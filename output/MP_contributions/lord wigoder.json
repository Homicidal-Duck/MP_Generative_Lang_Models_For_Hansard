["<cs> my lords when lord haldane referred to law reform requiring the efforts of three successive lord chancellors i doubt whether he was contemplating the possibility that two of the three might be the same man <e> <s> what i do not doubt is the invidious task that i have in endeavouring to follow in your lordships house the speeches of two noble and learned lords who have occupied the woolsack one of whom is now occupying the woolsack with such very great intellectual distinction such great charm and such never-failing courtesy <e> <s> it is indeed a difficult task <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the criminal justice act to restrict reports of committal proceedings in magistrates courts in cases where there is more than one defendant <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit certain dealings with witnesses in criminal and civil proceedings <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this modest bill seeks to deal with the situation where there is more than one defendant at committal proceedings in the magistrates court and there is a disagreement between the defendants as to whether or not the restrictions on reporting the proceedings should be lifted <e> <s> i suspect that there will be widespread agreement as to the extremely unsatisfactory nature of the present situation although there may well be some difference of opinion as to what is the best way in which to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for what i regard as a most constructive and helpful approach on behalf of the government <e> <s> i am grateful too to all those noble lords and noble and learned lords who have made such interesting and valuable contributions to this short debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> four weeks ago today mr justice cantley began his summing-up at the central criminal court <e> <s> there followed as your lordships will remember a lengthy retirement by the jury and as the minutes passed into hours and the hours passed into days so i am sure all your lordships will have shared with me a feeling of deep sympathy with those who were undergoing the agony of that very great ordeal because their whole future was in jeaopardy and depended upon the verdicts of the jury <e> <s> i have in mind particularly the journalists and the witnesses who stood to make so much money if only there were a conviction and whose fondest hopes were so bitterly dashed by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that observation <e> <s> i kept using the word press because i think that most recent instances have directly concerned the newspaper industry <e> <s> however my observations certainly should be taken to cover the media in general terms and the bill whose second reading i am moving is certainly not limited to the press <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me is that contained in a written communication from the director of public prosecutions or is that what mr bessell has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for the powerful support he gave to my argument <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lord lord hartwell for having the courage to come forward today and participate in this debate <e> <s> it would have been easy to stay away <e> <s> it must have been much more difficult to come and put forward as he did the spirited defence of the particular matter into which his newspaper entered <e> <s> i know enough from life at the bar to recognise skill and ability in putting forward a somewhat tenuous case when i see it and i indeed respect the way in which that has been done <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble lord lord belstead said <e> <s> speaking as one who very much supports the extension of legal aid to all tribunals at the earliest practicable moment to start off piecemeal in this way would nevertheless seem an unhappy way of proceeding <e> <s> has the noble earl endeavoured to cost this proposal <e> <s> if so what has been the result <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how long the last liberal administration took in preparing their plans but may i ask the noble lord whether if the governments plans are completed within the next three months they will give serious consideration to recalling parliament so that they can be presented and discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords yes he would <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends on these benches will also want to express gratitude to the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack for the careful way in which he explained the terms of this bill to your lordships house <e> <s> it appears only fitting that after the barrage of criticism this bill has received since its publication a fortnight ago there should at last have been one voice raised in its favour <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the reasons for the delay in bringing forward this enabling bill we on these benches certainly recognise that it is now being brought forward at such a late stage that somewhat more haste in dealing with it is necessary than would really be desirable <e> <s> we shall certainly not oppose the taking of the various stages of this bill with more rapidity than is customary <e> <s> however could the noble lord the leader of the house indicate what procedural steps he will be taking in order to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> having listened to the observations of the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice the noble and learned lord lord gardiner and the noble lords lord mishcon and lord <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i indicate that i too am a little dubious about the wisdom of this amendment first because it seems to me to be inflating the importance of the whole matter dealt with by this bill to an extent that is not entirely justified <e> <s> i do not envisage a specific procedure before the magistrates with its own separate rules followed by its own right of appeal and so on <e> <s> i envisage a short informal discussion between the parties which is resolved by the magistrates who should <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say from these benches how startled we are at the rapidity with which the government have fled at the first whiff of grape-shot fired by a labour opposition which is itself in a state of disarray <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the leader of the house whether he will bear in mind that it is possible to operate a two-chamber system of government only if this house receives a substantial amount of legislation early in the year and is not left in the situation in which it has been repeatedly in recent years in which we receive a number of major bills simultaneously towards the end of the session when it is quite impossible to do our proper task of scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would be kind enough to give one small piece of information to an ignorant foreigner in these matters <e> <s> if an accused person has failed to surrender to his bail and is then arrested and tried in a sheriff court or in the high court under clause for having failed without reasonable excuse to appear who determines whether there was a reasonable excuse <e> <s> is it the judge or the jury <e>", "<cs> my lords with that lucidity which one is accustomed to expect of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies there are two propositions set out in paragraphs and of the joint introduction to the reports with which i know all your lordships will entirely agree <e> <s> paragraph simply reads in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i expected this afternoon when i heard that there was to be a statement on the bingham report to be able to criticise the government on behalf of my noble friends for announcing as i had assumed they would that they had abandoned all further investigation into what we regard as the quite disgraceful matters disclosed in that report and subsequently <e> <s> but i accept that this statement does not deal specifically with that matter but deals only with a quasi-judicial decision taken by the attorney-general <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in this debate as an individual who recognises that there is no really solid evidence to support the views which i am about to put forward <e> <s> i believe as i suspect most noble lords who speak in this debate will believe that my views are based on sound and shrewd instinct and that the views of everyone else are based on wholly unreasonable prejudices <e> <s> it is because there is this vast variety in approach to this difficult subject that i ought to begin by saying on behalf of your lordships how grateful we are to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for giving us an early opportunity to debate the williams committee report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i accept that answer in the spirit in which <e>", "<cs> it is common ground that the police at the moment have not got this power <e> <s> it follows that to give them the power to detain and if necessary in certain circumstances arrest people who are not only wholly innocent of any offence but may not even have been witnesses to any offence is a very substantial diminution of our existing civil liberties <e> <s> that does not end the case against it but we ought to recognise that that is a fact <e> <s> therefore the question arises what justification can be put forward to your lordships for taking the action which is now proposed in clause <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that is one of the saddest observations that i have ever heard fall from the lips of a distinguished law officer <e> <s> to say that he felt obliged to support something because it appeared in the report of a distinguished committee is in fact to suggest that your lordships should abrogate your duties altogether and that any committee report must go through because the committee has reported it <e> <s> i repeat that there has not been a single word so far uttered by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey giving any reason in support of the proposal in the bill except that some other committee happens to recommend it <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that he does feel himself trapped and that he does feel himself obliged not to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i can only hope that noble lords who sit on the benches behind him will realise the difficulty in which he is and will allow him on this occasion to go alone from his front bench hand in hand with the noble earl lord mansfield into the lobbies <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i return to the observation as i am asked to do so <e> <s> i entirely accept that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey said just now that he supported this from conviction <e> <s> however that is not a reason and i venture to suggest that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey has still not given a single reason a single logical argument as to why he prefers what is in the bill to the amendment of my noble friend lord foot <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord renton correct me if i am wrong <e> <s> i think i remember that case <e> <s> the police did manage without this power and there was a conviction of the guilty people <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey or the noble earl lord mansfield whether one can in the circumstances safely talk about normal police procedure in a situation in which one is quite deliberately creating a wholly new power -the power of detention and therefore whether it might he better to incorporate this in the bill in order to deal with what is a new procedure <e>", "<cs> i am occasioned to rise by an observation of the noble earl that we are all agreed that there should be a power of detention <e> <s> i think it only right to say that that is not so <e> <s> it ought to be stated that the criminal bar association of england and wales which consists of the vast majority of members of the practising bar who both prosecute and defend have given evidence to the royal commission to the effect that there should not be any such power and that people should either be free or be arrested and there is no need for any intermediate stage such as is proposed in the bill and that is certainly a view i support <e>", "<cs> in the course of that catalogue of the deficiencies of tape recording the noble lord lord renton might have added a seventh which is frequently used by police officers to try to justify their opposition to this method of recording interrogations <e> <s> police officers say that there is nothing to stop a particularly wicked criminal in the middle of a tape recording when there is a perfectly innocent conversation going on from suddenly shouting out officer <e> <s> stop kicking me in the face <e> <s> that goes on the tape recording and furthermore say the police the suspect will then bang his face on the table very hard breaking his own nose and then insist that a doctor should be called in in order to justify it <e>", "<cs> no indeed <e> <s> we are not discussing the absolute virtues of tape recording <e> <s> everyone accepts that accidents may happen with tape recordings <e> <s> of course there might suddenly be a power failure <e> <s> of course a witness might be somewhat incomprehensible talking in his own dialect <e> <s> so he will be to the police officer <e> <s> presumably the same defect arises if the police officer is writing in a notebook <e> <s> of course the defendant might inadvertently give away his previous convictions on the tape recording <e> <s> but then of course at the trial that part of the tape recording would be eliminated just as it is cut out of the police officers notebook when it arises <e> <s> so one can go through all the points made by the noble lord lord renton in criticising tape recording <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the answer to that is really that one must compare the merits and demerits of tape recording with the merits and demerits of the only alternative that we know of which is that police officers should write down to the best of their recollection it may be several hours after an interview the best that they can remember about it <e>", "<cs> we should like to support the noble lord lord mishcon in this amendment <e> <s> we find the proposal in the bill a trifle difficult to justify <e> <s> i can understand the proposition that there should be no jury vetting of any sort either by the prosecution or by the defence that there should be no right of summary peremptory challenge at all either by the prosecution or the defence that both the prosecution and the defence should take their chance before a jury that is selected entirely at random <e> <s> if by any mishap there are on the jury one or two who may be unreasonably prejudiced in some way that is a chance that both the prosecution and the defence should take and it is a matter which is catered for by the majority verdict system which operates in both our countries <e> <s> i can understand that being put forward as the proper solution but i appreciate that at this moment in time the whole question of jury vetting of attempting to analyse the backgrounds of jurors has not yet been resolved and that therefore it is apparently right that there should be some right of peremptory challenge challenge without cause still given to both the prosecution and the defence <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down would he be kind enough to help me as to what the position is in scotland when the defence call alibi evidence and the prosecution wish to rebut that <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will find himself persuaded by the powerful arguments of the two noble and learned lords on this matter <e> <s> may i add only one small point that the question of the way in which we deal with convicted murderers is always a matter of the greatest public interest and the greatest controversy <e> <s> it would i suggest be a very very unhappy state of affairs if on such a vital issue of penal policy england and scotland should adopt wholly different methods of approaching this matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will consider on this matter <e> <s> perhaps more than on many others in the bill that it is very much in the public interest that the two countries should go together hand in hand and that scotland should not set out as is proposed in the bill on a method of dealing with people who have committed the offence of murder which at the moment is not part of english law and that any such reform should be done if it is going to be done at all by the united kingdom as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord lord mishcon my immediate reaction was similar to his <e> <s> then i began to reflect on the amendment which the noble lord lord mishcon had himself moved at committee stage in which he invited the magistrates to consider whether greater injustice would be done to the applicant by refusing such an order than to any other defendant by making it <e> <s> the more i thought about it the more it seemed that the only form of injustice which the magistrates could properly consider was the injustice which is now set out in detail in the new amendment <e> <s> i hope that on reflection the noble lord will come to the view that the new amendment does meet the point that he has raised <e> <s> it deals with the test which he proposed but in a rather more precise way and a rather more helpful way to the magistrates <e> <s> in those circumstances i hope that amendment no <e> <s> will be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill now he read a third time <e> <s> in so doing i should like if your lordships would permit me to express my appreciation to those members of your <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are also grateful to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for repeating the attorney generals statement <e> <s> i understand it really comes to this that where there are threats to public order or to the queens peace that occur in the course of mass picketing the criminal law in its present state is perfectly adequate in theory to deal with those dangers and that the existing law of obstruction of unlawful assembly of riot and affray can be used properly against those misbehaving on those mass pickets <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour in the evening i shall make only two short points <e> <s> first the noble lord lord campbell of croy made the observation that there have been cases where prisoners serving an indeterminate life sentence have been released on parole and have committed further offences <e> <s> that of course is entirely accurate as an observation but it is not an argument either for or against the amendment which we are now considering <e> <s> as the noble lord will appreciate in order for it to become an argument one way or the other one would have to know how many years that particular prisoner had served and what recommendation would have been made in his case had a recommendation been mandatory <e> <s> it might have been a longer recommendation in which case this would be a point against the amendment it might have been a shorter recommendation in which case it would carry no weight at all as an argument against this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl indicate whether he can help the house as to what are the present views of the noble and learned lord lord emslie <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i was not asking the noble earl to deal with that on an unofficial basis <e> <s> have the government not taken any steps to find out officially what the views now are of the noble and learned lord lord emslie <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to us on these benches that the reactions both of the secretary of state and of the area health authority to the judgment of mr justice wolff have been highly commendable <e> <s> this is clearly a situation which has arisen as a result of the secretary of state acting in perfectly good faith i do not think anybody has queried that in order to deal with the problem posed by an area health authority that was unwilling to be constrained by cash limits and indeed had indicated that to the predecessors of the present government <e> <s> it is is it not in a sense only an accident of politics that it is not the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who has this afternoon been making this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i cast no aspersions on anyone <e> <s> it is clear that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord comes to lord teviots point would the noble lord allow me to mention one other matter <e> <s> it is this am i right in thinking that under the proposed new clause the burden will be on the driver to prove on the balance of probabilities that he has taken the action that is required <e> <s> secondly the noble lord keeps saying that the question would be has he taken reasonable steps <e> <s> under the drafting of the clause would he not have to show that he had taken all reasonable steps <e> <s> and if he had failed to take one reasonable step he would still be liable to be convicted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also pay tribute to the heroism and skill of the army and the police both in this country and in northern ireland in combating terrorist outrages <e> <s> i should like in particular to praise the skill of the police in being able to clear up so many of the offences and in arresting so many of those responsible for nothing could be easier or more cowardly than to leave an explosive device which is going to kill or <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne consider looking again at this part of the bill in order to see whether it is possible to write into the bill some encouragement to the company to issue shares to its employees <e>", "<cs> my lords if your lordships house was discussing this afternoon solely the question as to whether this bill should be given a second reading this would be an even shorter discussion than it is going to be <e> <s> i say that because on the principle of this bill the opposition in the other place did not seek to divide at any stage except on amendments in committee stage and indeed the attorney-general in the former labour government mr silkin indicated that he supported the bill <e> <s> we are however discussing something perhaps a little wider than the question whether the bill should be given a second reading <e> <s> it is neces <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is pressure upon any authority one way or another to limit their expenditure and that pressure can perfectly properly be brought by this government as it was by the previous government it is inevitable that some people are placed at a disadvantage <e> <s> i doubt if i may say so most respectfully to the noble and learned lord whether it really helps to talk in terms of the slightly emotive context of the cardiac patient <e> <s> some people are bound to be disadvantaged of course they are if there is less expenditure on resources at any one time than there was at a previous time <e> <s> but i cannot see how the mere fact that that happens gives a right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i would only say to the noble baroness lady trumpington and the noble lord lord shinwell that all i am anxious to ensure and all the legal profession wants to ensure is that anyone who wishes to enter the profession and has the necessary talent is not debarred from doing so by the lack of appropriate support from a local education authority <e>", "<cs> my lords it ought not to be overlooked that a census by definition is a prying by the government into the personal affairs of the citizens and is carried out by asking questions about their private lives and by forcing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the foreign secretary not agree that in this extremely unhappy situation the matter is perhaps best left to diplomatic channels and that public debate is unlikely to serve any very constructive purpose <e> <s> would the noble lord also not agree that this is not the first time in recent months that very serious misunderstandings have arisen as a result of the tendency of some television <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clearly a matter of the utmost gravity when the police have to abandon control <e>", "<cs> my lords it is apparent that any comment made either in parliament or in the media might well find its way into the iranian embassy <e> <s> that could not conceivably promote the prospects of a peaceful outcome and might well prejudice it <e> <s> in those circumstances my noble friends on these benches feel also that it is best at this stage to say nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think it is reasonable that the costs of maintaining public order on these occasions have to be borne by the local authority in whose area by chance the demonstration takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would also like to congratulate <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who are participating in this short debate will i believe first want to express our gratitude to those noble lords who abstained from voting in the previous division <e> <s> that has precipitated this discussion at a somewhat earlier hour than might otherwise have been the case <e> <s> your lordships will also want me to thank the noble lord lord ardwick for enabling us to discuss this important matter yet again and yet at a time which is of very great importance <e> <s> there have over the years been frequent discussions of the issues involved in this unstarred question <e> <s> the history of the matter is known to your lordships <e> <s> in the past years the question has dragged a rather weary way from when the phillimore committee was first established <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i add a technical point to the substantive argument about this amendment <e> <s> i must confess that i find it difficult to understand what the effect would be if this amendment were passed and incorporated in the bill <e> <s> i am troubled particularly by the expression <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord look again at the situation by which jurors names get on to the panel in the first place <e> <s> would he consider it right that those who are manifestly unfit to serve for the reasons he has indicated or indeed who <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether in inviting sir denis follows to think again there is any ground for thinking that he has so far thought at all <e>", "<cs> we on these benches welcome this new clause and hope that it will be incorporated in the bill in due course <e> <s> it is in no critical spirit that i venture to make two observations to the noble earl lord gowrie in the hope that if the amendment is incorporated he might consider them when we come to the next stage in this bill <e>", "<cs> in relation to the observation made by the noble earl lord gowric i am not concerned about the provision that costs might be awarded i am concerned about the provision that a tribunal may make an award of compensation which seems to me to go far beyond the question of costs <e>", "<cs> as i imagine the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones last appeared in a magistrates court even longer ago than i did i think that perhaps i might venture to say that the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can give a specific example <e> <s> let us suppose that consideration is given to the difficulties which sometimes arise upon picket lines in distinguishing between pickets who are members of the union concerned and those people who are of the socialist workers party who have turned up in the hope of having a good punch up with the police and let us suppose that the code of practice indicated that the union picket in those circumstances might wear an armband <e> <s> this is not to the detriment of the unions in any way <e> <s> let us suppose that a trade unionist wearing his armband on picket was arrested for wilful obstruction of the highway and the issue therefore arose in court as to whether he was lawfully and reasonably using the highway <e> <s> would not the effect of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord wedderburn be to deprive the trade unionist picket from relying on the code of picketing in his defence <e>", "<cs> i should like to mention one matter which is wholly different in nature from the substantial matter raised by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> it is in fact a very small matter which i have already mentioned to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who utilised it in the course of one of his inimitable throw-away lines when moving an earlier amendment <e> <s> it is the slightly unusual expression in clause about a complaint being declared to be well-founded and that of course refers back to the similar use of the same expression in clause <e> <s> i am a little unhappy that a complaint being well-founded may not be coterminous with a complaint being successful and i rather assume that what the government have in mind is that the complaint should have been found to have succeeded <e> <s> i raise this matter asking the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he might care to reflect upon this matter and to put my fears at rest in due course <e>", "<cs> as one who much admires the contribution made by the noble and learned lord lord denning to the development of english law might <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement obviously gives great satisfaction to your lordships <e> <s> if i may i should like to ask what steps are being taken by the government to regularise the position of the libyans peoples bureau in this country <e> <s> is it correct that a number of people are occupying or using it who are not entitled to diplomatic immunity and who are

heard of in the last few days <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord any figures and if not <e>", "<cs> my lords the health services board is now under sentence of death and its execution will take place as your lordships know when the bill becomes law <e> <s> i am sure it is within the ambit of the addison rules that as the chairman of the board i might make two very brief observations to your lordship this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will want to express its <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is possible in scotland for a reason that i was coming to in a moment because it

reducing the burden on our crown courts <e> <s> how do we reduce the burden on our crown courts <e> <s> first we may i think pursue the suggestion that justice the organisation is currently concerned

begin at the central criminal court instead of being called in to advise at a very much earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble baroness for one moment <e> <s> i think i failed to make myself clear <e> <s> i was suggesting that technical matters such as failing to renew ones television licence should not be dealt with at all by the magistrates courts but by administrative means

house which of the criteria in the bail act were used by the magistrates in order to justify remanding her in custody <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord be kind enough to help me before he sits down <e> <s> are there precedents for giving an appellate tribunal a discretion to grant leave to appeal on questions of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord the

resist from these benches the temptation to congratulate the government on the first <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make three short points from these <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish also to say from these benches how much we welcome these new regulations <e> <s> the green form scheme has proved invaluable in providing legal advice to those who otherwise might not be able to afford it and also i think

<s> from these benches therefore i welcome this new proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say from these benches how grateful we are to the psa for the speed with which they have carried out their inspection and for the solution that they have devised which appears from the plan and sketches that i have seen to be nothing like as unsightly as might otherwise have been feared <e> <s> we all look forward to being back in our proper chamber immediately after the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not unknown for a newly incoming government to pledge themselves to produce far less legislation than their predecessors and then to find themselves in this difficulty at the end of the first session <e> <s> it is not unknown either that her majestys opposition should then become with some reason somewhat critical of the situation that has developed <e> <s> it is extremely unfortunate that we should find ourselves on a tuesday well into august having to debate the second reading of the important measure we have this afternoon and then finding ourselves on the thursday the day before the recess is due to start having to deal with important amendments to another equally important bill

to say how very greatly they appreciate the vital role played by your lordships house in the introduction of this amendment <e> <s> they particularly asked me to say how impressed they were with the high standard of debate both on this amendment and on the later one moved by my noble friend lord banks in relation to option mortgages <e> <s> they are full of admiration for the fact that on those amendments many of your lordships found it possible to vote according to the merits of the argument quite irrespective of narrow party political considerations <e> <s> they entirely accept that as a result of this amendment and a later one there are going to be substantial safeguards for the elderly in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords may we on these benches also associate ourselves with the eloquent tributes paid to the late viscount dilhorne <e> <s> as a lawyer his judgment was always deeply respected by every member of the bar <e> <s> outside the narrow confines of the law and i think perhaps of some of his speeches in your lordships house on the standards of conduct in public life and on various constitutional issues that were raised he displayed a shrewd vigorous common sense that carried vast influence in every corner of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords once the words retrospective legislation are uttered it is quite inevitable that the ears of my noble friends on the liberal benches prick up <e> <s> in those circumstances perhaps i ought to indicate very briefly that it is our view that this does not amount at this stage to retrospective legislation and that an indication given by a minister that when a bill on its way through parliament is enacted he proposes to use powers given under it is very far removed from being retrospective legislation certainly of the sort to which we on these benches would wish to take objection <e>", "<cs> with some reluctance i dissociate myself from the view of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i appreciate that there are a large number of general issues to be raised in the course of the various amendments and in the debate on the clause but i would respectfully suggest that we are going to get into a state of considerable confusion unless we take the amendments <e>", "<cs> i do not want to pursue the point i was making <e> <s> i was a little perturbed because it seems to me that there may be wholly different considerations on the question of charges for planning applications and on the question of charges for appeals it may be they are two quite separate issues <e> <s> i was perturbed that if we had a general debate the two issues might get intermingled rather undesirably <e>", "<cs> as no one has spoken yet from these benches on this matter perhaps i could briefly say that we on these benches in the first place are entirely opposed to the concept of charges for planning applications for the reasons that have been given <e> <s> if there are to be charges made for planning applications then it seems to us essential that provision should be made for the little man who wishes to make a small improvement to his own small property <e> <s> it is for that <e>", "<cs> i apologise in that case for making an observation which was entirely unnecessary i fear that i missed that particular concession <e> <s> among so many what is one more <e> <s> in the circumstances i must tell the minister how grateful we are that the point has been conceded and that the principle is recognised as being one of importance <e>", "<cs> may i make one observation <e> <s> in the course of considering subsections and of clause we are perhaps to some extent overlooking subsection which appears to me specifically to give the commission power not to entertain any complaint if they think it is frivolous and an even greater absolute discretion under the last three lines of the subsection at the top of page not to entertain a complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord say whether inquiries are being actively pursued into the source of the leak which has clearly caused grave embarrassment to a large number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord beswick comes to reply to this short debate i wonder whether he will be kind enough to remove the only slight anxiety i feel about this amendment which is this <e> <s> it emerged in the course of the debate on the statement the day before yesterday that when the authority is sitting in order to decide whether to grant an application for a licence a matter which might have the most grave commercial as well as political implications the tribunal consists simply of one member of the authority <e> <s> this would appear on the face of it to be not a satisfactory situation <e> <s> so long as that situation persists and is allowed to continue the only question that i would venture to ask the noble lord lord beswick is this <e> <s> is it wise in those circumstances to attempt to restrict the discretion of the secretary of state in dealing with an appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone in your lordships house must deplore the prospects of a confrontation between the government and the prison officers association a body of men and women who not only carry out a difficult important and dangerous task but very often have to carry it out in wholly intolerable working conditions <e> <s> therefore i think it is for all of us to see whether it is not possible to suggest some way out of the present difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords we entirely accept the need for urgency in <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a bill that can be received without any welcome in any part of your lordships house <e> <s> it can be received only with <e>", "<cs> i also referred to this matter on second reading <e> <s> in his reply the noble lord lord belstead indicated that a circular would be sent out <e> <s> if i may say so for my part i found his reply acceptable and satisfactory in these rather difficult circumstances <e> <s> i would only venture to remind the noble lord of a fact of which i have no doubt he is well aware which is that there are some magistrates courts who are notoriously reluctant to grant legal aid unless they are compelled to do so <e> <s> therefore no doubt the circular will be in the most stringent terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not right that a caution can be administered only where a person has unequivocally admitted guilt <e> <s> secondly would the government consider reminding prosecuting authorities both public authorities and those who prosecute privately that there is a discretion and that they ought to exercise their discretion with the greatest possible care particularly where elderly defendants are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look again not merely at paragraph but also at paragraph <e> <s> that says in terms that where an individual journalist finds that his freedom to report is being interfered with by his membership of a trade union his employers are to respect that interference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask by whom the noble lord understood that people were consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted only to ask the noble lord why the other place might not have sat last night as late as your lordships house did to deal with the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite inevitable in these difficult days that the main thrust of any debate on home affairs should be over our economic and industrial policies which we are going to debate at some length on thursday <e> <s> we shall then have an opportunity of analysing the unhappy consequences of the governments policies and the equally bleak alternative presented by the declared policies of her majestys opposition <e> <s> that debate will concentrate primarily therefore on the standard of life <e> <s> this debate i suggest to your lordships really concentrates more on the quality of life and on the measures that can be introduced into parliament in the course of this session in order to improve that quality <e>", "<cs> my lords both the necessity for and the difficulty of this bill arise from the fact that there is a conflict between two principles of very great importance to our society <e> <s> the first principle is that the press must have the right to investigate to expose corruption and dishonesty and to comment freely upon our legal system as it works <e> <s> the second principle is the necessity for the legal system itself not to be subject to improper pressures or unfair comment which may pollute its course <e> <s> it is because there is that conflict that i regret that only one noble lord the noble lord lord ardwick has had the temerity to challenge the monopoly of the lawyers who have put down their names to speak in this debate <e> <s> many members of your lordships house who hold the most distinguished positions in the media could be of the greatest possible assistance when we consider the problems posed by the bill <e> <s> i hope that they will find it possible to help during its later stages <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a statement of great importance <e> <s> it is clearly impossible to do it justice or even mercy in the course of a very short comment at this moment <e> <s> i am tempted to suggest to the noble lord that he recommends to the government that it might be preferable if information of this kind were released by way of a written answer to a parliamentary question <e> <s> what is really needed is a full-scale debate on proposals of this magnitude <e> <s> no doubt that can be arranged at the earliest possible moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord ought not to assume that i was unaware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords it related to whether contracts which have already been committed will now have to be cancelled <e> <s> while i am on my feet may i remind the noble lord that i was asking not how many local authorities will be affected by the proposals but in how many of them the relaxations will have a material benefit and whether they are the areas in which at the moment there is particularly high unemployment in the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> as your lordships are aware this is the second occasion upon which i have moved that this bill should be read a second time <e> <s> during the last session this bill passed through all its stages in your lordships house but there was no possibility of it going further in the other place partly because of the extreme pressure of legislation during that session <e> <s> the position now is that i venture to reintroduce this bill because some of my legal colleagues rather than my political colleagues in another place are anxious to see whether they can find an opportunity for this bill to go forward in another place if your lordships decide to take the same course on this occasion as you did last session <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boston and to the noble lord lord belstead for their encouraging remarks and i take on board of course the detailed points made by the noble lord lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords may we on these benches as always have the last word and reciprocate the noble lords good wishes <e>", "<cs> may i apologise to the committee for not being present when this amendment was called <e> <s> i had arranged for a more than adequate junior to cover me <e> <s> i have listened to what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said <e> <s> i am in the slight difficulty that i am not aware of exactly to what extent the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones developed the argument when he moved the amendment <e> <s> therefore may i merely make three observations first that the amendment appears to some extent at least to be in line with phillimore paragraph where that report certainly quotes with approval the divisional courts test in the <e>", "<cs> if i may respectfully say so i clearly have not probed with any skill because the amendment has not got the slightest reference to any of the observations of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> he is referring to a case in which there was an arrest and once there is an arrest or a warrant issued the amendment i have put down has absolutely no relevance unless and until the media can show that thereafter they had reasonable grounds for believing that proceedings were no longer imminent <e> <s> this deals entirely with the sort of situation where somebody is being looked for by the police a warrant has been issued and that person has disappeared <e> <s> all i am saying is that in those circumstances it might be wrong to impose an indefinite gag upon any comment by the press <e>", "<cs> i again must apologise because clearly not only is the drafting defective not only should i obviously not have used the word imminence and i am fully aware of all the disadvantages of that word even in a probing amendment but i fear i still have not made quite clear the one simple point upon which i would ask for some assurance from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> it is merely this <e> <s> as at present defined in this bill is the lucan case a case which is still active <e> <s> if it is still active what defence have the press got if they wish to comment on it <e>", "<cs> if it were a solitary red herring of course i would not pursue the matter <e> <s> it seems to me that there is perhaps a point here in which the <e>", "<cs> might i venture to support what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has said <e>", "<cs> as the proposer of amendment no <e> <s> which would be excluded if this amendment were carried perhaps i might indicate that i would propose not to move amendment no <e> <s> in any event because i think upon reflection that amendment no <e> <s> the present one is a more satisfactory approach to this difficult problem <e> <s> i urge upon the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor the desirability of reconsidering the whole approach in clause of this bill and i do so first of all for this reason <e> <s> as i understand it and i would be very grateful if the noble and learned lord would intervene at once if i were wrong clause seeks to extend to tribunals and inferior courts not only the strict liability rule as laid down in the previous clauses but also the law about contempt in the face of the court <e> <s> if that is right then the first question that i would suggest needs careful consideration is whether those two areas ought in fact to be coterminous as they necessarily must be so long as the clause remains in its present form <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will accept that nobody is seeking for one moment to make party capital out of this discussion <e> <s> there is a very deep and genuine perturbation throughout the criminal bar that the entirely unintended result of this clause is going to be disastrous to the process of criminal trial <e>", "<cs> clearly i did not make myself clear on that matter <e> <s> i was suggesting for that very reason that it was the juror who volunteered the information to the solicitor <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the expression used by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate about experience in recent weeks takes us very much further in this particular amendment <e> <s> perhaps all that that experience shows is that if the case is sufficiently notorious whatever rules are laid down they are going to be quite flagrantly and deliberately broken <e>", "<cs> i am still not entirely clear why the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was in a bird sanctuary with three judges wives <e> <s> i must admit i was beginning to lose the tenor of the argument <e> <s> i only want to make one or two short comments if i may <e> <s> first on the technical matter of the amendment i do not propose to go into it it is clear that the purpose of the amendment was apparent because the noble and learned lord has spent some time dealing <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry to detain your lordships at this hour of the evening but there are two matters which i wish to raise on this schedule and i raise them very briefly one is substantial and the other is just plain tedious <e> <s> the substantial one is as follows under paragraph of schedule proceedings are to be active in civil proceedings once arrangements for the hearing are made <e> <s> that does of course mean that in both jury and non-jury civil trials the press are to be under the strict liability obligation it may be for a period of years before the proceedings are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that this clause be left out of the bill and do not stand part of it <e> <s> i hope your lordships will allow me at the same time to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which proposes a substitute new clause to replace the clause that if the first amendment is carried will not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to both noble lords for their support <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two questions which i should like to ask the noble lord the minister <e> <s> first are there not other prisons both in the london area and within daily travelling distance of london which are structurally far more suitable for housing maximum security prisoners <e> <s> and will the government consider particularly in the case of such prisoners as ira prisoners on remand using those other prisons in future rather than brixton <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in doing so may i just <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to include the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor among the angels <e>", "<cs> may i make two brief comments in support of this amendment <e> <s> first i would hope that we will not get unduly involved in drawing analogies between the position of the journalist and that of the doctor the lawyer or the priest <e> <s> they seem to be so very different in degree as eventually to raise totally different issues in kind <e> <s> secondly i should like merely to go on record in support of what the noble and learned lord lord scarman has just said that the real issue which we are faced with by this amendment is whether we want the greatest possible amount of information to reach the public through the media <e> <s> one accepts that among that information if one has a free press there will be much that is irresponsible there will be many warts there will be much that to use lord mishcons word is scurrilous <e> <s> nevertheless the right of the public to know what is going on seems to me to be of crucial importance in the sort of society in which we live <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble and learned lord the lord advocate replies i wonder whether he would be good enough to deal with one point which was raised by me during the committee stage <e> <s> does not clause at the moment cover both contempts in the face of a court and the extension of the strict liability rule to inferior courts <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord indicate whether there is any convincing reason why the two areas should be coterminous <e> <s> may it not be that there is a strong case for extending contempt in the face of a court to all tribunals <e> <s> and may it not be that there is an equally strong case for not extending the strict liability rule to more than a very few tribunals <e> <s> before the bill leaves this house would it not be better to try to sever these two issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for that carefully considered reply <e> <s> i accept that all the government set out to do in clause was to achieve a limited objective to deal with the <e>", "<cs> my lords in bidding farewell to this bill i do so in the confident expectation that your lordships are not saying goodbye and that in due course it will be returned here in i hope a somewhat improved form <e> <s> i am of course assuming that some time can be found this session to consider amendments from the other place on the basis that sooner or later we shall end the committee stage of the wildlife and countryside bill <e>", "<cs> might i only ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to make it abundantly clear that if this amendment is written into the bill it will in no way be used as a possible precedent for suggesting in the future that therefore long criminal cases involving fraud might be dealt with by with-drawing the right to trial by jury <e> <s> those long criminal cases are a very different sort of problem <e> <s> there are ways of dealing with those cases while still retaining the right to trial by jury <e> <s> i am anxious that this amendment should not be misunderstood as indicating that in relation to criminal cases there is any intention whatsoever of weakening the present position <e>", "<cs> might i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor to consider the possibility that where an unrepresented defendant someone who has not employed the services of a solicitor wishes to make an application for bail to the crown court it might be done on the basis of a legal aid certificate for counsel only <e> <s> there is really no difficulty about a man being brought to court and being allotted a barrister by the court and in the space of minutes or a quarter of an hour sorting out sufficient information to enable a perfectly adequate bail application to be made in the defendants presence <e>", "<cs> my lords this being the fifth occasion on which your lordships have debated an order in similar terms to this i do not pretend that i can find anything new or significant to say <e> <s> the threat which the ira in particular poses is one which needs no underlining from me and is one which is recognised by all of us <e> <s> it is not only a threat to life and limb but to the very foundations of our society <e> <s> it is a threat carried out as is perhaps not always recognised by a gang of people in very close touch with other gangs of people similarly motivated throughout the world <e> <s> i might remind your lordships of the words of lord chalfont recently when he commented that the ira have nothing politically in common with the baader-meinhof group or the plo nevertheless they share everything that makes their operations successful <e> <s> they exchange weapons they engage in joint operational planning they use each others training areas and provide each other with administrative and logistic support <e> <s> i believe that the evidence for that is overwhelming and it is odd that the present government should find no inconsistency in opposing the ira with such vigour and yet espousing the cause of the plo with equal vigour <e> <s> but that is perhaps another story <e>", "<cs> my lords did the review deal with the question of whether we might change to a sensible electoral system <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say one word in support of the observations made by the noble lord lord ponsonby and the noble baroness lady llewlyn-davies as to the desirability of your lordships house supporting the government in this amendment <e> <s> it ought to be placed on record that this amendment seeks to omit two lines which were originally inserted at committee stage as the result of an amendment moved by my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> the debate on that amendment took place not on a friday not late at night but at an ordinary working hour on a thursday afternoon <e> <s> there was a very full attendance no fewer than members voted in the division <e> <s> it was an amendment which many days in advance when it has been tabled was known would be one upon which there was going to be a division <e> <s> it was therefore in so far as any division can be in this house clearly one which reflected the considered wishes of a very substantial number of your lordships <e> <s> in addition to that it was a division which took place on a bill which is originating in your lordships house and has still to go to the elected chamber for their consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just add that the noble lord lord denham has had more than two or three hours because he knows perfectly well from the discussion he had with me yesterday that the question arose as to whether there were any precedents in these circumstances and no such precedent has been forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the clear impression from the benches behind the noble lord lord denham that my guess as to that was clearly wrong <e> <s> but the situation is this is it not <e> <s> there is an issue here of very real importance that has nothing to do with the merits of whether or not there should be a registry of business names <e> <s> i hope that noble lords on the conservative benches who believe that there should be a registry for the reasons put forward by the noble lord lord ponsonby and by my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran will oppose this amendment which seeks to remove that registry <e> <s> i hope equally that noble lords opposite who may feel convinced by the governments own arguments that there ought not to be a registry of business names will nevertheless hesitate a very long time before going into the lobbies in support of this amendment on the ground that the reputation of your lordships house is of far more importance than the future of the registry of business names <e>", "<cs> my lords after that very sombre minutes might i revert now to the not entirely disconnected topic of the criminal attempts bill <e> <s> it is not entirely disconnected because of course among other matters the bill deals with the abolition of the sus offence and i think that there is no doubt that it was the misunderstanding of and the misrepresentations about that offence which have contributed at least to some extent to the lack of goodwill between the black community and the police in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to agree and reciprocate <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to express our respectful admiration for the incredible composure shown by her majesty at a moment which at that time must have seemed to be one of very real danger <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord on the woolsack only this question <e> <s> is it not a fact that year after year a substantial number of serious criminal offences particularly of armed robbery are committed by people using imitation firearms which are skilfully produced which are advertised for sale without any restriction and which are bought and sold without any limitation whatever <e> <s> if that is so would not the noble and learned lord say that it is at least the intention of the government to legislate as soon as possible to prevent this once they are satisfied that there is a practicable way of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble and learned lord agree that irrespective of where the blame might lie the salary levels at present being paid are obviously inadequate to ensure a proper service <e>", "<cs> i should like enthusiastically to support this amendment <e> <s> i was one of those who at second reading criticised clause on the grounds that it quite obviously created an intolerable burden upon the press in seeking to impose the strict liability rule upon the proceedings of the hundreds of tribunals which sit every day in this country <e> <s> i point out also that conscientious editors who ventured to do their duty would inevitably be baffled by the criterion that a tribunal was to be included in the clause if it was one constituted by law and exercised any part of the judicial part of the state <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to make a final appeal to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack not to oppose the motion moved by the noble lord lord hutchinson this afternoon <e> <s> i do so on this simple basis <e> <s> the motion that has been moved had had the explicit support not only of the lord chief justice but of those noble and learned law lords who have taken part in the debate of two former lord chancellors and of every member of the bar in your lordships house who has spoken at any stage in these proceedings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord would agree that it will not stop it being tried <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister two questions about the returning officers discretion first has he got a discretion where a candidate offers himself in a particular name to put on to the ballot paper name changed by deed poll dated so and so formerly known as joe ramsbottom or whatever it may be <e> <s> secondly if a candidate by way of description wishes quite deliberately to misrepresent himself as being the official candidate of a party of which he is not the official candidate has the returning officer discretion to refuse or accept that <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the final words of the statement indicate that the police must have the full support of all our leaders and all our people <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords in all parts of the house would agree that no amount of unemployment social deprivation or inner city squalor could even remotely begin to justify the sort of criminal violence we have seen in the last few days <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord help us as to what would be the effect on the unemployment figures if the defence policies of her majestys opposition were adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to recall the elderly gentleman in manchester who once put a notice in the personal column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware if any criticism of mr alderson were implied in the supplementary question that there are a great many members of your lordships house who regard him as a quite outstanding police officer <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to add our tribute to the bravery shown on this occasion by mr howorth and on so many other occasions in the past by him and his colleagues <e> <s> one has only to imagine the work involved to realise the courage that is required and the quiet and unostentatious way in which their tasks have been carried out <e> <s> the only other observation i would make is to query the way in which after each of these outrages it is reported in the media that a particular organisation claims responsibility an expression which seems to me to lend an aura of respectability to these outrages <e> <s> is not the straightforward fact that what such an organisation is doing is either admitting its guilt or confessing to a serious criminal offence <e> <s> would it not help in a very small way if we were to use the appropriate terminology <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that the reasons given by the other place make very odd reading when set alongside the argument put forward by the noble lord the minister this afternoon <e> <s> the other place put as their case against the amendment which your lordships approved that discretionary decisions should not be subject to review in the courts <e> <s> the argument of the noble lord lord belstead this afternoon is that that is of no consequence because a discretionary decision under the acts can be reviewed by the parliamentary commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords all of your lordships will want to join me in welcoming back from his hazardous journey to scotland the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> he told us about his old model t ford motor car <e> <s> may i say how pleased if slightly surprised we all are to rind that after all these years that car is still running so well <e>", "<cs> my lords may we also extend our seasonal greetings and best wishes for the new year to noble lords in all parts of the house without any political implications <e>", "<cs> my lords i make no apology for not seeking to increase the hysteria with which this whole subject has been surrounded in the course of the last few weeks <e> <s> one gets the impression from the popular press that rape has become the british national pastime <e> <s> i do not seek in any way to minimise the gravity of such an offence when it takes place nor the fact that in a very large number of such cases it may be necessary to send the offender to prison <e> <s> but to put the matter in general perspective it is right it it not the lord advocate will no doubt agree that in scotland for the last year for which figures were available there were some people convicted of this offence <e> <s> that was about a quarter of the total number of offences alleged as reported to the police and if one takes account of the experience of the rape crisis centres in england it looks as though the total number of incidents may perhaps have to be increased by another per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> altogether <e> <s> not perhaps sufficient to justify quite the outcry that is at the moment taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the opportunity of attending as an observer the beginning of the inquiry <e> <s> there was a large number of black youths outside the lambeth town hall who were very actively demonstrating with banners and placards calling upon their friends and colleagues to boycott the whole proceedings <e> <s> by the end of the first week the great majority of those youths were inside the lambeth town hall taking an active and constructive part in the proceedings <e> <s> that i think is perhaps the first measure of the success which the noble and learned lord lord scarman achieved in carrying out this inquiry <e> <s> he went to a community that was deeply suspicious and convinced them so very quickly that here was a person of integrity of sympathy with no prejudices and with no biases who was prepared to report fearlessly upon their problems and upon the remedies that were needed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course always possible that there may be a difference of opinion <e> <s> but that was never even explored in this situation <e> <s> it might well have been that if the local community leaders had said to the police officers this would be the effect of the operation we strongly advise you against it the police officers who were accustomed to work with and trust the local community leaders would have accepted their advice <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what would be the effect on the crime rate of announcing an amnesty several months in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will i know want to express its gratitude to the noble lord lord trefgarne for the very clear way in which he has explained the objects of the bill <e> <s> i should like to welcome it on behalf of my noble friends and

referred are well known <e> <s> my own experience was that it was perhaps more due to the idiosyncracies of the justices clerks than to the idiosyncracies of the justices themselves <e> <s> it would

the country has lost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the observations which have been made on the amendment the interesting suggestion of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway the very helpful observations of the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson who has very wide professional experience of litigation of this nature and of course the most interesting and helpful observations of the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> i think that a draft bill was in fact appended to the faulks committees report <e> <s> if not i am wondering where i got the four draft clauses from which are the subject of these various amendments <e> <s> i am persuaded by the noble and learned lord on the woolsack that perhaps there is just the slightest element of controversy about this amendment and in accordance with the indications i gave when i tabled it i ask for your lordships leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much encouraged by the consensus of opinion expressed by three very distinguished lawyers who have spoken on the subject of this amendment <e> <s> i would like if i may to express my particular gratitude to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his helpful suggestion that it might be possible to proceed in another way in order to secure an amendment which is clearly regarded in all parts of the house as desirable <e> <s> i would like to reflect on that and in the meantime i ask your lordships leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for those observations <e> <s> i think if i may say so the problem largely with defamation writs which does not arise with writs in other causes of action is the now rather more limited gagging effect but nevertheless the gagging effect which the issue of the writ may in certain circumstances have <e> <s> however i would like to reflect on what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall suggest to my noble friends when they return from the dining-room that we should support this amendment although i do so with perhaps slightly more reservation than has been expressed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> my reservations are twofold <e> <s> first that there will be inevitably a temptation for publicity-conscious and politically-motivated members of the legal profession to reveal in court the contents of documents not because that helps their legal case but because that helps their political cause <e> <s> that is a temptation which i think one must rely upon the integrity of the legal profession to resist <e>", "<cs> my lords had this bill included all the amendments which were proposed in another place and repeated it would undoubtly have merited the description which the noble lord the minister gave to it of being an important and substantial bill <e> <s> it would after all have included clauses to restore capital punishment to restore corporal punishment to abolish detention centres altogether to impose maxima in sentences of youth custody to provide for automatic parole after one-third of a sentence had been served and to provide for a rule under which if a prisoner had been kept in custody for days after committal he would automatically be released and set free and his trial not begun <e> <s> many other proposals of that sort were discussed and rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real problem posed by the question of the noble lord lord harris one of enforcement <e> <s> are there not believed to be already a number of people who are disqualified by reason of their previous convictions from serving on juries who nevertheless have been sitting on them <e> <s> would it not help if the noble and learned lord were to publicise the fact that it is a criminal offence for a person to serve on a jury when he knows that he is not elicible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is it still the current policy of the government that no new body will be recognised until a substantial majority of its members match the existing standards of the bodies so far recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether he would not agree that there are three particular problems which lead to the view that neither the present nor the proposed legislation is adequate the first problem being that the material by its very nature is not immediately identifiable so that police officers entering premises do not know what it is that is there to be seized the second problem being that this material can be shown to young people without any control under either the present or the proposed legislation the third problem being that the depraving effect of this appalling rubbish is enhanced in the home by the facilities that are available there for the particularly nauseating bits to be played and replayed at will <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in each of the last five by-elections in great britain her majestys official opposition has come third and has it not lost its deposit on two of those five occasions <e> <s> what is the justification in a democratic society for the state penalising the official opposition for daring to fight a by-election <e>", "<cs> i intervene to make only one observation from the standpoint of someone who believes that the short sharp shock is probably slightly preferable to the long sharp shock but otherwise has very little to support it <e> <s> i dislike talking in generalised terms and i should be grateful if the noble lord the minister would give us some simple figures that the home office must have by this time <e> <s> first of all a simple question how many young offenders underwent that treatment in the first months since april <e> <s> the figure must be available <e> <s> secondly and it may not be conclusive we can argue about the significance of it how many of those people were reconvicted in the months after their release <e>", "<cs> leaving aside the question of statistical reliability which is a matter each of us can make up our own minds about my lords may i ask the minister if the home office have the simple figures we can argue about their significance later first for the number of people who went through the detention centres where there is the short sharp shock from april to april <e> <s> they must have those figures <e> <s> secondly do they have those figures down to april of how many of those people have been reconvicted <e> <s> let us argue about the significance later <e> <s> it is idle to pretend that because of the question of statistical reliability the home office are not able to give those figures to the house and apparently will not be able to do so until consideration of the bill is over <e>", "<cs> i speak as one who will not forget what the noble baroness lady faithfull looks like even if she were sitting behind me on these benches as indeed i hope she will one day <e> <s> i waited to intervene because i was not entirely sure whether the noble lord lord elton was going to argue that this amendment is unnecessary or whether he was going to argue that it is inadequate <e> <s> as i followed his argument he is not saying that it is inadequate <e> <s> he is not suggesting that there are other criteria apart from those set out in the amendment which the courts should consider in deciding whether to impose a custodial sentence <e> <s> therefore the only basis for the difference of opinion that has emerged during the course of the debate is whether it is unnecessary or whether it serves a useful purpose to set out what appear to be commonly agreed criteria in the statute <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one matter to ensure that i have understood the position <e> <s> if and when these amendments are carried as i understand it amendment no <e> <s> will not now be called <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is consequential to amendment no <e> <s> which the committee has just supported <e> <s> as i understand it the position is and i would be grateful for the ministers confirmation that if these amendments are carried amendment no <e> <s> will not be able to be put but at the report stage amendment no <e> <s> will be re-tabled to come in at the appropriate stage after the new amendment no <e> <s> and subsection <e> <s> it will in effect then follow on as it would have done had these new amendments not been proposed <e>", "<cs> i endorse all the sentiments expressed by the noble baroness lady trumpington and the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> it seems to me that what it is sought to provide is something which would at once be acceptable to most noble lords namely that in view of the rgime at a detention centre nobody should he sent there unless there is a medical report which indicates that the person is suitable for that sentence <e> <s> unhappily so far as i can see the bill as drafted and the amendment as drafted do not achieve that at all because of the rather curious way in which the bill is drafted <e> <s> the bill puts it the other way round <e> <s> what the bill says is that the court shall not make an order if it considers that the persons detention would be unsuitable because of the mental or physical condition and the amendment provides that if the court wishes to determine whether it is unsuitable there must be a medical report to that effect <e> <s> this seems totally different from providing what i think most of us would agree should be provided which is to put it in a positive way so that if the court makes an order it shall not do so unless there is a medical report specifying the medical and mental condition of the person in relation to whom the order is made <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord say how long it would take an officer in reception to assess whether the person arriving is fit for the rgime or not <e>", "<cs> does that mean that one medical officer can say that a cell of a certain size will accomm <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord help by saying how many of the youth attendance centres are senior ones <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any hope of this being followed by the demolition of county hall <e>", "<cs> is there any difficulty in the government accepting this amendment in principle and then simply fixing a suitable commencement date <e>", "<cs> this is largely a matter of administrative convenience and that is perhaps the argument on both sides <e> <s> for the government there is the forceful argument of the enormous expense and use of manpower involved in conveying large numbers of people to magistrates courts for a pure formality as it is on per cent <e> <s> of occasions <e> <s> i suspect that on the other side there is a certain amount of administrative convenience for legal representatives who find it much easier to see their clients at a magistrates court than to make the sometimes tedious arrangements to go to a prison to see their clients there <e>", "<cs> i am not seeking to raise difficulties <e> <s> i am seeking to ensure that the new system works <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord the minister first how in practice on a further application for remand will a court decide that it is satisfied that the defendant has not withdrawn his consent <e> <s> secondly under the following subsection where the defendant was privately represented on the first occasion how will the court establish whether or not he still has a solicitor acting for him <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one query <e> <s> at the stage of a committal without consideration of the evidence is it not very important that the right <e>", "<cs> may i make one observation <e> <s> supposing since the courses open to defendants in this country had been first to remain silent with no inference of guilt whatever to be drawn from that or secondly to go into the witness box like everybody else take the oath and be cross-examined which would be the position if this amendment were carried <e> <s> i cannot help wondering whether it would ever remotely have occurred to the noble lord lord hutchinson if i may say so to come here today and say i have had the most marvellous idea why do we not give the defendant the right to make an unsworn statement from the dock <e> <s> it is not a logical position therefore i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble lord lord windlesham for the moderate and helpful way in which he introduced this debate at this stage just as indeed he introduced the debate on second reading some little time back <e> <s> on that occasion i was the member of your lordships house who moved the instruction on divestment and it is therefore appropriate perhaps that at this stage i should now for just one moment bid it a sad farewell <e>", "<cs> my lords i think many of us approach this question of the detention centres and their new stringent rgime from an empirical point of view and are very anxious to know how the experiment is doing <e> <s> the noble lord the minister at committee indicated that he would try to give some information at this stage <e> <s> i have had for a long time a suspicion that the home office computer is specially programmed so as not to be able to give information which might conceivably be helpful to anybody <e> <s> if the noble lord is able to give some information today as to how this new short sharp shock regime is doing since it was restarted and particularly what the reconviction rates are it might assist many of us to make up our minds on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way and i promise not to make a practice of this <e> <s> however is the noble lord really saying that in july he does not know what proportion of those who went on the stringent rgime in april have been re-convicted and how that compares with the re-conviction rates of those who in april went to other detention centres <e>", "<cs> all i would ask at this stage my lords is whether it is thought there may be security implications in what has been said because if there are no security implications we on these benches would find it odd for this matter to be made the subject of a statement in your lordships house at all <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a new imaginative and constructive proposal <e> <s> therefore like all good conservatives i view it with considerable suspicion <e> <s> my doubts arise because of the factor which has been referred to though not directly in this context that there are so many youngsters who get into trouble and who in fact come from homes where conditions are totally unsatisfactory not always visible to the outsider but nevertheless homes where there is marital discord and where there may be drunkenness and the pressures of poverty and squalor <e> <s> it is precisely those children who get into trouble <e> <s> i do not want to suggest that their domestic conditions are the sole or even necessarily the principal cause of their getting into trouble but that they form a contributory factor i do not think can be doubted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister what would be the cost of restoring the spanish language service <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> of course the power to grant bail to an appellant pending appeal is sparingly used at the moment and there is no reason to suppose that it would be any the less sparingly used if this amendment were accepted <e> <s> but it would be a useful modest improvement on the present position in two respects <e> <s> first as the noble lord lord hutchinson has indicated there are each year a distressing number of cases not a large number but a sizeable number where defendants have served the whole of their sentence before their appeal is heard and their appeal is eventually allowed and they are acquitted without as they say a stain on their character <e> <s> that is very little consolation to them and of course they are not entitled to any sort of compensation for the period that they have spent in prison in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed fortunate that it was a comparatively harmless intrusion into the palace that has given rise to the discovery of the ludicrous laxity of the security arrangements there <e> <s> i say comparatively harmless because i do not think that one should ever underestimate the shock and distress that can be caused to any occupant of any premises by behaviour of the sort about which we have heard <e> <s> i join in what has been said in total admiration of the self-composure that was so obviously displayed by her majesty at that difficult time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say to begin with that i entirely agree with the noble baroness lady macleod of borve and with the noble lord the minister that if a suspended sentence is passed its effect depends very largely on the degree to which the defendant believes that it is going to be enforced in the event of him getting into further trouble <e> <s> it is never possible to say to a defendant when one is imposing a suspended sentence if you commit a further imprionable offence you will serve the suspended sentence <e> <s> the most that anyone can say and i believe this is the formula that most courts use is you will amost inevitably have to serve the suspended sentence <e> <s> the reason for that is first that the act itself provides that there are other courses open in certain circumstances secondly that the courts have spent a little time trying to get around the situation anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords my peroration was going to be that i had no intention of dividing the house on this amendment <e> <s> i believe completely in the power of persuasion <e> <s> i was going to invite the noble lord to reflect between now and third reading on whether anything had been put forward which might cause him to reconsider the matter <e> <s> if he and i can reach some agreement we will no doubt take the appropriate action <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make one short comment on lord mishcons point about assault which of course is very often an extremely trivial matter <e> <s> in order to come within the provisions here at all it would have to be an assault which had merited a sentence of imprisonment of at least six months <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside the last altercation i still find these proceedings faintly baffling <e> <s> we have just heard the minister say why the amendment that i have moved is totally undesirable <e> <s> it is totally undesirable because it might lead to a blanket reduction it is totally undesirable because the judges might want to compensate for it in the sentences that they pass and not only is it totally undesirable but the secretary of state already has the power <e> <s> the logic of the ministers argument is that he should table an amendment himself to repeal that power because he clearly regards it as so totally unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords it is getting a little late and i am obvoiusly getting tired <e> <s> i cannot at the moment understand these amendments at all <e> <s> in line if we put in the word shall after <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also welcome the appointment of sir james and wish him every possible success <e> <s> this is an important new clause which i certainly welcome even if it is brought forward at a comparatively late stage of this bill <e> <s> purely in order that we may ensure that in due course the long title is correct would the noble lord the minister be kind enough to indicate on what basis he says that this is in fact relevant to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave would the noble lord be good enough to say which purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords which purpose is it connected to <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave and i am sorry but i am trying to be persistent for it will affect matters later in the bill there is nothing in the long title of the bill about reducing the prison population or anything to do with that <e> <s> how can this be a connected purpose to that <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last time <e> <s> with respect it is not about the sentencing and treatment of offenders but about the power of the court with regard to the sentencing and treatment of offenders <e> <s> the appointment of the inspector of prisons can have nothing to do with the powers of the court in relation to sentencing and treatment of offenders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as always to the noble lord the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords all i was going to say before the noble lord sat down after that most helpful and constructive speech was this could he assure us that the working party will be reappointed in the near future and instructed to treat their task as one of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the position that the law of contempt might provide some answer if it were enforced and that the decisions of the press council might supply some answer if they were enforceable <e> <s> will the noble lord consider taking action under one head or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords which member of your lordships house has asked the question to which the written answer is to be given tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords might i say that i have thought many times in the last two months of the words of the noble baroness lady young during <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those members of your lordships house who supported the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that it can be seriously disputed that the proposal does have or may have resource implications <e> <s> it is bound to require probation officers and social workers to work longer hours or alternatively that more of them work than are employed at the moment <e> <s> i venture to think that the minister would agree that serious doubts have been expressed about the effectiveness of the order and that so far very very little real research has gone into the whole concept <e>", "<cs> my lords it has sometimes seemed today that any resemblance between our proceedings and a normal third reading has been purely coincidental <e> <s> at this late hour i shall confine myself to two short observations <e> <s> first my noble friend lord harris of greenwich and i owe it to your lordships to explain in a sentence why the amendment we tabled on report and on third reading dealing with disqualifications for jury service was not moved <e> <s> it was an attempt to deal with the very serious and increasing problem of jury nobbling of interference with juries by ensuring that persistent or serious criminals were not available for jury service <e>", "<cs> my lords thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to disqualify certain convicted persons for jury service <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends on the liberal and sdp benches would i know want me to begin by offering my congratulations to the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord ponsonby of shulbrede on their election <e> <s> they will make <e>", "<cs> my lords with apologies and before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether the government have any plans for dealing with the question of eligibility for jury service <e>", "<cs> my lords we also are grateful to the noble baroness the leader of the house for repeating this grave statement <e> <s> if one looks at the first six months of this story so far as it is known the first six months of and the first count to which prime pleaded guilty it appears that in january of i assume after he had already been vetted for the first time the noble baroness can perhaps confirm that he was in contact with the russians in berlin <e> <s> in july it appears that he sought employment at the government communications headquarters and was positively vetted for a second time apparently without any discovery being made of the previous approach in berlin <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that the present position governing the disqualification of people from serving on juries by reason of their previous criminal convictions is <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is not so <e> <s> i think it comes within the part of the bill which is sub-headed any person who at any time in the last years <e> <s> so it would only therefore catch those people who have been convicted twice in the previous years and of course as they grow older if they commit no further offences so they will not then be eligible for disqualification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to everyone in your lordships house who has contributed to this interesting and fascinating discussion <e> <s> there appear to be three separate strands of opinion <e> <s> there are those who believe that the proposal in the bill is about right <e> <s> there are those who believe that it goes somewhat too far and there are those who like the government apparently believe that it does not go far enough <e> <s> i would only say on the very helpful observations of the noble lord lord elton that the proposals of the government as they stand appear to involve disqualifying a very large number of people who on a single occasion have committed a motoring offence of no great gravity <e> <s> i cannot believe that that would be a proper approach to this problem <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be able to report i hope accurately that the noble lord lord hutchinson made it clear later that there was perhaps a case for strengthening the law to some extent although perhaps not in quite the way that this bill now proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords my first task on behalf of the whole house is to thank the noble lord lord wells-pestell for raising this very important question and for doing it so forcefully and succinctly and in a manner which becomes the member of either house of parliament who knows more about the subject than any other <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lords who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> it is very difficult to distinguish i think between a debate at committee <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us on this side of the house who are anxious indeed to support on every appropriate occasion the police force as they carry out their difficult and dangerous duties are particularly perturbed by this incident <e> <s> we are perturbed that there should be an instance of mistaken identity arising in a case where apparently full information was available <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order is it not right that there are no points of order in your lordships house <e> <s> is it not clear that in recent months there has been a tendency for questions on the order paper to exceed the bounds of what many of us would regard as questions in the sense of being applications to the government for the release of information <e> <s> bearing in mind the observations that have been made in your lordships house today is this suggestion by the noble baroness the leader of the house that the matter should be referred to the procedure committee not a happy compromise and in the meantime should the noble lord not ask his question in the ordinary way if i may say so without prejudice <e> <s> in the circumstances would it not be a little undesirable to proceed with the motion of the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e>", "<cs> my lords i sense all around me a determination and an anxiety to proceed with the debate on the data protection bill <e> <s> when liberals heard that there was to be legislation on this subject we hoped that it would achieve three separate objectives <e> <s> first that anyone holding data about other people should be placed under a firm obligation to ensure that those data were accurate were properly safeguarded and were not misused and that there would be a way of effectively enforcing that obligation <e> <s> secondly that the citizen should in general have the means available to him of ensuring that the data were accurate that if not accurate they were rectified and that if not rectified or no longer needed they should be destroyed <e> <s> also that there should be an effective way of enforcing that right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill he now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will forgive me for one moment <e> <s> his observations are obviously very welcome and clearly made but i cannot help asking whether they have any relevance to what is purely a drafting amendment to substitute for words in a bill other words which mean exactly the same thing <e> <s> his observation may be highly relevant on lord campbells amendment or on the question that the bill do now pass which hopefully we shall come to reasonably shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will agree that before he winds up the discussion on the amendment i may say a few words about it <e> <s> first <e> <s> i should like to say that i am very grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for stimulating this discussion <e> <s> secondly i entirely agree with the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord rawlinson of ewell that this should be a matter for government legislation <e> <s> the government are aware of the gravity of the problem and they are aware too of the urgent need to do something about it <e> <s> they have made that abundantly clear in various comments that they have made over the last six months or so <e> <s> it was only when in response to the repeated suggestions by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and myself the government made it clear that they were not going to be able to take any initiative in this session of parliament that with very great reluctance it was decided to proceed by way of a private members bill in the hope that some pressure could be put upon the government either to take over the bill or to initiate legislation of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make three very short observations in conclusion <e> <s> first the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon about an indictable offence can i think very easily be met by a simple procedure under which the court would notify a defendant after conviction that he had or had not committed an indictable offence which was a disqualifiable offence under this act <e> <s> i see no administrative difficulty about that at all <e>", "<cs> no my lords but it will no doubt remind him when he gets a notice for jury service <e> <s> again i do not think there would be any difficulty about that <e> <s> the second point that i should like to make is this <e> <s> there are an infinite number of possible formulae or criteria as has been made clear <e> <s> they grade from the very very mild to the severe such as the one that is proposed by the government <e> <s> i would hope that minor disagreement as to the precise nature of the formulae will not lead as a result to nothing being done <e> <s> i think it is the governments duty to decide now in the light of the debate in your lordships house what is the appropriate formula and to proceed to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real issue whether information that was properly obtained was rightly treated by the coroner as being relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not agree that it is possible that the matters contained in the second part of this question are <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i do so on the basis that it offers at least some slight tightening up of the definition of data which is set out in clause <e> <s> the present position with that definition is that i think it will lead to considerable doubt in industry as to what exactly is included and what is not included <e> <s> to say that it is information recorded in a form in which it can be processed by equipment operating automatically is almost meaningless when one considers the pace of technological change <e> <s> information that can be processed by equipment operating automatically tomorrow may well be information that cannot be processed by such a means today <e> <s> it seems to me to be highly preferable in those circumstances not to leave a situation where no industry can possibly judge whether or not it is dealing with data within the terms of this bill but to say instead that the test is whether it is processed rather than whether it can conceivably be processed <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the consideration that the noble lord has given to this matter <e> <s> he will forgive me if i say that i find it difficult to be convinced <e> <s> indeed the very test that he chose the one of employability perhaps rather highlights the situation <e> <s> if an employee of mine who is doing say a grade job applies for say a grade job elsewhere and i wish to give an honest reference that he is a perfectly adequate grade worker but that in my view he does not have the judgment the supervisory powers or the financial control ever to get any further is it not in the interests of industry as a whole that i should give that honest and frank reference <e> <s> assuming of course i know that it will be computerised data at the other end as it is in the lord chancellors department and the lord chancellors department is not unique in this matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to what the noble lord the minister has said <e> <s> my advice is that there might be a danger that by including the word transferring there would be brought into the scope of the bill the whole question of electronic mail which is otherwise excluded <e> <s> this is perhaps an additional reason for not including the word at this stage <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord mishcon to reflect upon whether including the word includes rather than the word means is to substitute the rather imprecise for the very much more precise and whether that is not a temptation that we ought to seek to resist in the course of the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> your lordships will no doubt be relieved that in the noble lord lord renton we have at last discovered the data subject on the clapham omnibus <e> <s> i do not want to follow what he said about the previous amendment which i dealt with then <e> <s> i want to make two separate comments on clause stand part <e> <s> first the great british public who must be watching this debate with bated breath will be anxious to know why it is that the whole subject of this bill is limited to computerised data and not to manual data <e> <s> it is right that one should therefore make it plain that a number of us were deeply concerned about this and sought to table amendments which would remove this distinction <e> <s> but we were advised that in view of the terms of the long title of the bill that would not be in order and not appropriate and therefore the amendments that were tabled were with some reluctance withdrawn <e> <s> perhaps i may say that certainly for my part i still find the distinction which the bill makes a little artificial <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to bear in mind the questions about what is meant by the word individual in clause <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones about amendment no <e> <s> and deal at the same time as he has to some extent with amendment no <e> <s> because the two are linked <e> <s> i agree with the noble and learned lord that it is to the highest degree desirable that it should be the registrar rather than the secretary of state who should have these powers <e>", "<cs> may i in one sentence support what the noble lord lord mishcon has urged upon the minister <e> <s> it seems a little odd to refer to a right of access to something unless one first of all has as a prerequisite the right to determine whether or not the data exist to which you are in fact claiming access <e> <s> i should have thought that logically there was a great deal to be said for strengthening the bill as suggested by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am reluctant to support this amendment because every time anybody moves an amendment at the moment it causes such grief to the noble lord the minister in having to resist it and i am anxious not to add to his sorrow and suffering <e> <s> nevertheless this is a crucial amendment to the success of this bill <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to test it simply in this way <e> <s> let us assume that the people to be appointed would be precisely the same people whether it was the lord chancellor or the secretary of state who appointed them <e> <s> is it not a fact that if they have been appointed by the lord chancellor there would be a wide degree of acceptability across all classes data users data subjects and the general public as a whole who ought not to be entirely overlooked in this matter <e>", "<cs> if there is not a statutory basis for the advisory committee first of all is there any way in which one can avoid its being abolished at the whim of the minister without reference to parliament <e> <s> secondly if there is not a statutory basis for the advisory committee is there any way in which the registrar can be required to consult it at all <e>", "<cs> may i add that i do not think i have ever seen such a bill in which such vast powers have been given to the secretary of state <e> <s> almost every clause finishes up with the words that the secretary of state can cancel it alter it amend it improve it extend it or do whatever he may wish to do <e> <s> what we are seeking to do in committee stage in your lordships house is to go through each of these clauses seriatim and on each particular power it is perfectly possible for the noble lord the minister to make out a case for that particular power being given to the secretary of state <e> <s> what we are not able to do in this committee stage is to take an overall look at the totality of the situation as to whether the secretary of state is not being given overall a far wider extent of his powers and his discretion than is really desirable <e> <s> if that is the correct view and if this is a bill in which there are considerable extensions of the secretary of states powers far more than might reasonably be anticipated then i would suggest it is up to your lordships committee to take individual instances where that power can be whittled away without doing <e>", "<cs> i think we all knew that the time would come when the noble lord would find an amendment acceptable <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those observations <e> <s> one must not confuse the distinction between responsibility and day-to-day control <e> <s> i should have thought that it was not difficult to nominate somebody in an organisation who had the responsibility for compliance with the data principles even though the day-to-day control was under the immediate supervision of his subordinates <e> <s> perhaps the company secretary would in most cases be the obvious person in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may get my own back on the noble lord lord mottistone by saying that i entirely agree with every word he said as to the desirability of an amendment on these lines <e> <s> however perhaps there is a more effective way of doing it than this group of amendments in his name <e> <s> i query whether it is desirable to leave a matter of this great importance entirely within the secretary of states discretion <e> <s> i cannot help but think that it might be desirable to prescribe precisely in the bill the exemptions for which lord mottistone is contending <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a rather different point <e> <s> under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the way in which the government have treated the report of this tribunal is hardly an encouragement to persons of distinction to serve on similar bodies in the future <e>", "<cs> i find the ministers response convincing so far as the practical problems are concerned and indeed the problems in principle of making effective the interesting and ingenious proposal of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> i hope the minister is not to be taken as implying that he will not approach with an open mind proposals made later in the bill to try to relieve the registrar and his limited number of staff from the supervision of a vast mass of trivial computerised data the control and release of which could not conceivably do any harm to anybody <e>", "<cs> is there not a distinction between giving information and advice to the public in the terms of clause and giving advice to the data user or the data subject as is sought in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i think the indications he has given do meet the point which has been raised and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might tempt the noble lord the minister by saying that he has already rendered the noble lord lord mishcon speechless and if he were now to take the opportunity of rendering the noble and learned lord and myself equally speechless it would much facilitate the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> i most enthusiastically venture to support what has been said by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a very real step forward which in no way weakens any of the purposes of the bill and in fact makes the functions of the registrar the more easy to carry out <e> <s> there is no question but that the government are not proposing a very large-scale operation in the setting up of a registrar and his staff and one can quite understand the reasons for that <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the minister to the words in line of clause which read <e>", "<cs> may i venture to support this amendment <e> <s> i agree that it is an important one <e> <s> i hope that i am not going to be accused of nit-picking in any way but may i suggest that it may be slightly improved if the words grossly or persistently were so placed in the line as to cover both past contraventions and present contraventions <e> <s> at the moment think perhaps <e>", "<cs> may i support this amendment <e> <s> i agree in a sense with the noble lord lord mishcon this is a different way of putting the effect of the last amendment on which we divided <e> <s> but it is not very helpful to start inquiring which way noble lords divided on the last amendment <e> <s> the real point is whether the present amendment has merit <e> <s> may i suggest that it has and invite the noble lord the minister to consider it sympathetically before the next stage <e>", "<cs> is it not possible that an adaptation of the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone might serve to reduce the number of appeals and to reduce the expense in that way <e> <s> is that not a desirable end <e>", "<cs> i have followed with care every nuance of the ministers explanation <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me when i say i should like to look at it again in the <e>", "<cs> may i indicate that amendment no <e> <s> a which we seem to have reached somewhat abruptly is in a sense an alternative to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i propose to deal with those when we reach them rather than at this stage <e>", "<cs> i rise with a little hesitation to support this amendment <e> <s> my hesitation arises partly from the fact that the other day i supported with enthusiasm the proposition that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor rather than the secretary of state should appoint the members of the tribunal <e> <s> i must confess that on re-reading the noble and learned lords reply in the <e>", "<cs> apart from that point i am happy to accept the assurance given by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two observations <e> <s> first the noble lord the minister said that this is a measure of last resort from which i think it would follow that it would not be expected to happen on a very large number of occasions <e> <s> therefore there is no question of any undue pressure of work or time so far as the particular person is concerned who has to authorise the execution of the warrant <e> <s> secondly if one looks at clause one appreciates just what the person who is asked to issue the warrant has to decide <e> <s> first he has to decide whether <e>", "<cs> my amendment would not delete the words <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will forgive me if i say that i do not think that he has passed his examination paper <e> <s> certainly he has made no attempt to answer the questions that i raised <e> <s> but i see the problems that arise here <e> <s> i should like to reflect on the matter but a possible solution might be to give to the person who authorises the issue of the warrant the power to state within what hours it may be executed so that he would then have direct evidence as to the appropriate hours in relation to the particular user <e> <s> i should like to consider that possibility before the next stage <e> <s> i still feel very strongly that to leave the clause in its present form will give rise to very great trouble in future and i should find it no consolation to say i told you so <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be convenient to your lordships committee if at this stage i were to speak to amendment no <e> <s> because it deals with substantially the same issue but by means of a slightly different wording <e> <s> it imposes upon a person executing a warrant a duty of care not to impede the owner of the premises or the data user in the carrying on of his lawful business <e> <s> i perhaps marginally prefer this amendment to amendment no <e> <s> but i should very happily settle for either amendment depending upon which one the noble lord the minister thought fit to concede <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord mottistone whether he was moving amendments nos <e> <s> zd and ze together <e>", "<cs> my lords did the government of this country make any representations to the government of nigeria about the way in which the expulsion was carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord able to say on how many occasions in recent years the press council has issued warnings to the press which have been totally unheeded <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble and learned lord to reflect in due course on whether he is satisfied that the present wording of this clause deals adequately with the situation in which information requested by one data subject is found to contain as an integral part of its existence information about other data subjects <e> <s> for example in the case of a husband and wife what would the position there be when a data subject applied for data about him <e> <s> would he also be entitled in the circumstances to obtain data about other data subjects who may not have given their permission for the release of that information <e>", "<cs> without these amendments is there not a probability that the maximum might be charged as a matter of routine on every single occasion without any limitation on it <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has inadvertently misled your lordships by omitting to remind your lordships that the gentleman who wrote the cheque on the back of a cow did make the whole matter entirely legitimate by also affixing a d stamp to one of its ears <e> <s> may i venture to suggest that the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone has much to be said for it in principle <e> <s> one can criticise the adjectives which have been chosen in the way that the noble and learned lord has criticised them this i can understand <e> <s> but will the noble and learned lord not consider looking at the principle to see whether suitable language could be devised in order to discourage applications which are quite obviously on the face of them totally unmeritorious <e>", "<cs> i see that point and i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for making it so clear <e> <s> i confess that i had not considered the effect of amendment no <e> <s> in relation to my amendment <e> <s> it might still be that there is no purpose to be gained by this subsection in giving the data subject the right of access to the courts if in fact the registrar is competent to deal with the whole matter himself and it may be that that is a wholly unnecessary luxury that is being afforded to the data subject in these circumstances <e> <s> i should like to reflect on that and for the moment beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment moved by the noble viscount lord craigavon <e> <s> when we discussed clauses and a little earlier i endeavored to find out what if any was the meaning of the word distress when added to the word damage <e> <s> i received a somewhat ambiguous answer but it was quite clear from the answer that the word distress does add something to the word damage and is not to be taken as being included in the word damage hence the use of the words damage or distress in clauses and <e> <s> it appears only consistent now in clauses and when one is considering the harm that may come to a data subject in various ways that the same phrase should be used and the words or distress should be included <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his careful answer to this matter <e> <s> i had been reflecting on the question of the electoral register a little earlier this afternoon <e> <s> i am not sure that <e>", "<cs> one small query on clause <e>", "<cs> that is unauthorised <e> <s> if it is authorised by the data user then the data subject has no complaint <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> may i therefore make the problem clear and leave it to the noble and learned lord to reflect upon it <e> <s> i refer to organisations that contain records of millions of people with hundreds of millions of items of information amounting to personal data who frequently want to bring their records up to date and to dispose in one way or another of data which are for their purposes entirely obsolete <e> <s> i am only anxious to make clear if that is so that such an organisation is not going to need to secure the authority of each and every data subject at each and every time before so disposing of it <e>", "<cs> as the amendment is similar and as the answer appears to be similar i think the course i should take ought to be similar <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that explanation and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we return to it at a later stage would it be possible for some of us who are interested in this matter to make the odd observation this evening <e>", "<cs> might i support what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones said about this being one of the most important amendments in the bill <e> <s> it seems to me to be important on two grounds <e> <s> first it deals to a very large extent although not exclusively with the extremely difficult and sensitive area of medical records and health information <e> <s> secondly unless an amendment of this nature is written into the bill there will be the most extraordinary dichotomy between the bill and the police and criminal evidence bill which is at the moment going through another place <e>", "<cs> of course i shall do so <e> <s> there is no definition of the word substantially or of the word prejudice <e> <s> i venture to think that the use of the word prejudice by itself and the proviso that it is sufficient to claim exemption from the non-disclosure provisions on the most marginal and trivial degree of prejudice is going to give rise to just as much difficulty as if not more than the inclusion of the word substantially <e> <s> it might be that the best solution is to drop the whole of subsection and substitute the words which the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones moved in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but that is another argument <e> <s> for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to both the noble lords who have spoken on this matter <e> <s> it was not the intention of those who drafted the amendment to drive a coach and horses through this part of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that will be generally accepted <e> <s> but it was the intention to try to see whether machinery could be found which would ensure that such disclosures as took place in accordance with clause could if possible be monitored to ensure that the provisions were not being abused <e>", "<cs> this was in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> i am content with the response which has been given to it by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said we must not deal in hard cases <e> <s> i propose in the circumstances to ask leave to withdraw this amendment but to come back to it beyond any question at a later stage <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether i am correct in understanding that the secretary of state is not seeking two separate powers one under paragraph <e>", "<cs> the trouble is that the noble lord lord mcintosh and i as we both read this assumed that under paragraph <e>", "<cs> may i make it clear that i had of course included the noble and learned lord as one of those who were for this purpose on the front bench opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord mottistone chose to couple amendments nos <e> <s> and together because i have certain reservations about amendment no <e> <s> which i need not go into but i think that amendment no <e> <s> is one of importance and it is one which i am very happy to support <e> <s> i support it on the basis that the definitions throughout clause are so vague and so sweeping that unless there is some reservation of this kind there will be unlimited argument as to whether or not it does in fact include automatic word processors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone is getting on so well with the noble lord lord elton at the moment that i have the feeling that it can do nothing but harm to intervene from this side of the house in his support <e> <s> i do so on these two amendments because they seem to me to be the most important ones that we are considering in relation to the particular topic of business efficiency <e> <s> i accept that business efficiency is by no means the only objective to be secured by this bill <e> <s> i accept that the rights of data subjects at all times have to be borne in mind when we are considering to what extent we can assist business to carry out its work with that degree of efficiency which is obviously in the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down if that is the appropriate way to put it would he be kind enough to indicate whether the notification by the registrar in the terms of this new clause is to take place before or after the data user has had the opportunity of appealing to the tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may briefly intervene as one whose name is down in support of the amendment but who i must confess has some reservations about his position in that capacity <e> <s> i am probably the only member of your lordships house certainly the only member present at the moment who is a member of the council on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for the consideration that was given to what was said in committee and speaking personally i find this amendment entirely acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to disagree openly i think for the first time during the passage of the bill with the noble lord lord elystan-morgan because i think the noble lord lord mottistone is on to something here <e> <s> after all if one looks at the powers of entry one sees that they are very extensive and i believe they should in principle always be limited so far as possible <e> <s> the results of the entry and seizure of data or computerised material could be quite catastrophic to the person carrying on business and again it should be limited to those occasions when it can be justified beyond any question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last line of this amendment the word documents is in the plural and it should i think be in the singular <e> <s> i hope that that is the only objection that the noble lord lord glenarthur will take to this amendment because it seeks to deal with a very real problem which could arise where warrants are executed <e> <s> there are two situations first that police officers may execute such a warrant without proper regard to the interests of the occupant and may take possession of material that is totally irrelevant and has nothing to do with any alleged contravention of the law <e> <s> i would not want for a moment to suggest that this is likely to happen on a large number of occasions but i think that one would be closing ones eyes to the obvious if one pretended that it was never likely to happen on a single occasion <e> <s> secondly and more serious is the danger that in executing a warrant police officers may take possession of files programs or computer material which contains not only a single disputed item but it may well be hundreds of thousands of other items which have absolutely nothing to do with any alleged contravention of the law and the seizure of which will bring the occupiers lawful business to a total standstill <e>", "<cs> my lords the first issue that your lordships have to decide this afternoon is whether to approve the renewal of the order <e> <s> so far as my noble friends in the liberal and social democratic parties are concerned the answer is an unhesitating yes <e> <s> we have consistently supported the order made under the principal act since it first originated and we have consistently done so because all the evidence is overwhelming that it has served to play a valuable part in combating the evils of terrorism <e> <s> one has only to give the simple figure which was produced in another place by one of the opponents of the order to make that clear <e> <s> he pointed out that since there had been detained some suspected terrorists and he pointed out triumphantly that some of them had not been charged <e> <s> there are two things that follow from that <e> <s> first it is highly probable though none of us will know for certain that many of those gave invaluable information before they were in fact released <e> <s> secondly a simple piece of arithmetic shows that some have in fact been charged and i defy any of your lordships to suggest that that did not make a useful contribution in the war against terrorism <e> <s> that is one of the statistics that goes to show the value of this order <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to express my view and i do <e> <s> if the opposition had succeeded and won the vote in another place there would have been no order the order would have lapsed there would have been no provisions for combating terrorism until such time as the new bill was brought into force and i should have regarded that as quite deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the noble and learned lords argument with the greatest of interest and to the contributions made also from other parts of your lordships house <e> <s> the difficulty that i see as to what the noble and learned lord suggests is simply this ought there to be protection for let us say newspapers who have totally inaccurate information on their computer <e> <s> i can quite understand that where there is information which is accurate it may be undesirable in the interests of protecting sources that it should be revealed but where the information is wildly inaccurate it seems to me on first reading at least that clause as it now stands will deprive the data subject of any remedy whatsoever <e> <s> indeed taking the matter a stage further again as i read the clause any data user can avoid any liability under clause of any kind simply by saying obtained from third party <e> <s> the data subject will be powerless and the registrar will be powerless a great big coach and horses will have been driven right through this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister to help me about one matter <e> <s> immigration law is complicated and plentiful <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down my lords will he give me a clear instance of a case where he regards the power under <e>", "<cs> but my lords it is a crime covered by <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke at considerable length on this same amendment in committee and i know that what i said then is of course fresh in all your lordships minds <e> <s> therefore it is not necessary for me to repeat the arguments this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard the observations of the noble lord lord elton as a constructive reply to this amendment <e> <s> i am pleased to learn that the government will continue to consider the merits of what i appreciate is a problem that has many difficult edges <e> <s> in the knowledge that they are going to continue to consider it i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what effect the experiment has had so far on the punctuality of the buses involved <e>", "<cs> my lords supposing there are no legal representatives is it not possible to ensure that the court staff are nevertheless made aware that children are being kept in care <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether he agrees that apart from sporadic incidents this demonstration however much he and i may have disagreed with its objects was an entirely lawful occasion <e> <s> could he please go on and help us by advising us what each member of your lordships house would have to pay if we had to bear the cost of the police on the scene at the time of the opening of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for agreeing that he and i should change places in the order of speakers <e>

research organisation which occasionally produces a curates egg of a symposium such as the one that we are discussing today <e> <s> thanks to the noble lord lord hunter of newington it has enabled us to have what i have no doubt will be a stimulating discussion on the relationship between the public and the private sector <e> <s> in the minutes or so at my disposal i want simply to seek to demolish some five myths that are currently circulating about that relationship between the two sectors <e> <s> i declare an interest as being chairman of bupa and i shall do my best not to make my observations sound like a television commercial <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the changed political situation may i not only express my support for the bill but also the hope that it will be found possible for it to reach the statute book before parliament is dissolved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how grateful we are to the noble lord for giving us as much notice as possible of the re-arrangement of business <e> <s> i know that we shall be very happy to seek to assist in ensuring that the non-contentious matters that still remain can be put on the statute book before parliament is prorogued <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether in relation to prorogation he is in a position to give any indication as to the timing or indeed the manner in which it will be done <e>", "<cs> my lords two queries if i may <e> <s> first of all on the assumption that none of the political parties will wish to meet this thursday in order to discuss next weeks now non-existent business is there any reason why we should not sit at this thursday rather than at three oclock <e> <s> secondly could we have offical confirmation that the data protection bill hl <e> <s> will not now reappear in this house in this session <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble and learned lord say whether there have been many public complaints recently by members of the judiciary that the maximum penalties prescribed are proving inadequate <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for his not entirely unsympathetic response <e> <s> i have only two observations to make upon it <e> <s> first as i understand it the position under clause is that any data user can nullify the whole object of this legislation by recording if he wishes to do so against every item of data obtained from third party <e> <s> so far as i can see there will be no check of any sort by anybody as to whether that claim is accurate or whether if the claim is accurate it is true <e> <s> if that is so it seems to me to drive a coach and horses right through the whole of this legislation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord regard stability as a virtue if there were a left-wing labour government elected on a minority vote <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the announcement of the noble earl lord swinton will give me more than enough time to develop the few remarks that i want to make on this extremely important report <e> <s> it is important because it deals primarily with the administration of justice and with the effects on the administration of justice of certain activities in a particular case first by the police secondly by the press and thirdly by the law officers of the crown <e> <s> it also leads us to reflect on the role that the press council has played to date and the role that it should play in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether any of the pickets have been charged with being in possession of firearms <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as he earlier was perhaps a little unusually for this house unwilling to give way for what was intended to be an entirely courteous intervention may i ask him simply this <e> <s> he reports that his leader in another place has condemned violence whoever uses it <e> <s> what is meant by that expression <e> <s> and in particular is there any allegation by the noble lord that any unlawful force has been used by anybody on this occasion except by the demonstrators <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a higher proportion of those who use independent medicine give their blood to the transfusion service than of those who use only the nhs <e> <s> in those circumstances would not separate blood banks not only be thoroughly undesirable but positively detrimental to the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends in the sdp and my noble friends on the liberal benches are somewhat puzzled as to what the object is of this private notice question and its inevitable answer because it adds absolutely nothing to the information already available to the public and it does absolutely nothing except to give an opportunity to members of the other place and to members of your lordships house to make provocative remarks that cannot do the situation any good at all <e>", "<cs> my lords we are much impressed by the noble lord <e> <s> lord skelmersdales statement of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord lord aberdare consider making it clear when he replies to this discussion that any such restriction as is contemplated is subject to two conditions <e> <s> first the agreement of the usual channels of all the parties and secondly the motion before the house decided by a majority of the house if necessary <e> <s> i think it is necessary that these two conditions should be clearly understood in order to eliminate the perhaps at this moment academic possibility but the one that has been raised of a party majority in this house using its majority for the purpose of restricting debate against the wishes of the other parties <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody will know better than the noble lord lord henderson of brompton how inappropriate it is for anybody to comment on the appearance of a maiden speaker in your lordships house other than the noble

open mind on that matter this afternoon <e> <s> bearing in mind very much the links between the various forms of international terrorism and i do not seek to include anti-apartheid organisations in that observation of course i do not i listened very carefully to the assurance given by the noble lord the minister in regard to the way in which this clause would be operated <e> <s> i should like to see in committee whether it is possible to amend the clause to cover the terms of the assurance given by the minister <e> <s> if that is possible i believe it would be desirable <e> <s> if it is not possible i am prepared at least to accept at face value the assurance as it has been offered to your lordships house this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are appalled by this news and would wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy both to mr mhatres family and to the indian government <e>", "<cs> my lords the liberal peers deeply appreciate the tributes that have been paid to their late leader both by the noble viscount the leader of the house and by the noble lord the leader of the opposition peers lord cledwyn <e> <s> those tributes were generous and yet at the same time were entirely well-merited <e>", "<cs> my lords has the hearing before the review tribunal finished and if so when <e>", "<cs> my lords when did the hearing finish <e>", "<cs> might i from these benches express our total admiration of the noble lord lord mishcon for the great skill with which he has disguised the simple fact that his colleagues in another place fought the whole of this bill tooth and nail and eventually voted against it on third reading in a manner which we are bound to say was not conducive to the defeat of terrorism <e>", "<cs> we on these benches cannot support the noble lord lord mishcon and his noble friends in their attempt to remove exclusion orders from the provisions of this bill because like the noble and learned lord lord denning we believe that the findings of the noble lord lord shackleton and the noble earl lord jellicoe each in their turn are really quite incontrovertible <e> <s> that is to say there have been occasions and there are likely to be more occasions where the power to make exclusion orders can serve to limit the effects of terrorism <e>", "<cs> i desire to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is

committed it was his duty to report it to the police <e> <s> what i was saying was that there is so far as i know no case in english law under which a person has been convicted on the basis simply

lord has said that there may be a moral duty in those circumstances but i do not think that there has ever been a legal duty <e>", "<cs> i should like to say at once that i accept that clause is a substantial improvement on its predecessor and the government i think are entitled to credit for acting on the recommendations of the noble earl lord jellicoe to that effect <e> <s> i listened to your lordships observations with very great care <e> <s> i want to make only one or two short comments <e> <s> first the points made about the press and the bbc i hope will not he misunderstood <e> <s> i do not suppose for one minute that anyone was claiming that there should be a privileged position for journalists or broadcasters <e> <s> the only point that was being made was that if there is a section which obviously has an absurd consequence so far as they are concerned then it must he an undesirable piece of legislation so far as the community as a whole is concerned <e>", "<cs> the proposal that there should be review on a regular basis by impartial people responsible to parliament emanated from one of my honourable friends on the liberal bench in another place <e> <s> if i may i should like to put that fact on the record and support this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for reflecting on the problem and coming forward with some tentative suggestion <e> <s> i find it difficult to see quite how it would operate in practice and i find it difficult to see how for example if this house at this minute were debating the renewal of the order the government could go away and say that there was a quite clear majority feeling in your lordships house that this or that particular section should or should not be removed <e> <s> it would not be possible for us to vote on it or on any particular section <e> <s> my immediate reaction is that although i see the government are trying to be helpful this may well not be a very practical method of achievement <e> <s> having said that i accept that these procedural matters are intricate <e> <s> i am happy to think that my fellow proposer on one of these amendments is the noble lord lord henderson of brompton to whom i would have gone for advice on this matter even if he had not been the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> i am content to try to reflect upon these matters as has been suggested and for my part to ask leave to withdraw until the next stage amendments and <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only deepen the gloom with which the statement has been received <e> <s> this is not an isolated occasion <e> <s> the statement itself reveals that in the previous archway inquiry had to be abandoned <e> <s> is it not a fact and i know that the minister will be able to confirm this that just round the corner there has been a closely associated inquiry into the widening of the north circular road at east finchley <e> <s> that has had to be abandoned on two occasions within the last two years each time because the protesters had so misbehaved themselves that the inspectors felt obliged to resign because their health was suffering <e> <s> is it not a fact that it is very largely the same group of individuals who have been interrupting the two inquiries <e> <s> is it not perfectly clear that they <e>", "<cs> my lords there is little that i can add to that <e> <s> does the noble lord lord elton want to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords i only want to make one or two observations on the points that have been raised in the course of this interesting debate <e> <s> first the noble and learned lord lord denning referred several times to the position of a person who puts the police off the scent <e> <s> we are not considering in this clause the question of putting the police off the scent <e> <s> in this clause we are considering the question of a person who for particular reasons in particular circumstances may remain silent <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear that with a certain amount of gloom if we are to be told at a later stage that there will be particular reviews of the operation of the act so that the houses of parliament can discover just how effective clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords acting in <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make one very obvious remark <e> <s> i am sure the government will wish to bear in mind that it is helpful to somebody who is charged with an offence to be able to say in court that is contrary to the terms of the statutory instrument <e> <s> he has no defence whatever if he can say only that it is contrary to some circular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to see that normal service has now been resumed and that i am able enthusiastically to support what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said <e> <s> it is clear that vast powers are being given at the potential expense of the individual <e> <s> it is clear that those powers for the most part cannot by their nature be subject to judicial review <e> <s> i think everyone is agreed that it is clear that parliament must therefore review the operation of those powers on an annual basis <e> <s> so far there has been no dispute between anybody in your lordships house <e> <s> the real question is how is parliament to get the raw material from which it can make accurate judgments every year as to which powers or whether all the powers or none of the powers should in fact be renewed <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he say whether this individual would have access to detainees <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is necessary to add to what the noble lord lord henderson has said about the importance of exclusion orders nor about the desirability that on annual review parliament should have the power to come to a separate decision on part ii exclusion orders from its decision as to renewing the rest of the act <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary to add anything to what the noble lord lord henderson has said first because of the way in which he put the matter and secondly because it seemed to me that at the committee stage the noble lord the minister very graciously conceded that it was desirable on renewal in an appropriate case for the houses of parliament to have the opportunity to come to separate decisions on separate parts of the act <e> <s> the only matter that divided us at the committee stage was the question of what is the best machinery for achieving this desirable end <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on behalf of noble lords on these benches who supported this bill in principle that means the noble lords on the liberal and sdp benches but who sought to strengthen and make the bill more acceptable say now grateful we are to the noble lord the minister for the care with which he has listened to all our suggestions and the genuine efforts which the government have made in order to meet the improvements that we proposed <e> <s> we are grateful to the minister and we believt hat as a result of our deliberations this bill and the undertakings that have been given now make it far more acceptable than it was when it first came to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord suggest any question on this topic that permits of a straightforward answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not agree that both at archway road and at an associated inquiry at the north circular road there was a deliberate and systematically organised campaign which was intended to negate the whole democratic process <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord not also agree that in fact that sort of behaviour is very difficult to bring within the terms either of the common law or of the statute law such as the noble and learned lord has described it <e> <s> in particular is there not considerable doubt as to whether it is for the police or for the inspector to initiate proceedings <e> <s> in those circumstances is there not a very strong case to be made for clarifying and strengthening the criminal law to prevent these outrages from continuing <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness reconsider her observation that whether the government makes a statement is a matter for the usual channels my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i take considerable umbrage at the opening remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon in which he indicated that i might be able to offer some support to his argument whereas the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones had he been here would have been able to offer very able support <e>", "<cs> i doubt if it is helpful to talk about the rights of people to serve on juries because frankly per cent <e> <s> of the community would disclaim the opportunity if they had the chance of doing so <e> <s> what it is i think is a duty and this is relevant to this amendment for this reason <e> <s> it is an arduous duty <e> <s> it is time-consuming <e> <s> particularly with women jurors it may impose a considerable strain on their family life on the way they look after their children <e> <s> very often it gives rise to real financial hardship <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to make two observations <e> <s> first i should have indicated that the old lag case where a person is put on probation will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord renton did not intend to have that effect because one would not take that step in the case of a bill in which there was anything controversial still to be debated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by differing at once from the noble lord lord mishcon in one observation that he made when he said that on a previous occasion i had spoken on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> i did not <e> <s> there is no question of there being any party point of view on this bill at all <e> <s> it is not a government bill it is not a conservative bill <e> <s> i know so far as my own noble friends are concerned that they are entirely free of course they are to go into the lobbies in i hope a very short time taking their own view of this point and basing it on their own judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was careful not to say that the figures were not correct <e> <s> i could only say that his figures differed very remarkably from mine <e> <s> it may be that the tables were drawn up on a totally different basis <e> <s> i would certainly not accuse the noble lord of being incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble and learned lord will not wish in any way to give a false impression to the house <e> <s> the debate in another place which he is talking about consisted almost entirely of a long filibuster did it not <e> <s> by two members there <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord the minister is waiting for assistance to arrive on that difficult matter may i ask him what is meant by the words in public in line <e> <s> on one occasion in the course of his reply he used the expression in a public place and on another the expression in public view <e> <s> i should be grateful for clarification <e> <s> they seem to me to be totally different matters <e> <s> what is meant by the words in public <e> <s> is it a public place or does it mean somewhere which is not a public place but where other members of the public are present or somewhere where other members of the public might be expected to be present <e>", "<cs> having listened to this argument with as always a completely open mind i really find myself inclined to sympathise with the views put forward by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> may i take a particular example and invite the noble lord lord mishcon to deal with it <e> <s> let us suppose that there is an armed robbery in which the arms carried are pickaxe handles and not firearms <e> <s> that as i understand the bill would not be a serious arrestable offence under part i of schedule nor would it he a serious arrestable offence under part ii of schedule unless in fact firearms were carried <e> <s> therefore in order to make it a serious arrestable offence which i rather assume that the noble lord lord mishcon would agree that it was one would have to bring it somehow under the provisions of subsection <e> <s> i suppose one might argue that such an armed robbery was likely to have the consequence of causing serious injury to any person but it is a slightly artificial approach to the problem <e> <s> the common-sense approach surely is that a robbery of that sort is something of which the likely consequence is to cause substantial financial gain <e>", "<cs> it might be said to have been intended to lead to the consequence of financial gain even if there was only there <e>", "<cs> not only was it not unknown on the circuit of the noble and learned lord it was almost a monopoly on that circuit <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister help with a simple statistic in relation to the last figure for the year ending december <e> <s> can he say how many offences within paragraph were committed in that year <e> <s> what proportion of offenders were sent to prison <e> <s> that would enable us to judge whether or not they are serious offences <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down has he by any chance the figures for which i asked him <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord really saying that he has no idea how many offences of this type are committed every year <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to make any comment on the bulk of the statement made by the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> i assume that it is made clearly with the full approval of the law lords <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i too should like to thank the noble lord the chief whip for his repetition of that statement <e> <s> we are grateful to him for keeping us informed and we look forward to future developments with very considerable interest <e> <s> at this stage i should like to raise two matters <e> <s> first can the noble lord lord denham inform us whether the government agree with the observations made by his noble friend lord whitelaw last night <e> <s> the noble viscount after reflecting upon the matter for some hour and three quarters after the end of the division announced at col of <e>", "<cs> i see the force of the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord lord denning and i certainly would not want to do anything to weaken the protection to which owners of houses in hampshire are entitled <e> <s> at the same time there is something in the point made by the noble lord lord gifford that the wording <e>", "<cs> may i make two observations <e> <s> first the noble lord the government chief whip will not want it to be suggested that any sort of delaying tactics were used over the last amendment particularly having regard to the fact that a number of noble lords who spoke in that debate are probably making their only substantial contribution throughout the whole of this bill <e> <s> secondly if the noble lord the government chief whip wishes to consult through the usual channels will he bear in mind that there are usual channels in all the political parties in this house <e>", "<cs> am i not right in thinking that paragraph <e>", "<cs> or attempted <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord the minister will kindly explain so that i may follow his argument why he says that clause applies only to a police station <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister to be kind enough to summarise his argument by a simple answer to two questions which i want to put to him <e> <s> let us leave entirely on one side for the moment the question of whether these matters should be contained in the code of practice or in the statute because that is a separate argument <e> <s> may i ask the minister to look at the rights set out in paragraphs <e>", "<cs> secondly will the minister be kind enough to tell me which of those rights he agrees that in one form or another a person voluntarily at a police station should be informed of and which he says that person should not be informed of <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has set out in very reasonable terms what are the safeguards provided by clause <e> <s> what he has not said in simple terms is what is the point of clause <e> <s> the reason for that is i suspect that if he were to be candid with your lordships committee the reason for clause is the simple proposition that the longer you can keep a man in custody the more likely he is to crack <e> <s> that is the simple proposition behind the whole of clause is it not <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> i was not seeking to contend that self-serving statements should not be admissible <e> <s> what i was seeking to contend was that self-serving statements should only be admissible as evidence in relation to the maker of the statement and i am perturbed that the subsection as it stands should contain the words <e>", "<cs> if i may adopt the words of the noble and learned lord lord edmund-davies the perilous road about which we are troubled is that those who are carrying out an interrogation might be led to believe that a slight departure from these principles will nevertheless not render a confession inadmissible <e> <s> the perilous road is that those carrying out the interrogations will thus be led to further and more frequent departures from these principles <e> <s> for those reasons we would wish to support this amendment and to support in particular paragraph <e>", "<cs> i did not want to intervene while the noble and learned lord was speaking but is it not a really striking fact that all the reported cases are cases in which the unlawful evidence was admitted <e> <s> is it not in the nature of the process that the cases where the unlawfully obtained evidence was excluded have in all probability resulted in acquittals and have therefore never reached the appeal stage and so have not been reported <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord ezra i should like to say how much he appreciates the care courtesy and reception that has been given to his suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords there is just one matter of in a sense verbal quibbling <e> <s> concerning the last line of amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred does one suspect something of being subject to legal privilege <e> <s> is not the word suspect rather inappropriate as giving the impression that something is wrong <e> <s> would it not be better to have thinking rather than suspecting that it is subject to legal privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the undertaking which has been so generously given extends also to the various other clauses surrounding this particular one which we have been debating in such obscurity this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be grateful if the noble lord the minister would explain to me what i did not follow from his observations <e> <s> if the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the argument put forward by my noble friend lord foot first because it simplifies very much an extremely complicated arrangement as set out in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about that <e> <s> i rather doubt whether there are any offences in the bill as it stands which are offences that are punishable by imprisonment only on a second or subsequent conviction <e> <s> i am not sure about that <e> <s> but i do not think there are <e> <s> what i was going to suggest to my noble friend lord foot if he wishes to press this amendment either today or at a subsequent stage is that if his amendment read <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> it seems to me that the custody record which i rather assume was known in my younger days as the charge sheet probably it is the same document contains a vast amount of information in any event and to ask that it should contain these two additional items can do no harm and might be of very great advantage in the course of a trial <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness forgive me <e> <s> is she saying that if she goes to a police station and reports the loss of her motor car somebody there does not make a record of the time at which she is seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to have to say that i cannot agree with the view that the noble lord lord mishcon has taken because at the moment one has no idea what will happen if the substance of this debate is reserved until the next stage at third reading <e> <s> indeed i think it might be open to objection if on third reading there were debates in detail on amendments which had been put down at report stage <e>", "<cs> and then they were simply glossed over on the ground that it happened to be eleven oclock at night <e> <s> i find this a difficult proposition <e> <s> i think the matter should be explored a little further this evening because it is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> i want if i may to support my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington in drawing attention to what i would regard as a most sweeping extension of the criminal law which is tucked away rather innocuously in subsection of clause <e> <s> i say that it is a sweeping extension of the criminal law because i believe i am right in saying the noble and learned lord on the woolsack will correct me at once if i am wrong that if any judge today directed a jury in those terms as set out in subsection and there were a conviction it would at once be quashed in the court of criminal appeal without any argument because under the law as it stands today there can be <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will forgive me surely he is wrong in saying that there must be some evidence <e> <s> what he means is that there should be some evidence <e> <s> there is a world of difference between the two words <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be perverse of me in those circumstances to oppose this amendment and of course i do not do so for one moment <e> <s> i am glad to hear from the noble and learned lord on the woolsack that the existing rule of law as to the situation where one defendant refers to another defendant in the course of his statement to the police is now not going to be affected in any way by this bill <e> <s> i think that that is a most welcome improvement on the bill as originally drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> has he looked at amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> does that not solve the problem that he is raising <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the period covered by the log which has gone astray <e>", "<cs> my lords can there be a fixed and generally known place in the library where such documents may be found <e>", "<cs> my lords these are extremely modest proposals and it is therefore not surprising if i extend a somewhat modest welcome to them <e> <s> they do not seek substantially to increase the number of people who are eligible for legal aid or advice or assistance <e> <s> they merely seek to ensure that the number is not reduced as a result of the effects of inflation <e> <s> that is in itself to be welcomed but it is a very limited step forward <e> <s> it is not easy on that particular narrow issue to make a passionate or enthusiastic speech and i do not propose to do so <e> <s> i should like however very briefly to raise two closely associated matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will meet with the approval of your lordships if we now return to the prosecution of offences bill and its second reading <e> <s> your lordships will recall that a week is a long time in politics <e> <s> seven hundred weeks is a very long time in politics <e> <s> it is just over weeks ago that two young queens counsel one is now a distinguished circuit judge and i was the other produced a report for justice called <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three questions <e> <s> first does the noble lord agree with the observations by the noble viscount lord whitelaw in col of <e>", "<cs> my lords in expressing some anxiety about the course upon which the government have embarked i make it perfectly clear that no one on the alliance benches is seeking to offer the slightest encouragement or support for the criminal antics of mr scargill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask who has expressed an opinion against it <e>", "<cs> as one who has always believed that the service should be run as a national system without it being an over-centralised system may i suggest that the combined effect of the recent white paper and the noble lords amendments appears to provide a very helpful and constructive solution <e> <s> i very much prefer his proposed solution to the alternatives that are in some respects indicated by the amendments to which we shall be coming shortly in the name of the noble baroness lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely sure that i agree completely with the observations of the two noble and learned lords who have just spoken <e> <s> i accept the view of course that if the police have charged someone against whom there is no evidence the powers of the prosecutor to abandon the case are entirely adequate at the moment <e> <s> the clause i think seeks to deal with the situation that gives rise to great problems at the moment where the police have charged a person perfectly properly because there is some evidence a scintilla of evidence against that person and yet the independent prosecutor when he looks at the papers comes to the conclusion that it is not in the public interest that the prosecution should continue <e>", "<cs> with respect no because they are the cases that succeed and after a trial lasting four months the judge says to the wretched moll now go away and dont do it again <e> <s> that is what one is seeking to avoid by this amendment <e>", "<cs> clause refers to the rights of audience at the crown court <e> <s> it is therefore a clause of immediate and pressing concern to the whole of the bar as a practising profession <e> <s> i want if i may to raise this matter in i hope an entirely non-controversial way <e> <s> the fact is that at the present time the existing rights of audience in the crown courts which the bar enjoys are regarded by the bar as being absolutely essential to its survival as an independent profession <e> <s> any whittling away of those existing rights would i think severely interfere with the prospects of the bar surviving in that way <e>", "<cs> i sympathise entirely with what the noble lord lord mishcon is seeking to achieve by this amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether he would not consider on reflection that it is just a little widely drawn and whether he really intends for example that it should be the duty of the clerk to notify let us say every single shoplifting prosecution to the director of public prosecutions <e>", "<cs> given that the amendment of the noble lord lord mishcon includes specifically the words of a general nature can the noble lord the minister give us a hypothetical example of advice or guidelines of a general nature which it would not be in the public interest to publish <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will regard this amendment with sympathy <e> <s> it seems to me to refer to the points which i raised on second reading <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> leaving aside the drafting point of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale perhaps i may refer for a moment to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i hope that it is in order to congratulate the chief constable of sussex on his initiative in setting up this inquiry which is a productive inquiry and a step which showed considerable forethought on the part of that police officer <e> <s> i am sure your lordships will agree that this is a situation in which pre-eminently there is a danger of being wise after the event and of showing hindsight and of asking questions now which would never have occurred to anyone at that time <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and i agreed that he might move this amendment and that i might reply to it one of the purposes of that was that we might demonstrate in a practical way that this was in no sense a party political issue <e> <s> it is hardly necessary i think to pursue that aspect of the matter any further <e> <s> having heard three noble and learned lords from the cross-benches opposed to clause having heard five noble lords and noble baronesses from the government benches including one former attorney-general opposed to clause and having heard only a single voice raised in its support and that from the noble baroness on the labour benches i think it is perfectly clear that party political issues have nothing to do with the merits of what we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> i can only say that i know perfectly well the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that all my noble friends on the alliance benches will have welcomed the verdict that was reached in the case yesterday <e> <s> having said that may i make two observations that may not perhaps meet with the unanimous approval of all those who have been welcoming that verdict <e> <s> first i can see no reason why mr ponting should be elevated to be some form of folk hero <e> <s> there are many of us who want to see the abolition of section of the official secrets act or at any rate its drastic reform who at the same time recognise that there is a place for the concepts of confidentiality and loyalty both in the civil service and throughout industry as well <e> <s> what we query is the wisdom of seeking to enforce those concepts by means of the clumsy machinery of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his explanation of and his comments on this order and also indeed for his assistance in trying to help those of us who were interested in the order to receive at the earliest possible moment the report by sir cyril philips and the riposte by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should also like to say that we regard this bill as being of very considerable importance in the administration of our criminal law and we do so primarily for two reasons <e> <s> the first is that it serves to remove the police by one stage from the prosecution process and that can only enhance the confidence which the public feel and ought to feel about the independence and impartiality of the police <e> <s> the second reason is that it will help to create a career structure in the prosecution service which will encourage people of real calibre to continue to come forward and support it <e>", "<cs> my lords by my calculation i have some minutes at my disposal but your lordships need not be too disturbed <e> <s> i do not propose to occupy all of them by a very long way <e> <s> when this debate began i said that i hoped that in the course of it a consensus might develop <e> <s> i believe it has <e> <s> i believe that the overwhelming majority of the speakers have some with their reservations some with their modifications supported the general principles laid down in this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we too would want to associate ourselves with the deep expressions of sympathy and indeed of horror at this appalling and quite unnecessary tragedy <e> <s> we would want also to join <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the publication of the white paper in order to bring the whole area of public order law up to date <e> <s> it follows perhaps somewhat belatedly the green paper of april the home affairs committees report of august and of course the law commissions very useful report of october <e> <s> only one or two comments might be helpful at this stage until one has had a chance of studying the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall assume if i may that the word eases three lines from the end of that amendment will be altered in due course to cases <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> i wanted only to demonstrate that i had read the matter with some care <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want vigorously to oppose this drafting amendment <e> <s> it is the last opportunity that i think i shall have of saying farewell to the bill <e> <s> i wish to make only one observation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord will no doubt accept that what he has said about the possible limitation of jury trials is a matter of the greatest controversy and not one perhaps that can be usefully explored at question time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my congratulations to the noble baroness lady vickers for the clear and lucid way in which she has introduced this bill <e> <s> i think few of us would argue but that there are a limited number of areas in this country where kerb crawling has become a pestilential nuisance <e> <s> that there should be an attempt to use the criminal law to stop it is something i think very few of us would wish to argue about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> if that is so and that does appear in due course to be acceptable to your lordships house it will in fact be possible to combine clauses and and simply have one clause dealing with persistent soliciting whether from a motor vehicle or otherwise <e> <s> it would incidentally have the very happy result of getting rid of what i think is the ugliest sentence i have even seen in an act proposed in your lordships house where in lines and the sentence reads <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister say solicitation of a prostitute or did he in fact not mean solicitation of a woman <e> <s> there is a big difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that observation which answers the point that i raised <e> <s> it still means although it is of no great consequence that the original comment in the explanatory memorandum is not entirely accurate <e> <s> however if the criminal law revision committee has subsequently reviewed the matter and indicated as it has to the home office that meets the point that i raised <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo those points on behalf of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> hear hear my lords <e>", "<cs> in general terms at this stage i should like to support the argument so eloquently put forward by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> if i have any observations to make in support i should like to reserve them until a slightly later stage because now i want to ask the noble lord lord glenarthur what i hope is a series of fairly simple questions the answers to which i believe will clarify our minds in deciding how to approach the problems which the noble lord lord mishcon has raised <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has misunderstood the effects of the first amendment <e> <s> the word persistently applies to the soliciting <e> <s> it is suggested that it should be an offence persistently to solicit women not solicit the same woman persistently <e>", "<cs> it would read <e>", "<cs> may i add one observation arising from the recent intervention of the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> it is only a matter of draftsmanship i know but if i persistently make a speech on a friday afternoon it is not i hope the same speech <e> <s> if i persistently catch a bus to go to work it is not the same bus <e>", "<cs> may i say that i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his answers to my questions <e> <s> i am relieved to think that apparently a motorist who does stop and speak to a woman goes back to his car and drives off is not simply from those facts to be in peril <e> <s> that is helpful <e> <s> in parenthesis i would add that if that is right it is putting rather a temptation in the way of a police officer who happens to see that particular scene to gild the lily a little in the course of his evidence <e> <s> but no doubt that is a risk we shall have to take <e>", "<cs> i can only say that if that guidance had always been followed in the past i would have had an even smaller criminal practice than i had <e>", "<cs> i see the problems with the word left which is proposed in the amendment although as has been appreciated it is the word that is used in the explanatory memorandum by whoever drafted it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly raise one matter on clause which increases the maximum penalty for indecent assault on a woman from two years or in some cases five years to a maximum of years <e> <s> may i say that i entirely agree with that <e> <s> there can be very serious cases of indecent assault on a woman and it is quite appropriate that the maximum sentences as at present in existence should be regarded as wholly inadequate and should he increased to years <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not want to ask any questions arising out of this statement because the questions which i would seek to ask are those which i know perfectly well it would be quite inappropriate for the government to attempt to answer at this stage <e> <s> i shall therefore if i may make only three brief comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that any of your lordships if asked to choose an example of good legislation would choose the way in which this bill has proceeded through both houses of parliament <e> <s> having gone through the other place we are now at third reading and are all desperately trying to rewrite the whole bill <e> <s> what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would say about this on third reading if he were here i shudder to think hut we must do our best in this difficult situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only saying let us by all means hear in mind what the committee has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first place i think that the noble lords scenario is being quite fanciful <e> <s> i think that in the second place one must face up to the fact that frivolous vexatious prosecutors if they exist exist in all sorts of areas on all sorts of charges <e> <s> there are women going around who are perfectly capable of going up to a police officer and saying lord so and so has just pinched my bottom <e> <s> there is a risk that that will happen <e> <s> it is totally fanciful but there is a risk that it will happen <e> <s> there is a risk that a magistrate will grant a summons and there is a risk that a charge will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will wind up proceedings on this bill if i say in one sentence how grateful the whole of your lordships house is to the noble baroness lady vickers for the way in which she has presented the various stages of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in my approach to this fascinating bill i want to make two preliminary observations <e> <s> one is to say how much we look forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord donoughue the other is that i should say from these benches how much we congratulate the noble lord lord mishcon on his speech <e> <s> i have never before seen anybody fight quite so effectively with both hands tied firmly behind his back <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly there was no such agreement <e> <s> there was consultation with one of the whips of one of the alliance parties who never even saw the bill and who said that the matter appeared to be sufficiently urgent for its passage through another place to be facilitated <e> <s> that is as far as the matter went <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i said earlier and which i understood to be correct that at the time when the alliance representatives said they would facilitate the passage of this bill the bill was not produced to them <e> <s> there the matters rests <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i correct him on one small matter <e> <s> i did receive a copy of the notes on clauses and i am grateful to the home office for its courtesy in providing it <e> <s> had i realised that no doubt due to some oversight my noble friend had not received a copy i would have shared mine with him <e>", "<cs> my lords surely not if the boxes are not overlooked by other spectators <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in effect saying that if clubs provide one-way glass at the front of these executive boxes so that the members and guests inside can see the event but nobody can see into the box he might regard that as an acceptable compromise <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it we are at the moment discussing together in one group amendments nos <e> <s> to with the exception of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord lord dean and the noble lord lord northfield are really a pair that go together <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and are a similar pair in the name of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich the noble lord lord mulley the noble lord lord monson and myself <e> <s> they are for practical purposes identical except for a matter of drafting with amendments nos <e> <s> and in the name of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> the difference in the drafting is unfortunate <e> <s> it is due entirely to the somewhat phrenetic haste with which this bill is proceeding through both houses <e> <s> it has made it difficult for consultation between noble lords to be as complete as it might otherwise have been <e> <s> therefore i am very happy to support in principle the approach which the noble lord lord dean makes in his amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords we are still in the middle of the speech of the noble lord lord mulley <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope noble lords will forgive me but we are in the middle of the speech being made by the mover of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that this bill will play an appreciable part in reducing the amount of hooliganism both inside and outside football grounds <e> <s> to that extent the bill is undoubtedly to be welcomed and to that extent we on these benches of course support it <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for repeating this statement and of course to mr justice popplewell for an extremely thorough interim report which has <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we were minutes on the statement and the responses from the front benches <e>", "<cs> my lords and putting it if i may say so very much shorter <e>", "<cs> my lords there may have been in some quarters an hysterical over-reaction to the result of this case and there may be a tendency to attempt to use it in obscure ways as a stick to beat the government <e> <s> i can only say that i think there are more effective sticks available at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pose one simple question before we get involved in an orgy of police bashing led by the labour party front bench <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that at this trial there were no serious allegations of misconduct made against the special branch of the metropolitan police <e>", "<cs> my lords on the practice alleged is it not a very nice point whether it could amount to a breach of the criminal law <e>", "<cs> my lords every year this debate covers a vast range of topics <e> <s> so far as i can see half of them are chosen because they have been mentioned in the gracious speech and are therefore worthy of comment <e> <s> the other half are chosen because they have not been mentioned in the gracious speech but are equally worthy of comment <e> <s> if there is any general theme underlying many of the contributions that your lordships have made this afternoon and this evening each speaking with his or her own particular expertise on a specific topic it is a deep concern with the lack of cohesion in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one of the hallmarks of a civilised society that because of their inadequate means its citizens are not deprived of access to the courts <e> <s> as these four orders represent a modest step in the continuation of the process which was begun many years ago in this country we of course give them our full support <e> <s> however if i may i would very respectfully echo the forceful point just made by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords when the survey is carried out will the government bear in mind the extreme importance of being even-handed as between the prosecution and the defence <e> <s> will they also bear in mind that at the moment the prosecution has first the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord look again at the law whereby a man accused of rape is entitled to anonymity in order to see whether that is operating in the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that my colleagues on the alliance benches will want to welcome these codes of practice as being taking an overall view fair and sensible and seeking to hold a proper balance between the rights of the police to carry out their duties efficiently in the interests of society and the rights of the individual not to be oppressed or harassed when those powers are being exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords we too should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating the statement even though it led him at one point to be forced to say that he was looking forward to consulting his noble friend the lord chancellor at an early stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate of this nature it is an inevitable formality that i should begin on behalf of my noble friends by expressing our gratitude to the noble and learned lord lord roskill the chairman of the committee to its distinguished members and to its staff for the extremely lucid wide-ranging and helpful report which they have produced <e> <s> on this occasion it is in fact not a formality it is an expression of our deepest congratulations to the noble and learned lord for a document which i certainly regard as one of the most constructive and profound reports on the criminal law that i have ever had the pleasure of reading <e> <s> i believe that it will make a real contribution to the development of that law in the course of the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that intervention <e> <s> the thought had of course occurred to me when i was considering this matter <e> <s> i think the situation is very different <e> <s> i think the situation with an alibi is that the trial is very often a very short trial the defendant very often produces witnesses of whom the prosecution have never heard the case is over the same day or the same afternoon and hours later it is discovered on examination that the alibi is totally false or the alibi witnesses have long criminal records about which nobody knew <e> <s> a fraud case which by definition is the kind of case about which we are talking will take days and days if not weeks and weeks and i do not believe that that consideration applies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord for introducing the order in the way that he did and particularly for bringing it before your lordships house some four weeks or so before it is due to take effect <e> <s> as i understand it and i know that i shall be corrected if i am wrong that is in order that if there were a sufficient weight of opinion on one or more than one aspect which required reconsideration by the government they could do that before the order came into force in the middle of next month <e> <s> that is the cumbersome procedure that we devised last year so that we should not necessarily have either to take or to leave an order <e>", "<cs> my lords i also noticed that there was an apparent contradiction between a in one place and a nought in another place <e> <s> i do not know but i took it that the figures in the statistical column were correct <e> <s> in either event nought or is a very small number <e> <s> it is because the number of orders has now become so small that clearly serious consideration was given by sir cyril and is being given by the government to the question of whether sections and should remain in the act or whether as an alternative proposal put forward by sir cyril it might be possible at least for the government while keeping sections and to undertake not to make any new exclusion orders in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would forgive me if i indicated that to the best of my knowledge the alliance as a whole did not vote in support of the labour party last night in opposing the motion although as i understand it it may be that there were the odd one or two who went into that lobby <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say how many times section was used last year <e> <s> i did ask him <e>", "<cs> my lords the opinions expressed in your lordships house this afternoon have really been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am beginning to find that my attendance in your lordships house is inducing in me a state of schizophrenia <e> <s> i come on mondays and wednesdays and listen to government ministers who are very often cabinet ministers extolling our economy and telling us what a prosperous society we now live in <e> <s> i leave your lordships house with my head held high and proud of being a member of such a society <e> <s> i also come on tuesdays and thursdays to your lordships house and tonight i find the noble and learned lord on the woolsack who is if i may say so the most generous of men constrained to have to put forward on behalf of his department niggardly proposals of this sort <e> <s> it is being done in the name of saving a paltry sum in the region of million a year <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to say that having listened to the discussion on this amendment with an open mind and having heard the contributions so far i come down very much in favour of what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i rather anticipated that the minister might have attempted to put forward the suggestion and argument that the amendment was unnecessary because the high court judge would as a matter of elementary justice ask that the defendant should be represented so that he can hear what had to be said <e> <s> but the minister has not said that at all <e> <s> he has come down against giving the defendant a right to make representations over what seems to me to be an important stage in the disposal of what <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> so far as i can see it does not in any way change the sense of the existing bill it merely makes a statement that appears on the face of it to be a trifle bald and somewhat radical a little more moderate in its implications <e> <s> i hope that the minister will find a way to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords three matters are quite obvious are they not <e> <s> first extradition proceedings are invariably full of technicalities <e> <s> anyone who has ever been involved with them knows that perfectly well <e> <s> second warning was given if warning were needed and i do not believe that it was some months ago when these very warrants were returned from dublin because they contained some technicalities <e> <s> third i think that anyone who does not live in a political vacuum must recognise the fact that there are some irish judges who in the course of perfectly properly exercising their judicial independence are likely to look somewhat more enthusiastically for irregularities and technicalities than some of their colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make it clear so that there is no confusion that the question as to where the central criminal court is arose in and has absolutely nothing to do with the reason why the warrants on this occasion were found to be invalid <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no allegations of bad faith to make against the government this afternoon <e> <s> i welcome the information that has been given and also that these steps have been taken perhaps somewhat belatedly <e> <s> it is the belatedness of the matter that causes me a little anxiety <e> <s> i should like to give one example <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister can inform us whether among those to be deported there is a man by the name of adel masoud who according to the press the press may or may not be right was boasting last month that he was a member of a revolutionary squad in this country who was prepared to become part of a suicide attack <e> <s> if that is right it looks as though action of this sort might properly have been taken rather more quickly than it has been <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say that it is not an offence to cross a single continuous white line in the middle of the road <e> <s> if it is not what is the difference between a continuous white line and a broken white line <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that recently on my garden path the postman delivering my morning mail crossed with the postman delivering my afternoon mail <e> <s> is he further aware that when i queried the reason for that i was told that it was due to shortage of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures given by the noble lord the minister a moment ago indicate that overall the activities of the parole board have been quite remarkably successful <e>", "<cs> my lords among the not unlimited range of matters in which noble lords on this side of the house have complete confidence in the prime minister is that she has complete confidence in the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> we should therefore like to add our congratulations and best wishes <e> <s> i should like also to echo what the noble lord lord trefgarne said in thanking mr calcutt for this report which has been extremely rapid given the problems very clear very well argued and i believe extremely well balanced <e>", "<cs> my lords i no longer practise but i spent most of my working life in the criminal courts sometimes prosecuting sometimes defending appearing sometimes privately and sometimes on legal aid <e> <s> it was not perhaps the best of training for learning how to limit a speech to a maximum of minutes <e> <s> it is a period that gives me time i think only briefly first to thank the noble lord lord benson for the way in which he has introduced the debate and secondly to say how eagerly i anticipate the speech of the noble and learned lord lord ackner <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one who i believe is still a vice-president of the criminal bar association may i very strongly support this amendment and hope that the government will persist in it <e> <s> i give my support on three grounds <e> <s> first the offence in clause will then be the offence of knowing or suspecting certain matters <e> <s> that is a formula which is accepted and recognised in the criminal law of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want at this late stage of the bill to intervene in the controversial matter that has arisen as a result of what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> nor indeed do i want to make any comments at this stage on the contents of the bill because most of what one wanted to say has been said on several occasions during the course of the bills passage <e>", "<cs> the council on tribunals considered this matter with very great care and issued the special report which i know that most members of the committee have seen <e> <s> it is only the second time in the history of the council that it has issued a special report and the first occasion concerned a largely internal matter <e> <s> i do not propose to read very much of the report to the committee but i do not think i can better end my observations than by reading the concluding observation that the council made in paragraph and asking the committee to agree with it <e> <s> the council said <e>", "<cs> i rise with reluctance in order to wind up this discussion <e> <s> the reluctance stems primarily from the fact that the noble and learned lord lord scarman was going to undertake this task <e> <s> unhappily he has been detained by very urgent personal reasons and he asks me to present his apologies to members of the committee <e>", "<cs> the answer is no i cannot any more than i can give any estimate of what will happen under the new proceedings <e> <s> all i am venturing to suggest is that we have no grounds for thinking that one will be any better than the other that is all <e>", "<cs> i thought that in her closing comments the noble baroness made certain observations about the membership of tribunals to which they will not take kindly when they read in <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble baroness a question so as to make sure that i have understood correctly what she has just said about the social fund <e> <s> does it imply that a responsibly budgeted social fund which she has been indicating will be the case would not be in any fundamental conflict with a responsibly operated appeal system <e>", "<cs> could the noble baroness give us a simple example of a set of circumstances in which there is never the possibility that the person or body might wholly or partly meet the payment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount remind us how many extra officers the commissioner asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the issue that of whether the failure of a public library to make available certain national newspapers is a breach of its duty to provide a comprehensive library service <e> <s> is that not an issue on which legal advice could have been taken many weeks ago and so should have been forthcoming by now <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with a sense of nostalgia to speak on this matter because this was the principal act on which i made my maiden speech many years ago <e>", "<cs> depite the extraordinarily wide nature of the clause as drafted i shall make a speech that consists of only one sentence <e> <s> a man and his wife are walking along the street they have an argument one of them uses an expression which is abusive to the other intending it to be abusive and the other is momentarily distressed <e> <s> do members of the committee appreciate that that would then be a criminal offence under the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement refers to the wide discrepancies that occur between one area and another <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the government regard this as being totally undesirable <e> <s> am i also right in calculating that the great majority of those discrepancies arise as between the decisions of adjudication officers and not as between decisions of various independent review tribunals <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount the leader of the house perfectly properly and quite understandably saw fit in nominally introducing amendment nos <e> <s> and to range over a somewhat wider field i know that he will extend to me for a moment the same courtesy that he has extended to the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i want only to make one or two comments at this stage <e> <s> i do not wish to become involved in the details of matters that will conic up shortly in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps your lordships will allow me five sentences only <e> <s> first as to the discretionary side of the benefits payable from the social fund the fact is that before the ssats administered a discretionary system and since they have been administering a system which often includes interpreting words such as reasonable and they have no problems with it <e> <s> it gives satisfaction to the great british public even if it may not give entire satisfaction to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it that undecided although the matter is at present it is perfectly possible that under the governments system there may be an oral hearing before the social fund inspector <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be miles away <e> <s> can the noble baroness help us as to who will pay for that <e> <s> finally as my last observation and as a small footnote on this matter but it does indicate the haste with which these matters have been entered into over the last day or so i ask your lordships to look at the provisions for the establishment of the social fund commissioner <e> <s> your lordships will see that the bill will now provide that the secretary of state may appoint the commissioner <e> <s> there is no provision anywhere for him to remove the commissioner <e> <s> no doubt this time next year we shall be having a social security amendment bill before us <e> <s> i invite your lordships to stand firm on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that those noble lords who have been taking part in this very interesting discussion on clause of the bill will forgive me if i do not follow them and if i go back to clause to deal with the point of principle that appears to arise on that clause <e> <s> as your lordships know that clause applies the food legislation to health authorities and health services by removing crown immunity <e> <s> in other words it deals so far as hospitals are concerned with kitchens and catering <e> <s> i welcome the removal of crown immunity for the reasons so admirably set out by the noble lord lord ennals and i have no doubt that all your lordships will welcome it too <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider positively encouraging employers to consider on-site screening facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what conditions are in existence at the moment which make the present time wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will now think that it is up to feasibility to return to the debate on the gracious speech <e> <s> i follow with pleasure the observations of the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones first in saying how much i look forward to the maiden speech of my noble and very old friend lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i follow him secondly in devoting most of my attention as he did to the profound questions of law and order that face us at this time and the issue of whether the criminal justice bill will contribute materially and if so in what direction to the resolution of those questions <e> <s> i agree with the noble earl lord caithness and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that the criminal justice bill is certainly the most important feature of the new parliament apart perhaps from the likely date of dissolution <e>", "<cs> my lords the affairs of guinness are very natuarally and properly a matter of considerable public discussion at the moment <e> <s> they are a matter of very lengthy investigation in the press and it is not entirely surprising that there are members of political parties who think that there may be in some way some electoral advantage to be gained out of discussing them in considerable detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i do of course declare an interest as chairman of bupa which is an organisation that insures some million people which overall manages some private hospitals and screens medically through its centres something like patients a year <e> <s> i say that not in any way as a boast nor as an advertisement but simply so that your lordships can get some idea of the size of the private sector as compared to the size of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down if i said that those who are medically insured never use the nhs that would have been manifestly wrong and i certainly had no intention of saying any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earl read a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recognise that in deciding where to station skiing facilities the need for balance is extremely important <e> <s> also does he appreciate that no facilities are likely to be sucessful in a resort called lurchers crag <e>", "<cs> my lords does the amount of reported crime necessarily involve any increase in the amount of crime committed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a convention of your lordships house that a maiden speaker is congratulated only by the speaker immediately following him <e> <s> the fact that that convention has been so widely breached this afternoon and evening is the simplest possible tribute to the impressive contribution of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in many parts of the country the addresses are also never provided <e>", "<cs> i wish simply to comment that the solidarity to which the minister referred is the solidarity not only of the alliance who originated the amendment and the labour party who support it but apparently of the government as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we all thought that at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that within the past half hour for all anybody in the committee may know including the minister we may well have repealed both magna carta and the bill of rights <e> <s> it has been a half hour of almost total gibberish in the course of which and this is not really such a laughing matter a whole series of starred amendments of which no one had any notice until this morning when the marshalled list was issued have been passed through this chamber without a word of explanation or comment <e> <s> i suspect that none of us had any idea of the implication of the detail of what it is we have passed <e> <s> that strengthens my sense of unease about the whole of the proceedings this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords while congratulating everybody in all directions might i ask the noble earl whether the effect of his original reply as regards my own application which has now been lying in petty france for some two months is that he is undertaking that my passport will be issued by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it sad that the noble and learned lord whose accession to the woolsack has been so very widely welcomed should find himself constrained as his first substantive contribution to your lordships house to make a proposal to whittle away the right of jury trial <e> <s> it is sad because those of us who know the noble and learned lord know how both at the bar and in his distinguished career since he ceased to practice at the bar he has always been a stalwart supporter of the principle of jury trial <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made a second reading speech on this bill <e> <s> it is enshrined for posterity in the columns of <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i follow with hesitation as always the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice <e> <s> if i disagree with some of his conclusions and some of his arguments i hope he will at least agree with me when i make one remark that is perhaps not self-evident as a truth <e> <s> it is wrong to believe that there is such a thing as a correct sentence for each criminal offence <e> <s> it does not exist <e> <s> it is not only as has been said that every defendant differs from every other defendant <e> <s> he differs in his mental or physical capacity in his criminal record in the temptations to which he was exposed or in his upbringing innumerable matters of that sort <e>", "<cs> i should be grateful if perhaps on another occasion the noble and learned lord would give me the details <e> <s> perhaps i may give just one or two illustrations of the points i am making <e> <s> not very long ago a young man at a football match punched somebody and i think also committed an offence with a knife <e> <s> for the offence with the knife he was very properly sentenced to years imprisonment for the offence of punching somebody he was sentenced to life imprisonment <e> <s> the popular press said judge slams football hooliganism <e> <s> it was only the legal profession that realised that this case had gone absolutely berserk and in due course the noble and learned lord the lord chief justice was able to put that matter right on appeal <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has anticipated with some accuracy what i was about to say <e> <s> i was going to suggest eventually at the end of my observations that when we come to deal with sentence and with newspaper hysteria one of the problems is in fact the existence of those very organisations to which the noble baroness is referring which seem to think that every case of rape has to be dealt with by or years imprisonment <e> <s> they are quite incapable of distinguishing which cases should receive a long medium or short sentence or perhaps even no prison sentence at all <e>", "<cs> may i simply say on behalf of my colleagues on these benches that we welcome the proposals that the offences set out in clauses and be made summary offences <e>", "<cs> i wish to say at once that i am full of admiration for the work that magistrates do <e> <s> they try cases with great skill competence courtesy and common sense <e> <s> nothing that i say in opposing the amendment is intended to detract from that in any way <e>", "<cs> no but he may be nine months awaiting trial <e> <s> the practical problem is this and members of the committee who have been justices will confirm it <e> <s> in many parts of the country justices sit either in the mornings or afternoons <e> <s> in some parts of the country they sit for one whole day each week or perhaps one whole day a fortnight <e> <s> going to tribunals of that sort and saying i have here a case which is quite complicated it is true that the amount involved is only <e> <s> i want a fixture where the same three justices can sit together on two or three consecutive days to try the case <e> <s> that request would be quite impossible to meet and it would put an even greater burden upon the justices than there is at the moment <e> <s> i venture to suggest that both on principle and on practical grounds this is a wholly impracticable amendment <e>", "<cs> when the moment arrives when it begins to look as though my noble friend lord hutchinson is in agreement with the noble and learned lords lord ackner and lord roskill perhaps the time has come to put the question fairly hastily <e> <s> i would not want to defer that issue for more than a moment <e>", "<cs> we on these benches also reject these proposals <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i confess myself in some doubt as to whether if the power were given to a court compulsorily to castrate an offender that would be entirely consistent with the right to silence <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> this is a consequential amendment <e> <s> it is the amendment which sets up the machinery by which there is to be implemented the clause passed by the committee against my advice giving the prosecution the right of appeal against lenient or over-lenient sentences <e>", "<cs> will the minister be good enough to consider taking the advice of the law lords on this matter before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> it is extremely unfortunate that so far on every occasion that we have discussed this bill when there has been a proposal that might increase the likelihood of conviction the law lords have been present and expressed themselves in force and strength but when we finally reach the stage of what happens if there is

hope that he is being rapidly restored to the best of health <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in respect of clause <e> <s> as i understand the matter this clause was not in the original bill when it was first produced many months ago <e> <s> i then tabled an amendment to that bill which included this clause now clause and which also included amendment no <e> <s> with which we shall shortly deal <e> <s> i therefore desire to claim the credit for clause as it now stands because it follows the wording of the amendment that i tabled originally <e> <s> i do so not in order to obtain credit but to establish my credentials when i move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> when i have recovered from my surprise i shall say to the minister that i am most grateful for his remarks <e> <s> i accept his offer most gratefully and shall be happy to co-operate in any way that i can <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those observations <e> <s> i make it clear that these are not amendments in any event that i would seek to press <e> <s> they are suggestions put forward in case they appear to be acceptable to the government as a modest means of shortening some of our complex trial procedures <e> <s> i am happy to ask leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the last thing that i want to do is to be responsible in any way for any proposal that might increase the number of people serving any sort of custodial sentence <e> <s> if that were to be the effect i should be deeply perturbed <e> <s> i suspect it may be that the figures given by the minister are an indication that the principle of suspended sentences is sometimes neither understood by those who are <e>", "<cs> my lords as this amendment is being moved i wish to say a few brief words in support of what my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington said <e> <s> it is simply this <e> <s> i believe that any judge who has had any experience on the bench any experience at the bar or any experience as a parent will inevitably and invariably want to warn the jury in any case in which there is a child giving evidence of the possible dangers involved <e> <s> i feel that very strongly and i know that my noble friend does too <e> <s> clearly the noble and learned lord lord denning feels the same <e> <s> in those circumstances if the noble earl feels that he must move the amendment at this stage we will really have no alternative but to divide the house against him <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course i will <e> <s> i am obliged to the noble earl for what he said <e> <s> i was concerned not so much with the merits of the affirmative procedure as against the negative procedure as with the possibilities of proceeding by way of draft which is amendable in practice because the minister was able to listen to the debate before he put the order into its final terms <e> <s> with those observations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience is much less than that of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> however perhaps it has the slight compensating factor of being rather more recent <e> <s> i should like to dissociate myself entirely from the view of trial by jury which has just been put forward <e> <s> i believe that it flies in the teeth of the evidence <e> <s> i believe the evidence is perfectly clear that of every cases which are tried by a jury selected at random but presided over by an experienced judge who has not been selected at random cases would have exactly the same result if they had been tried by a stipendiary magistrate or by lay justices <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord caithness has recognised the weight of the argument in this case and has indicated significant concessions <e> <s> it is absolutely right that i should say that with regard to the merits of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> the noble earl has said that he would like to reflect upon the matter between now and the final stage of this bill <e> <s> i take the view that it would be churlish of me in the circumstances not to go along with the spirit of what the noble earl has said and to enable him to reflect upon this matter between now and the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is appropriate for the noble earl to reflect on amendment no <e> <s> perhaps it is equally appropriate for me to reflect on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should have said that i was speaking at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> which would be consequential my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may point this out quickly the argument put forward by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has already been abandoned by the government themselves at an earlier stage of this bill <e> <s> the government themselves have introduced the machinery for judicial review <e> <s> that implies does it not <e> <s> that it is just conceivably possible that every now and again the home secretary may make an error <e> <s> all this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was proposing to speak to that amendment separately <e> <s> i have not yet moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington is as grateful to the minister as i am for what he has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i look forward to debating the issue again in the early days of next august <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that on the continent random testing is <e>", "<cs> i have no interest to declare but perhaps i may simply make two very short comments on the argument put forward by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> the first is that as the gap grows if it grows between legal aid fees and private fees it is quite inevitable quite natural and quite understandable that some members of the bar will cease to do legal aid work <e> <s> it is quite inevitable that they will be the more competent and the more successful members of the bar <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a comment in support of the amendment <e> <s> there are many tribunals where the person who presides has such legal experience that to some extent he is able to compensate for the fact that one of the parties is not legally represented <e> <s> that does not necessarily arise in coroners courts because the coroner is often a person of limited legal experience although he may have substantial medical experience <e> <s> it would assist the fairness of proceedings in that particular tribunal if there was legal representation of both sides <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and i do so with a modest knowledge of the topic <e> <s> i served for some six years on the council on tribunals which not only had to examine the workings of all the tribunals but individual members spent a great deal of time visiting individual tribunals of all kinds in all parts of the country <e> <s> one saw a great many of the proceedings that we are now discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that it is clear from the statement which he has repeated that evidence has been found that some officers of the royal ulster constabulary have committed criminal offences in the way of attempting to pervert the course of justice or matters of that nature <e> <s> in that case does he agree that it would not be practicable to leave the matter there <e> <s> those individuals may well find themselves in future giving evidence as witnesses for the crown in serious cases in northern ireland <e> <s> is it fair to them to leave them in a position in which the substance of the allegations has not been tested independently <e> <s> indeed is it fair to the reputation of the courts in northern ireland <e> <s> is there not much to be said for the proposal of my noble friend lord harris of greenwich that in some way or another an attempt must be made to resolve these allegations <e>", "<cs> my lords my colleagues on these benches would also like me to welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> i must make it clear that i have no interest to declare <e> <s> i mention that fact simply because the last time i made a similar observation during the bills progress it was inadvertently transposed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord ferrers for repeating the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may say at once that at this stage there can certainly be no question of this matter being in any way a party political issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl be kind enough to answer the first query that i raised about the date when the government first heard of the unsubstantiated allegations <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls will forgive me but is it not the normal practice in your lordships house that on report stage debate should not break out after the spokesman for the government has made his reply to a particular amendment and that the only remaining contribution should normally be on behalf of the movers of the amendment as to the course which is then recommended <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the attendance in your lordships house is at this moment so emaciated that i might be allowed to make a few observations that might be thought to be marginally relevant and escape censure in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords was the figure which the minister gave in his answer to the question for the number of holidays abroad or for the number of visits abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that the question of a link may be a matter of acute controversy but that the question of the distastefulness of programmes of this kind to many people is not a matter of controversy and that there is a strong case for suitable warnings being given from that point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords might i support the amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i do so on the grounds as he has indicated that if there is to be any extension of legal assistance to cover people appearing before any tribunals then the social security commissioners are clearly the first tribunal that should be borne in mind for a possible extension as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor himself said on a previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that questions of responsibility of members of a crowd for what other members of that crowd may do give rise to matters of extremely complex law <e> <s> it would therefore be better not to intervene as regards the evidence but to put forward an appeal based entirely on humanitarian grounds <e> <s> in those circumstances may we on these benches support what has been said by the minister and put forward the general proposition that it would be uncivilised to hang six people years after an event for a matter in which on any showing they did not play a major part <e> <s> does the minister recall that on many occasions his right honourable friend the prime minister has said that she would wish to embark upon a constructive dialogue with the president of south africa <e> <s> might this not be a useful starting point <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask another very simple question <e> <s> does the noble earl regard the right of an ec national to live in this country together with his wife and children as being in principle a good or a bad thing <e>", "<cs> my lords if the weapons were not taken on board in bangkok will the minister remind us of the other possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords having borrowed a copy of the statement from my noble friend lady seear may i ask the minister a question in regard to the paragraph at the bottom of page <e> <s> does that mean that the channels previously reserved for mod use have been reserved except in the area of central london or does it mean that in future the channels will be made available except in the area of central london <e>", "<cs> will the minister please help me <e> <s> i am sure that i have missed this point in the bill <e> <s> is there a definition of person prescribing a minimum age or does the clause apply to a child of four five six or whatever it may be who is trying to get into a ground <e>", "<cs> i leave aside the fact that some very good football is played in outer mongolia <e> <s> i shall revert to the perfectly clear position and i hesitate to put myself forward as an authority as has been suggested <e> <s> however under the first three lines of clause it is perfectly clear that <e>", "<cs> that means that this measure is merely aimed at senile hooligans <e>", "<cs> leaving aside the fact that the official statistics might not disclose the proportion of male and female offenders at football grounds does the ministers department have a single press cutting to show a single conviction of a single woman for a single crime of violence at a single football match <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might also return to first principles i do mean first principles and not first prejudices and put forward an elementary proposition which i have no doubt will have the support of everyone in your lordships house that is that it is in the public interest it is of crucial importance to our society that there should be a core of people able and willing to stand up for the ordinary citizen for the little man in his constant battles against the big battalions and the power the size and the potential oppression than can be represented by the activities of government by the activities of state departments such as the home office from which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale hails and the activities of the police local authorities nationalised industries big business or the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no way of arguing that that is not correct if the green paper means what it says <e> <s> that is a situation which totally misunderstands the role of prosecuting counsel of the prosecutor in this country <e> <s> i talk about this country i am not interested in arguments about what goes on in scotland outer mongolia or anywhere else <e> <s> we are concerned only with this countrys traditions <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is feasible it certainly would be likely it certainly would not be <e> <s> it would not be likely because it would be regarded as being cheaper for the crown prosecution service to provide its own counsel <e> <s> secondly it will not be feasible in the long run because as i shall endeavour to show the members of the bar with the necessary experience will cease to exist <e> <s> they will not be there to be instructed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has anticipated my next point in words more effective than i can use <e> <s> all i was going to say was that once you get a corps of people concerned solely with prosecuting as civil servants then all that is left for the rest of the bar is defence <e> <s> there will be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not consider making some comment when the time is right <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears to me highly desirable that as chairman of bupa and after listening to the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne i should declare an interest in this matter <e> <s> i make it clear that my position as chairman is one that i hold with pride <e> <s> i view with pride the fact that among the million people that bupa covers we can count the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne as a subscriber <e> <s> however i must say that we have other subscribers who occasionally bestow rather more praise upon us than the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords all i am saying is that where the needs cannot be satisfied by the state it is in the public interest that there should be an increase in the amount of resources devoted to the health care of the community <e> <s> if that volume of resources cannot be forthcoming from the national health service alone it is very much in the interests not only of the nhs itself but of the community as a whole that it should be supplemented by every possible source <e> <s> it seems to me self-evident that if the private sector which is very small it only covers some million people at present can be encouraged to grow it is bound to reduce to some extent the number of people who are dependent on the national health service <e> <s> that is self-evident <e> <s> if that can be done it is equally self evident that the limited amount of resources necessarily available for the nhs can be applied to looking after a rather smaller number of people than would otherwise be the case <e> <s> there is bound to be treatment available to them in those circumstances which is not available at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will agree that those to whom he is referring when they use the private sector are also paying their taxes for the national health service <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one brief observation in support of my noble friend lord hutchinson <e> <s> it is quite right and natural that emphasis should be placed upon the fact that great hardship can be caused to a defendant if his application for bail is wrongly refused <e> <s> equally as my noble friend has mentioned there is a matter of great significance to the community involved here because there have been cases many of which will occur to the minds of members of the committee where defendants who have applied for bail have been released on bail and have committed serious offences while on bail <e> <s> the only inference i draw from those two facts is that the judge who is trying the issue is entitled to all the help he can get from both sides <e> <s> that means in this case the help of professionally qualified people to assist him in coming to what is often a difficult conclusion <e>", "<cs> is not the answer to the noble lord lord boardman that one simply cannot provide for everything in this world <e> <s> it is important in every case that the prosecutor should be a person of independent mind <e> <s> it is even more important in cases tried on indictment because they are of even more importance to the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i too may indicate a distinct lack of enthusiasm for the new clause proposed by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> i fully understand his desire to re-enact in some form or another the gist of section of the supreme court act <e> <s> but as i am sure the noble and learned lord will realise we are in a very sensitive area at this particular moment <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the wording of the proposed new clause might have been rather more sensitively drafted <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down and before he replies to my noble friend lord hutchinson of lullington will he consider whether it might be more helpful to the house if he were to withdraw the amendment at this stage upon the indication that it will come back next time in an amended form <e> <s> i am sure that many of us who have been speaking in this debate would indicate that we would be prepared to accept such an amendment at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that during the past few months the two main routes through the city of london to this house that is to say the embankment and the strand have both been under substantial repair simultaneously <e> <s> may not that have been a contributory factor in the many defeats of the government during that period <e>"]
