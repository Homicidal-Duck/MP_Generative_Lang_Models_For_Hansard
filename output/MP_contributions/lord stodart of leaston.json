["<cs> my lords many fantasies have swung before my eyes in my life but never one that i who am the simplest of simple scottish farmers should address your lordships for the first time immediately after three of the most eminent advocates if i may use a scottish connotation in the land <e> <s> i hope it is not presumptious of me to address your lordships on what is the very first day of what is fundamentally perhaps the most important debate in the session and on virtually the first day of the session itself <e> <s> however i am by so doing enabled to cling on to a discipline which i imposed on myself many years ago which was to say only a few words on a subject about which i happen to have some knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords soon after i was privileged to join your lordships house one of your number warned me to look out for the unexpected <e> <s> i have certainly discovered it today <e> <s> it is rare for two farmers to agree certainly not one who farms in a small way and one like the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> frequently i like a hungry sheep have looked upwards hoping to be fed or to drink and have rarely received satisfaction <e> <s> but i agree with the noble lord when he says that this is not the easiest of bills on which to make a second reading speech <e> <s> i suspect that there are many questions which will arise in committee and therefore i propose to concentrate on only two matters which i think are principal matters <e>", "<cs> i drew the attention of your lordships to this subject on second reading <e> <s> it gave rise to an animated discussion when we examined it in our committee on the reform of local government and i think it was the only issue on which the two tiers retreated to their opposite corners and took up extremely vigorous stances <e> <s> the districts do the licensing at the moment and that was the starting point <e> <s> but said the regions taxis are now virtually part of the public transport system <e> <s> the police are interested in the licensing of taxis and their stands and we should get greater uniformity of fares if it were done through the regions <e> <s> the consultative paper mentions the question of the uniformity of fares a matter which concerned us slightly was what <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend one small question relating to subsection of clause <e> <s> this deals with the point raised by my noble friend lord selkirk <e> <s> the point i want to raise is that i think there is an amendment to section of the local government act which is down for consideration in connection with a bill which has just started its progress in another place <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether the reference to the local government scotland act here would take note of the amendment to that if it were carried <e>", "<cs> i believe this is the first time in some years that i have found myself in agreement with the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> it is a unique occasion and i am wondering what celebration we might have afterwards <e> <s> as soon as i saw <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend can clarify something for me and say whether or not this applies to what one might call the scrap merchant who pays a visit to farms probably every summer <e> <s> the definition describes him as going from house to house and no doubt that covers going from farm building to farm building <e> <s> i am bound to say that i view with a certain amount of gloom the fact that according to clause i presumably have to issue this scrap merchant with an invoice for the scrap i provide him with and whether or not i shall be liable for the vat i do not know <e> <s> it does seem to me to be carrying ones bookwork to rather gloomy extremes <e> <s> i need hardly say that it is the practice for the scrap dealer to pay in cash <e> <s> i have never known cheques <e>", "<cs> i should like to apologise for having been carried away by the fluency of the noble earl lord selkirk and making a point slightly in advance of where we were in the bill <e> <s> however looking at clause it seems to me that we are being quite unrealistic in suggesting that an invoice should be made out by a farmer to a scrap merchant for various items of metal that are picked up over what used to be known as the stack yard showing the weight and the description of the metal <e> <s> where is one to weigh it if there is no weighing machine on the farm <e> <s> and there are very few farms which do have wieghing machines certainly in the upland areas <e> <s> i am sorry to be nit-picking about this but i am bound to say to my noble friend that i find this particular subsection totally unrealistic <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but surely it must be the case that if an itinerant metal dealer is to retain an invoice it is the farmer who must give him the invoice because it is the farmer who is making the sale <e> <s> therefore all that i am saying is that i do not think that it is realistic that an invoice could be made out for things which it would be remarkably difficult to describe <e> <s> junk is just loaded on to the lorry <e>", "<cs> i think there is just one other point <e> <s> if a public place means what is stated <e>", "<cs> i would find it inconsistent if i did not say that i agree with the amendment which has been put down <e> <s> the report which has been referred to examined the whole lighting set-up which is a network of complexities made no easier by the fact that some powers are mandatory while others are permissive <e> <s> we dealt with the question of the lighting of highways of streets of common stairs and of private developments and recommended very strongly that the responsibility should be put in the hands of one authority instead of two namely the region in order to do away with each local authority having an electrical department which we thought was not altogether necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall when i first had the honour of addressing your lordships house telling your lordships why an episode in my youth had caused me to make a vow to speak only on subjects with which i was fairly well acquainted <e> <s> therefore as all other noble lords have said i am most grateful to the noble baroness for allowing us to have this debate <e> <s> noble lords will i am sure forgive me if i like one or two others concentrate on agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords may just make the point that in the report which bears my name we took a certain amount of interest in this <e> <s> in fact if i may say so taxi licensing was a subject that raised more fury rather to my surpise than did any other when the regions went back into their corners and the districts into theirs <e> <s> that is by the way <e> <s> all that we did feel was of immense importance was that there should be a pretty strong agreement about taxi journeys that crossed district boundaries and that there should be no chance of a racket being used for returning the one way unless of course factors such as extraordinary late hours were involved <e> <s> i would hope that my noble friend could say that there would be consultation between the contiguous districts with regard to the fares one way and the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say how surprised if not stunned i was to see that a suggestion of a simple person like myself had commended itself to my sophisticated noble friends on the front bench and i am most grateful to them <e>", "<cs> i regret that transport difficulties delayed my getting here to listen to the debate on this matter in committee on nd february <e> <s> it was and still is i think universally accepted that the law with regard to processions at this moment is highly confused and for the first time in his life i suspect that the noble lord lord ross seemed to be guilty of a minimal degree of confusion by saying in one column that the stodart committee had recommended that the regions should be responsible and in the next column saying that the districts should he responsible <e> <s> i am sure that it must have been a misprint <e>", "<cs> my lords i like many others so far must declare an interest <e> <s> i am a farmer and i have no hesitation about saying that i am thus biased heavily though i think not quite so heavily as the noble lord lord mackie of benshie in favour of food producers <e> <s> but i do congratulate those who have <e>", "<cs> you jolly well buy it <e> <s> this is why while i think that the fmf is wrong to ask for no increase i believe that the nfu goes too far <e> <s> i think we have to share in the inflationary problems of others and i am afraid disagreeing with the committee in this that i think the per cent <e> <s> suggested by the commission is not far wrong provided that there is as i am certain there will continue to be an increase in productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most appreciative of the kind remarks made about the report by the noble lords lord ross and lord mackie <e> <s> i find your lordships house a most agreeable place as i have said before <e> <s> in the course of years in another place i cannot recall the compliments that have been flowing in my direction from lord ross <e> <s> the mellowing atmosphere of this chamber is indeed considerable <e>", "<cs> my lords any merit in the committees report was due entirely to the willingness indeed i would say the determination of people of wide-ranging views to agree on matters which were and were generally considered to be of importance to local government in scotland <e> <s> therefore i want to retain the harmony which i experienced and enjoyed by dealing in what i have to say with only parts ii and iii of the bill <e>", "<cs> although this matter was not one with which the committee over which i presided was concerned we did a section on social work generally this particular aspect of it was not within our remit <e> <s> nevertheless while i support what my noble friend lady elliot said my impression and i think hers is that what the minister will say in relation to amendment no <e> <s> will cover the points envisaged in amendment no <e>", "<cs> may i ask one point by way of clarification on clause <e> <s> the point that confuses me slightly is that clause refers back to section of the act <e> <s> it substitutes the words an islands or district council for the words a local authority with regard to tourism <e> <s> referring <e>", "<cs> i rise with some trepidation <e> <s> i most willingly agree with my noble friend lord mottistone that this is a question of balance and delicate balance <e> <s> considerable representations of a very formidable nature have obviously been made in recent days <e> <s> for some reason or another very few have been sent to me <e> <s> perhaps those who have <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is a good thing that we are having this protracted discussion because as the noble lord lord ross has said it at least gives this noble house a clear picture of how the scottish grand committee has always conducted itself <e> <s> i am quite certain that the noble lord lord ross will think of an old friend of ours one mr willis who must be thinking of how he would have spoken for at least two hours in the scottish grand committee on this particular subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am not going to embarrass my noble friend for all i know he might propose to accept the amendment <e> <s> i am not as certain that the amendment is as meaningless or as ineffective as noble lords opposite have suggested <e> <s> clearly until the passing of the bill the function relating to leisure and recreation is a concurrent one for which both regions and districts have responsibility <e> <s> i certainly do not propose to go to the stake in favour of the recommendations made in the report of my committee but undoubtedly the burden of the report is that the responsibility or if i may adopt the term used by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney the obligation for leisure and recreation matters should pass to the district <e>", "<cs> my lords again i rise with some trepidation <e> <s> your lordships were extremely patient with me at the committee stage <e> <s> i shall not detain your lordships long because i am well aware that i must not be guilty of repeating what i said at committee stage <e> <s> all i would say about what i said then in the light of the remarks made by my noble friends about evidence that has come out since the report is that we have heard nothing said during the committee stage nor have i read of it as having been said in the other place of which we were not fully aware when we wrote our report in which we came to a unanimous conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friend may be correct without my going through all the papers <e> <s> we saw no point in taking oral evidence as i said on committee stage from those who had submitted excellent papers in writing <e> <s> i think that is a matter of practical common sense <e> <s> but what i do repeat whether or not my noble friend is right is that nothing he has said and nothing that has been said by the noble lord lord campbell of croy or the noble lord lord drumalbyn has told me anything that my committee or i did not already know <e> <s> i repeat that it came to a unanimous conclusion and on it there sat members of regional councils and the head of the leading supermarket chain in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend venture an opinion as to whether the timber which used to go from my farm to the pulp mill at fort william but which now goes to grangemouth is exported to scandinavia and is then returned to britain as pulp is regarded as an import as a finished product or as homegrown <e>", "<cs> my lords i have known my noble friend lord polwarth as a near neighbour for a very long time from about the period in which i suppose i had my first taste for the arts when i made a considerable hit at school by playing the queen of the fairies in iolanthe the dear dim days beyond recall <e> <s> i am of course as every noble lord has already said grateful to my noble friend for raising this subject <e> <s> i should also like to voice my congratulations to my noble friend lord marley for his very interesting and illuminating contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the custom in another place as it is in your lordships house for the speakers who follow a maiden speaker to compliment him and say that the house would join unanimously in hoping that the maiden speaker would be heard on many occasions in the future <e> <s> i have known one or two of my former colleagues in another place say privately that they rather wish they had not uttered those words of hope that the new member would be heard on many occasions thereafter <e> <s> but on this occasion i will say only that the keen anticipation that was expressed about the maiden speech of the noble lord lord northbourne has been succeeded by a feeling of all-round satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i can imagine no more suitable and appropriate day for my noble friend lord kinnoull to have raised this particular subject <e> <s> i dare say that it may well have been fortuitous but in view of what we are going to hear from my noble friend within a matter off moments i think that the whole house must be deeply grateful that we are holding this debate on this particular day <e> <s> i listened to him with very deep appreciation when he referred to the decline in the number of trawlers of the deep sea fleet <e> <s> it is to my mind nothing short of tragedy to one who visited hull years ago to see the harbour full of trawlers ready to go to sea to go and see what there is at hull today <e>", "<cs> i can see no possible reason for not supporting the principle of the amendment though as the noble lord lord melchett suggested the wording may not be entirely perfect <e> <s> i also support the suggestion that when the point at issue comes to be decided there is a case for bringing in the ministry of agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords in confirming what my noble friend lord glenkinglas has said about the difficulties facing distilleries on the mainland may i ask whether if it is correct that the cause of the difficulties is owing to lack of demand for whisky my noble friend is able to say how demand can conceivably be stimulated by putting up the price <e> <s> considering that his right honourable friend was flexible enough to exclude pipe tobacco from his tobacco allowance would it not have been possible to exclude whisky from the duty on spirits <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady elliot remarked at the beginning of her speech the subject of agricultural holdings and particularly the tenure of them has for as long as i can remember been an extremely contentious subject in scotland <e> <s> just mention security of tenure to me on a moonlit night and i can hear the sound of hooves and a gentleman whom <e> <s> i suspect some noble lords may remember by name captain arthur mcdougall of blythe galloping across lauderdale shouting imprecations at every landlord in sight with the great geniality for which he was known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in the happy position of quite properly being enabled to second the plaudits which my noble friend lord nugent of guildford gave to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe <e> <s> as someone has already said no more suitable subject could have suggested itself to one of his great experience <e> <s> he will understand what i mean when i say that one of the great things in vogue today in all sorts of aspects is nostalgia <e> <s> the music shops and the book shops are full of it and my nostalgia goes back to a period which he has mentioned of years ago when he and i used to see a great deal of each other in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be brief for a reason which will enable the house to see that i cannot but agree with the comments made by the noble lord lord hughes about the timing of this debate <e> <s> owing to an engagement that has long been made i have already had to ask the indulgence of my noble friend because i may not be present to hear his reply <e> <s> i shall also i am afraid have to say that to the noble lord lord ross and also possibly to others of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> may i make one very short point about the scottish situation which has been mentioned <e> <s> the two pieces of legislation differ in one very substantial way and my belief is that this bill which we are now discussing will very largely succeed as a result of the implementation of clause <e> <s> clause does not feature in the scottish legislation and therefore it seems to me that there are likely to be more farms coming on the market in england and wales than there will be in scotland <e> <s> more landlords in england and wales will as my noble friend has just said be prepared to put their heads on the chopping block <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston was kind enough to refer to some of the things i said on second reading <e> <s> to make it quite clear although i quoted i qualified the quotations by saying that they were not my views <e> <s> on the clause we are now discussing i said on second reading that to me clause is entirely basic within this bill with a view to getting more tenancies on to the market <e>", "<cs> my lords may i in my turn add my warm congratulations on two fronts first to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove who has sat glaring across at me in another place for many years but who has as is normal been a great friend of mine personally outside the chamber <e> <s> in congratulating him on his maiden speech i would say that many years ago and he touched on this himself tourism might not have been regarded as the most appropriate subject for someone living in the city of glasgow <e> <s> i do not think that anyone who lives in scotland today can fail to be impressed by the tremendous efforts that the district of glasgow as it is now officially called is making and the success i believe it will have in building itself up as a great tourist centre <e> <s> i should add as a former member of parliament for part of the city of edinburgh that edinburgh will have to watch its laurels <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ross quoted some words from the report which we submitted to my noble friend two years ago and i make no bones about saying as i said on second reading that i wish that the government were prepared to go a little further <e> <s> that is what the report said and that is what i wrote my name to <e> <s> i am bound to say that i think my noble friend the minister of state is labouring under a most unfortunate burden from the remarks that were made in another place when i believe that a statement was made and the minister made it emphatically clear that this would mean virtually nothing and would be of little importance to the scottish tourist board <e> <s> i think that that did an immense amount of harm <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble and learned friend will forgive me if i say that i support the amendment <e> <s> i remember when i had to look at bills after they had been drafted <e> <s> one looked at one or two words and wondered whether to put in a few more words to cover every possible exigency <e> <s> the advice <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this in connection with an smaller area namely lothian <e> <s> under this drafting it would be perfectly proper for the road authority for the region to advertise in the <e>", "<cs> speaking as the simplest of farmers and as the most elementary of laymen it seems to me that the noble lord lord hughes is talking extremely good sense <e> <s> if his amendment were accepted i could read no other meaning into what was required <e> <s> but needless to say if my noble and learned friend says that his wording is essential for the proper interpretation of law who am i to argue <e> <s> but i am bound to say that i should have thought the shorter wording made sense <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may put a point to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i apologise for my voice it has an affliction not uncommon at this time of the year <e> <s> i think the point i wish to raise does deal with the amendment which has been moved <e> <s> the clause as i undestand it deals with preventing snow from endangering pedestrians and vehicles on public roads <e> <s> because of the definition of a footway which i prefer to describe as a pavement this covers the endangering of pedestrians on the pavement <e> <s> in the committee which i chaired some two or three years ago we reported that a good deal of confusion had been expressed to us about the responsibility of keeping up public footpaths as opposed to footways <e> <s> to my mind a footpath is probably what the noble lord lord carmichael is describing as a pedestrian way which does not i have ascertained feature in the interpretation clause a footpath does but a pedestrian way does not <e>", "<cs> i wish to ask my noble and learned friend for clarification <e> <s> the heading of clause is <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must express my thanks to my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard for enabling us to discuss this subject <e> <s> i should also like to say that we have heard an astoundingly good maiden speech i should have thought it astounding however long he had been a member of this house from the noble earl lord dundee <e> <s> i envy profoundly his ability to speak apparently entirely without notes <e> <s> i saw that he had notes but i never saw him glance at them <e> <s> as the years go by i find that i have increasingly to consult my notes <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me i did not mean to imply that the cadzo brothers needed financial help from the board <e> <s> i merely wished to say that the board had latched on to some of the ideas which the cadzo brothers were propounding <e>", "<cs> it gives me genuine pain to have to question something that the noble lord lord john-mackie has just said because the committee may not be aware that for some years he and i if i may use the expression went steady as pairs in the house of commons in a system which is not used in this house <e> <s> but if i heard him aright i think i heard him just now say that he supported a licensing system <e> <s> well reading his speech on second reading i do see that in column of <e>", "<cs> my noble friend i think has said that an appeal would go to the county court <e> <s> can he tell me to which court in scotland he would send it <e>", "<cs> i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i express some surprise following upon the point made by my noble friend lord burton about the legislation applying to scotland <e> <s> it is not so long ago that in reply to other amendments my noble friend lord alport reeled off a considerable catalogue of bodies from the ramblers association to the countryside commission that had been consulted <e> <s> i am slightly surprised that he rather airily says in reply to my noble friend that he will incorporate at the next stage of the bill a measure that will include scotland <e> <s> has he consulted any organisations in scotland <e> <s> has he had any representations from the national farmers union of scotland <e> <s> i asked him this question at the beginning and i got no reply <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord drumalbyn who has just spoken has said much of what i wanted to point out and i shall not be repetitive <e> <s> however it is a fact that during the last five years two committees have been set up to look into certain aspects of local government <e> <s> modesty naturally prevents me from referring to one of them particularly as the noble lord lord grimond slightly deflated me by saying that neither of them had examined anything of any importance at all <e> <s> i hope i am not misquoting him but that was the impression i got <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> i should certainly say that though i think both those committees made useful suggestions and indeed your lordships house took it upon itself to support one of them not very long ago i would fully subscribe to the view that neither of the subjects inquired into be it the functions of local government in scotland or the particular problems of the islands is basically as important as looking into the rating system itself <e> <s> i am particularly moved to say that in view of what i think everybody knows which has been referred to today regarding the unfairness of the system asit applies in many cases in scotland <e> <s> that may be because undoubtedly it is because the law of scotland in many matters to do with land and inheritance is different from and in many cases better <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord lord ross of marnock go to the stake and contradict me if i say that my recollection is that in the scottish standing committee on several occasions either he or one of his ministers defended the words in the secretary of states opinion and insisted on them being left in legislation <e>", "<cs> i should like my noble friend to reassure me on one point <e> <s> my recollection of the other place is that a resolution of the kind referred to here is either negative or affirmative <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the discussion is limited to an hour and a half or can there be unlimited time <e> <s> if by any chance there were to be a discussion on six or seven different authorities i find it difficult to see how justice could be done to them in the course of minutes <e>", "<cs> i am not being in the least bit discourteous but i was addressing my question to my noble friend and i still would like him to tell me about the minutes <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise one point for clarification and i hope that the noble lord will forgive me if by any chance my thoughts were wandering when he moved this amendment <e> <s> there is reference to the local government scotland act and references are also made to section c b and d <e> <s> i have the local government scotland act in my hands and i find that section bears no reference whatever to the subject under discussion <e> <s> the rubric to section is <e>", "<cs> may i make one very small point and ask my noble friend for clarification <e> <s> this clause amends section of the act as has been mentioned which to my mind was a very clearly written section whereas the present one strikes me as being very much more complex <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly paraphrase the section <e> <s> it says that rating rebates will be granted to certain premises which fulfil certain purposes <e> <s> it defines the purposes whether the premises form residential accommodation people are being re-trained and welfare services are involved <e> <s> it says that the rebate will be given provided that the premises are used wholly for one of the purposes in the list or partly for one of the purposes in the list <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that an equivalent scheme applies to agriculture and that it has been operating for the last years with if i may say so considerable success <e> <s> is he also aware that the rate of defaults in the agricultural scheme has been infinitely lower than that in the industrial one <e> <s> would he not agree that perhaps the reason for this has been very much more efficient scrutiny of the farmers applications to the scheme by a very small staff <e>", "<cs> my lords my interest in this bill is focused on parts ii and iii <e> <s> therefore if i may i shall devote my few remarks to them <e> <s> as regards part ii i am bound to say that i view it as i dare say noble lords and my noble friend might appreciate with somewhat mixed feelings because throughout years ago i was heavily involved with consultations at the ministry of agriculture and in answering questions in another place about the dumping at sea bill <e> <s> the number and range of questions with which i was confronted showed the very great interest taken in the forthcoming legislation <e>", "<cs> far be it for me to nit pick on this and there is no need for me to confirm what my noble friend said because my recollection about land and sea is exactly what he has said but marine structure means <e>", "<cs> there is just one very small point <e> <s> i am sorry for raising another triviality but i have been searching the bill to see if there is any definition indicating which secretary of state it is <e> <s> there are several secretaries of state <e> <s> i think it is perfectly obvious that it is the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> on the other hand the fact that the name of the bill is the food and environment protection bill <e>", "<cs> might it still not be better to say secretary of state rather than the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i fear that my noble friend is going to have a hard task judging between two of his predecessors in his eminent office because i am afraid that i am going to disagree with my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> in my view something like this ought to go in as a preamble <e> <s> i am bound to say that it attracts me <e> <s> the reason i prefer it to amendment no <e> <s> is that amendment no <e> <s> is put forward as a new clause and i do not think that we want that <e> <s> however we do want a pointer to what the regulations are aimed at achieving and therefore i hope that my noble friend will feel able to accept something like this amendment be it with the commas colons and brackets removed <e> <s> those are matters which can be tidied up <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps the noble lord has in mind making a regulation against emptying out the contents of a spray container that is only a quarter full into a bottle that possibly does not get labelled <e> <s> i can easily recall about years ago when there were considerable discussions on this very subject with regard to paraguat <e> <s> there were then great calls for making it a criminal offence to do that very thing because there had been tragedies through children having picked up the bottles <e>", "<cs> listening to this debate i have the horrible fear i am sure it is not intended that a farmer will possibly require different sprayers for different chemicals <e> <s> that would virtually put spraying by the farmer or his men out of existence <e> <s> it would become totally uneconomic <e> <s> sprayers are <e>", "<cs> i have absolutely nothing against the keeping of records i think they are invaluable and necessary <e> <s> however as i have already said in the course of this debate i think that too much is being asked in this particular detail <e> <s> i do not know the set up of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i suspect that he has an army of private secretaries <e> <s> i do not have one and even if i did i see the instructions that are given by the firm which supplies me with the pesticides <e> <s> they write out on a sheet of paper what mixture should be put on each field how many points per acre and because the tank does five acres to the fill i therefore do some calculations and hand them to my foreman and say this is what you must put in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend accepts the fact that there is a fairly widespread disappointment at the withdrawal of the note might he not consider that legislation which was introduced years ago might not be totally relevant to present-day circumstances <e> <s> does he not regard it as slightly absurd that branches of scottish banks in london or elsewhere in england are allowed to accept scottish notes and give english ones in return but are not allowed to re-issue scottish notes <e> <s> people might want them because they are slightly cleaner than the english ones and made of better paper <e> <s> would he not finally agree that it is surely the philosophy of this government that if there exists a demand and somebody is ready to supply it that supplier should be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords may i encourage the noble lord opposite who asked if he could see a scottish banknote <e> <s> if it is of interest to him i may say that the last time that i showed scottish banknotes to an american i was able to get ten guineas from him in return <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment on which i feel sympathy for both my noble friend lord stanley and my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i may be wrong but i suspect that my noble friend the minister will find considerable difficulty no matter how great his powers of persuasion in getting the treasury to accept an undertaking of this kind <e> <s> if i am wrong and if my noble friend has secured the agreement of the treasury and intends to accept the amendment i say at once that he is a much cleverer and more persuasive minister of state than i was <e> <s> i had a case not unlike the one now being discussed <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a special plea to my noble friend and it relates to something which the noble lord lord ross of marnock has just said <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the name of lorimer <e> <s> sir robert lorimers middle name was stodart and i make the special plea that a cousin of mine was a famous architect and i therefore ask my noble friend to please think favourably about including the word architectural <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must thank the noble lord lord somers for giving me the opportunity not only of listening to but being able to take part in a discussion on a subject which has always been of interest to me <e> <s> i cannot truthfully say that i recall as i understand many of us can as a

misgivings about it <e> <s> the art of the draftsman is extremely obscure i have always found <e> <s> but having served in the scottish office i would suspect that with the enormous range of the functions of the secretary of state and no doubt my noble friend will correct me if i am wrong the reference to the application to scotland is probably defective <e> <s> if that is so it can easily be

my noble friend whether he is aware that there really is considerable confusion among those who are not lawyers who form the vast majority of the population not only of scotland but of the united kingdom on a very very complex case <e> <s> is it not perfectly proper that though a decision has been given by lord davidson the ordinary process of appeal to the inner house should be gone through

believe is a proposed per cent <e> <s> cut in the establishment of the agricultural research station which many people would say has done even more valuable work if that is possible than its counterpart in england <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether in the context of this admirable contribution by the government and by industry the government have made any calculation about whether food from britain will by exporting make a significant contribution to reducing the surpluses that are growing up at home <e>", "<cs> i am one of those people who have had no experience at all of fishing salmon <e> <s> the last occasion which i recall answering a question about salmon fisheries was years ago when in response i think to the noble lord lord ross of marnock i said that the government of the day were giving the most urgent consideration to the hunter report <e> <s> it has taken a certain amount of time for that consideration to mature <e> <s> all i would say as one who has admitted that he knows absolutely nothing about it is that i suspect that one would be told that lord burtons amendment is defective in its drafting <e> <s> i expect that that may well be so but i profoundly wish that clause as it stands was as lucid as lord burtons and i beg my noble friend lord gray of contin with his usual lucidity to tell us exactly what it means <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say one thing not having used my voice on this subject since the first stage of the committee <e> <s> i wish to congratulate my noble friend on what he has managed to achieve with this amendment <e> <s> i speak with some feeling in that some years ago the matter was under consideration and we found whenever one thought about salmon fishing and one was thinking of the salmon that were returning to the rivers on the east coast of scotland that the east coast fisheries or the north-east coast of england fisheries stood out like a sore thumb <e> <s> as i found to my cost if i may mix metaphors this sore thumb proved an extremely hard nut to crack <e> <s> i say with great feeling that i think my noble friend has achieved a very great breakthrough in what he has managed to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i say with some feeling that controversy in matters of transport seems always to concern the western part of edinburgh <e> <s> some years ago there was just a little controversy about a runway <e> <s> if i may say this to the noble lord lord galpern the one thing i am thoroughly sceptical about is statistics which are given in forecasts for years hence <e>", "<cs> my lords one gets the impression when the term is used of cars hurtling from glasgow in their anxiety to reach the more salubrious atmosphere of edinburgh and maybe that is what they will want to do in the other

agricultural correspondents of reputable newspapers constructing hit lists and broadcasting them on early morning farming programmes <e> <s> the last that i heard was that the animal breeding research organisation and the hill farming research organisation were to go <e> <s> we know that the latter is being amalgamated with the macaulay institute <e> <s> but there is great controversy as to where

could seem to take us into the far distance <e> <s> i was hoping having heard the facts of what seems to be an extremely strong case for the amendment that my noble friend would be able to go as far as saying that his ministerial colleagues would come to a conclusion before the bill has its third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords both noble lords who have spoken on this amendment have quoted from a document which i possess and which has been sent to me and many others by shelter <e> <s> i have read this document with considerable care and i am bound to say that if what is in it is correct as i am sure it must be there have been major differences of view among some of the most eminent legal luminaries in the land <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie has quoted the noble and learned lord lord wheatley on the pigsty and said that it was not reasonable accommodation <e> <s> according to the notes that case went on to the appellate committee of this house where the noble and learned lord lord

under great stress <e> <s> it is most complimentary that the noble baroness lady nicol should remember what i said on second reading <e> <s> it is perfectly true that i started by saying i say it again that i believe that advice for which you are asked to pay is probably treated as more valuable <e>", "<cs> i fully accept that <e>", "<cs> on thursday my noble friend was kind enough to say that i was one of the few who had given him some friendly support <e> <s> i am afraid that this afternoon he will have to face up to some very reluctant criticism because despite his latest effort to introduce more flexibility which undoubtedly is welcome with great respect he has not provided us with even a morsel of simplicity <e> <s> the hungry sheep still look up for simplicity and they really are not getting fed <e> <s> i cry out for simplicity <e> <s> it was certainly one of the things which attracted me and still does to the drafting of the amendment of my noble friend lord middleton <e>

lords we can then build on that <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say i am a little sad that my noble friend has allowed himself to be taken through the uncharted waters in the wake of his colleagues at the ministry of agriculture because so far as i am aware there is no history or experience in scotland of translating the worth of a tenants improvements into annual rental values <e> <s> yet these figures are an essential element in determining the tenants share of the standard quota <e> <s> i am bound to say that i should have thought in echoing or repeating my earlier cry for simplicity in all this what a marvellous system we already have in scotland so far as hill sheep transfers are concerned <e> <s> the system is known as the hefting of a stock which is bound to the farm on which it is running and i should have thought it would have been admirable to build this scottish system of valuation of an outgoing quota on a foundation which exists in scottish law but not i think in english law <e> <s> we should have been spared all the arguments we have had because the incoming tenant merely takes over the stock at valuation and the landlord would be left out of it altogether with no argument at all <e>", "<cs> may i press my noble friend on one point <e> <s> was it not possible to adopt what i suggested about treating the quotas in the same way as bound farm stock because of european community regulations <e> <s> was it impossible to do that or did he not regard it as a good plan <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> i am chairman of the agricultural credit corporation which gives guarantees to farmers which are backed by public money when they are short of the necessary collateral to get the amount they want from the banks <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords the argument is about whether one adopts the methods in amendments no <e> <s> or or goes along with the governments schedule <e> <s> undoubtedly amendment no <e> <s> suffers from the sheer simplicity with which it was drafted <e> <s> on the other hand there may be certain significance in the fact that those who produced the marshalled list must think extremely well of it <e>

my lords i have never concealed my distaste from the outset for the schedule which i think will be the notorious feature of the bill <e> <s> it must be the longest schedule ever written <e> <s> i counted the words which were needed to explain something <e> <s> it surprises me that both my noble friends to whom lucidity is paramount require so many words to explain what they have both told us is a fairly simple matter <e> <s> in one of the national newspapers today i read that my noble friend lord belstead at some function in the west country over the weekend had been congratulated before he had made whatever observations he was going to make <e> <s> the least i wish to do is to congratulate him on and thank him for his tolerance of all the pinpricks that he has endured from at least

absolutely certain <e> <s> it was a remarkable achievement at brussels to secure a package which has been accepted by all the countries concerned <e> <s> the complication is such that i believe it is quite impossible to give a balanced view of it particularly off-the-cuff <e>", "<cs> my lords of one thing i am quite certain the noble lord lord john-mackie must be thoroughly satisfied with his good fortune in the ballot because i find this a totally absorbing debate <e> <s> it is a subject which needs grappling with and every contribution that we have had so far has thrown up at least one good idea <e> <s> like every other occasion when farmers gather together unanimity is pretty well absent <e> <s> the noble lord said that farmers were getting rid of men and selling tractors <e> <s> i am not getting rid of any men and i have just purchased a new tractor <e> <s> i throw that remark into the pool <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say what encouragement my noble friends statement gives not only because of its content but also because it has been delivered at a remarkably late hour prior to the opening of the national farmers union meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords there can hardly be a more controversial subject which has as usual in your lordships house inspired an interesting and extremely thoughtful debate than the subject before us <e> <s> one thing i enjoyed was that we had a sample

think todays vintage was quite so good as i have known <e>", "<cs> my lords that i am afraid is the sort of question to which the noble lord could get a better answer from the minister than he would from me because i do not know <e>", "<cs> with the greatest of respect my lords i do not think that the noble lord has quite cottoned on to what i was trying to get at <e> <s> the bill as i read it says quite clearly that it may be either the owner or the occupier who is the responsible person <e> <s> it is to either of those that the registration officer may go <e> <s> i may be wrong about this

the registration officer should look at the valuation roll that does not show the name of the occupant of the tied cottage <e> <s> the tied cottages are in my name on the valuation roll <e>", "<cs> my lords not having the knowledge of the noble lord i would not in the least know what he is talking about <e>", "<cs> it is probably inadvisable improper and impertinent to take part in a debate at which one has just arrived <e> <s> but when i entered the chamber there was some confusion about what was meant by the noble lord lord ross shaking his head <e> <s> i may help my noble friend if i say with possibly more experience of the noble lord than anyone else in the chamber at the moment it ran to over years of nostalgic and on the whole pleasant antagonism that i recall on many occasions his shaking his head at what he realised was his own argument being lost <e>", "<cs> it is always very dangerous to tangle with lawyers and i have always come off worst when i have done so <e> <s> but is there not a perfectly simple precedent for this in the case of a person who has two houses <e> <s> he is allowed either to choose which one is to be the subject of capital gains tax in fact whether or not he can opt i cannot remember or he is told which one obviously is his main residence <e>", "<cs> when i first addressed this chamber in my maiden speech i gave an undertaking to speak in future only on subjects with which i was reasonably familiar <e> <s> i have already broken that pledge this evening in venturing into the field of tax law <e> <s> but i must express my apologies to the noble lady for having missed the first seconds of her remarks <e> <s> i think she has done a great service in raising what is a very difficult problem indeed and i think the noble lord lord morton has also said that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may say this to the noble lord who i am quite sure is trying to be fair <e> <s> he has produced figures of which i was unaware but which i totally accept and very interesting they were about the number of farmworkers who live in untied houses <e> <s> he has quoted the <e> <s> has he any figures at all for the proportion of farmworkers who enjoy the minimum wage <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord rises i wonder whether i can add one point to the felicitous remarks made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he was probably spared the shock that i received when i read in a national newspaper yesterday morning in black type in the middle of the page remembering willie ross <e> <s> i then read <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord lord morton has considered the possibility of houses being uninhabitable <e> <s> i do not know if i am right about this but i should have thought that this was what the prescription might be used for <e> <s> i recall when i was the member of parliament for the western district of edinburgh seeing many houses in the area of west pilton which had been vandalised <e> <s> their windows were boarded up and i imagine that they were totally uninhabitable <e> <s> the owner of these houses is now the edinburgh district council and i should have thought that this would be a case for prescription <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a totally unhelpful remark at this time of night <e> <s> so often in the statutes we have words which are subject to wide dispute <e> <s> what is reasonable and what is not reasonable is so often disputed that i would say with total assurance that what we on this side of the committee my noble friend or any of his successors consider to be adequate the noble lord lord ross will almost certainly consider to be totally inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is any dispute or quarrel with the facts deployed by the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> it is a hard life there is no question about that <e> <s> all the same i am bound to say and this is not an original remark because it has been referred to already and i think the noble lord lord mackie would agree with me that agriculture is under pressure at the moment both inside the highland area or perhaps more accurately in the crofting counties and also outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he consider bringing to the attention of british rail the widespread mystification of many people at what they think is their extraordinary financial strategy <e> <s> does it make sense to spend a fortune on up-grading the east coast route from kings cross to edinburgh and then permanently to re-route the night sleeper by a longer run from euston through carlisle thus depriving a large area of south-east scotland and north-east england of the ability to use those services <e>", "<cs> i have been moved to speak by the remarks of my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> he may remember an occasion some years ago when we both attended a meeting in the dartmoor area

visit to the park to see whether anything is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a possibility that a stork may visit the pelican house and then one would get a new connotation of the expression pelican crossing <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord lord ross of marnock has been not too fit for the last few weeks <e> <s> i am bound to say that at my age i do not have the energy to join him in his chase of the hare of devolution which he has attempted today <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first thank the noble earl for giving us the opportunity of ranging over a very wide canvas <e> <s> perhaps it is not irrelevant for me to remark on the subject of the use of land and sea that one might sympathise with my noble friend <e> <s> i see he is out of pocket today as a result of a bull trying to use one of the islands for natural purposes but being drowned on the way across <e> <s> perhaps that is a rather cruel example of the use of land and sea <e>", "<cs> it is years ago that i

might coincide with the scottish note the size of which is extremely popular north of the border <e> <s> can my noble friend persuade the governor of the bank of england to take note of this <e> <s> as a token of the increased prosperity of the nation does he not consider that it would be an admirable move for us to return to those and white notes of blessed memory <e>", "<cs> my lords harking back to the last question may i ask my noble friend whether he is advocating unity or uniformity <e>", "<cs> having listened to what members of the committee have said <e> <s> there seem to be two

where nurses are in short supply there is discrimination between nurses and other students <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must have totally forgotten the legacy to which he succeeded with relish in when if my memory is correct he succeeded me in the scottish office <e> <s> he found a situation there in which in the agricultural field the rather poorly paid upland farmers were receiving more than their equivalent in england and i do not recall him going into the great apoplexy of objection <e>", "<cs> my lords having been a ratepayer in lothian region for many years and having seen my contribution to that authority soaring through the sky perhaps i may say how deeply grateful i am for the principle of rate capping and how profoundly i hope that even under the new system it is still
