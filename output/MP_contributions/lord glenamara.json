public sector borrowing requirement when there is not the slightest possibility of their not being able to honour that debt <e>", "<cs> my lords as a relative newcomer here i must confess that i

side would share the view of my noble friend lord paget on this subject and that most of us regard this cut as quite appalling and shameful in that a still relatively rich country like britain should

unemployment <e> <s> would he ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state for education to discuss this with local authority associations and see whether any help can be given <e> <s>

he look at this matter to see whether he could persuade planning boards to be rather more flexible in allowing planning permission for the change of use of farm buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that many of us would regard this as putting the clock back years to where it was before the war <e> <s> would he not agree that this together with the abandonment of the robbins criteria which the government are proposing this year would mean that higher education will become an litist privilege as it used to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us think the prime minister is absolutely right in this matter that the plo does not represent the views of the vast majority of palestinians who could have had their state long ago had it not been for

is the noble earl aware that a great many people agree with the noble baroness lady trumpington that far too much goes to one or two so-called national bodies in london which are patronised mainly by rich people living in london and the home counties and by companies purchasing blocks of seats and far too little goes to the struggling provincial theatres <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the arts council by this policy is unwittingly contributing to the two nations which the governments economic policy is creating <e> <s> will he look at this imbalance in the distribution of arts council funds <e>", "<cs> my lords are not these figures entirely misleading <e> <s> for example gas prices have gone up by per cent <e> <s> because the government decided that they would go up by per cent

minister aware that what he said about the act may mislead a great many people <e> <s> is he aware that when the act was passed it was certainly the intention of parliament that it should refer to christian teaching <e> <s> while we are all in favour of moral teaching in the schools may i ask whether he accepts that it surely is the birthright of children in this country to be taught about the christian story <e> <s> does he agree that that is not being done in a great many schools contrary to the law <e> <s> what are the government going to do about that <e>", "<cs> of course there are

report deals with the closed shop in the two branches of the legal profession <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that many of us think it is a piece of nonsense for him to say that it is not the governments policy to end school meals when it was the governments own bill which they forced through parliament which is allowing local authorities to do this <e> <s> is he not ashamed that after all these years school meals are being ended in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not confirm that it was the governments bill which they put through parliament against all the opposition parties which permits the ending of school meals <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl knows what i mean it is the ending of school meals for all the rest of our children <e> <s> it is a matter of some importance that hundreds of thousands of our children are being deprived of school meals because of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the enormous debt of the argentine has recently been restructured and that british interests have participated in that restructuring <e> <s> would it not be possible to ensure that the restructuring of international debts of such countries is made conditional on none of the additional credits being made available for armaments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl explain to the house exactly how it would safeguard academic standards to withdraw grant from universities which have the temerity to take in a few additional students <e> <s> surely it will have exactly the opposite effect <e>", "<cs> my

now share the view of president reagan that that is the case <e> <s> will the government now please distinguish between the palestinian people who have a perfectly legitimate desire for some kind of autonomy or state of their own and the plo whose major purpose is the destruction of israel <e> <s> the failure to distinguish between the two has prevented this government from playing any major part in the search for peace in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not illogical for the government to ban the export of arms to the argentine as they have done but to permit british <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord see any hope whatever of reducing the tragic levels of unemployment in all western countries except by raising standards in the third world and therefore raising demand in the third world <e> <s> will the government use all their influence to ensure that western countries take this matter much more seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us who are not unilateralists believe that the governments position on this is becoming quite untenable as his right honourable friend the member for down south made clear in another place this week <e> <s>

right reverend prelate will he say yes or no have we a veto or have we not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in the view of many of us the government are to be congratulated upon what

times over by the governments appalling policy towards the local authorities <e> <s> is the noble earl also aware that million is being withdrawn from the grants to the four northern counties this year counties which are trying to make an impact upon the appalling social and economic problems with which they are faced <e> <s> what the government are doing is therefore being negatived and

not have one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that all of us who know anything about managing the economy agree that there is a problem in controlling public and local authority expenditure but that the method chosen by this government is grossly unjust because it penalises the poorest areas in the country which have the greatest collection of social and physical problems <e>

government to be ashamed of themselves for introducing proposals like these <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the case heard before the general medical council in the past days or so would it not be relatively easy for the government to tighten up on the abuse of drug prescriptions particularly in the health service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that those of us who know the metro
