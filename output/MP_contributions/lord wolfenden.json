["<cs> my lords i have very little right to be imposing myself on your lordships this evening <e> <s> i am i think the newest member of the select committee and i think the most recently appointed chairman of a sub-committee <e> <s> i am therefore and i know it an utter novice <e> <s> as part of my education or initiation or indoctrination or whatever i had the privilege and pleasure and it was i assure your lordships both of accompanying the noble baroness lady white on a one-day visit to brussels just a fortnight ago <e> <s> it was a very full day in the course of which we had five conversations with different groups or individuals and i should like if your lordships will allow me to report very briefly indeed my first virginal impressions <e> <s> without exception of any kind all those whom we saw were friendly welcoming and forthcoming and they ranged across the board from a vice-president and other high officials of the commission to a couple of our own united kingdom representatives <e> <s> nowhere was there any sign of holding hack or keeping us at a distance <e> <s> further without exception of any kind they struck me at least as being all of them in their various ways able hardworking thoughtful and anxious to make the whole thing work <e> <s> so far as the personnel of the commission are concerned my impression was wholly favourable <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady young for that reply which i am sure will give considerable satisfaction not only in this house but outside <e> <s> further might i ask whether the government have in mind any steps that might be taken to remove from the public mind fears in this whole field which the experts assure us have been much exaggerated <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have had a useful debate <e> <s> naturally i could have wished that there had been a more populous attendance but i think this has done something towards one of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if i may in a very few words to fill in what lord alexander of potterhill said about the third of the reports that we are considering that is the one about the admission to institutions of higher education of students from other member states <e> <s> nobody i think would deny the desirability of such interchanges <e> <s> those of us who were fortunate enough to spend a year or so of our early academic life in a university in another country have never ceased to be grateful for that experience and i suggest not altogether flippantly that student age is likely to be the most appropriate age for this kind of interchange because at that stage we all of us have ideas many of them half-baked which we want to exchange with our contemporaries in other countries before we all settle down to a middle age of orthodoxy and set opinions <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel bound to begin with an apology <e> <s> i hope that i may have your lordships pardon if i have to leave before the end of this debate <e> <s> i very much hope that that will not be the case because i particularly want to hear what subsequent speakers have to say <e> <s> but if it comes to the real crunch choice between listening to those speakers on the one hand and catching my last train home on the other i know which course i shall adopt if your lordships will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be allowed just a word or two of very sincere thanks first to the noble and learned lord the minister for giving us a glimpse of the governments present feeling on this matter <e> <s> whether that feeling will be altered by changes in the proposals that we have been considering remains to be seen <e> <s> i should also like to be allowed to thank the noble lords who have taken part in the debate both colleagues of mine on the relevant sub-committee and others and i would especially thank those noble lords who were so generous in their references to the report itself <e> <s> finally i should like to thank everybody who has contributed to this lively wide-ranging and constructive as i believe it has been debate <e> <s> right at the beginning i said that i was deeply aware that there are many of your lordships who are infinitely more knowledgeable than i could ever hope to be in this field of industrial relations and i think that that statement has been vindicated by the contributions made this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say what a very great privilege i think it was that the noble baroness lady carnegy should make her maiden speech in this debate <e> <s> we were all i am sure profoundly impressed by her knowledge and her concern and i hope we shall hear her many times more <e> <s> i was myself particularly rejoiced because she anticipated in what she said a good deal of what i was proposing to say which means that my contribution this evening can be even shorter than it was going to be originally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all very grateful to the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for raising these very important questions this evening <e> <s> after the noble lords comprehensive and persuasive speech and the penetrating comments of the noble baroness lady david there is very little left for me to say but perhaps i may be allowed very briefly and perhaps from a rather different angle to underline just two points <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my thanks to those which have already been expressed to the noble lord lord strabolgi for giving us the opportunity to discuss these matters this evening <e> <s> they may seem parochial and trivial by comparison with the affairs of the european community but to many people perhaps more than is generally recognised they represent an element without which our lives would be very much less worth living <e> <s> secondly i must declare two interests <e> <s> i am chairman of the body which is responsible for the dulwich picture gallery and i am also president of the nationwide british association of friends of museums <e>"]
