["<cs> my lords i have very little right to be imposing myself on your lordships this evening <e> <s> i am i think the newest member of the select committee and i think the most recently appointed chairman of a sub-committee <e> <s> i am therefore and i know it an utter novice <e> <s> as part of my education or initiation or indoctrination or whatever i had the privilege and pleasure and it was i assure your lordships both of accompanying the noble baroness lady white on a one-day visit to brussels just a fortnight ago <e> <s> it was a very full day in the course of which we had five conversations with different groups or individuals and i should like if your lordships will allow me to report very briefly indeed my first virginal impressions <e> <s> without exception of any kind all those whom we saw were friendly welcoming and forthcoming and they ranged across the board from a vice-president and other high officials of the commission to a couple of our own united kingdom representatives <e> <s> nowhere was there any sign of holding hack or keeping us at a distance <e> <s> further without exception of any kind they struck me at least as being all of them in their various ways able hardworking thoughtful and anxious to make the whole thing work <e> <s> so far as the personnel of the commission are concerned my impression was wholly favourable <e>"]
