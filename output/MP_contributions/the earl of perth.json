["<cs> my lords i too want to say how pleased i am to see the noble earl lord mansfield my near neighbour in scotland sitting on the government benches and i know that he will do scotland proud in his position <e> <s> my only sadness is that his first task if it is to happen is the burial of this act <e> <s> as i think many of your lordships will know i believe that an assembly was the right solution for the union <e> <s> others and we have heard the noble lord lord strathclyde say exactly the opposite <e> <s> there is no point in arguing about it now history will give us the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put my name down to speak but there is a little time available and i shall not be more than five minutes <e> <s> all of us who care about these things owe our thanks to the authors of the drew report and also to the noble lord lord montagu of beaulieu for introducing this short debate tonight <e> <s> as i read it the main feature of this report is an organisational one <e> <s> i am not very good at organisational charts <e> <s> it was very important to hear that the noble viscount lord eccles broadly favours the suggestion of a commission which will allocate money and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord davies of leek <e> <s> i said that i would be five minutes <e> <s> i see that six minutes have passed so i will sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the help of our leader on a point <e> <s> a short while ago he made <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord lord kilbracken when he says he thinks that the initiative which the secretary of state is taking is a waste of time <e> <s> i shall return to that point a little later in my speech <e> <s> we all owe a great debt to the noble lord lord dunleath for introducing this debate and particularly for the various concrete suggestions that he made of what might be a future rule or future arrangements for northern ireland <e> <s> this was backed up by the noble duke the duke of abercorn in his excellent maiden speech when he gave us most valuable first-hand ideas of what might be done <e>", "<cs> i am not necessarily in favour of quangos my lords <e> <s> they have been operating for some time <e> <s> as i say if you have a new initiative in the form of a top security official so there might be if you like some publicity value i am not suggesting anything permanent in what i am suggesting there might be a once only inquiry on the point <e>", "<cs> i should like to know from the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey whether at a later stage of the bill perhaps on report he proposes to move a similar amendment but with a five-year period <e> <s> i ask that because in my view there is a good deal to be said for such an amendment <e> <s> i do not understand in the way that many other noble lords do all the legal arguments that have been used today on the various clauses but i am aware of the disquiet there is in regard to these powers <e> <s> a letter appeared in <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may help a little on the word prevaricate <e> <s> of course i agree entirely with the noble and learned lord that the prosecution and defence should be parallel in their rights <e> <s> may i ask whether in the last several years the word prevarication has been tested in the courts or has caused difficulty <e> <s> if it has arisen as a problem already would it not be wiser to withdraw it in both cases rather than leaving in something which to my way of thinking is a difficult word <e>", "<cs> my lords i go along with the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood on the two points she made first that the trustees of the fund which is being set up should as it were act as a catalyst and collaborate with many other trusts covering the whole field and i have no doubt that point will be well in their minds when they commence functioning <e> <s> secondly on the importance of their independence and right to do the things they want i think the bill provides for that in most cases but clearly if it did not that would need to be looked at very carefully <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that this was not a wrecking amendment <e> <s> technically i suppose that is true but as i understand it the amendment makes things extremely restrictive in the realm of housing <e> <s> under this amendment although government policy may be one thing if the local authority decides otherwise their rule or will would prevail <e> <s> perhaps i have got this wrong but that is how i understand it <e> <s> it seems to me that <e>", "<cs> i know but government policy is government policy <e>", "<cs> it seems to me to be a wrecking amendment or as close to it as no matter <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support the noble lord lord glenkinglas for i agree that three years is a short period that eight is rather long and that the figure of five which seems to be a compromise seems to have good reasons going for it <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will in fact say that he will consider the actual figure he said that the figure of three was not sacrosanct and perhaps introduce an amendment at the report stage <e>", "<cs> the length of time we spent discussing earlier amendments is relevant to this question <e> <s> if after only three years occupation one gets a house at a per cent <e> <s> discount i think that is going a bit far <e> <s> if it were five years or a slightly longer period i could see a better justification for that sort of discount <e>", "<cs> since the noble earl mentioned me in particular in relation to this amendment i should like to say that i do not quarrel with the fact that there is a considerable inducement to encourage people to buy <e> <s> the only point i made was that someone who has lived there for only three years is perhaps getting away with something rather fortunate <e> <s> i would hope that the noble earl would take that point not so much in relation to this amendment as in relation to amendment no <e> <s> which has already gone its way <e> <s> he said at that time that he would consider again whether three years was not too short a period <e> <s> i would hope that in that connection he would bear that in mind when he considers amendment no <e> <s> which has already been dealt with <e>", "<cs> i am a little unhappy at the noble earls reply to the suggestion made in the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> he seemed to be arguing in some respect that this has been greatly discussed in another place and therefore there is nothing for us to do about it <e>", "<cs> all the same despite what the noble earl has said it is important that we are free to consider these matters and not that because some discussion has taken place in another place therefore we must be guided by it <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will consider seriously the point made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> it seems to me that we do not want to be at a disadvantage in scotland <e> <s> it may well be that the local authorities who to date have said that they do not want it may change their minds <e> <s> if the power was within the powers of the secretary of state for scotland i should have thought that that would be a good thing <e> <s> while it is not something which we should divide upon today it is something which i hope the government will think of for report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the amendment of the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton and the noble earl lord selkirk i think this is a subject where it is of the greatest importance that the law of england and wales and the law of scotland should be one and the same <e> <s> we heard the noble earl lord selkirk say that if this new clause is passed without the amendment to the amendment then there is more latitude in scotland than in england on this subject and this seems to me to be a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs <e> <s> i hope that even the noble lord lord boothby when he thinks further and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is in order for me to say that the manuscript amendment which i have moved which is consequential upon amendment no <e> <s> a should be taken first <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if this is a muddle <e> <s> i gave a manuscript amendment to be put on the table after amendment no <e> <s> a if amendment no <e> <s> a was accepted by the government and that is what has happened <e> <s> mine is a consequential amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the house <e>", "<cs> we now come to the manuscript amendment which i mentioned when we were dealing with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> this is purely a consequential amendment <e> <s> if one looks at subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word on this <e> <s> having listened to all the arguments on both sides it seems to me that in general the government must have the right to decide what should be done in the way of demanding money and so forth from whatever the source <e> <s> but i think they go too far in not giving any kind of guidance on what will be the form of consultation <e> <s> it is all very well for the noble lord lord bellwin to say for the next two years it is all right <e> <s> you must believe in us <e> <s> of course these are things we are bound to take into account <e> <s> but that is all an act of faith <e> <s> i feel on the other hand that the amendment brought in at the committee stage goes too far in that it binds the government in a way which would be very awkward if for one reason or another they wanted to do certain things and were then challenged in the courts by the new town which felt it had a right to go on with its programme regardless <e> <s> you can always argue these things in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness on this <e> <s> we all know how valuable are many of the things in this category which are grown in scotland <e> <s> think of the roses for example which are famous <e> <s> it seems to me that in this case we should be in line with the practice in england <e> <s> this is not so in every case but here in regard to the situation that we have heard described it seems right and appropriate that we should be in line and have nursery grounds in the same category as market gardens in general <e>", "<cs> i came to this debate with an open mind <e> <s> the only conviction i had was that this was not or should not be considered a moral issue and having heard a number of noble lords including the noble lord lord home and the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson they have confirmed my feeling that it is not and should not be a moral issue whatever may be the feeling of the churches <e> <s> i well understand <e>", "<cs> supposing there is this pool of very large numbers which is the expression the noble lord lord belstead used over the years would it not be possible at the time when that is proved to limit further our immigration numbers so as to take care of the problem <e> <s> or again if we had figures at that time to prove the case would it not be possible at that time to introduce a similar bill in the form it is now <e> <s> to me the issue really turns on the basis of figures it is a practical issue and not a moral one <e> <s> also it depends on the noble lord lord belstead being able to answer the question why not if things prove to be the worst that he fears change at that later time the numbers which can come in through immigration <e>", "<cs> i heard what the noble lord lord ross has said but i am very worried that what he proposes will change the <e>", "<cs> may i answer one point which was made by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> these are not new conditions new clauses <e> <s> they already exist and they are being repeated <e> <s> this has happened again and again <e> <s> to that extent one must not say these are new conditions for the roman catholic hierarchy <e> <s> it is something which has always been accepted <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that we do not want to create differences over something we are all very proud of namely that all the schools in scotland are treated in the same way <e> <s> but the amendment as it stands would not have that effect <e> <s> it would cause a great deal of trouble something which the noble lord does not want any more than i do <e> <s> in saying this i know that i am speaking for the hierarchy of the great majority of catholics in scotland <e> <s> if the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ross of marnock is agreed to it will cause great upset <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> it is a most unusual situation to have the noble earl lord mansfield on the government side and the noble lord lord ross on the opposition side in harmony against some of the back-benchers of both parties <e> <s> clearly it is very satisfactory to know that the noble earl will think again certainly on the second amendment and perhaps on the first though i am not sure that i would not have done it exactly the opposite way round and been ready to accept the first amendment and not the second <e> <s> my reason is that if when a parent goes to the appeal committee he knows that there will probably be a majority of one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he would be good enough to look at that again <e> <s> as i understand it the main work which has been done up to date represents such things as the eradication of dry rot and the main extra work has not in fact reached an irrevocable stage <e> <s> i would therefore ask that he makes quite sure of what he has been told at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords that we are in the right is recognised by the united nations and in some ways even more importantly by our friends in the eec and the commonwealth who have not only agreed to a resolution but have taken action which is of great importance to us in our attempts towards an economic blockade <e> <s> we also have the right as an outcome of this and indeed we have the duty if necessary to face bloodshed to uphold the rule of law <e> <s> but let us remember two facts <e> <s> for the past years we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest interest to what the noble lord lord beloff said about the importance of national unity at this time <e> <s> i would only say that i agree with him and i hope that what i am now going to say will not be interpreted otherwise <e> <s> my lords it is a fortnight since our last debate and no one can doubt our strength and our resolve in this dispute <e> <s> we have triumphantly retaken south georgia <e> <s> from tomorrow we have declared the falklands shall be blockaded both by sea and by air <e> <s> there are afoot urgent and secret negotiations diplomatic negotiations to try to bring an end to the problem <e> <s> often such secrecy is right but i believe the time has now come for us from our position of strength to announce to take the initiative on what we would propose to do in the event of the argentinian forces having withdrawn from the falklands <e> <s> i believe it is not enough to say we are then prepared to resume negotiations <e> <s> of course that in a sense goes without saying but i suggest we should go further now <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the big questions <e> <s> is the question of a flag flying which is only one flag among several a matter of reward when that country is not sovereign and when the united nations is administering the territory <e> <s> i would say the more flags the merrier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that we should wipe out allegiance <e> <s> what i am suggesting and i continue to suggest it is that we should consider putting the falkland islands as a trust territory and it has happened before in past history under the united nations with us administering it <e> <s> of course that is a difficult concept but i believe that the time has now come for open diplomacy and for the government who have acted so firmly and clone so well to date to consider very seriously taking action along the lines that i have advocated <e> <s> of course there can be endless variations <e> <s> but the main thrust of my remarks is the following do not let us just say that once the argentinians have evacuated we are ready for negotiations let us rather even now tell the world what would be our position and what we would want to do and what we are prepared to do <e> <s> i believe that the world would understand our position <e> <s> we would have struck a blow for peace and ensured the long-term wellbeing of the islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords on all sides from the government benches the cross benches the opposition and i need not detail others support has come for the noble lord lord ross in this matter <e> <s> i was brought up to believe that one or two is something rather than are so i hope the noble earl will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble baroness lady birk for introducing this prayer because this is a matter of great concern to all of us and the debate so far has shown how well your lordships can help in a case of this sort <e> <s> i support the idea behind the special development order because it is clear that what is attempted by the government is to cut through the interminable planning delays which have arisen so often <e> <s> when i was first a crown estate commissioner we devoted most of one of our annual reports to this very subject and gave many examples of the difficulties we were up against in trying to get through good design or good planning <e> <s> i recall for example cambridge terrace one of the great nash terraces in regents park <e> <s> we wanted there to restore a bomb site with the facade as it had been originally <e> <s> it took us over years to achieve that only last year did we get permission to go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not even halfway through the speakers and it is already getting late <e> <s> therefore i shall confine myself to one subject only which is the falkland islands <e> <s> let us see what the gracious speech says about them <e> <s> it says that the government will encourage the economic development of the falkland islands maintain an appropriate defence force and at a later stage in consultation with the islanders consider their future political development and security <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether the government will consider in future giving two days to this debate <e> <s> there have been a number of very important speeches in the last three hours but only a handful of your lordships to listen to them <e> <s> it is midnight no dinner has been available and it seems to me that this is an unnecessary hardship to inflict on your lordships house at the beginning of the session <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other speaker in the second reading debate today i welcome the governments introduction of this bill in principle and the admirable way in which the noble earl lord avon introduced it <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that it is right that museums should be outwith the control of government in the way that has been happening to date in the two with which we are particularly concerned tonight <e>", "<cs> i totally agree with the noble viscount lord eccles that it is of the greatest importance that we get this right because we are legislating now for a long future <e> <s> i confess that i am astonished at the opposition to the amendment <e> <s> in particular i should have thought the noble lord lord strabolgi would have seen that in this day and age when we want more rather than less democracy in government to have a chosen few chosen by the prime minister totally separate from the work of the director and his staff except in so far as they lay down policy when they have no responsibility for carrying it out is not a right structure for today <e>", "<cs> it is clear that the wording will have to be changed for the reason pointed out by the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> i agree entirely <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i would be very happy to withdraw my amendment but before doing so i think it is very critical that the board its policies and the directors are executive but i did not quite follow the noble earl completely when he said that the board should lay down policy and that was all they could do <e> <s> even if you accept my amendment which is no <e> <s> they lay down their policy and have various functions to perform <e> <s> if they find in fact that the director and the staff are not carrying out their policy they can control it again <e> <s> i do not think that by accepting the amendment i have suggested we are restricting the board to one function and the director and staff to the other <e> <s> however the noble earl has said that he will look at this again <e> <s> i have my amendments and the noble lords lord strabolgi and lord montagu have their amendments of a similar kind <e> <s> there has been support for them and so i hope we shall be able to find something which will satisfy us eventually <e> <s> with that comfort from what the noble earl has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the general feeling that there should be remuneration not only for the chairman but also for some of the members <e> <s> we do not have to have an exactly comparable rate of remuneration for one and all <e> <s> suppose one of the members is chairman of two or three sub-committees <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will find it possible to accept the amendment because in a sense the armouries have had two blows this afternoon <e> <s> one was on the question of who should appoint the trustees and the other was on the source of funds <e> <s> many of your lordships know that this is a matter about which they are anxious not immediately but in the future and that being so and because i feel one should pay attention to the views of those directly concerned i hope the government will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have understood what the noble earl has said in reply to the noble lord lord strabolgi but would it not perhaps be better if it were made clear that what we are talking about are the royal botanic gardens of england <e> <s> after all i am not sure whether the royal botanic gardens of scotland in edinburgh did not come first <e> <s> if they did not come first they are certainly equally eminent <e> <s> i think that it would be a great pity if there arose a situation in which when one was talking about the royal botanic gardens everyone thought that somehow edinburgh did not count <e> <s> so if the government cannot accept the amendment as it is written i hope that they will think about changing the title to the extent of adding of england <e> <s> then it would be possible to go anywhere in england to set up a new location whether it be at wakehurst place or anywhere else that is suitable <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely happy about this <e> <s> do i understand it now that there are two royal botanic gardens of equal status <e> <s> or is the noble earl saying that the royal botanic gardens in scotland is not really a royal botanic gardens or that we have got to qualify it in some way <e> <s> this is a bill which is dealing with england <e> <s> why cannot we make it the royal botanic gardens of england <e>", "<cs> i too feel that despite all the help we have been given by the noble earl lord avon who has tried to explain what the bill is all about the general public and in the last analysis it is the general public who are going to count will not know what is to replace the historic buildings council for england and the ancient monuments board for england <e> <s> we are told that there is to be a commission but as it stands the commission is such a hotch-potch because of all the amendments that people will not understand what it is all about and will not give it the proper help and respect which it ought to have <e>", "<cs> i am quite ready to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> as i said i merely wanted to make a point <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will draw the attention of the secretary of state for scotland to the fact that anyhow one member of your lordships house believes that in this case scotland should be treated on a permissive basis in the same way as the english members of the new commission <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has said we have discussed this question for a very long time but it is a pity that there should be passions about it particularly when this amendment is one that is permissive and looking to the future <e> <s> up until years ago for a hundred years the directors of these museums were generally on the board of trustees certainly in the case of big museums <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord cottesloe is ready to see a director as a member of a board although it is hardly allowed for at the present time <e> <s> what i think we have to realise is that although we have at this moment the people who are operating the old system all against this there may come a moment when we want a change just as after a hundred years changes have occurred before <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could mention my experience with the crown estates <e> <s> we have commissioners there <e> <s> they receive very modest pay as well as expenses <e> <s> i assure noble lords that it is very modest in relation to the work which they do <e> <s> in this particular case some of them are farmers with great agricultural experience <e> <s> they have to leave their work on the farm in order to take part in the deliberations of the crown estates <e> <s> that is not just a question of expenses it is very definitely a sacrifice <e> <s> in this day and age it seems unreasonable to expect such people the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington gave us a very good example of artists to sacrifice their time <e> <s> i am sure that they would do it for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i am also speaking for the noble lord lord strabolgi although he is not here in thanking the noble earl <e> <s> lord ferrers for the amendment <e> <s> i think that kew is totally appropriate <e> <s> if i did suggest of england it was because i wanted to make sure that there was no muddle between england and scotland which both have their botanic gardens <e> <s> ours is the royal botanic gardens edinburgh here it is the royal botanic gardens kew <e> <s> i thank the noble earl very much for making the necessary change <e>", "<cs> my lords before there is any question of a division i say to the noble baroness lady birk that i was worried when i heard the noble lord <e> <s> lord charteris say that he was worried that heritage could cause confusion with his own council <e> <s> would it not be sufficient if the government said we are prepared before third reading to listen to any other good name and would be ready for someone to introduce it <e> <s> if we were to divide now on <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl lord avon answers his noble friend may i just check that i understood him aright when he spoke on the question of vat <e> <s> i believe that almost everybody in this house dislikes vat but there it is <e> <s> the noble earl said that in the event of the new commission seeking a grant from the treasury for some purpose or other the vat could be included in the amount required for the grant <e> <s> if the noble earl will just reaffirm that it would give me great comfort even though i dislike vat in many other respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel with the noble earl <e> <s> lord avon that if we accepted these amendments we should he hampering what is in a sense a totally new body <e> <s> it is true that it is going to have the functions of two other bodies <e> <s> the subsection as it stands now says that the secretary of state enjoins them to discharge their functions <e> <s> it may well be that they would want to do the main work on either ancient monuments or on buildings in the main body and not have a second committee <e> <s> i hope that on further thought those who have moved the amendment will go along with the noble earl and see that what the government propose is probably the best from every angle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not go along with the noble lord lord kennet or the noble baroness lady birk about having primary duties and secondary duties <e> <s> i think that the commission must have a duty as is put down in the original text <e> <s> on the other hand i support the amendment when they put in the word conservation and more important the words and archaeological and conservation areas <e> <s> also in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords lord kennet has commented on the difficulties of schedule <e> <s> it is a very difficult schedule but to the extent that this amendment leaves out of the lines we should be grateful more particularly because as the noble earl lord avon has told us it is covered in his amendment no <e> <s> which was moved before we went to have our dinner <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord kennet that clause is now subject to one or two changes but we know now what the commission are to do <e> <s> this is stated so clearly not only for our purposes but also for the public generally that we are all very indebted to the noble earl for having done that <e> <s> it was that point that worried me most of all what was it all about <e> <s> now we know <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the problem here it arises from the word historically <e> <s> i understood the noble duke to say that if one had an empty house and another collection that was wholly appropriate then it was right that it should be included as part of the whole of that particular house <e> <s> i would go along with that <e> <s> but if we interpret historically as being actually associated with the house in one way or another then i am unhappy about the situation <e> <s> so i hope that there is no confusion and that the noble earl when he inserts the word historically does not mean that these items have literally got to be part of the history of that house in some way or another <e> <s> that is my worry <e> <s> if he were to leave out the word historically so that it just said appropriate to i should be totally happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord who has just spoken particularly in relation to gardens <e> <s> gardens are live things <e> <s> gardeners today may be creating something which will be thought to be of great artistic merit or they may want to change what they have started <e> <s> if it is to be made mandatory that a garden which is being created or which has been created by somebody who is living today has to be listed many of the people who are doing this work may be very worried about it <e> <s> i wonder whether we are wise to try to go further than the provisions which as we have heard are already in the bill at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the debate on this series of amendments with great care and it seems to me that it is perhaps difficult for the government to give their view until breakfast or lunch between the commission when it has been established and the royal commission has taken place <e> <s> so i must confess that it seems to me that amendment no <e> <s> which leaves everything open until after the famous meal has taken place is probably the amendment that we should go for <e> <s> it indicates that at a proper time when the secretary of state is satisfied that it is expedient to review the relationship something may happen <e> <s> but to expect an answer now would be wrong and one should not press even the government for it <e>", "<cs> my lords almost every speaker this evening has concentrated on clause of the bill and that i think is totally right because it is a very difficult and bad clause as it stands at present <e> <s> i have been keeping the scoresheet which shows that out of the speakers there has been one in favour besides of course the mover of the second reading of the bill the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> there has been one who may be neutral the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> on the other hand the noble lord lord mottistone having shown a certain neutrality said perhaps i am neutral so long as it does not apply to the isle of wight <e> <s> for the rest the churches that is to say those on the bishops bench six conservatives labour liberals and the cross-benchers have all spoken strongly and compellingly against the clause as it at present stands <e>", "<cs> first let me say on behalf of the noble lord lord goodman with whom i spent an hour this morning that he much regrets that he cannot be here this afternoon <e> <s> i am happy to say that he is not in bed but as he put it to me he is a smouldering volcano but immobile <e> <s> before i go any further i should like to take up one point which the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i know that <e> <s> unfortunately the noble lord lord campbell of alloway was not here <e> <s> he misrepresented what was said by the noble lord lord goodman <e> <s> i quoted exactly what lord goodman said at second reading <e> <s> if he had been here he would have heard it <e> <s> he can read it tomorrow in <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord bellwin can say why he has chosen per cent <e> <s> why not per cent <e>", "<cs> if you live for years or more in your home will you get an per cent <e> <s> discount <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to venture outside the main theme of the valuable debate begun by the noble lord lord seebohm and not cover so much of the very valuable ground and suggestions which have been made by others <e> <s> my reason for doing so is that i believe the main problem we face today is to get the third countries back on to a sound economic base <e> <s> it is all very well to think in terms of help with food production and so forth but unless there is law and order in those countries and unless there are peaceful conditions in which agriculture can be improved then there is no hope for those who are hungry <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether under article iv the declaration of udi is in his view lawful <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty to thank the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx for his excellent maiden speech in this house <e> <s> i stress in this house because so many of us remember him speaking when he had another guise in another place <e> <s> i am also very happy that he chose this subject to break the ice because it shows the importance that he attaches as indeed do the other noble lords who are speaking today to this <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the explanation of the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> it seems to me that a discount of nearly a third at the end of two years is pretty considerable <e> <s> if it was said that the discount at <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord ross speaks could the noble lord lord gray help us a little more <e> <s> i can understand that a per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> discount in relation to somebody who is already there as a tenant is a reasonable discount <e> <s> but and i think it was the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside who made this point what about somebody who now today gets a council house <e> <s> he is pretty lucky <e> <s> he had no tenancy right but what the government are going to give him under this bill if i read it aright is in two years to get the house at a per cent <e> <s> discount <e> <s> in other words those who are lucky enough to get a new tenancy after this with no tenants rights are going to be particularly fortunate as opposed to those in the past because they are getting a house which enables them to buy it at the end of two years for one-third less than its value <e> <s> it seems to me that that is mistaken <e>", "<cs> i have been listening to the noble lords who have spoken in support of this amendment and i must say that in my experience too one finds gross anomalies overburdening certain sections and giving relief to others which is not very fair <e> <s> like the noble lord lord drumalbyn i think we ought to ask that in the rather near future this question is all looked into <e> <s> i recognise that the amendment says within six months and then urgently <e> <s> i know that even with those words in the practice with these committee reports means that it will probably be a year or so before there is any outcome <e> <s> that takes us to <e> <s> then the government will think about it for a year or two and so it will probably be before we reach any outcome <e> <s> because the last revision was in for years we shall have been labouring under what many of us feel is an unfair system <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord gray of contin will consider accepting this amendment in principle if not in its entirety <e>", "<cs> together with others who have spoken <e> <s> i think there is a worry here when we read that one has the right to make copies <e> <s> i know the noble lord lord gray said they should not be unreason-able but who is to judge that <e> <s> it would be much better to have another look at this and see whether somehow even if it is only by saying within reason or something like that we can qualify what is here at present otherwise i can see the busybodies being very troublesome <e>", "<cs> my lords when i saw the unstarred question of the noble lord lord fanshawe i thought that it was a little hard on the getty museum <e>", "<cs> various noble lords who have spoken so far the noble lord lord vaizey the noble lord lord annan and i have forgotten who else to a degree defended it <e> <s> the noble lord lord saint oswald has attacked it very strongly <e> <s> i think he is wrong shall come back to that <e> <s> i accept that there is a threat but i think that the noble lord was wrong to have said some of the things that he did <e> <s> perhaps there is a moral to that namely not to circulate what i would call propaganda because that is what happened to your lordships just before a debate <e> <s> so often it has precisely the wrong effect <e> <s> i shall come back to certain activities of the getty and how i think that we can do better by helping rather than trying to fight <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i take the point <e> <s> i would say equally that the national heritage memorial fund and others should be a little more flexible given that we know that at this time it is a rising market <e>", "<cs> i find some difficulty on this <e> <s> i must confess that i have a lot of sympathy with lord pitt <e> <s> my reason is one of the points that he made what happens if you have been waiting minutes and then the bus comes along and you cannot get on it because it is then one minute past the hour or half hour <e> <s> if it had in fact been proved that these peak periods caused great inconvenience we should have to put up with it but i certainly have seen some facts which seem to illustrate that in practice what we feared would happen during the afternoon does not happen at all <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that i should like to just ask as a matter of fact whether the situation at the present time is or is not that between and pm people cannot travel free <e> <s> i think they can <e> <s> therefore the answer that the noble earl lord avon gave us as i understood him is not that we are doing what is already in existence but in fact that we are going backwards from an existing plan <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will think once more about the situation so that we can avoid a division on this amendment <e> <s> as i see it he gave us an answer which was not in accordance with facts <e>", "<cs> my lords like many of your lordships who have spoken today there are many things in this bill which i do not like but as there are or more speakers and most of those who have spoken have already given the outline of almost everything and i am quite sure that those who are to follow will complete the task i do not intend to detail my dislikes <e> <s> however i suspect that i differ from most of those who have spoken against the bill because neither do i like the amendment <e> <s> indeed i think it should be opposed <e> <s> it is a way round a convention which is the convention that we do not vote against the second reading of a bill which has been passed in another place <e> <s> i know the movers of this amendment recognise this but all the same it is a way round it <e> <s> i do not think that your lordships should support such circumlocution such circumnavigation or whatever is the appropriate word <e>", "<cs> my lords when the original bill was introduced into your lordships house many of your lordships had two main worries <e> <s> one was that it was a gerrymandering bill and the second was that it would in some way denigrate from the powers of this house <e> <s> i feel that the noble viscount the leader of the house has met us today in his preliminary speech on both of these points <e> <s> for example the political colour of the greater london council and the metropolitan councils is to remain unchanged during what i would call the interim period <e> <s> so much for the gerrymandering <e> <s> then we had the anxiety that in some way or another this was derogating from the powers of your lordships in particular <e> <s> again this point has been met because we have been told that nothing will happen until the abolition bill has received the royal assent <e> <s> so my lords it seems to me that our main worries have been removed <e>", "<cs> on amendments nos <e> <s> and i go along with the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> on the other amendments i am in some difficulty because i have an amendment following amendment no <e> <s> which owing to a typographical error does not make very good sense as it stands <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the chairman of committees would like to make the point on my amendment no <e> <s> before i speak further <e> <s> for the purposes of your lordships committee it is difficult to understand what i am proposing which has a relationship to what the noble lord lord ross has been saying about a museum of scotland <e> <s> having said that i support amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> would that be agreeable to the noble lord lord ross and others <e>", "<cs> if i may i will speak to amendment no <e> <s> but i wish to speak to it in an amended form <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am more confused than ever about the position <e> <s> the noble lord lord home asked a question <e> <s> we are told that there is some possibility of having trustees who can set up a museum of scotland but can they be the trustees of the museum of scotland and not the trustees of the other two bodies <e> <s> is it not clear to me <e> <s> i ask the noble lord lord gray to think again and having listened to all our discussions here to consider whether the government cannot accept the permissive amendment which i have put down here <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord please answer the question <e> <s> would it be possible for the trustees to become trustees of the museum of scotland or not under the bill as it stands now <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i really do not understand <e> <s> would the trustees then become trustees of the museum of scotland or not <e>", "<cs> if noble lords <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord the chairman call amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i would be happy with that solution <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord in writing to me will pay particular attention to what was said by the noble lord lord home <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble lord the chairman of committees whether we should not take amendment no <e> <s> before amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> what happened was that again some gremlin found its way into the amendments that i tabled <e> <s> my amendment no <e> <s> should have read page line not line <e> <s> therefore it comes before <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support i have received from all quarters on this amendment <e> <s> i am also grateful that the noble lord lord gray of contin is going to have another look at it <e> <s> i was careful not to exclude other objects <e> <s> i know well that the royal scottish museum and other museums have very fine things from all over the world and that is as it should be but there is nothing in this bill or in this list which shows that we should pay special attention have special regard to things scottish <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord gray is in luck <e> <s> he now has three people who are going to oppose the amendment <e> <s> despite the eloquence of the noble lord lord carmichael i believe that it is reasonable to have the power to charge for admission <e> <s> he asked me a question about the smithsonian <e> <s> the smithsonian is free as are all the museums under it <e> <s> the great metropolitan museum in new york has what it calls voluntary contributions <e> <s> however if you try to enter and do not put anything into the pot as it were it ought to be as much as four dollars so you must put in at least one or two dollars which is now or you will find it most unpleasant <e> <s> so that method of being voluntary does not work because it is only voluntary in inverted commas <e> <s> if there are to be admission charges forget the special categories it is essential that it is known that on at least one day in the week admission is free for one and all <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i just have the record straight <e> <s> i did not suggest that we should charge <e> <s> i said that the charge in the metropolitan voluntary contribution is indicated at four dollars which is virtually <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation which has been provided by the noble lord lord gray but i am even more grateful for the support of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gray said my purpose is to introduce one more safeguard <e> <s> i note his opinion that the existing provision is adequate <e> <s> i can only say in withdrawing the amendment at this stage that i hope the noble lord is right <e>", "<cs> this all seems rather complicated to me <e> <s> i see that in subsection <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i should go into this matter because i am a member of the board of the national library <e> <s> i certainly do not want any change which means that i cannot continue as such <e> <s> i do not think that that is envisaged <e> <s> what i would say is that although it is in many ways archaic in my view it works extremely well <e> <s> in particular the lord president and others of the advocates play a really important part in the work of the library <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord lord grimond that it would be a great pity if the lord president who is also a member of the executive committee and functions frequently and valuably were not a part of it <e>", "<cs> i find this a very difficult and complicated issue but two things occur to me <e> <s> one is that i do not believe it is a good argument to say that there have been only three cases or that a case has not yet arisen <e> <s> it may arise at any moment and therefore i do not like that negative approach <e> <s> the second point is that if the national trust for scotland feels that it is important to put it on a par with the english legislation i would back the national trust for scotland <e>", "<cs> when the noble earl looks at this again will he remember that these things can arise suddenly and that one has no time for legislation <e> <s> therefore it is essential that one should have provision from the start rather than saying in a year or two we shall put in a provision if it is necessary <e> <s> none of us knows what may suddenly arise and be absolutely critical and which there will be no time to handle because there is no suitable legislation <e> <s> i ask the noble earl to take that point into consideration along with everything else <e>", "<cs> my lords for my part this amendment meets our worries <e> <s> i recall well how many of your lordships at committee stage were supportive of the thought that we should make it clear that all the items under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very exciting moment for me and for many of your lordships the government having accepted the importance of getting these words into the bill at this stage <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord lord ross is quite right i have been very persistent <e> <s> indeed between the committee stage and the report stage i have been having a lot of discussions with many people including the noble marquess lord bute and others to try to explain just what we had in mind <e> <s> i am particularly indebted to the government for recognising what was the anxiety of so many of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say thank you to the minister and really to say thank you to the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> when the matter was in committee i sat down too quickly and he took it up in the next amendment <e> <s> anyhow between us we have achieved what we think is the right thing <e> <s> it does not restrict the choice <e> <s> it may not be more than one but anyhow it is one and we are grateful to the noble minister for having put it in as he said he would <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the important thing that the minister has said is that if the museum of scotland is set up the board of trustees can call themselves the trustees of that museum if i have understood him correctly <e> <s> if that is the case i am happy to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i was quite unaware that this proposal was coming up as an amendment in todays committee stage <e> <s> having heard the noble lords lord taylor of gryfe and lord grimond i must say that i am very much on their side <e> <s> there is always a tendency to centralise the banking facilities all the financial power in london <e> <s> there was some discussion about the hong kong and shanghai bank trying to take over the royal bank <e> <s> there were people in scotland who were in favour of that but for one reason only that the hong kong and shanghai bank had undertaken that they were going to move their headquarters from london to edinburgh <e> <s> that was a completely different thing from the proposed takeover by the chartered or anything else <e> <s> what was being done was moving financial power to scotland rather than to london <e> <s> i do not understand why it is not possible to have for scotland a separate bill in favour of the trustee savings bank scotland <e> <s> as we have heard with all the financial power that we have in scotland we are perfectly capable of standing on our own feet and i think that we ought to be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords may wonder why i a scot am speaking in this second reading debate <e> <s> my first reason is that i was born in london secondly i have spent a great deal of my life in london and thirdly and for me much the most important reason i came down from scotland this morning to ask her majestys government whether they will consider after this bill is through if it is through a similar reform for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it was plotted or good fortune on the part of the noble lords lord fanshawe and lord annan that we have this debate at this moment <e> <s> yesterday we saw the report of the national gallery <e> <s> it seems to me that what we have learnt from that reinforces all that we have been talking about tonight <e>", "<cs> i came to this committee stage this afternoon without any preconceived idea one way or the other on the amendment <e> <s> however the more i listened the more it struck me that in a way this amendment is something of a derogation of the powers of the house itself <e> <s> what is it suggesting <e> <s> it is suggesting that the house in this committee stage and in other stages goes with the greatest care into all the various points raised by many of your lordships and then assumes that the work must be done again by a committee <e> <s> i find that some sort of reflection on your lordships house <e>", "<cs> i wish first to apologise to the committee for the fact that my amendment appeared so late <e> <s> i am sure that many of your lordships will not have had a real opportunity to consider its merits or its demerits <e> <s> having said that let me get down to what it is all about <e> <s> i start by echoing the worries of the noble lord lord hayter and others about the fate of voluntary organisations <e> <s> the problem that we face today is how best to ensure that they continue to receive proper assistance from the boroughs in the london area and the districts in the metropolitan areas <e> <s> it is not only the boroughs that have to help <e> <s> the charitable organisations themselves will have to raise some money <e> <s> apart from anything that comes from the voluntary organisations or from the government there must also be a contribution by outside groups <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one comment since the noble lord has mentioned my amendment <e> <s> it is simply this <e> <s> both the right reverend prelate the bishop of london and the noble lord lord ennals have i am afraid misrepresented my proposal <e> <s> they said that they were not interested in it because it added yet another body to the set-up that we are talking about <e> <s> my answer is that this is not the case <e> <s> i am proposing that there should be a body totally outside politics that would be replacing both the glc and the mccs <e> <s> if the amendment on which the name of the noble lord lord hayter appears first is passed my amendment would also replace the voluntary service authority <e> <s> my proposal is not to establish another body <e> <s> it is a substitute <e> <s> i am glad that the noble lord lord ennals has sympathy for me <e> <s> if he has sympathy for me but votes for the noble lord lord hayter my amendment disappears <e>", "<cs> i think that the purpose of my amendment is just this <e> <s> the government have undertaken and i am sure that we all rejoice at this to make considerable grants over an interim period to the local authorities under the grant scheme <e> <s> my proposal is that the body which should distribute these should be non-political and should so deal with the various matters not comparing one with the other but judging on the merits of the case <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister replies the noble lord lord hunt asked a question of me <e> <s> it was whether his amendment in any way conflicts with the amendment that i propose to move later <e> <s> my answer to that is no far from it <e> <s> as i read it it ensures that there will be these schemes <e> <s> if these schemes are not only from the greater london council but also from the metropolitan bodies then the sort of body that i am talking of will be all the more necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both the noble lords lord beloff and lord boyd-carpenter for raising these questions <e> <s> let me say to the noble lord lord beloff that if he will look at subsection of my amendment it is totally clear that what i am talking about is only the <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i am not entirely happy with that answer because as i see the problem it is that there will be more demands on government than there are funds available <e> <s> the noble lord lord elton as i understand it said in certain sections it will be done proportionately <e> <s> frankly i do not think that is a good idea <e> <s> some of the things may be good and some of the things may be bad <e> <s> i should have thought it would be far better to have an independent body making a decision <e>", "<cs> i do not understand that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether it is really necessary to repeat this statement in this house <e> <s> we are all of course very much interested in the welfare of another place but surely they are able to take care of themselves i think the time has come when we really should look at statements from the point of view of considering whether they are of real importance to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the wish of the house so be it but i would very much hope that what the noble earl has said namely that there is to be consideration of this whole issue in the procedure committee will enable that committee to take into account what i know is the feeling of many of your lordships on the point that i have raised today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house an assurance that until a decision has been made no objects which are at present being offered in lieu will be turned down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the exchange very carefully and i am somewhat puzzled because basically one has great sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord renton said that if the amendment was passed every voluntary organisation had to have some part of it <e> <s> i do not find that in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of clarification when the noble lord says this amendment what amendment is he talking about <e> <s> is he talking about amendment no <e> <s> b or amendment no <e> <s> h <e> <s> because we are not talking about amendment no <e> <s> h at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome this amendment but there are one or two questions that i should like to ask the minister the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> he told us that the assets are to go to the london residuary body <e> <s> he further said that if the surplus assets allow this was in the verbatim report of th may the government might be able to increase that amount further <e> <s> how do we decide what is the amount remembering that part of this money is ratepayers money and part of it is government money <e> <s> how is a decision taken <e> <s> does the secretary of state say oh well there have been enough surplus assets now <e> <s> i have heard very large figures for london some million or more <e> <s> will we get only million out of it or if surplus assets allow could it be million <e> <s> i ask that for elucidation not in a spirit of opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down i asked a question to which i do not think i heard the answer <e> <s> it was who decides what is the amount of the surplus assets <e> <s> after all million is not a very large figure when you think of what we are talking about for greater london <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the report stage of the bill and i must say that in a report stage it is unusual to say the least to introduce such a revolutionary proposal as we find in these amendments <e> <s> i may be wrong but my own reading of what happens is that in a report stage one does not do something like this rather could it be in the committee stage or not at all <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord diamond who said that in the event that the amendment was passed we would probably have to change the long title of the bill <e> <s> i think that that is right <e> <s> i may have misheard him but if i may look at the title of the bill it states that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a matter of opinion but i thank the noble lord lord diamond for explaining his view <e> <s> but the whole purpose of this bill as i understand it is to transfer the authorities functions to the local authorities in their areas <e> <s> again and this is a very worrying point the purpose of the bill as i read it and i remember well saying this on second reading is to abolish a tier of government <e> <s> this amendment does not do that <e> <s> it continues a tier of government with certain less great powers than exist now but with other new ones which are perhaps even wider than before <e> <s> strategic planning is to be handled in that way as is economic development <e> <s> perhaps these functions are already with the glc and the metropolitan councils but the powers are certainly very wide <e> <s> this would be an elected tier of government when as i understand it the spirit of the whole of this bill is to get rid of a tier of government <e>", "<cs> i have listened to much of this debate <e> <s> in particular i listened to the noble lord when he spoke and gave us a good deal of encouragement <e> <s> as far as i can make out nowhere in this bill at the present time do the words elderly or disabled appear <e>", "<cs> before the minister concludes will he give an answer to a proposal which i found to <e>", "<cs> my lords one of my earliest political recollections was in <e> <s> my uncle viscount fitzalan was to be the last viceroy of ireland i remember that in my teens i was asked to pray for him <e> <s> we were all asked to pray for him for it was a dangerous job that he was taking on <e> <s> our prayers were heard for as your lordships know he lived long after to give great service <e> <s> ever after i was conscious of the northern ireland question <e> <s> in greater or lesser degree i have kept following it closely <e> <s> i assumed wrongly that things were going rather well for the next years <e>", "<cs> i very well understand the request of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i too should like to try and understand a little more of the meaning <e> <s> i noticed that the noble lord lord burton said you get the rivers beauly and the ness which are not in any board or district at the present time as i understand it <e> <s> is it open to them to apply to the secretary of state and say we want to be included <e> <s> is it open to some smaller area of salmon fishing a small river a small loch which wants to have the protection and to be a part of all this to ask <e> <s> if so who asks <e>", "<cs> i should also like very much to support the amendment on the basis that it is after all giving power is not obligatory <e> <s> it should be allowed that if there is a clear unfairness the secretary of state as i understand the amendment has the power to change schedule as listed here <e> <s> the small river the small man should be given a chance if the secretary of state thinks that is right <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord can help me <e> <s> i am a little worried about the use of the word persons unless it covers various bodies as well as individuals <e> <s> i am all the more worried because the committee accepted the first amendment of the day moved by the noble lord lord ross of marnock to insert the words consulting such persons <e> <s> i assumed that persons covered institutions as well as individuals <e> <s> i should like to know that i am right about that <e> <s> i want to be sure that when under amendment no <e> <s> we talk about consulting such persons that phrase covers a body as such which may have individuals in it but which is a representative group and not a person as an individual <e> <s> i am seeking the definition of the word person <e>", "<cs> as a sometime first crown estate commissioner perhaps i can help the committee <e> <s> the fact is that in some estuaries the crown estate has total ownership but in others under charters given many centuries ago there are individuals who have the right for the sea bed in an area so it is only partially correct to refer to the crown estate <e>", "<cs> clearly a new problem has arisen in connection with these cages <e> <s> there is no clear authority as to who is to handle them <e> <s> it may be that this bill is not the right place for dealing with that at all but if the noble lord will examine the problem and advise us that this is a problem which is recognised and which has to be solved in some other way then i would be entirely content <e>", "<cs> i wonder if it might help if in connection with the first time this order is made so that we all have the opportunity to know what it is about it was made the subject of an affirmative resolution <e> <s> in that way we would have a chance from the very start to comment on it whereas otherwise it may as it were slip through without our knowing <e> <s> while in no way wishing to try to press the exact detail of it i am sure it would help the committee very much if we knew we would have another chance to comment on this at the time when the government have made up their minds and are preparing to make the order <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord gray of contin can help the committee <e> <s> i was not able to make a note of the other amendments that are being considered at the same time as amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i now realise that there is a list of the groupings and so i no longer need to bother the committee <e>", "<cs> before the movers of the amendments give their replies to the noble lord lord belstead i should like to point out that i noticed that he said that various matters would take a great deal of extra effort and cost <e> <s> i only hope that extra effort and cost will not stand in the way of achieving something <e> <s> there may be many technical difficulties however i have no doubt that not only for scotland but also for england and wales the desire is to stop salmon poaching and if necessary in some way or another money should be forthcoming <e> <s> however the excuse of extra effort and cost should not be allowed to be one of the factors which are taken into account <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord home that this must be undertaken on the basis of phasing out the practice <e> <s> as the noble lord lord tryon has just said it is important that the government should say were going to do it but well do it over a period of time <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross rightly asked about the netsmen and commented that they are going to do very much better <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord moran decides what to do i hope that at the end of the three years if it is to be a three-year period the government will not simply say that the catch has gone down from say to <e> <s> it must go relatively considerably further <e> <s> how to decide that is a question of judgment <e> <s> the fact is that the catch is going down already due to over-fishing <e> <s> so it has to be something more <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead used the words in the round <e> <s> that means if i understand it correctly that the reduction will be taken in relation to the overall position on salmon and that it will not simply be claimed that the amount has gone down a little <e> <s> that may mean nothing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead has said that he cannot go any further in his undertaking <e> <s> i find that a rather unhappy situation because he merely says that the government will review it at the end of three years <e> <s> review it to what end <e> <s> if the noble lord were to say we shall review it and if there is not a substantial reduction by the various methods that we are going to introduce we undertake then to take further measures i would go along with him <e> <s> however just to say that they will take certain measures and will then review the situation is to give no undertaking at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i go along very much with the two noble lords who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord gray says in relation to the first part of the amendment that it interferes with the ordinary planning authorities <e> <s> on the second part he says that we do not want general control of the abstraction of water <e> <s> that is all very well but what we are seeking to do in this bill is to ensure that the conservation of salmon is a key thought for all the bodies who have something to do with the rivers <e> <s> i do not think it is enough to say we will see if we cannot have a talk as the noble lord lord gray said <e> <s> i would have thought it was possible to say somewhere even in this bill perhaps that those who are concerned about this shall have a definite right to have their voices heard both in the abstraction of water and in regard to sand and gravel extraction <e> <s> if it is known as a specific part of the work of the planning authorities and so on then i think we are very much better off <e> <s> but really as i understand it just to say i will have a discussion but things are not really going to change does not seem to me to be good enough <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as a sometime first crown estate commissioner say to the noble lord lord burton that it is not true that the crown estate is interested only in the money that it can get out of these things <e> <s> it has many other considerations in mind which are essentially those of a responsible body with the fishing interests very much in its thoughts <e> <s> so i hope that that idea is totally removed from what your lordships may think <e>", "<cs> my lords

threaten us <e> <s> with the noble lord lord home and others i feel very much that the right thing to do is to allow consultation with the thought that at third reading the lord advocate will be

amendment <e> <s> i find myself very much in agreement with it <e> <s> i would express myself totally in support of it but for the fact that the noble lord lord belstead has an amendment that in many respects covers the same ground <e> <s> however there are two points which are not covered in lord belsteads amendment <e> <s> the first is that it does not cover the whole of great britain <e> <s> it is important that this aspect should be considered perhaps on the lines suggested by the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> secondly there is the word statistics <e> <s> it is of the greatest importance

to authorise museum charges <e> <s> i well remember that i supported him at that time and i need not rehearse again the reasons because in some degree they have been outlined by the noble lord lord

george-brown <e> <s> one can remember those things and yet one can hold ones position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble earl lord selkirk on this point because it is all very

unfortunately i could not be present at the second reading of this bill but of course i read with the greatest care all that went on and i noted as has been pointed out several times today that the bill was given a second reading by a large majority <e> <s> it was a large majority at nine oclock in the evening but never mind it was a large majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been told by the noble lord that i made two mistakes <e> <s> i accept that i made the first mistake <e> <s> it is not a bypass it is a relief road with all that that means <e> <s> on the second point i made no mistake <e> <s> i said that the amenities societies were against it and that is what counts not the tgwu <e> <s> that is all i wish to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i share with my noble friend lord selkirk his disappointment that things are as they are at present <e> <s> i have just been looking up what took place on report and the noble and learned lord lord cameron said that they had included a clause which would enable the board to have specific power to give advice to the secretary of state <e> <s> he went on to say that obviously this advice can include advice on the content of the regulations not that it will <e> <s> i am afraid that i have a rather nasty and suspicious mind about this situation in which they can include it but will not necessarily <e> <s> what is the good of something which just says that we can include it but does not undertake to do it <e> <s> it is all very well for the lord advocate to have said i can give an undertaking here and now that my honourable friend

only by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie but also by the noble earl lord selkirk and many others we are getting into what seems to me to be the heart of this matter namely that to try to make all housing association houses available for purchase goes too far <e> <s> the noble lord lord gray said that it was a wrecking amendment <e> <s> very well i will accept that on condition that when we get to the more particular cases such as that of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie the noble lord and the government should accept what we are trying to do in our amendments <e> <s> i have particularly in mind the question of charitable housing which comes up at a later date <e>", "<cs> having heard the last intervention of the noble lord lord ross of marnock i think it would help us all if the noble lord lord gray could tell us the magnitude of what we are talking about <e> <s> when i hear it said that such things are of importance for preservation reasons and so on i think it is hard for the committee to judge the merits on one side or the other without the facts <e> <s> if the noble lord would give us the information for which the noble lord lord ross asked that would be helpful <e> <s> i understand the amendment will not be pressed if he knows that at the report stage we shall be given further details <e>", "<cs> may i be clear about what the noble lord lord gray is saying <e> <s> as i understand it he said that there are flats which were constructed before <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i still ask the noble lord whether he could help us with the figures on report <e> <s> if only or of those were constructed before and if they were of a special quality that makes a difference <e>", "<cs> what we have heard from the noble lord lord gray is very important <e> <s> however i am not entirely happy that it goes as far as he wants <e> <s> i say that because as i understand it there will still be a difference between the practice in england and wales and the practice in scotland if that is right i wonder why <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the exchange which has taken place and i am very grateful to the various noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> i do not think at this late hour that it would be right to test the will of the committee <e> <s> however i feel very strongly that before the report stage the noble lord lord gray should find a reason which i certainly cannot imagine why scotland should be treated differently from england and wales <e> <s> the noble lord says that we might misuse our rights whereas the english and the welsh do not do so <e> <s> i am very unhappy with that argument <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said the government have given way <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot go along with that <e> <s> i support wholly the reasons that the noble earl lord selkirk has given for his amendment <e> <s> i recall that at <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> this is a terribly complicated situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord gray of contin wrote a letter to various noble lords outlining his proposals <e> <s> in that letter he said that he hoped we would agree this to be a fair and useful extension of the aims we had originally achieved in carrying the amendment on report <e> <s> therefore i too thank the minister for bringing forward the amendment <e> <s> all in all i think it is useful <e>", "<cs> my lords i have heard the case and in particular the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones mentioning the legal problems but all the same i have a feeling that we must do something <e> <s> at report stage the noble lord lord gray said that the government were going to wait <e> <s> they had come to the conclusion that it would be premature to consider the possibility of amendments until and unless it was demonstrated that local authorities were taking a different approach to the discharge of their responsibilities <e> <s> how long does one wait <e> <s> who judges <e> <s> does someone say now is the moment <e> <s> three or four cases have gone wrong and so we had better move or what <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in my name and in the name of the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> perhaps i may go back a little in history <e> <s> as soon as i learned that the amendment that we passed at report stage on may th which was a memorable day for me had been amended in another place i thought the right thing to do was to seek a compromise which still allowed new charitable housing associations to be set up in scotland in the same way as they are in england and wales but only after november which is the date inserted by the other place <e> <s> in other words i am proposing an addition to the other amendment and not an alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to thank noble lords from all sides of the house who helped me in supporting this amendment <e> <s> apart from the noble lord lord glenarthur there has been only one namely the noble baroness lady carnegy who argued against it <e> <s> in listening to her argument i felt that she was confusing what we are trying to do <e> <s> neither the noble earl lord selkirk nor myself nor many people who support this argument are against the right to buy far from it <e> <s> we have seen that happening and we think that that is fine <e> <s> we are trying to establish in a very limited field that where a charitable organisation a housing association has got over two hurdles the hurdle of the inland revenue and of the housing corporation is therefore genuinely for charitable purposes will not cheat as was suggested in one way or another but in this limited field wishes to go ahead and set up a new establishment i am clear in my own mind that as a matter of principle it should be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question <e> <s> another noble lord attempted to intervene during his speech and he said that if he allowed him to speak he would exceed his allotted time <e> <s> i do not know of a practice of the house which gives anybody an allotted time to speak and nor do i know how long the noble lord was given to speak this time <e> <s> i wonder whether he can help me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i was anxious to ensure that there was not some <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to many of the speakers in todays debate on the queens speech and most of them very properly have within home affairs talked on such matters as law and order health or education <e> <s> i was particularly glad to hear the speech of the noble viscount lord eccles on <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise rather unpremeditatedly because of a remark made by the noble viscount lord brookeborough <e> <s> he said that the cardinal is an evil man <e> <s> the noble baroness lady phillips queried his use of that adjective <e> <s> as i understand it the noble viscount said that he used the word in a subjective sense <e> <s> i do not know what that means <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply will give great pleasure to english heritage the british archaeological society the british museum to me and to many others <e> <s> is he further aware that in view of happenings such as the saga of the middleham jewel which was discovered a short while ago and whose fate is unknown we do not know

some of your lordships <e> <s> the committee was asked in particular to look at a report by the scottishtertiary education advisory council on the future strategy for higher education in scotland <e>

with the united states but also with europe <e> <s> we should not think just in terms of the united kingdom when in fact we are part of the european community <e> <s> i should particularly like to develop the point that was put forward by the noble lord lord home in his very fine opening speech about the importance of consultation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord taylor said that i had also had a letter from the national trust <e> <s> that is quite right <e> <s> i cannot speak to that letter because i lent it to him and he kept it <e> <s> i remember very clearly the national trust saying that if an amendment similar to this were not possible then the burden on it would be very very serious it might be or more <e> <s> i am sure that is not the wish of anybody <e> <s> we all know the great work the national trust does perhaps this amendment as it stands is not quite right <e> <s> it might open up certain matters which the noble lord lord burton mentioned <e> <s> i would not know about that <e>", "<cs> may i ask whether we have yet had amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister correctly <e> <s> if for example the government decided that teachers should have a per cent <e> <s> increase whereas the rpi was only per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> would the government take into account what had happened and make compensation to the local authorities to that extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say just this <e> <s> i shall be perfectly happy if the house so wishes to move my amendment and then to allow the statement <e> <s> the general debate could proceed afterwards <e>", "<cs> first of all <e> <s> i feel sure i should echo what the noble lord lord glenarthur has said and thank all those who have taken part in this very wide-ranging debate and those who without exception i believe have shown how very unhappy the whole committee is with the bill as it stands <e> <s> i think the whole chamber agrees on that <e>", "<cs> it seems to me there are really two questions here <e> <s> one is the great number and variety of the points made on various clauses and all that is connected with them <e> <s> that is quite clear and i am sure the committee will be grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for having undertaken to look at those <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may comment a little further <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for what he said <e> <s> i repeat that it seems to me that the issue of my amendment is very simple <e> <s> if it is faulty and it may well be then it is very easy at the report stage to change it having taken all sorts of points into consideration <e> <s> i received some encouragement when i understood the noble lord to say that even if in principle he accepted it he might want to change its presentation <e> <s> if that means that the amendment will almost certainly come forward in some form then i could not press it <e> <s> but if it means oh well well talk some more about it at another time i feel i have a duty to the overseas students and to the universities to ask that this amendment be accepted <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the reply of the minister <e> <s> it seems to me that the paragraph encourages registration officers not to answer <e> <s> i appreciate the point which the minister has made <e> <s> however i wonder whether he will look into providing some sort of mechanism to ensure that officers do answer <e> <s> the minister says ordinary people will do so <e> <s> however i have often found that it is difficult to get answers out of government departments <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the other members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> perhaps it will not surprise the minister to know that i am very much in agreement with what they are saying <e> <s> something which is as important as this should be in the bill and not in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear whether the minister wishes to answer the various points which have been raised by the noble lord lord morton or whether he wishes the house to concentrate on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to follow the noble lord lord grimond on the subject of scotland <e> <s> that is partly because he having decided to speak in the home affairs debate which was also my instinct shows that i was right to do that rather than to put my speech within a foreign affairs context <e> <s> one says that because the outcome of the election really seemed to show that we in scotland and some of the north as well are or want to be in a degree foreign to the rest of the country <e> <s> it is quite clear from the election results that scotland is extremely unhappy over what has been happening in the past eight years <e> <s> this afternoon i aim first to develop the reasons for that situation and secondly to suggest an immediate remedy which could help a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this question and the one preceding it with all respect to the noble baroness lady elliot are really not suitable as questions of the starred type and that it would be far more suitable if such very general questions were the

the house <e> <s> the last debate was years ago <e> <s> as a group we felt that years was rather a long time <e> <s> we have therefore suggested that this should be looked at regularly annually not

that suggestion but i am not sure that it is very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether it would be possible for those on the lists to be asked whether they agree before

different bill is coming to this house <e> <s> i fully understand part of what is going on but i wonder whether it is appropriate today to debate such an issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened

that there is a distinction between government bills and private bills <e> <s> all the same i want to put before your lordships what seems to me to be an issue of grave import from a constitutional angle <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one good feature in the governments policy on forestry <e> <s> it is that they have reaffirmed that they want to plant as a target hectares a year <e> <s> but to achieve this they have made some fundamental changes in fiscal arrangements which as i have listened to all noble lords today fill us with fear and gloom <e> <s> none of us knows for certain what is going to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to support the noble lord lord hughes <e> <s> i heard him say quite distinctly not-content <e> <s> i understand that

were accepted would be to take sections and <e> <s> i hope that as the noble earl said in the interests of general drafting and clarity these words which in no way change what is proposed will be

also worried because if the bill passes in its present form for england and wales we may find the same thing being attempted going backwards for scotland <e> <s> i would be very unhappy about that <e>", "<cs> my lords a year ago it seems like a long time we were considering the community charge for scotland <e> <s> at that time i led a compaign to have overseas students released from per cent <e> <s> of the liability <e> <s> a remarkable thing happened <e> <s> instead of that per cent <e> <s> the government agreed to per cent <e> <s> for all students <e> <s> the generous action of the government at that time is one of the happiest things i can remember <e>", "<cs> my lords first <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord sanderson for his apology about what happened last time <e> <s> i had had it already in writing from him and the leader of the house had also written <e> <s> i did not want to go any further except for one matter and that has now been met <e> <s> i was most anxious that it should not be a precedent for the future <e> <s> the government have given that undertaking and so on that basis let us forget it and let me say thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that what the noble lord lord sanderson has said goes a long way <e> <s> the question raised by the noble lord lord grimond is one of law <e> <s> i am quite clear that if one has an undertaking in the prospectus one will follow it through <e> <s> i believe that we should be well advised to accept the offer of the government knowing the powerful advocacy of the secretary of state and that he will act in the spirit of what we want and what appears here <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i am extremely unhappy with the reply <e> <s> i am sorry to say that that is no answer at all <e> <s> i went over the points that were made by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor with some care and why this amendment is quite different from what was proposed in the earlier stages <e> <s> i believe that we must somehow show that we scots feel very strongly about this question but i know that some of us cannot be here today <e>", "<cs> my lords safeguard and conserve are to me the two vital words in the unstarred question of the noble lord lord fanshawe about our artistic heritage <e> <s> i find myself in agreement with much that he said and indeed with much that almost all speakers have said particularly the noble lord lord strabolgi when he talked about the disgraceful behaviour of the rylands library which was must confess to the benefit of the national library of scotland of which i happen to be a trustee <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down did i understand him to say that the galleries should not buy great works of art because the public would not get their money back <e> <s> surely if such works of art are in galleries the public will more than get their money back by being able to enjoy them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise because there was some misunderstanding about the amendment <e> <s> my name as the noble lord lord morton said was on the amendment and i was not happy that that should be so for reasons i shall explain <e>", "<cs> my lords at second reading i do not recall that i took any part in the debate <e> <s> it did not seem to me that the bill was a matter of concern <e> <s> however suddenly one became aware that what i would call the scottish factor is of great importance and from that moment on in committee at report stage and even today we have been working to try to ensure that both ravenscraig and hunterston are taken care of in the future <e> <s> of course one can never he guaranteed of anything in this uncertain world particularly when it has something to do with commerce but i should like to think that the government have understood our anxieties <e> <s> i especially want to thank

last year in its present form <e> <s> i know it is the wish of one and all in the house that it will go forward from strength to strength <e> <s> i wish it well <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have pleasure in accepting the amendment <e> <s> i think that the wording is a little better than that which we put down for example in elevating us to a committee as opposed to a sub-committee <e> <s> the only difference is the addition of the welsh committee and it would be churlish of us to object to that <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as no surprise to your lordships that i intend to speak this afternoon about scotland and the significance of govan <e> <s> that happening was not perhaps foreseen at the time of the drafting of the queens speech <e> <s> the result was an extraordinary one <e>

as one of the suggestions <e> <s> i was very ready as was the noble lord lord grimond to go along with the idea so long as the government would look into the question which is what both he and i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the house it falls to me to congratulate the noble viscount lord daventry on his excellent and informative maiden speech <e> <s> it was not controversial but it put forward points with which we would all agree many of them original in thought <e> <s> he spoke of the importance of architecture and of smaller houses <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will wish to hear from the noble viscount more often because it is two years since he first had the opportunity of addressing your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to put to the noble earl a question of which i have given notice <e> <s> it relates to but is not the subject of the debate <e> <s> over two years ago the government undertook to make a study of the laws of treasure trove taking into account the modern means of finding treasures such as metal detecting and so forth <e> <s> they recognised the fact that there is an ever-increasing interest in archaeology <e> <s> i know that a working party has since been considering the matter and i realise that it is a difficult subject because many interests are concerned <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to tell the house that a report will be published in the near future because it is of the greatest importance that we preserve our treasures <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord rees that i suggested that there should be a once-for-all gift to be spread over five years because i recognise as well as he does that this is not something that can happen all at once with a solution forthcoming <e> <s> it must be done gradually <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving the motion standing in my name today perhaps i may start by explaining a little about its origins <e> <s> on the third day of the debate on the gracious speech which centred on home affairs the noble lord lord grimond and i spoke passionately not to say fervently about the almost universal demand in scotland at the present time for scots to have more say in their own affairs <e> <s> incidentally i am confident that that is a demand which will not go away <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and in particular the last speaker for his courteous regard to what everybody said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with many other noble lords in welcoming the fact that the noble lord lord annan opened the debate <e> <s> after hearing those who have spoken one realises the great need for such a debate to try to find ways to meet some of the troubles about which we have heard <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the efforts that the government are making to ensure a ceasefire will they consider going a little further and pressing the president of syria to make a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords how many times in a year may glasgow airport be shut <e> <s> prestwick because it is almost totally clear of any kind of fog enjoys a great advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the present fragile peace will her majestys government and other governments particularly those of the arab league now urge the syrian government and president assad publicly to accept resolution of the united nations which recognises lebanon a foundation member of the united nations as being an independent and sovereign state <e>", "<cs> the minister certainly satisfied me on amendments nos <e> <s> and but on amendment no <e> <s> he set out four safeguards against a wrong happening <e> <s> it may well be that one of them is effective <e> <s> however why cannot we have one further safeguard to avoid the risk of someone pulling a fast one against the government or the local authority <e> <s> we have in the past seen examples of bad deals <e> <s> it has generally been by the government or the local authority <e> <s> the further safeguard proposed in the amendment might be worth considering <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord carmichael has mentioned my name i should like to repeat that it would be very good if the minister could further reassure us <e> <s> it might be possible to do so at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime we have his words that the government are going to take mighty good care that nothing goes wrong in the way of assets being sold to the loss of the public good <e>", "<cs> my lords on the principle that if one has a legitimate grievance one should express it again and again i should say that i certainly support the noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord mackie of benshie in protesting that a friday should be chosen for this extremely important bill <e> <s> with that in mind i shall be brief <e> <s> perhaps that is what the government whips hoped of all of us when they tabled this business for a friday <e> <s> this is not good enough <e> <s> i hope that this protest which we have had to make often before will this time register <e>", "<cs> i regret the fact that the noble baroness lady carnegy is not here to move the <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments on both sides and i come down very much in favour of the amendment <e> <s> everyone wants school boards to be well experienced <e> <s> one can imagine that one or two will take the opportunity straightaway <e> <s> if that is the case i am told that the secretary of state may decide that they have a right to do so <e> <s> surely it would be much better for such school boards to realise that they have to show for a period of time that they are capable <e> <s> only then should we allow the school boards to go forward <e> <s> it has to be remembered always that there can be exceptions and that is allowed for in the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the balance of argument is very much in favour of those who want the amendment accepted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say how welcome the suggestion is that the government will consider a period of more than months even if they cannot agree to a four-year period <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a very important amendment <e> <s> having said that i am not clear whether i speak to amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however it is quite clear that we are embarking on a course of action which i favour namely that there should be self-government for schools if they want it <e>", "<cs> as i understand the ministers position for not making change it is because the secretary of state is the defence <e> <s> let us help the secretary of state <e> <s> we all accept that it is a matter of great importance <e> <s> it is a step which is significant for schools <e>", "<cs> as the minister said this is a very complicated clause <e> <s> when reading subsection forgetting paragraphs a and b i hope that the minister will explain what the following words mean <e> <s> i start with the term shall and finish with been given <e> <s> i have read the passage many times and i do not understand what it means <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i hope that he will pass on the information to others who are also concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides whether she will test the opinion of the committee perhaps the minister will think once again <e> <s> i understand that what we are trying to achieve in the amendment is that self-governing schools and local authority schools should be treated in a similar way <e> <s> a comparable way is i think the phrase used <e>", "<cs> before the debate continues perhaps i may ask the minister whether there is any provision in the bill as drafted that the change should not take place within a given number of years <e> <s> if there is not such a provision it appears that the proposed new clause has a value <e> <s> i do not say that the period should be seven years five years or any particular period but it is important that the school and children should not be subject to constant <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take up the ministers reply <e> <s> i understand that a situation might arise which demands prompt action <e> <s> at the same time could there not be a provision under which there would ordinarily be a period of <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the important point made by the noble duke was that the scottish office and the hierarchy are in agreement <e> <s> therefore there is nothing hole in the corner about this amendment <e> <s> of course while i understand the problems that can arise surely it is in everybodys best interests that reasons for objecting or indeed not allowing should be made public <e> <s> that must be good rather than matters being kept under cover as it were <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i was very much struck by what the minister said when he pointed out that the amendment as drafted does not wholly reflect the purpose behind it <e> <s> the amendment provides for at least two years whereas earlier it was just two years <e> <s> when one comes on to the next part or until such time i assume that that means for a lesser period <e> <s> am i right in now thinking that it means a longer period <e> <s> if so i think it is difficult to go forward on this and i ask for elucidation on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords while it may be true that the amendment is not necessary it is one which i think would help the parents <e> <s> it may be very important for them to know whether the board have in mind any change in admission policy or as the noble lord lord grimond said some special direction in which they plan to go <e> <s> i see no harm in accepting that those two matters which seem to be about the most important for any future of the school be put down as guidance at the present time <e> <s> i hope that the minister will give the amendment in some form or other favourable consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that half a loaf is better than none <e> <s> nevertheless before i withdraw the amendment in the light of the ministers remarks i should like to point out to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel that i accept in certain circumstances that the secretary of state could decide otherwise <e> <s> however l am only explaining my point and it is not important <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not meant to speak on second reading but there is one item in this bill which has compelled me to do so <e> <s> but first i should like to say one word on what i would call the bill in general <e> <s> i am a catholic <e> <s> our views have been well explained by the noble duke the duke of norfolk <e> <s> in brief i believe that life begins at conception at the beginning of the embryo and after that there should be no experimentation on it for life is then human and sacred <e> <s> to me as to many others there is no such thing as the term pre-embryo on which experimentation should be allowed <e> <s> from the very start an embryo is an embryo and that is that <e> <s> the noble baroness lady ryder expanded on this most successfully and properly <e> <s> all the same i deeply respect those who hold different views in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two minutes left <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson was correct <e> <s> we should have had three debates <e> <s> i thank all your lordships who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> they managed most skilfully to keep within their time limits and made invaluable contributions with regard to the arts and the department of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i was totally unaware that the answers to the questionnaire had been placed in the printed paper office in november <e> <s> i was one of the people who answered the questionnaire <e> <s> may i ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first and this is about treasure trove in the main will the minister consider passing the answers to the questionnaire to all who replied in the early days or at least advise them that the answers to the questionnaire are available <e> <s> my second question is this have the government made any commentary on the answers either in the questionnaire or with it <e> <s> for example have they explained why they do not intend to introduce any change in the treasure trove laws except as regards scheduled sites <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the noble lord answered one part of my original question <e> <s> it was this will the minister not only consider that your lordships should know that the answers to the questionnaire are in the printed paper office of this house but will he also advise those who answered the questionnaire and not on a discretionary basis that the answers are available on demand <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate on this amendment and it seems to me that there is a very genuine worry on the part of those who tabled the amendment and those who have spoken in its support that is the question of the meaning of the word treatment <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy <e> <s> i heard the comments of the noble lord lord walton who is far more knowledgeable <e> <s> he asked that his amendment be pursued and not those which i and other members have tabled <e> <s> he did so on the basis that the hamster test has greater accuracy than others <e> <s> that is no argument for what i and many others believe to be shocking namely the mixing of human sperm with that of another animal thereby creating another living thing <e> <s> it is no good to say that the embryo will not live <e> <s> the words are contained in <e>", "<cs> i agree and we have heard from the eminent noble lord lord walton that there are other methods <e> <s> i am reluctant to do so but believe that i must test the opinion of the committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment on the basis that the authority will become another quango <e> <s> i can see the time when the secretary of state or her majestys government are asked questions to which they will say it is not our affair <e> <s> we have seen so many other cases <e> <s> i see no reason why this amendment should result in any diminution in the authority of the authority <e> <s> somehow we need to have parliament and therefore the secretary of state responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am disappointed in the reply of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> in a sense however i am not surprised <e> <s> i beg him to realise the support which i have received from all sides of the house <e> <s> he has argued that my amendment might detract from the provisions <e> <s> it cannot be said to do that <e> <s> it states that the report shall include it does not say that it shall only deal with those matters <e> <s> therefore surely it is necessary and right that items of such importance should be covered and that we should know that they will be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord <e> <s> on the assumption to be drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> the government may say that this issue is already covered by paragraph of schedule <e> <s> however although i understand the words in the subparagraph they are nonetheless worrying <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will allow me to speak first <e> <s> as amendments nos <e> <s> and standing in my name are related to this amendment it is appropriate i believe that i should speak first <e> <s> as the noble lord lord walton rightly explained when we discussed this matter in committee i found the idea of human sperm being mixed with the eggs of another animal so repugnant that i tried to move an amendment to delete the practice altogether <e> <s> however your lordships argued strongly that the hamster test was an important method of testing fertility <e> <s> i took my amendment to a division but lost <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may rise to say a few words about what i understand is a matter of procedure <e> <s> i was very happy that amendment no <e> <s> was to be taken with amendment no <e> <s> b the amendment that we are now discussing <e> <s> however that was done on the understanding that the words in directions would be further considered in the light of the assurance that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has given <e> <s> i rise because i understand that under the procedure if the amendment is accepted i cannot talk about amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> that is why i intervened at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to welcome the amendment and say thank you to both the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and to the noble baroness lady hooper for having given effect to an anxiety of mine and i think of others in the house namely that we should know as far as possible every detail not only of what the authority has done in the past but of what it plans for the future <e> <s> the amendment gives effect to that <e> <s> it gives us a chance if after report we think it appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords again i have to say how grateful i am for the amendment which has been put forward <e>

to comment on an article which appeared in a newspaper which has been referred to and which is of great importance <e> <s> in a sense it relates to the bill but the cardinal is not here to reply <e> <s> it is something i would commend to noble lords to read and to reach their own conclusions and leave it at that <e> <s> it was the article of friday th march <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have decided that the human embryo can up to days be used for medical research <e> <s> i remain deeply sad at the consequences for the future of this position <e> <s> i wish to express one very strong hope and it is this if the bill goes through more or less in its present form in another place i hope that it will in no way discourage or lessen the other avenues of medical research as instanced by the noble duke who spoke about experimentation on grown-ups <e> <s> because medical research is possible on embryos it would be tragic if there was less research conducted into other avenues <e> <s> i wish to make that point most strongly <e>", "<cs> my lords i still believe that he did all that was appropriate but i am not going to speak for the chief rabbi <e> <s> i am extremely unhappy at what is going forward to another place <e> <s> i shall not rehearse my reasons for that <e> <s> it is well known that i am a roman catholic and like a lot of other people of other faiths i have been upset

do things that way <e> <s> one has to answer certain questions <e> <s> i know about this in a very small way because my wife and i set up a small charitable trust <e> <s> very soon we had a request from the registrar to explain it which is a voluntary procedure <e> <s> the first year we paid no attention to it the second year we found that we had to act <e>", "<cs> i want to make a few remarks on the question of churches <e> <s> i believe that they are in a different category to other charities and that in some form or another that difference should be recognised <e> <s> it is not so much a question of their being burdened by new responsibilities or anything else the fact of the matter is that the parishioners of any particular individual group of churches will already discipline themselves <e> <s> if something goes wrong one can be quite sure that the minister or the parishioners will know about it <e> <s> they will put the matter right themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to make one point and only one point <e> <s> having heard the speech of the noble viscount lord eccles who made my point so well and so skilfully i hesitated before i rose to speak <e> <s>

european community including for example how eastern european countries and russia will join in with us <e> <s> but whatever the developments may be it is vital this is my point which was also made by the noble viscount lord eccles that the usa remains involved <e>", "<cs> i support noble lords who have said that it appears odd suddenly to find that all one can appeal about is expenses and nothing else because one does not know about other factors <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble and learned lord will as asked think again <e>", "<cs> i agree with those who advocate a longer period <e>

this matter is not a question for dispute <e> <s> i hope that the government will bear in mind how all sides of the committee have advocated leaving the period at two years and changing from five years to three years <e>", "<cs> is there not room for compromise <e> <s> one year is a short period <e> <s> it is a question of easy come easy go <e> <s> can we not say one-and-a-half years <e> <s>

marriage is something of a sacrament <e> <s> even those to whom it is not enter it i hope with great seriousness <e> <s> i hope that the period will be a little longer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has made what seems to me a most interesting personal suggestion namely that the government should hold inter-party consultation on those matters which are of the gravest importance for the whole country and on which our future depends <e> <s> i hope that the government will consider that personal suggestion most carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that he agrees that the provisions in subsection a b and c will be included <e>", "<cs> my lords that is equivalent to shall <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the minister said <e> <s> he began by saying that it would be a mistake to apply the social angle to the whole of scotland and that the highlands and islands are totally or recognisably different <e> <s> he then went on to say that he recognised also that some parts of the country which are not highlands and islands were akin to them <e> <s> if that is the case and of course it is the case as many members of the committee have pointed out will he consider the introduction of a clause which includes a social function but which should only apply if the secretary of state for scotland agrees <e>", "<cs> i am a little
