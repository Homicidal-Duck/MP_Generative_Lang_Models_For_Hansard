["<cs> my lords first of all i note that lord winstanleys motion is very carefully worded in that the first impression on reading it is that it directly accuses the national health service as such as going wrong but more careful study reveals that it does not specify who is responsible <e> <s> the general impression easily accepted is that the nhs itself is at fault and with this i wish to protest strongly <e> <s> there is little doubt that there is much wrong with the service that it provides but is this the sole fault of the service or something else <e> <s> it is not so long ago that we were being told that the nhs was the best in the world and that we could be proud of it <e> <s> how does it come about that now it is said to be running to seed <e>"]
