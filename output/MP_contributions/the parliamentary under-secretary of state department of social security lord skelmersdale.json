["<cs> my lords the retirement of the director of the dhss funded general practice research unit at the institute of psychiatry and the forthcoming retirements of the two medical research council unit directors provides the opportunity for restructuring the three programmes <e> <s> our objective is to fund research of high scientific quality with the potential to improve the treatment and care available to patients by means of the establishment of a new social psychiatry research unit <e> <s> the dhss intends to fund a significant programme of work at that unit <e>", "<cs> my lords the first report is expected to be laid before the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords speech therapy is one of the services which it is the duty of health authorities to provide under the national health services act <e> <s> as a result of your lordships consideration of the education reform bill local education authorities in england and wales will have a power to provide funds for speech therapy services <e>", "<cs> my lords that was an inspiring speech if ever i heard one <e> <s> it was forcefully put <e> <s> it illustrates the dilemma which has been alluded to all around the house with respect to leaving out this subsection <e> <s> my noble friend lord trafford the noble lord lord adrian and my noble friend lord beloff all agreed that reasonable exploitation should not be curtailed <e> <s> i rather think that the noble earl thought so too although the noble lord lord ennals who made an excellent lieutenant to the noble earl in his absence earlier today would perhaps not feel like that <e> <s> there is a distinct danger if we pass the amendment that we shall be throwing out the baby with the bathwater and many noble lords have said today that that is not desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is to make income support available to eligible individuals entering accommodation for respite care <e> <s> where this accommodation is a hostel they are entitled to help towards the charge plus meals up to a limit of or if they are elderly or disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the up-rating of social security benefits currently being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to remember that it was less than a week ago that in answer to a supplementary question on the up-rating statement from my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i said that your lordships regularly target your thoughts on disabled people <e> <s> little did i think then that we would be returning so immediately to this group of disadvantaged people <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and his committee for the hard work that they have put into investigating the second action programme for the integration of disabled people <e> <s> i have to tell the house and on this occasion it does not mean that your lordships will not like what is coming that <e>", "<cs> my lords good facts bear repeating bad facts do not <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord winstanley has said on th july miss sharon campbell walked in to the office of miss isabel schwarz a social worker at bexley hospital kent produced a knife and stabbed miss schwarz to death <e> <s> why <e> <s> the government set up the inquiry into the care and after-care of miss sharon campbell to get the facts in spite of the bexley local authority internal inquiry which had been going on <e> <s> it is the government inquiry which is the subject of the noble lords unstarred question tonight <e> <s> this painstaking inquiry as the noble lord lord ennals described it was carried out by an independent committee chaired by mr john spokes qc who published his report on th july <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is a painstaking report <e>", "<cs> my lords since the start of the new scheme over claims have been received <e> <s> at the end of november over families were receiving family credit <e> <s> in addition about claims were in hand but in of these we were waiting for replies to inquiries from employees or claimants <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> an rpi uprating of child benefit would have meant an extra p per child <e> <s> instead as i explained to the house on tuesday we have more than compensated for the standstill in child benefit by increasing family credit by an extra p per child over and above the uprating for prices <e>", "<cs> my lords since june unemployment has on the consistent seasonally adjusted basis fallen by <e> <s> it is now at its lowest level for well over seven years <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that during questions yesterday i misled the house in answer to a supplementary question from the noble lord lord callaghan of cardiff <e> <s> i mistakenly asserted that unemployment was rising in when in fact unemployment continued to fall until the autumn of that year <e> <s> i am very sorry that that obviously caused annoyance and confusion to the noble lord and to all your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords we are making good progress in implementing the act <e> <s> six key sections are now in force <e> <s> the first report under section will be laid late next year <e> <s> we have agreed with the local authority associations that section is the next priority and we are discussing its resource implications with them <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in addition to our own as yet incomplete monitoring the government have recently received a number of reports on the effects of the current level of support for young people who have valid reasons for living independently <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are reviewing the position of the may day bank holiday but no decision has yet been taken <e> <s> we are looking at a wide range of options <e>", "<cs> my lords in the latest year for which the most useful figures are available the estimated number of new registrations for value-added tax was <e> <s> the net increase in that year was or nearly a week on average <e> <s> the indications are that the rate of increase during has been faster perhaps as much as per week <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with much interest to the helpful and constructive points made by noble lords during the course of this important debate <e> <s> when we started i thought that unanimity would break out in the chamber but clearly that was not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords although there have in the past been difficulties for trawlers and other fishing craft in the landing of their catches at grimsby i understand that there are at present no operational problems in this respect <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords women are taking full advantage of the favourable economic climate created by the government <e> <s> since there has been an increase of over million in the number in paid work and an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the number working full time <e> <s> since the number of women in self-employment in the united kingdom has more than doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are pleased to announce that they have provided assistance to the value of in the form of rent-free accommodation at their premises in london for the project manager of the global secretariat of the united nations global project <e>", "<cs> my lords if i learnt nothing else in the period when my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer was secretary of state for energy and i was the spokesman in your lordships house it was the art of timing <e> <s> i do not recall the noble baroness lady turner as a fellow disciple but the house will recognise her lucky timing in having her debate only eight days after the budget on which views have emerged on all sides of the chamber in varying shades of grey tinged on one or two occasions with the green of envy <e> <s> all that money wasted on repaying the national debt seems to be the theme behind some of the speeches i have heard opposite <e> <s> nonetheless i genuinely congratulate the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the abolition of the earnings rule is good <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have approved an application by the north dorset district council for a small-scale trial of the biological insecticide bti against the dorset or blandford fly as it is more commonly known <e> <s> this trial will take place in a side channel of the river stour as soon as conditions permit <e>", "<cs> my lords the introduction of the social fund is the first time that the social security system has specifically directed help to supporting the policy of care in the community for vulnerable groups <e> <s> i am pleased to report that people have been helped with community care grants in the social funds first year <e> <s> we have of course fulfilled our pledge to monitor the whole of the social security reforms and the social fund is no exception <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house not just those few of your lordships in the chamber at this moment will be most grateful to the noble baroness lady phillips for introducing this bill on a subject that is of mounting interest not only to all those concerned with the labour market and the future supply of skilled people but also to those like the noble lord lord mccarthy who said he was forced to think this subject out from first principles <e> <s> i do not think that anyone would disagree in their heart of hearts that age discrimination is unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of social securitys highly complex billion strategy for the computerisation of the social security benefit payment systems is proceeding to the accelerated timetable announced on nd november <e> <s> the major systems for the payment of pensions and income support are being piloted in local offices to ensure they are running smoothly before national implementation starts in autumn this year <e> <s> all central and local offices will be computerised by august <e>", "<cs> my lords no government of any political persuasion have ever accepted that it is possible to have a simple definition of poverty <e> <s> there is no doubt that there are and always have been disadvantaged people in society and that is why the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords our policy is to ensure that the department of social security provides a good service for the public both as customers and as taxpayers in the most cost-effective way <e> <s> my right honourable friends remarks to which the noble earl refers were simply intended to illustrate that it is possible to provide the same level of service more cost-effectively by improving the efficiency of the operation <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent estimates were that if the community charge had been in operation across great britain in the year the cost of the rebate scheme would have been million in scotland and million in england and wales <e> <s> however we expect to revise these estimates shortly <e> <s> actual expenditure next year will of course depend on the actual levels at which the charge is set and on the uprating of benefit levels <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government regularly review industrial relations law in a manner consistent with the step-by-step approach that they have adopted over the past years <e> <s> they bring forward proposals as and when necessary <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for employment is currently reviewing the law in relation to industrial action with a view to issuing a consultative document later <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the length of this answer <e> <s> it is caused by the fact that two totally separate matters arise from the question on the order paper namely the future for hostels run by local authorities and charities and the resettlement units run by the department of social security <e> <s> for the former from october the special rates of income support for hostel dwellers will cease <e> <s> instead like people living in board and lodging accommodation they will become eligible for normal income support rates plus housing benefit to help with accommodation costs <e>", "<cs> my lords without in any way wishing to curtail the debate i thought it would be helpful to the house especially in view of the speech that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has just made if i at this stage put forward the governments plans concerning help for these most unfortunate of people so movingly described by the noble lords lord carter and lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> as i told my noble friend the duke of norfolk in committee concerning attendance allowance for the terminally ill we are not afraid to act as promptly as circumstances allow <e> <s> on this matter of mobility allowance for the deaf/blind and the mentally handicapped i cannot stress too strongly that we are wanting to act willing to act but waiting to act <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord young pointed out earlier this week the statutory training system in general has not worked <e> <s> therefore the chairman of each industrial training board has been asked to bring forward by the end of the month proposals for future arrangements that command the support of employers in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl put down with others a very similar amendment at committee stage <e> <s> evidently i failed then to explain why the government believe that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> i share the noble earls concern that claimants should not suddenly and unexpectedly find themselves without benefit <e> <s> we have ensured that this will not happen and i hope i can reassure the house <e> <s> the safeguard is in the way in which the employment service and the independent adjudicating officers will operate the new condition <e> <s> the process we have agreed on has been outlined a number of times both by myself and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reasons be now considered <e>"]
