["<cs> my lords i must be honest and it is not very often that i am and say that i did not expect to get so much sympathy and understanding from the government when i originally tabled the amendment <e> <s> i am therefore very grateful to them <e> <s> as i understand it we shall have an order after the act has been published <e> <s> of course i need hardly tell them and hope that the wine does not turn sour in their mouths that i would have preferred my amendment because that tics the ministers down <e> <s> but believe it or not i understand the difficulty that if the government accepted my amendment they might offend my noble friend lord mottistone which i would not like to do <e> <s> i hope that the governments attitude of generosity and thought will be displayed when i move my next amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw <e>"]
