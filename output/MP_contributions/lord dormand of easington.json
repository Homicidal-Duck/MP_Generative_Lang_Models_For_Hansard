["<cs> my lords the first debate i heard when i came to your lordships house three weeks ago was on the procedures of the house <e> <s> one matter that soon became clear was that shorter speeches would not only be welcome but would add to the efficiency of your lordships house <e> <s> for the past six years it has been my privilege to be chairman of the parliamentary labour party <e> <s> during that period one of my continuing tasks was to encourage shorter speeches at meetings of the parliamentary labour party <e> <s> bearing in mind those experiences i hope that the brevity at least of my first contribution to your lordships deliberations will be welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ensure that the training includes how to deal with disputes between boards of governors and local education authorities and between boards of governors and the department of education and science <e> <s> the minister can be assured that under the misguided measure called the education reform bill such disputes will increase to a great degree <e>", "<cs> my lords have we not heard the most revealing sentence a real example of letting the cat out of the bag by the secretary of state <e> <s> he said that the government are committed to returning to the private sector successful state industries such as steel <e> <s> is that not another way of saying that some fat profits will be made by certain people in the city <e> <s> is there not now ample evidence of shortcomings in the governments privatisation programme <e> <s> will they give a little more consideration to the country as a whole and not simply to profit-making <e> <s> in a recent debate on this question noble lords on all sides of the house showed that this was not just a question of certain people making money <e> <s> will the secretary of state give further consideration to this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the complacency of that reply may i remind the minister that after eight years of this government <e>", "<cs> if that is so may i tell the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask him whether if that happens the results will be devastating for the northern region <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is no begging-bowl attitude in the northern region as demonstrated by the joint initiative taken by the employers the trade unions and the local authorities in setting up the northern development company <e> <s> as that company could be quite crucial in the development of the northern region will the minister consider giving increased aid in addition to the rather meagre help which has been given in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the overall drop in the number of positive breath tests and accidents <e> <s> does the minister agree that the reduction is small and that is some parts of the country the figures increased considerably <e> <s> is not the main lesson to be learnt i think that the minister has already said this that there are no grounds for complacency <e> <s> is the time not now appropriate to introduce random breath testing <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the improvement brought about by this short campaign will the government now consider continuing the campaign against drink-driving <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that there is a considerable problem so far as grant is concerned with the to -year-old group <e> <s> many young people of that age are prevented from going on to further education because of lack of financial support <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that the settlement made in december last year does nothing to improve the situation <e> <s> can it be reexamined <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that in some way either by regulation or by local authority description the duties of a home help move from domestic duties to what he calls personal care <e> <s> if that is so many of us on this side will be very surprised indeed <e> <s> the duties are very different indeed <e> <s> the reputation of home helps is very high indeed <e> <s> many of them undertake duties far beyond their remit <e> <s> but it is a very different thing for the minister to be saying that we can regard these matters in fact i use the word officially as being part of the duties of a home help <e> <s> perhaps he would like to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that a figure of million people unemployed is a disgrace in a modern society <e> <s> is he further aware that the worst feature of unemployment figures is the number of long-term unemployed and that within the past two years two independent reports have shown a distinct link between long-term unemployment and ill health <e> <s> in view of the fact that the government have been in power for nine years what does the secretary of state think has been the reason for the failure to reduce unemployment to a reasonable level <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that if unemployment continues to decrease at the rate which he has just given to the house it will take at least years and probably years assuming that the decrease continues as my noble friend says to return to the level which this government inherited in <e> <s> is that anything to be proud of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that there is a long-term net gain to the national health service from money spent on health education <e> <s> i appreciate that in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the government abolished the health education council which had carried out splendid work and constituted the health education authority in its place it became known as the ministers poodle <e> <s> how does he refute that accusation <e>", "<cs> the question of other loyalties is raised from time to time and indeed the two members of the committee who have just spoken have said that <e> <s> they have mentioned entirely properly the responsihilty of an employee to his family the teacher to his pupils and nurses to their patients <e> <s> one could continue with such illustrations <e> <s> however perhaps members who have spoken will feel that this is a legitimate point <e> <s> the people in all of the categories which we have mentioned are aware on joining a union that any action whether industrial or of any other kind will almost automatically mean that their charges be it family pupils or patients will be affected <e> <s> in other words joining a union is a premeditated act <e> <s> they know that that will happen <e>", "<cs> in view of the kind of case put forward by the noble lord and the kind of members we are talking about perhaps he will accept that when an increase in wages shorter hours or longer holidays are negotiated those members will not say to themselves i am not fully behind the union in certain circumstances i had better not accept the advantages which the union has just negotiated <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the somersault in the governments economic policy how much importance do they place on m as an indicator of money supply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that british coal enterprise ltd is failing to provide alternative employment to the extent that in the coalfields the operation is regarded with the utmost cynicism and many consider it to be a confidence trick <e> <s> the government and bce are constantly telling us about their huge success in providing alternative jobs <e> <s> therefore why are they refusing to provide the number of jobs which have been lost in the coalfields <e>", "<cs> my lords in commenting on the reply given by the minister i should like to point out that i did not suggest that british coal enterprise ltd is dishonest <e> <s> does the minister not agree that in the light of million plus having been provided to british coal enterprise ltd it should not be afraid to reveal the statistics <e> <s> does that not show some guilt that it is not providing the jobs in the coalfield areas as my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that nursery education is important for all children and that in some cases it can be critically important <e> <s> in view of the fact that compulsory provision is a long way off and in view of the fact that the minister has just said that only per cent <e> <s> of our children have the benefit of nursery education will the government consider introducing an incentive scheme for those leas which are keen to expand their present nursery education <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will realise that most of us know that nursery provision is not compulsory but my supplementary question was whether in those circumstances and in view of the minister having admitted that the government feel that nursery education is a good thing the government are prepared to provide any kind of incentive to help those leas which are prepared to help themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature of the crisis in the national health service at the present time is such that this debate is about the political philosophies of the government and the opposition <e> <s> as i see it that is at the very heart of our debate today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the most important aspect of this examination is that it is a different kind of examination <e> <s> in those circumstances having regard to what some people have said about the shortage of time quite apart from materials is she satisfied with <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those disgraceful figures that the secretary of state has just announced are the most serious condemnation of the governments economic policies <e> <s> does he recall that one of his noble colleagues sitting on the bench with him in a recent answer to a question concerning long-term unemployment said that it took a little while for government programmes to take effect <e> <s> those were his words <e> <s> as the government have now had absolute power for almost nine years and as the figures that the secretary of state has just given are six times the number of those in when the government assumed office will he give an estimate of when we are likely to return to the long-term unemployed figures of <e>", "<cs> my lords i was saddened that the secretary of state should suggest that i do not live in the real world <e> <s> i say to him with great respect <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that as someone who has lived in the north of england for most of his life perhaps i am more in the real world than he is <e> <s> will he now attempt to answer the question <e> <s> i accept the figures he has given but the government having had nine years of absolute power can we have an estimate of when we shall get back to the situation in <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state accept that this country has some of the finest film makers in the world <e> <s> does he also agree that the effect of the facts he has given is to terminate government help towards the film industry <e> <s> as the abolition of the national film finance corporation the eady levy and the per cent <e> <s> tax capital allowances among other things have caused unforeseen circumstances in the film industry does he agree that there ought now to be some fiscal incentives given to the film industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that i thought he would refer to the success of the last emperor <e> <s> he is quite right that most of the finance came from hill samuel <e> <s> is he further aware that that was the th financial institution which the producer approached <e> <s> he has said publicly that had that finance not been available the film would not have been made <e> <s> does the secretary of state recall a statement made in the white paper on film policy which said that the industry has an importance and influence both in our national life and internationally which is out of all proportion to its size <e> <s> does that still apply <e> <s> will he therefore not give further consideration to financial incentives <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord stockton called in aid what he said was the view of the north eastern teacher associations <e> <s> i am very surprised at what he said <e> <s> i come from the north-east <e> <s> i have been in education all my life there i keep in close touch with them and i am glad to say that they keep in close touch with me <e> <s> in the north-east the feelings of all the organisations with which i keep in touch are very much against the bill <e> <s> i very much hope that the house will not accept the view that there is strong support for the bill as the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> my lords i took due note of that <e> <s> the noble earl read the aims and objectives <e> <s> i do not think that there is any difference between the two sides of the house on the aims and objectives <e> <s> what we are concerned about in the bill is how to set about achieving them <e> <s> that is why we on the opposition benches are so opposed to it <e>", "<cs> my lords apropos hmis does not the minister agree that it would be a good idea if they returned to schools for teaching from time to time <e> <s> i have the highest regard for hmis i have had a lot to do with them <e> <s> but is the minister aware that teachers in schools dealing with day-to-day problems feel that hmis from time to time become a little remote <e> <s> can the des and the minister in particular give some thought to that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i point out to the secretary of state that he has partly replied to the theme of the short contribution which i now intend to make <e> <s> i thought that it would be more in order to make my remarks at this stage having heard the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says million so perhaps he is right and i am wrong but that is the price give or take a million or two <e> <s> that move seems to suggest that once again the government are merely flying kites and are not taking the matter of relocation seriously <e> <s> we should not be surprised at that <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the problems of the inner cities does not the minister agree that there are continuing major difficulties in urban and rural areas involving unemployment housing infrastructure and other matters <e> <s> in such circumstances is the minister satisfied in the answer that he has just given me that the balance of assistance from government between inner cities and urban and rural areas is correct particularly in those areas which are unable to attract private capital <e> <s> that balance is really what i am stressing <e>", "<cs> that is a question for the minister as my amendment has been adopted <e> <s> however speaking as a former education administrator my short answer would be the beginning of the school year or as soon as possible i think that is the normal phrase used in legislation after the implementation of the act <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord has misunderstood the situation completely <e> <s> that is not my view <e>", "<cs> i answered the question quite clearly <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will get on with his speech and we shall see how it compares with mine <e>", "<cs> i am very conscious of the fact that we are now in the most important hour of the evening <e> <s> i shall therefore be very brief <e> <s> at least three noble lords opposite used the word ideological and applied it to my speech <e> <s> i make no apology for that <e> <s> it was put very succinctly by my noble friend lord peston <e> <s> i happen to be a member of this house and i was a member of the other house because i am a socialist <e> <s> i make no apologies for that <e> <s> in the same way noble lords opposite should not make any apologies for their conservatism <e> <s> that is what i thought parliamentary democracy in this country was all about <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may have misunderstood at least part of what i said <e> <s> the main thrust was that these would be not personal appointments but representative of the teachers organisations <e> <s> if the noble baroness infers that there would be a certain number of nut amma and pat representatives that is not correct <e> <s> i am saying that the teachers on the councils would be representative of their associations <e> <s> this has been done many times in the education world <e> <s> the teaching unions would decide among themselves who would represent the teaching profession as a whole <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i found the ministers reply to the amendment somewhat peculiar <e> <s> the first part seemed to indicate that a regional dimension is not being explicitly named here <e> <s> the minister called in aid something i said in moving the amendment that if it is a national curriculum there cannot be a regional consideration <e> <s> the latter part of the reply seemed to suggest that there can be such a dimension but that it is not necessary to spell it out <e> <s> i note that the minister is nodding which presumably means that my interpretation of her reply is correct <e> <s> whether the government say it or not therefore as i said in moving the amendment there will be a regional dimension to teaching in schools and long may it be so <e> <s> it is such things that make teaching come alive <e> <s> it is related to the immediate experience of children <e> <s> at some stage i hope that we can have a clear statement by the minister that this is a desirable and effective part of education <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend referred to me nodding my head perhaps i had better say that the open enrolment to which he refers is of course governed by such things as staffing and by physical facilities <e> <s> but having said that what my noble friend has said is correct <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to mention a factor which does not seem to have been mentioned so far in the debate <e> <s> it concerns the amount of money which is to be delegated <e> <s> i have experience of one authority which was very generous indeed and where there was no problem in getting all the textbooks and the exercise books and other things that were wanted <e> <s> in my experience of governing bodies the governors on the whole were very happy because their schools were getting all of the equipment that they wanted <e> <s> if they wanted an extra classroom built they would have to make recommendations but they would get a very sympathetic hearing <e>", "<cs> my noble friend says definitely not <e> <s> surely that is the crucial point <e> <s> this government both in this chamber and in another place tell us that the country has not been more prosperous for many many years <e> <s> let me say at once that i have no objection in principle to delegation but it seems to me that if there is an adequate amount of money to be delegated so that governors can make worthwhile decisions that is a different matter but i suspect that that will not be the case <e>", "<cs> it may be asking a great deal of the minister but i wonder whether he is prepared to say how a schools overall budget is determined <e> <s> for example would the minister say that if according to the numbers on the roll there ought to be six teachers on the basis of pupils per class or something of that order the governors could say no we should only have five or four teachers and spend the rest of the money improving the school playing field or getting another couple of acres on to the school playing field or something of that nature <e> <s> if that is the kind of flexibility which will be given to governors i think many people including parents will have grave doubts about it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the minister has covered the essential points which are made in the amendments <e> <s> while not pressing the amendment now i shall certainly return to it at a later stage <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the reasons for so little having been done practically to implement all the provisions of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the first part of her answer was rather odd because the warnock report was published before the act <e> <s> perhaps she will look at her answer again <e> <s> is she aware that the real reason such little progress has been made is the lack of a definite commitment on the part of the government to the integration of handicapped children into what might be described as the normal education system <e> <s> in those circumstances will she consider as a matter of urgency convening a meeting of all interested parties to consider what immediate steps can be taken to implement the more important parts of the act <e>", "<cs> it may be of no comfort to the minister to know that i am not only the worst mathematician in this chamber but the worst mathematician in the whole country and i can understand it <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord is far too intelligent to tell us what he is really about here <e> <s> i suspect that there is something behind it <e>", "<cs> any obfuscation would arise from the inability of or deliberate action by the government not to proceed in the manner suggested by the amendment <e> <s> the ministers reply is completely unsatisfactory <e> <s> he has not addressed the central requirement of the amendment <e> <s> he has not dealt with what i said in moving it in terms of parents needing to be informed about what is happening <e>", "<cs> the minister having very properly in my view laid stress on the value to the community of schools is he in a position to say how pre-school play groups will benefit <e> <s> my understanding is that there is no provision under the law for such groups <e> <s> if i dare say this before the committee i used to break the law regularly by providing both facilities and apparatus for such groups and this was widely welcomed in the community <e> <s> under this part of the bill would there be any provision to meet the needs of the pre-school play groups <e>", "<cs> that is a most welcome and if i may say so a most unusual assurance having regard to the debates that we have had today <e> <s> but i wonder whether i might press the minister on one small point <e> <s> can he say what form that assurance will take in the regulations <e> <s> i hope i have made myself clear <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the minister <e> <s> in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question that arises from my being genuinely puzzled about the thrust of his argument <e> <s> as the noble lord has said the christian religion offers the kind of joy comfort and pleasure that he so movingly described when proposing the amendment <e> <s> i understood and i confess that i am not a christian that any kind of religious faith provided exactly that kind of response <e> <s> does the noble lord accept that all faiths provide that kind of solace joy and comfort <e> <s> in the circumstances therefore why should we now relate a major measure simply and solely to the christian religion <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the slight indication at the end of the answer why do not the government come clean and say that they will privatise the coal industry at the earliest possible moment <e> <s> we all know that an increasing amount of work within the industry is being given to private contract <e> <s> is the minister aware that if the coal industry is privatised it will receive no support from the miners not least because of the closure of unprofitable pits with the loss of thousands of jobs that is still going on and because new and profitable pits will prove rich pickings for people whose only concern is to make money and who have no interest in the industry or the country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that sympathetic view <e> <s> i was merely going to point out <e>", "<cs> my lords from my short time in the house i understand that the convention is that we are allowed a second question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that advice <e> <s> in view of the kindness which is always shown in the house i now put a second question <e> <s> does the noble viscount accept that privatisation will inevitably mean more open-cast mining which has few friends anyway and a considerable increase in coal imports <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will allow me to add to the question put by the noble baroness <e> <s> if someone at a lower level can be appointed to carry out the job why was someone with higher qualifications appointed in the first place <e>", "<cs> the hour of the night affects this because we do not want to press the amendment to a division <e> <s> but i am sure that the noble lord has seen the depth and intensity of the feeling on these benches about the situation which might arise through this clause <e> <s> i have to say that the reply was extremely unsatisfactory <e> <s> the minister skirted round the central point of dispute he did not deal with it in any shape or form <e> <s> he is repeating the kind of i was going to say bland assurances but i shall not say bland assurances which have been given in other parts of this bill <e> <s> i cannot resist telling the committee about one of the statements of the minister of state in another place <e> <s> i said that i would omit it but in view of what has been said i found this quite hilarious though i know that the noble lords opposite will not find it so <e> <s> when a similar amendment was being debated in another place mrs rumbold said this <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has said something similar to what i intended to say <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that the present horrific deficit in the trade of manufactured goods represents a loss of probably million jobs as compared with <e> <s> what are the government doing about that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state said that he failed to see the logic of my question <e> <s> is not the main cause of the deficit the fact that the manufacturing base of this country is still smaller than it was in and there has been a failure to invest in the manufacturing goods industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the replies she has given are completely unsatisfactory and will be rejected by almost everyone in the teaching profession and those associated with it <e> <s> i ask the noble baroness to refer to exactly the same experience which we had in the s <e> <s> although there were some natural born teachers at that time they were very few and far between <e> <s> it took a great deal of effort time and i may say because i was engaged in it a great deal of human suffering in trying to remove the other people from the profession <e> <s> finally does not the noble baroness agree that if training means anything it must be the training which we have now <e> <s> we do not have untrained lawyers doctors and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that research and development in the private sector as distinct from the public sector is well below the national average <e> <s> as we are constantly told how well our industry is performing what measures more specific than those given by the secretary of state a moment ago are the government taking to encourage increased spending in the private sector <e> <s> matching our international competitors in this field is absolutely crucial as the secretary of state implies in his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the secretary of state mentioned and said that expenditure in the private sector had increased since that date <e> <s> can he give the percentage of gdp at the latest available date <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the minister keep referring to the organisation as the so-called council of the north <e> <s> that organisation has existed for many years <e> <s> is it not one more demonstration of the ignorance of people in the south of what is happening in the north <e> <s> more importantly is he further aware that there is a grave shortage of factory space in the northern region as was admitted by his noble friend the secretary of state <e> <s> what are the government doing about that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the minister and your lordships aware that this is national bike week and therefore a splendid opportunity for the government to express their support for that healthy cheap and non-polluting form of transport <e> <s> is he further aware that cyclists present priorities are the provision of more cycle lanes and <e> <s> perhaps even more importantly the repair of some of our disastrous roads <e> <s> as both of those matters are the responsibility of the local authorities will the government consider reintroducing the financial incentives to local councils to improve cycling facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment contains a number of extremely important points <e> <s> i believe that none is more important than the matter to which the noble baroness lady young has referred the availability of teachers <e> <s> i should like to speak briefly and ask what the government mean by the word teachers as regards the implementation of the national curriculum <e> <s> i should like to go further and ask what they mean by the words qualified teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to deal with one matter mentioned by the noble baroness <e> <s> i agree that there was an overwhelming welcome for the act which was a milestone <e> <s> however in my view it raised expectations unnecessarily <e> <s> will the noble baroness agree that the main reason for the unsuccessful implementation of the act is lack of resources <e> <s> i see that the noble baroness disagrees <e> <s> i believe above all that specialist teachers and specialist training are needed together with more equipment <e> <s> i support the amendment but although in favour of such a body i wonder whether its setting up will greatly improve the material situation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask whether she can say what form the special remit will take <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred to the fact that the ncc would have a special remit as regards special needs <e> <s> my question was what form would such a remit take <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble baroness a question before she sits down <e> <s> her first point concerned getting the chemistry that is the phrase she used between a teacher who may be transferred to a school and the ethos of the school <e> <s> although i believe that she exaggerates the case i do not think that one could disagree with the principle <e> <s> how can one know whether a transferred teacher will fit into the ethos or provide the right chemistry when the teacher has not set foot inside the school <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i hope that we shall have a very much stronger statement from the minister today about the value of nursery education than has been made by this government since <e> <s> their record on nursery education is very bad indeed <e> <s> to my mind it shows that the government do not have any determined interest in the provision of nursery education <e> <s> this country compares very badly with the rest of the european community in this area <e> <s> i should have thought that that in itself might be some spur to the government to try to raise standards <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wonder if i may ask her what plans the government have for new buildings for nursery education <e> <s> both labour and tory governments have tended to take a fairly negative view making provision for nursery education in small schools or where extra classrooms have become available due to falling rolls and so on <e> <s> surely that is a fairly negative point of view <e> <s> we ought to be thinking in terms of purpose-built new buildings either as separate buildings or perhaps in present circumstances adding new wings new classrooms or new facilities to existing schools <e> <s> i was rather disappointed that the minister did not make any reference to that in the debate <e> <s> would she care to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate what form the training would take <e> <s> i think all noble lords are agreed that training is not only important but also essential <e> <s> it occurs to me i have clerked hundreds of governors meetings from <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that any board of governors would probably find as many different interpretations of how the voting should take place as have your lordships in the past few minutes <e> <s> as governors meetings generally last a long time they would find even greater permutations of the interpretation <e> <s> that is point one <e> <s> secondly does that not also mean that different governing bodies could come to different decisions <e> <s> if that is the case surely the minister agrees that that could not in any way be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords from time to time indeed quite frequently the secretary of state makes speeches in which he refers to truancy which we all recognise to be a matter of great concern and quotes statistics <e> <s> i am rather puzzled that the secretary of state makes speeches of this kind when there is no central record and a great variation in local records of the way in which truancy arises <e> <s> perhaps the minister will refer to that aspect of the matter when she comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i respectfully suggest that amendment no <e> <s> p to which my noble friend referred which relates to leaving out lines and on page is not quite so simple if i may say so because it is concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords while i do not agree with it i accept fully what the noble baroness has just said about not having national provision for nursery education <e> <s> does she recall that in committee i asked whether the government had any plans either to extend schools and build new nursery class rooms or indeed to build new nursery schools <e> <s> that would not necessarily conflict with what she has just said <e> <s> can she answer that point now <e>", "<cs> my lords the interpretation which the minister has put on clause is not that assumed by all my noble friends and myself <e> <s> the minister has moved since i spoke on this matter in committee and we obviously welcome the arrangements that have been made for statutory consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the minister this is information on names and addresses only <e> <s> if that is so it is very different from saying as the amendment does that the information <e>", "<cs> my lords i give a cautious welcome to that answerdoes the minister agree that a general teaching council would raise and maintain standards in the teaching profession just as the general medical council and the bar council do in their professionsdoes she not further agree that the two prerequisites of a successful general teaching council would be first that it should be a completely independent body and secondly that it must consist entirely of representatives of the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may ask a question about amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and that of my noble friend lady blackstone <e> <s> as regards the question of a parents ballot all the minister has said is that she believes it would be wrong <e> <s> surely the house is entitled to a fuller explanation <e> <s> much of the philosophy of the government is based on ballots both in this measure and in the five employment and trade union acts which if i may use the term are riddled with the need for balloting <e> <s> why should it be wrong in this case <e> <s> perhaps the minister will enlarge on why she believes it to be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a question supplementary to one of the important questions asked by my noble friend lady blackstone <e> <s> she asked the minister what would be the proportion of public and private expenditure on the colleges <e> <s> will the minister deal specifically with the point that when they were first mentioned by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to respond to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter whose ability and knowledge of procedure i respect so much not only in this house but also from our previous incarnation <e> <s> perhaps i may say first that this is not the third time that this amendment has been put down it is the second although i think that that is what the noble lord was saying <e> <s> the first amendment which was put down was completely different i am referring to the words although i make no secret of the fact that it was the intention to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friend lord peston and indeed the noble earl lord russell have said that we felt the reply we were receiving was so unsatisfactory that something had to be done about it because it was such a major issue <e> <s> i hope that there will be some tolerance as my noble friend said towards that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister will expect me to say that i am not entirely satisfied with that reply <e> <s> it seems to me that having what appears to some of us at least to be an open-ended ability to use employment laws is simply not satisfactory <e> <s> in the context of what the noble earl said i think it is worth repeating and i was going to say this any way relationships between the teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the closure of elstree studios would cause great damage to the ability of the british film industry to compete internationally <e> <s> in view of the blatant breaking of the agreement by cannon <e>", "<cs> my lords the government ought to take more cognisance of these factors than they have up to now <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will deal in a little more detail with what his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter told your lordships was a very important point <e> <s> we are not just talking about two ballots we are talking about a third stage which the leader of the house has mentioned namely the decision which we presume is final of the secretary of state <e> <s> i am sure that some of us would consider that that is a mere debating point and that the government have made their view absolutely clear by saying that they really want a majority of any kind however small even though a second ballot is <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few brief words <e> <s> i too support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend because i was not able to be in the chamber for the beginning of his speech <e> <s> however the use of university buildings for courses of one kind or another has been mentioned and as one who has benefited greatly from summer courses at universities i believe that that is something that should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> the question was put to me and i apologised for not being able to hear the beginning of my noble friends speech where perhaps he dealt with that matter <e> <s> having said that it is not the first time that this idea has been suggested <e> <s> as i interpret the amendment the proposal is that the on-campus accommodation of the university be used for this and similar purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the encouraging answer given by the secretary of state perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> why is it so difficult and in some cases impossible for so many czech businessmen to obtain visas to enter this country <e> <s> is he aware that the presence of so many germans and japanese in that country indicates the scope for trade and that this country is simply not taking advantage of it <e>", "<cs> i must say to the minister that not only is that a most disappointing reply but it also seems to me that he has not understood the main thrust of the argument <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that from time to time the government have designated different or perhaps i should say new types of such housing namely the large panel section types <e> <s> but we simply have not had an explanation as to why skarne has been excluded <e>", "<cs> i find the first part of the ministers statement extraordinary <e> <s> i would obviously have to have a second look at the first part of his statement but having been involved for a number of years with large panel section houses i am astonished <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham of edmonton mentioned peterlee <e> <s> i do not want to keep mentioning peterlee as the situation is country-wide but it is something about which we happen to have direct experience <e>", "<cs> i could not have put the case in summing it up more comprehensively than my noble friend lord graham of edmonton has just put it <e> <s> in those circumstances i hope that the minister will have another look at it particularly in relation to the thamesdown case <e> <s> i am glad to have that information about an appeal being made <e> <s> it seems to me that all of these factors are very relevant indeed but having regard to that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the increased importance which the government now place on religious education will the minister say what is being done to meet the shortage of specialist teachers in this subject <e> <s> will the government resist the temptation to employ the local parson who may well be a most worthy person but who is unlikely to be a trained teacher and is possibly quite unsuited to this very important task <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have that explanation from the secretary of state which i fully accept <e> <s> does the minister agree that a high level of research and development is of the utmost importance in an economy such as ours <e> <s> is he aware that in both the public and private sectors the percentages which he has just given fall in particular below those of our competitors not least the united states of america germany and japan <e> <s> when will the government take seriously their role in both the public and private sectors of research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords as the figures which the secretary of state gave to me are so much at variance with the figures i have and apparently with the figures which my noble friend lord williams of elvel has will the secretary of state be so kind as to let me have the source of his figures <e> <s> i agree with the noble lords statement that quality counts rather than quantity in itself <e> <s> but is he implying that in this country both in the public and the private sectors the quality is not as high as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords as unemployment fell for the five consecutive months immediately prior to the election of the present government on what basis does the minister say that unemployment was ready to take off when this government came to power <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not farcical to believe that the in-service training now being proposed can compare with the normal three years full-time training given to teachers <e> <s> is the minister aware that the proposal could cause great damage to thousands of children <e> <s> after nine years in power and being aware of the well-known fact that there has been a shortage of teachers in certain subjects why has something more effective not been done before now <e>", "<cs> my lords i say at the outset that i am no expert on northern ireland or on short brothers <e> <s> however i feel compelled to make a brief contribution to this debate for a number of important reasons <e> <s> i repeat what the noble lord lord bonham-carter has said <e> <s> any substantial move made in the province must be looked at in a different context from anything that is undertaken in the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should apologise to your lordships and to the minister for arriving late for the debate <e> <s> if i say anything or ask any questions that have been dealt with by the minister then i reiterate that apology <e> <s> first i am a little concerned about the form and format of the circular itself <e> <s> i find it very odd <e> <s> having dealt with department of education and science circulars in a previous experience i find it odd that we have such a huge schedule <e> <s> my noble friend has just made that point <e> <s> it is a huge schedule and yet with such sparse references to it in the paragraphs of the circular <e> <s> again underlining what my noble friend has just said some of the matters in the schedule are of the utmost importance and are not dealt with as they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down i should be grateful if he would deal with the point which he did not answer <e> <s> the regulations come into force on st december as i said in my speech <e> <s> he is now telling your lordships house that they will be operative if that was his word from st april <e> <s> there is a four-month period there <e> <s> does that mean that the sums allocated for each of the items in the schedule could be changed in other words that nothing will be finally fixed for st december <e> <s> is that what the minister is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to state that i am vice-president of the northumbria tourist board <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like her to expand one point <e> <s> she said that the government have had a number of successes <e> <s> does she subscribe to the government view which we do not accept that it <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government really believe in decentralisation and in bringing jobs to the regions the government frequently repeat those criteria presumably the minister would agree that movement to the regions reduces costs considerably <e> <s> why do the government not do more of this relocation <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the transfer of the national savings certificates division for example to durham has been a resounding success <e>", "<cs> my lords the original answer given to me by the minister seemed to consist of half promises <e> <s> when can we have something firm about future policy on dispersal <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this is an utterly disgraceful decision as regards sunderland <e> <s> this is a case of sheer dogma placing money before people <e> <s> we on this side of the house are as concerned about economic efficiency as members of the government and other noble lords opposite <e> <s> but there are instances where this does not apply <e> <s> is he aware that unemployment for sunderland is per cent <e> <s> does it not mean anything at all to the government that a town like sunderland is so affected <e> <s> i live near sunderland and have done so all my life so i have some idea of the ethos of that town <e>", "<cs> my lords when do the government expect to achieve their target of per cent <e> <s> of take-up <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the figures the minister has given could he not try to make an estimate of the achievement of the per cent <e> <s> take-up target <e> <s> is it not a fact that means tested benefits seldom achieve their targets <e> <s> in this case is it not made much worse by the disgraceful decision to freeze child benefit <e> <s> if we had a decent level of child benefit payment would this not be much better than the ill-conceived scheme of family credit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a recent independent investigation of accidents in the north-east coalfield shows that major accidents increased from per man shift in to in and that the number of inspectors under the mines and quarries legislation was reduced from in to in october last year <e> <s> that is largely a direct result of government action <e> <s> does the minister accept that it is the unreasonable drive for production and profit that is leading to this highly dangerous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister see the recent outrageous statement by a senior member of british coal who said in advocating and recommending longer shifts <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones raised a point which i felt was very important namely whether or not there was any precedent for what is now proposed <e> <s> i noted that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor did not refer to that point when he replied <e> <s> i wonder whether the absence of any reference means that there are no precedents or indeed that if there are the noble and learned lord cannot recall them at the moment <e> <s> however i feel that in a matter of this importance the question of precedent is vital <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would like to respond to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the main reasons why young people do not stay on beyond the compulsory school leaving age particularly in areas such as the northern region is that their parents cannot afford to keep them there <e> <s> when are the government going to consider introducing mandatory payments in place of the present system whereby it is left to the leas to decide whether payments can be made to families or to the youngster concerned <e> <s> is this not long overdue in order to encourage and help younger people to stay on at school <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the government have finally decided against random breath testing <e> <s> further is he aware that there is more than one form of such testing and that unless we have some kind of random breath testing the position will remain unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> accepting that the solution to the vietnamese problem lies outside hong kong and that the recent decision which the minister has just announced to admit another refugees and to allocate another million to the problem is important does not the fact that this country is the sovereign state mean that we have a strong moral obligation to do more than we are doing <e> <s> as canada and the united states have admitted five times the number of refugees that we have and as australia has admitted twice as many should not that be the least that we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister make clear because i do not think that he did so in answer to my first supplementary question that having hong kong as a crown colony this country has a strong moral obligation <e> <s> if so is he saying that that moral obligation amounts to some refugees each year for the next three years which i think is what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will not consider it to be a jarring intervention but some of us feel that the larger card is rather expensive <e> <s> it costs four times as much as the equivalent card in another place <e> <s> i understand that the same firm produces both cards <e> <s> is it possible for that aspect of the matter to be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the films act to which he referred reduced considerably governmental assistance to the british film industry and that this has had an adverse effect <e> <s> does he not agree that although british film makers are among the best in the world the industry is suffering <e> <s> one has only to look at the awards made last night to see that the british film industry consistently gains international awards <e> <s> is it not time for a whole re-think of the financial support to an industry that pays great dividends <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord is saying that the rules of court permit such instances to take place <e> <s> can he tell the house how often they happen in practice <e> <s> i understand that the amendment places more importance on the fact that such events should occur before that which is proposed in the two previous paragaphs <e>", "<cs> my lords why has the minister not said something about the most effective form of transport namely cycling <e> <s> does he not agree that it is healthy non-polluting and does not add to traffic congestion <e> <s> when will the government do something about that not least in making additional cycling lanes available to cyclists <e> <s> finally as the person in charge of the house bicycles may i invite any of your lordships who have a machine to see me afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords how much money are the government spending on encouraging schools to opt out <e> <s> is it not an improper use of public money <e> <s> the decision is primarily and if i understand the act correctly--entirely a matter for the governing bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the government dragging their feet on this matter <e> <s> when one considers that our own oil supply has a very limited life and accepting that we have reserves of coal which will last for years at the present rate of extraction is there not a strong case for public investment in this area <e> <s> the company to which the noble baroness referred has been involved for several years and progress is negligible <e>", "<cs> my lords in her answer to me the minister said that the government watch international co-operation in this matter <e> <s> if that is so why does she not say that in germany as has been mentioned in south africa and particularly in the united states advanced work is being done from which the government could benefit <e> <s> has she not let the cat out of the bag by saying that it is a tonnes per day job which is absolutely miniscule <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may request the minister to answer the first part of my question <e> <s> how many city technology colleges do the government intend to establish <e> <s> will he concede that there is no possibility of the government achieving the number stated many times by the secretary of state at least by next year which was the original intention <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that most of the bewilderment to which he referred is felt on this side of the chamber not only because of the confused answers we have had from him but because of the utter chaos of the ctc programme <e> <s> will he stop trying to run the nations education service with gimmicks <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that we are not going to hear too much repetition in this debate and indeed outside parliament of the statement already made on more than one occasion that there has always been a shortage of teachers <e> <s> the implication is that it is a shortage that has always been with us and that it is perhaps an insoluble problem <e> <s> it is simply not true that there has always been a shortage of teachers <e> <s> furthermore i suggest that the present shortage of teachers and the nature of the shortage is more criticial and more serious than it has ever been <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall the euphoria that occurred exactly one year ago today when the chancellor of the exchequer introduced a budget that was supposed to herald a new era in sustained and sound growth <e> <s> does he agree that the worst feature of that budget has been to expose the weakness of the supply side of british industry <e> <s> in those circumstances does he agree with the cbi that the nine increases from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> have caused and are causing serious under-investment in british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the express purpose of the present high interest rates is to dampen down domestic demand <e> <s> that being so what has he to say about the report at least according to <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the reasons for these shocking figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that the trivial answer which he gave to me does not do himself or this house any credit <e> <s> do not the figures which he provided in answer to my question show that the main reason for the present disastrous situation is related to a great extent to the erosion and indeed the destruction of the manufacturing base which has taken place under this governments policies <e> <s> what is to be done about that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the contracts for the construction of royal navy vessels always awarded on the lowest tender <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the huge increase in the importing of coal and the usual difficulties associated with any imports how much importance do the government place upon the years coal reserves which we have in this <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the remarks made by the noble lord lord ezra about the price of british coal i wish to ask whether the minister is aware that the cheapest deep mined coal comes from the north of england <e> <s> in the last five years million tonnes of coal have been imported an increase of million tonnes <e> <s> if that continues it will mean the closure of at least four pits in the northern region with the devastation of mining communities which this government know all about <e> <s> does that not mean anything to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps naively i have always thought it self-evident that there should be a general teaching council to compare with the associations governing the medical dental legal and other professions <e> <s> i well remember my hopes when my noble friend lord glenamara set up the weaver committee <e> <s> that seemed to me to be a milestone although he was correct about the reason for its failure <e> <s> i must say i shall deal with this point later that that issue would still be a major problem now <e> <s> that point has already been made in the debate and it is perhaps worth repeating <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has just left the point i intended to ask him about <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> do the government believe that a general teaching council is a good idea <e> <s> if that is their view surely there is no reason why they should not take the initiative <e> <s> i believe i used the words pump-priming or something like that <e> <s> if it is a good idea why should they not take the initiative knowing all the time that there are immense difficulties <e> <s> we all recognised that in making our contributions <e> <s> the government might create good will in doing that and at the end of the day come out with a gtc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way again <e> <s> that is not the point i am making <e> <s> i am saying that if the government think it is a good thing why do they not take the initiative in the hope that it will come about <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case is the minister aware that under objective of the new criteria for the ec structural fund the regions of this country are said to be in greater industrial decline than in any other areas of the ec <e> <s> in such circumstances and because of those findings will the minister comment on two matters <e> <s> first will the government include those areas now specified under the arrangements i have just mentioned incidentally they involve million people which do not currently qualify for national assistance schemes <e> <s> secondly will the government adhere to their often repeated promise that this ec funding will be in addition to the funds obtained through regional assistance in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the minister two rather narrow specific questions <e> <s> will he be so good as to answer them now <e> <s> they were certainly relevant to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with a small i <e>", "<cs> my lords that will be the day <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend would be kind enough to give way i should <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government have thought long and hard and have arrived at the age of <e>", "<cs> the government frequently boast about the increase in the number of shareholders and the minister has done so once again <e> <s> surely it follows that shareholders must take an interest in the companys affairs <e> <s> in other words it is a good thing that shareholders should do so <e> <s> therefore ought not the government to take an initiative in encouraging that trend and support the amendment <e> <s> does the minister find any illogicality in my suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord joseph and i are old adversaries in education from another place and as the views of the noble lord do not change i am tempted to express my disagreement <e> <s> however in view of the time we had better do that on another occasion <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will not disagree too much with my own remarks because i must say that my contribution to the debate today will be concerned solely with adult education and in particular with full-time and part-time courses at universities and polytechnics <e> <s> i must say how delighted i was that my noble friend in her splendid speech in opening this debate made reference to adult education of which she has so much experience <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when the government came to power in one of the first statements made by the prime minister was that nursery education would be available to everyone who wished to have it within a period of about six to seven years <e> <s> as the government have now been in power for years when does the noble earl think that that aim is likely to be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the considerable difficulties which are now being experienced in the implementation of the national curriculum what advantage is there in opting out <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the considerable difficulties which are now arising in connection with the implementation of the national curriculum what advantages are there in opting out <e>", "<cs> my lords while the significant decrease in accidents in recent years is to be warmly welcomed the figure used to be as the minister will know will the minister give a firm assurance that those figures will not give rise to any complacency particularly as in some parts of the country accidents are on the increase <e> <s> does he agree that if people were killed in air crashes or rail crashes every year there would be uproar <e> <s> on the question of drink driving particularly in view of the answer that he has just given me does the minister not accept that the time has come for some form of random testing <e>", "<cs> my lords while i understand that the minister should give information about the legislation relating to drink driving and very properly so he has not really answered the question on random testing <e> <s> i do not ask him to answer now but can he give an assurance that random testing and there are different forms of random testing will be considered seriously for the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords as deputy chairman of the teesside development corporation may i unusually congratulate the government on their wisdom in bringing the jobs which the minister has just mentioned to teesside <e> <s> those jobs are very much needed in that part of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very disappointing answer but is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very disappointing answer indeed <e> <s> is the secretary of state aware that nationally twice as many disabled young people are unemployed as are able-bodied young people <e> <s> is it not obvious that the government are not aware of the severe difficulties which arise from the double handicap of being young and disabled <e> <s> will the secretary of state look again at what is happening in this scheme and among other things consider the probability of positive discrimination in favour of young disabled unemployed people <e>", "<cs> there is however a question that has to be asked namely who decides how much he needs <e>", "<cs> it happens <e>", "<cs> my lords do the extra resources provide any additional benefit for the cadet forces of the three branches of the armed services <e> <s> apart from being a first-class educational experience for young people do they not provide a long-term beneficial result for the three forces under discussion today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of us are not unduly concerned about the lack of a british film in competition at cannes because the films are chosen by one man and we do not think too much of him anyway <e> <s> however having said that surely he agrees that we have some of the best film-makers in the world <e> <s> one of the factors that inspires some of us who are interested in the film industry is that the best american producers and directors come to british studios and use the facilities <e> <s> why are the government so paranoid about helping the film industry <e> <s> the question simply asks for a review <e> <s> what special circumstances are there in which this government would help the british film industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> it is perfectly understandable that concern should be expressed on some aspects of this project and i hope that in broad terms i have assured everyone that the development corporation has always been conscious of those fears <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say who is actually doing the training <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that amid all the current talk about the pollution of beaches very little indeed nothing is being done to deal with what is the virtual destruction of beaches not least as he says in the north east of england <e> <s> i am very surprised that that amount comes under the derelict land grant which is normally a separate source for this purpose <e> <s> as the production of coal is a national requirement do the government feel any responsibility for the loss of such a valuable amenity in certain parts of the country as i say not least in the north east of england <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is surely aware is he not <e> <s> that when the principle of the polluter pays is answered by the national coal board its action will literally put thousands of miners jobs at risk <e> <s> i appreciate the rather kind remarks the minister made about my efforts but notwithstanding the money that is being spent and despite the fact that we have now had ministers from various government departments visiting them is he not aware that the beaches are as black as ever <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state comment on the fact that when he answers the questions i ask as i do quite frequently as he is aware on the northern region the information he provides is invariably different from that which is provided from the region itself <e> <s> is he aware that the question i asked today is based on information i have received from the northern development company and the northern regional councils association organisations i know he holds in high regard <e> <s> they are saying that there is a great <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware that some of us find it very interesting that when there is credit to be claimed the government claim the credit for the northern region but if anything is not quite right the minister places the onus on something else in this case the private sector <e> <s> how much importance does the secretary of state place on the quality of such buildings <e> <s> is he aware that the latest report on this matter when locational and environmental factors are taken into account shows that only out of individual premises are not felt to be of high quality <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he will comment on the point made by his noble friend lord nugent of guildford namely that in his reply the minister must justify the profit motive <e> <s> the noble lord said that twice <e> <s> presumably if he said it twice it was to justify the importance of the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the secretary of state has just said about british coal enterprise will he ask that organisation to do two things <e> <s> first will he make a detailed examination of how british coal enterprise arrives at its statistics <e> <s> secondly will he ask british coal enterprise to break down its statistics into travel-to-work areas <e> <s> is the secretary of state aware that what is being said by british coal enterprise about the number of jobs being created bears no resemblance whatever to what is happening in areas where there have been pit closures <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state told me that jobs had been created largely by british coal enterprise <e> <s> is he aware that during the lifetime of this government no fewer than jobs have been lost in the mining industry so there is still a long way to go <e> <s> his noble friend talked about small businesses <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him that if a pit with employees closes it would take an awful lot of small businesses to make up that number <e>", "<cs> my lords one can believe anything if one believes that <e> <s> does the minister recall that when we on this side of the house complain about the high level of unemployment we are constantly told that the number of unemployed is falling every month and that that is an indication of the success of the governments policies <e> <s> the prime minister and the chancellor as recently as last week repeated and i quote that the governments overriding objective is to bring inflation down <e> <s> but inflation has been rising now for more than a year and we have been told that it will continue rising until the spring of next year <e> <s> can we therefore assume in the light of the governments own top priority and their own criterion that in fact their economic policies are a miserable failure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am not the slightest surprised that in his answer to me he should underplay the governments failure to control inflation <e> <s> however will he confirm that our present rate is per cent <e> <s> will he confirm that the average of the group of seven is per cent <e> <s> how does he explain the difference when this is the country that has performed the economic miracle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton made a legitimate point as he always does in our debates in suggesting that another part of this bill will take care of at least the spirit if not the content of the amendment which my noble friend lord williams has proposed today <e> <s> however your lordships will know that on a number of occasions particularly in the privatisation bills which have been before us for some months now we on this side have felt that it has been necessary to be more specific about certain things rather than to accept the generalities contained in various bills before us <e>", "<cs> my lords this is obviously not an appropriate time for a major debate on what some of us regard as a very important issue <e> <s> however i wish to support the statements made by my noble friend lady david about how strongly my party continues to object to the scheme for the reasons which my noble friend gave <e> <s> when the scheme came into operation we felt that it was totally unnecessary <e> <s> all of us on this side of the house thought that it was simply one more doctrinaire scheme introduced by the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down perhaps he will add in his reply to me a point that arises from the noble lords question <e> <s> presumably if the information is sent to him he will be able to tell us how many children with special needs have been accepted in assisted places <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has said twice that we must face the reality of this world <e> <s> is not part of that reality the inevitability that some employers will not pay a voluntary levy and will poach employees who have been trained by other companies <e> <s> i realise the problems but is not some form of statutory levy inevitable and necessary if we are to have a successful industrial training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only one simple point to make <e> <s> it has been covered in part by the noble lord lord renton but i believe it to be so important that it should be repeated <e> <s> in fact i should like to go a little further than did the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on tuesday when industrial training boards were discussed in a parliamentary question to which he has referred the secretary of state stressed that voluntary arrangements will be better than the former statutory boards <e> <s> indeed that has been confirmed in the answer which the minister has just given to me <e> <s> the secretary of state also said that that view was based largely on the change of attitude in industry <e> <s> will the minister accept as i think he must that not every industry will meet the objectives that he thinks are necessary that we all think are necessary in that way <e> <s> what will happen in those sectors of industry in which it is hoped that those arrangements will be made but in which they are not made which may well be crucial sectors of our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister now answer my question which was repeated by my noble friend lord mccarthy <e> <s> what will happen in those parts of industry in which a voluntary organisation is not set up <e> <s> does he agree that there will be some parts where it will not happen <e> <s> if the government are to be so inflexible in this matter will they at least agree to consider a code of practice <e>", "<cs> answer the question <e>", "<cs> i take it that i am in order in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> zzg which has been spoken to by the minister <e> <s> in introducing the amendments the minister did not mention specifically any moneys which might come from the european community and in particular from european regional development fund grants <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zzg mentions <e>", "<cs> i was glad to hear the minister say that the point i raised is being considered <e> <s> i take it that it has been considered for some time <e> <s> it seems to me that this is such an important aspect of this part of the bill that it ought to have been considered <e>", "<cs> thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answers which the minister has given so far may i ask why are the worlds currencies shunning this country in which an economic miracle is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that perhaps the single most important factor in teaching in universities as in all education is the quality of the teachers and the teaching itself <e> <s> that being so is it not also a fact that there is a so-called brain drain from our universities to american universities <e> <s> is the noble viscount looking at the matter and can he provide any figures <e> <s> if not will he have a look at the matter <e>", "<cs> how does the disabled person know that the help to which the minister has referred is available <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps he would like to comment on the fact and perhaps the minister will listen that in this very place the palace of westminster we provide transport home for everyone including some of the younger staff after oclock <e> <s> it may be midnight but i believe that it is oclock <e> <s> surely what is good for the goose is good for the gander <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend in what he has just said <e> <s> perhaps i may remind him that he is a member of the parliamentary labour party films group <e> <s> i wonder whether he has remembered that <e>", "<cs> the minister agrees with that <e> <s> there are millions of feet of early film which are part of the heritage of the country and which ought to have protection <e> <s> the silly reason given is that this is about tidying up legislation <e> <s> the minister ought to consider the matter again <e>", "<cs> i rise to ask the minister for clarification <e> <s> in moving the amendments he appeared to say that their contents would in no way change the principle or organisation of the training commission <e> <s> did the minister say that <e> <s> if so will the whole of the employment training scheme be affected <e>", "<cs> we do not need to wait for anyone else because there has been a recent internal review <e> <s> i have an article from the <e>", "<cs> i ask the minister to refer to an answer that i was given on the same point just before the summer recess <e> <s> i regret i do not have the date to hand <e> <s> his noble friend sitting beside him who now has responsibility for northern ireland will no doubt recall and confirm what i am about to say <e> <s> he said then that he thought that was <e>", "<cs> my lords in the restructuring of british coals finances which is soon to take place will the government give special consideration to the treatment that british coal is <e>", "<cs> my lords are your lordships aware that it is a long time since we have had so many red herrings dragged across that dispatch box about the state of the british coal industry <e> <s> when the minister mentions that most of the coal imported is coking coal is he not aware that that is due to the fact that this government have closed the coking pits in this country including all those in the north-east <e> <s> how much emphasis do the government place on the social effect on the mining communities of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said once it becomes a new post <e> <s> i am not sure that that is what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> he is agreeing with me <e> <s> if i understand my noble friend correctly he is saying that the post remains even though the postholder has moved on somewhere else <e> <s> the minister has just said that that creates a new post <e> <s> perhaps we should have another comment upon that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may speak again <e> <s> as i understand it the minister is saying that if it is a new person ipso facto that makes it a new post <e> <s> that is what puzzles me and perhaps my noble friend too <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that i can speak at this stage to seek elucidation <e> <s> i have not followed what the minister said <e> <s> i wonder whether he would like to comment on my view of the clause itself and of the amendment <e> <s> there is a basic difference here <e> <s> the clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord has misunderstood the amendment <e> <s> it talks about the cleaning not the use of machines <e> <s> there can be and often is a fundamental difference between using a machine and cleaning it <e> <s> in many cases cleaning the machine means dismantling part or all of it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there has been a cut in the regional aid budget of no less than per cent <e> <s> in real terms since this government came to power in <e> <s> is he further aware that the economic growth rate in the south over that period has been per cent <e> <s> compared with the north where it has been per cent <e> <s> as the governments present policy is to slow down growth what special measures i emphasise the word special are the government prepared to take to see that the northern regions do not suffer in order to make up the leeway which they have lost over that -year period <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister questioned my figures <e> <s> perhaps he should know that i took my figures from the public expenditure white papers of and <e> <s> will he check the figures <e> <s> he will find that the statement that he made to me is incorrect <e>", "<cs> my lords except for some people <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems almost by definition that we must be increasing the possibility of accidents <e> <s> if that is not the case why are we urging people to wear hard hats and in the law making it compulsory for them to do so <e> <s> the noble lord said what seemed to him plain common sense <e> <s> it seems to me plain common sense that people wear hard hats to avoid accidents <e> <s> if someone for whatever reason and we are not particularly concerned at the moment about that reason although i share my noble friends reservations about it will not wear a hard hat <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he comment on what appears to be a parallel <e> <s> if i understand him correctly he seems to omit it as the logical conclusion of his argument <e> <s> he knows that the government compelled trade unions to have ballots about the establishment of political funds <e> <s> most contributions were going to the labour party <e> <s> the government did that because they felt quite sure that there would be a change <e> <s> if i follow the noble lord correctly the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i hope he can answer a query i have <e> <s> i should say immediately that i have no legal knowledge <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord lord jenkin said and what has been said

difference between two years if that is the situation and the proposal of years in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give special attention to the recommendation in the report that assessment tasks be reviewed regularly for evidence of bias particularly in respect of gender and race <e> <s> is the minister aware that this is not as straightforward as it sounds <e> <s> for example girls will tend to score higher than boys at certain ages and in certain areas of study and <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered varying interest rates in relation to their regional policies <e> <s> is the minister aware that their present policy on interest rates which will obviously continue for some time will affect the regions first not least the northern region <e> <s> is he further aware that the suggestion i am making is a well-established practice in the ec <e> <s> will the government give consideration to it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report recommends not only one inspector or adviser for each of the national curriculum subjects but in addition one for special educational needs three for primary education one for secondary education and one for further education <e> <s> does he accept that these are as important as the proposal to have for the national curriculum subjects <e> <s> if so while i cannot agree entirely with the noble lord lord beloff will the government ensure that the people who are appointed are regarded as the leaders in organising best practices and not necessarily as the fount of all wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the most effective ways of developing links between primary schools or indeed any schools and industry is to have teachers spending either a long or a short time in industry itself <e> <s> how can this be done when there is such a desperate shortage of teachers in primary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that is a pathetic reply <e> <s> having regard to the stark contrast between some awards which have been made to directors some as high as between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> for which they receive a gentle admonition from the government and those to the lower paid workers who are presently struggling against a per cent <e> <s> inflation rate caused by the economic incompetence of this government have the government any morality at all <e> <s> what will the government do about such a state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister believe that the high increases to which i referred in my earlier question i have a list of them are damaging the governments policy on wage restraint particularly in relation to inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way again <e> <s> he says that the social security system is comprehensive and thereby by implication takes care of everything <e> <s> would he like to comment on the new regulations for the social fund <e> <s> your lordships will know that the social fund contains a finite amount <e> <s> when all cases of the social security department appear to have been dealt with there is no more money available regardless of how bad a case is and notwithstanding that it would have been justified under the old regulations <e> <s> would the noble lord care to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords hardly a week goes by without one hears a boast from the government both in this chamber and outside it that they have enjoyed the confidence of the electorate for more than a decade <e> <s> even allowing for their poor showing in the opinion polls in recent months the government are entitled to claim some credit for having won three consecutive general elections <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the northern region continues to have the highest rate of unemployment in the country after northern ireland <e> <s> if he says as i assume he will that unemployment in the region is falling will he comment on the fact that if it continues to fall at the rate that it has done over the past years it will achieve its rate in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that that is the normal full survey which is carried out every four years by the government <e> <s> if so will the government consider publishing a full separate report on the findings <e> <s> what action are the government proposing to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the minister wishes to look at the exact figures <e> <s> since he asked me a question perhaps i may tell him where i obtained my information <e> <s> it comes from the government review of rd which also includes a proportion of the research and development undertaken in private industry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the greatest deterrent to drink-driving is the fear of getting caught <e> <s> in those circumstances does he agree that the only measure which will substantially reduce the appalling number of deaths caused by drink-driving there are per year is the institution of random breath testing at roadside checkpoints <e> <s> in view of the outstanding success that this has had in a number of other countries why are not the government adopting it or at least looking at it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the great strengths of my suggestion of a breath test made at a roadside checkpoint is its fairness <e> <s> there is no question of bias harassment or anything of that nature associated with it <e> <s> will the government take into consideration the fact and i think the minister might have mentioned this that a road transport users opinion poll revealed that per cent <e> <s> of people now support the kind of breath test which is being proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords even for this promise-breaking government the order plumbs new depths <e> <s> ministers have given unequivocal undertakings to restore the negotiating machinery by march <e> <s> some of them were given outside parliament and some in another place <e> <s> we assumed that they would be implemented <e> <s> the secretary of state has talked about <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down will he be so kind as to say a little more about the points that some of us made concerning the ilo <e> <s> he has just said that the ilo is aware of what the government are doing to achieve the ultimate objective of free negotiations <e> <s> the ilo has said that the interim action the body which has been established is in contravention of the ilo convention <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> will the minister say something about that matter because he is missing the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however can he say what will happen to the headquarters of the various voluntary youth organisations when the government grant comes to an end in <e> <s> i ask that because i understand that there is an interim government grant effective from to <e> <s> does not the noble viscount agree that such bodies as the london union of youth clubs the london federation of boys clubs the boy scout the girl guides and the wolf cub organisations and so on perform a vital function in the london youth service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although there will be considerable self-help among the organisations that i have mentioned which is laudable there will be a shortfall of some <e> <s> that is a large sum for those organisations but a comparatively small sum for the government <e> <s> will the government give further thought to the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say what is to be done in the field of health education <e> <s> while we appreciate the work being done by the health education council does not the minister agree there is a great deal of work to be done yet on matters such as excessive smoking alcohol abuse the need for physical exercise and other matters <e> <s> is the minister further aware of the depressing reports that have been written about physical education and health education in schools <e> <s> those reports have been written by the central council of physical recreation and the sports council <e> <s> they show there has been a great reduction in what is being done in those areas in schools <e> <s> that bodes ill for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that throughout the whole of england there are only groups of employers who receive development funding and that means that there are very wide areas of the country in which no training at all is conducted <e> <s> that affects particularly the disabled in the way that my noble friend described <e> <s> when will the government do something about setting up tecs throughout the whole country and when are they likely to complete the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back to the minister a second time <e> <s> he said that he had disappointed me <e> <s> he only disappoints me because the figure that he gave is grossly at odds with the written answer that i had from him two weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has said that the government will not amend the education reform act to ensure fair representation <e> <s> assuming and it must be a correct assumption that the government are anxious that there should be fair representation on governing bodies what other action are they prepared to take to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that deeply disturbing answer which demonstrates to me at least the inadequacy of the present legislation does not the minister think that the time has arrived for a new approach to the problem <e> <s> will the government now introduce static testing that is where the police are authorised to stop say one in vehicles a predetermined number which can be agreed to carry out breath testing <e> <s> in considering this matter will the minister look at the remarkable success of that procedure in australia new zealand scandinavia and america <e> <s> when is this slaughter of people killed annually by drunken drivers to stop <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the form of random testing which i suggested be considered is supported by the national council for civil liberties the british medical association and by opinion polls <e> <s> does he therefore appreciate that the fear which i understand of people being harassed and bias being applied in some cases is quite simply unfounded <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer to the question asked by my noble friend lady turner <e> <s> will the minister agree that the association of british travel agents has done a great deal towards training in the tourism industry in recent years <e> <s> will he further agree that the organisation continues to place great emphasis on training <e> <s> can he give an assurance that when abta asks the government for assistance from time to time they will be ready to consider any proposals which it suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords as the unemployment rate in the south-east region is per cent <e> <s> and in the northern region per cent <e> <s> can the minister say why after nearly years of unrivalled power there is still such a chronic discrepancy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the original questioner was normally allowed a <e>", "<cs> my lords not even on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> i wish quickly to refer to the ministers reply to my first supplementary question <e> <s> he said that the rate of unemployment in the northern region was falling fast <e> <s> is the minister aware that if the rate of employment in that region falls as it has been doing for some time it will reach the level in the year <e> <s> is he satisfied with that <e>", "<cs> my lords no government have yet successfully married education and training <e> <s> but the tragedy of the present situation is that the government are pursuing policies that will make matters worse and at a time when there was never greater urgency to get those policies right <e> <s> in the short time available i shall try to demonstrate that by dealing with only one aspect which the <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to hear that i found the ministers statement quite disastrous <e> <s> i have raised the subject here on many occasions <e> <s> he is saying that the principle of privatisation is better than public enterprise <e> <s> it may be that many of my noble friends believe that in certain circumstances that is the case <e> <s> however presumably the minister cannot and will not accept the fact that people who will run the skills centres will be there primarily to make a profit <e> <s> there can be no denying that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that and the minister must not misquote me <e> <s> in principle i believe in the mixed economy and there is nothing wrong with making profit <e> <s> i said that this is not an appropriate field in which to be making profit <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that when the scheme was launched the then secretary of state said that ctcs would be in operation by the end of <e> <s> does not the failure to achieve anything like that target relate to the second failure that is the inability to attract more than per cent <e> <s> of private money into what was to be a per cent <e> <s> private money scheme <e> <s> the whole business is little short of a scandal <e> <s> should not the per cent <e> <s> of public money which is being poured into these unnecessary schemes be used to repair our crumbling schools <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that it is now crystal clear that the consecutive increases in interest rates over the past months represent a blunt instrument which is wholly inappropriate to the economic problems caused by this government <e> <s> can he say how much consideration is being given to the effect of interest rates on investment the exchange rate and the trade <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in implementing the part of the act to which my noble friend referred due and full regard had to be paid not only to those people who are not christians but also to those who have no religious faith of any kind <e> <s> in view of the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the quotation which my noble friend has just given from the hmi report represents the biggest condemnation yet of the <e> <s> inaction of the government in implementing the education act which is specifically related to the issue of assessment of special needs <e> <s> is she further aware that the act had the total support of the government of the day of parents of leas of administrators teachers and everybody concerned and yet the government have done virtually nothing about it <e> <s> does she accept that that is confirmed and condemned again in the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that all of your lordships will wish me to congratulate the noble lord lord crook on an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i can assure him that many of us in this house do not regard the building of tunnels roads and similar projects as mundane affairs which is what he said <e> <s> indeed many of us would welcome more of such construction in our own areas <e> <s> making ones first speech in this house usually presents certain problems but the noble lord has overcome them without the slightest difficulty <e> <s> his speech was informative and presented in a most persuasive manner <e> <s> there is no doubt that the noble lord will be a most valuable member of your lordships house and we look forward greatly to further contributions from him <e>", "<cs> i may not have understood the minister <e> <s> it could be implied from his comments that british coal would be profligate in spending

"<cs> perhaps i may comment on something which the minister has just said in reply to my intervention <e> <s> i think he said that there will be an increase in the importation of low sulphur coal <e> <s> the former secretary of state said that it will be necessary to import massive quantities from overseas <e> <s> one assumes that that is an accurate description of what is happening <e> <s> in view of what the minister said a moment ago is he prepared to say that there will be a massive importation of low sulphur coal with all the effects that that might have not only on the british coal industry but on the billion deficit on the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> that is a comfort <e>", "<cs> we have taken note on this side of the committee that the minister is contradicting what the secretary of state said <e>", "<cs> the minister said that there was no master plan for the future of the industry <e> <s> in literal terms that may be the case <e> <s> however he knows that there is

maximum of is not a particularly generous payment for somebody who has been working in a pit for years <e>", "<cs> the minister has properly drawn attention to the significant reduction in the number of fatalities in mines and we all say hurrah to that <e> <s> that has been a most significant <e>", "<cs> my noble friend raised a matter which i had intended to mention myself namely the fact that deputies will not now be required to hold a first aid certificate <e> <s> that is an amazing suggestion <e> <s> deputies are very proud of their certificates which they acquire as part of their overall training <e> <s> perhaps the minister can tell us why that is being withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am completely opposed to the bill because of the effect it will have on the british coal industry and as a result on the national economy <e> <s> nothing that the noble lord lord geddes said allays any of the fears that i have in this respect although i must pay tribute to the fact that he referred to the select committee <e> <s> he gave one or two quotations from the report and i hope that your lordships will bear with me if i put forward later in my speech other quotations from the same committee which i think have even greater strength <e>", "<cs> my lords why is the minister so equivocal <e> <s> is there not simply a conflict here resulting from the doctrinaire approach to training adopted in this country about which many of us have commented <e> <s> what will happen if the noble lord does not receive the reply that he expects from the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may put it to him that he has not quite answered the question of my noble friend lord graham and i certainly think that there is a point which needs to be cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords we know that <e>", "<cs> my lords given that the minister has at least a point when he says that he would like to wait until all local authorities have set the poll tax rate will he say now that all local authorities be they tory or labour whose rate is above that set by the government are high spenders and irresponsible <e>", "<cs> my lords no tory government including this one have been a friend of the british mining industry <e> <s> one reason among a number of reasons is that they know that they receive virtually no political support from the miners <e>

a firm assurance that i was talking about the amount of money available to schools that is largely what lms is about <e> <s> can she be a little more specific on the matter because with the greatest respect she did not really answer the question <e> <s> if the historic base is to be or even more money is bound to be needed if only as i said in a supplementary question in relation to normal

the planet <e> <s> does not that kind of frightening statistic show how inadequate i realise the difficulties facing this government and other governments present policies are <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the specialties in which there are shortages and what are the government doing about that <e>", "<cs> my lords my main question was what are the specialties in which there are shortages <e> <s> may i have an answer to that question please <e>", "<cs> my lords what provision is being made for the large section of the population which has no religious faith at all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am deeply disappointed that he did not achieve his usual high standard in answering my question <e> <s> surely he must agree that one of the purposes of religious broadcasting is to put over a certain viewpoint <e> <s> it seems to me quite proper that someone who does not hold that viewpoint should also be allowed to put across his opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is years since the labour government left office <e> <s> is he further aware that the trade unions are now well under control as the government constantly remind us and that we cannot import inflation these days because the countries with which we trade have a much lower rate of inflation than we have <e> <s> who is to blame for the per cent <e> <s> inflation rate <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that last week in another place the prime minister said in dealing with the problem of inflation that the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the splendid work undertaken by english industrial estates in the northern region <e> <s> my noble friend lord jay was quite right to refer to it <e> <s> those of us who have had close dealings with the organisation over many years realise the tremendous work that is done for the northern region which still has the highest rate of unemployemnt <e> <s> secondly i am a little confused as was my noble friend <e> <s> is the minister saying that there is a possibility of privatisation at some time in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government had any doubt about the relationship of poverty illiteracy and environmental degradation to rapid world population growth i hope that it has been dispelled by the excellent speech we heard today from my noble friend lord rea <e> <s> it is the kind of detailed well-researched speech to which we shall refer time and again <e> <s> i also congratulate him on initiating the debate not only for the intrinsic value of what has so far been and i am sure will be when finalised an excellent debate but also because i hope <e> <s> that it will be one of a number of debates that will continue in your lordships house on what many of us think is a major issue facing mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell me how he knows that it would be unprecedented <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkin of roding has made so many misleading statements about the coal industry that i am tempted to scrap my notes and deal with the points he made but there is not time <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that but i am not sure that it entirely deals with the point that i made <e> <s> however it was worth having it mentioned as it might be taken into consideration at some other time <e> <s> the two points that i wish to make are related <e> <s> the noble lord lord geddes said that had it not been for what he called the coal issue the bill would have gone through without any problem <e> <s> the noble lord lord thomas repeated that <e>", "<cs> my lords i did say that but my point was that given that we are dealing with a large organisation like british coal with all its staff researchers and experts it is at least one view <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that high interest rates have now been in operation for more than months <e> <s> as retail sales continue to increase will the noble lord say whether the government are at least giving <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that we on this side of the house appreciate that the government have reduced inflation <e> <s> they have reduced it from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in may <e> <s> it has taken only years to reduce it by per cent <e> <s> as high interest rates have now been in operation since and are affecting inflation at the same rapid rate will the government stop talking nonsense about zero inflation and look at the way in which other countries are successfully tackling inflation without relying solely on high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that there is at least considerable evidence that the high interest rate policy is not working as satisfactorily as the government think it is <e> <s> in those circumstances will he give the house an assurance that the government are at least thinking about the possibility of other ways of restraining inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government have failed completely to control inflation and the minister frequently makes a comparison with the record of the last labour government does he deny that the average rate of inflation for the last months of the labour government was per cent <e> <s> which compares very favourably with the present runaway inflation of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the government are doing about this serious problem <e> <s> however is the noble viscount aware that there will only be a significant reduction in the number of deaths and injuries caused by drink-driving with the introduction of random breath testing at specially authorised and sign-posted checkpoints <e> <s> such a form of random testing should not trouble the sensibilities of those people who think that civil liberties are threatened <e> <s> is he further aware that if people were killed in air crashes every year as there are with drink-driving there would be uproar and that very soon solutions would be found <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that i knew the figures he gave me about the reduction and i welcomed them <e> <s> unusually for me i said that i appreciated what the government were doing <e> <s> however i say in all seriousness that the fact that people were killed on the roads through drink-driving last year is an utter disgrace <e> <s> does the minister agree that we have to achieve a balance between deterrence and detection <e> <s> the random testing that i have described which was different from that described by his noble friend there seems a misunderstanding on that is being carried out successfully in other countries <e> <s> why do the government not try it on an experimental basis <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he say whether he agrees with the statement by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that some homelessness is necessarily self-inflicted <e> <s> i think that those were the words he used <e> <s> if he agrees with that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the figure he has just given which was achieved i do not know whether that is the right word after years of unbridled power demonstrates more than anything else the sheer incompetence of this government particularly as they have stated so often that their main objective is to achieve low inflation <e> <s> is it not now evident that one result of high inflation and high interest rates is increasing unemployment <e> <s> what are the government doing to counteract that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer the minister gave me it is clear that the government need lectures from someone <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the community charge which he mentioned was introduced by the government <e> <s> is he also aware that the government are responsible for increases in the price of electricity and water <e> <s> it is true that unemployment has decreased in the last few years but not in the last four months which were the subject of my question <e> <s> will he now deal with that point <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a disappointing answer <e> <s> is the minister aware that when there is a rise in unemployment as is happening now the regions are hit first and they are hit the hardest <e> <s> is the minister further aware that the unemployment figures for the regions can and do hide pockets of high unemployment <e> <s> in my own area for example yet another pit closure was announced last week with the loss of another jobs <e> <s> as the change in regional development grants has resulted in a huge loss to the regions will the government now consider an increase in regional assistance grants and at the same time make the administration of those grants much more flexible <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the cbi the forum of private business and the london business school among many other objective observers are saying that there will be a substantial increase in unemployment which is the basis of my question <e> <s> as he referred to the regions will the minister comment on the fact that the northern region to which he referred after years has an unemployment rate of per cent <e> <s> which is only six points from what it was in <e>", "<cs> i have a further point to add to the points which the minister will have to answer <e> <s> there are a number perhaps a large number of plants offices factories and workplaces where there is no union <e>", "<cs> my lords does the fact that we are one of the two best countries in this respect mean that we have implemented the directives in full and without equivocation <e>", "<cs> i strongly support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the right reverend prelate referred to my part of the country and mentioned tynemouth priory and the significance of that building <e> <s> he will know that not too many miles away from that building is another magnificent building on a magnificent site namely durham cathedral <e> <s> i have a reason for mentioning it <e> <s> i am sure that the right reverend prelate will be interested and maybe the committee also <e>", "<cs> i heard that observation from the noble baroness <e> <s> i suppose that i am like many noble lords and a little dubious about some of the polls which are taken <e> <s> indeed i have heard my noble friend say so on more than one occasion <e> <s> i had not intended to quote but i shall do so now <e> <s> the british humanist association recently had a poll i got word of it yesterday from which it states that per cent <e> <s> of the population are not christians <e>", "<cs> yes i do believe it <e> <s> my noble friend said that surely i did not believe it but i do <e> <s> in any case you pays your money and you takes your choice <e> <s> there are certain sections of the population who are not christians and their voice should be heard <e> <s> we are talking in the context of broadcasting <e> <s> therefore by any standards there must be a case for allowing that section of society to put its viewpoint <e> <s> i am at a loss to understand why there is such a strong feeling against non-believers having broadcasts <e> <s> is it because some are afraid <e> <s> i can hardly believe that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords the labour party has opposed the scheme since its inception <e> <s> the regulations being considered today the way in which the scheme is working and the principle involved have not led us to change our view <e> <s> the cost per year for each assisted place pupil for was <e> <s> this information came in a written reply to me yesterday from the minister <e> <s> she also stated that the equivalent national cost of a pupil in secondary education for that year is not yet available but for it was in the maintained sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> are we talking of the same thing <e> <s> i spoke of the origin of pupils from a region not the number of schools although that would be interesting too <e> <s> for example in my part of the country i refer to the number of pupils from the northern region the west midlands the south east and so on <e> <s> are we talking of the same figure <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why that huge number of men and women is unaware of the economic miracle which has taken place under this government <e> <s> as the government have now been in power for years and as the measures related to long-term unemployment have failed is it not time for a complete reappraisal of the measures used to deal with long-term unemployment especially as unemployment is now increasing again and is likely to do so for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the minister and his noble friend who spoke about the increased number of people in employment that i was not referring to that <e> <s> i referred to long-term unemployment which is the biggest blot on the governments employment record <e> <s> does the minister realise that with more intelligent policies the half million long-term unemployed which figure is absolutely disgraceful could be self-financing with a decrease in social security payments and benefits and an increase in tax revenues <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government unable to say how many extra staff have been appointed in scotland to deal with the poll tax as stated to me in a written answer last week <e>", "<cs> my lords how much importance do the government place on the security of supply of coal given that our present reserves are sufficient for some years at the present rate of extraction <e> <s> as all forecasts predict that the price of imported coal will increase in the medium and long term and as the british coal industry continues to improve its efficiency ought not the government to look again at the policy of pit closures <e> <s> i stress that i am referring to the medium and long-term position especially as the secretary of state in another place this week said that there was a great need for long-term contracts <e> <s> one cannot mothball a pit <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are not concerned about the security of <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government decided whether there should be specific united nations authorisation of military action before it is taken by this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this year will see an increase of million people on the planet so exacerbating all of the terrible problems which the population explosion brings about namely hunger death environmental difficulties and so on <e> <s> in accepting that the government have made some contribution towards the problem does the minister realise that unless there is an increase in resources and i appreciate the figures which the noble earl has given and an increase in political commitment and know-how by the advanced countries of the world there will be a tragedy such as we have not yet seen on this earth <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say when the government intend to restore full and free negotiating rights to teachers <e> <s> secondly do the government not realise that their proposal to have nationally agreed scales and at the same time permit local negotiations to take place is absolutely ludicrous <e> <s> will the government think again about that <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering my supplementary question the minister used the words free negotiation in relation to teachers salaries <e> <s> for clarification this is an important point will the minister say whether that means full free unfettered negotiation <e> <s> as the noble baroness is aware there has been trailed the question of a time limit and the possible reference to a body which would presumably be the equivalent of the interim advisory committee <e> <s> will the minister please clarify that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in one of the less well publicised speeches made at the recent national conference of the cbi the chairman of a company used these words <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not now overwhelming evidence that a-levels cause over-specialisation and not only at certain ages as referred to by the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> that in turn causes under-education in other important fields not least in science and technology <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the minister said that about million people were employed in manufacturing in june this year <e> <s> can he say what the number was in <e>", "<cs> my lords do not those figures demonstrate more than anything else the fact that the economy is now well and truly in recession in spite of what the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer and other senior members of the government say <e> <s> therefore will the government confirm that after years of conservative government the total number of unemployed is now million which is more than it was when labour left office <e> <s> even more important will he also confirm the fact that next year i ask the minister to deny this it will rise to a figure of million <e> <s> what do the government say is the cause of these disastrous figures <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister considers that long-term unem-ployed are worth mentioning that just goes to show how little compassion the government have for the unemployed <e> <s> will he confirm that there are now per cent <e> <s> fewer vacancies than there were this time last year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say why the original objective to establish ctcs within two years with the cost being met wholly or largely by the private sector has not been achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness kindly answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great cost involved in the setting up of ctcs will the government consider giving an amount of money equal to that which has been spent on established ctcs to the local education authorities in those areas so that they can meet the great cost of the necessary repairs to their schools <e> <s> perhaps i may give one example <e> <s> in the north east where the gateshead ctc has been established the amount of money spent is almost million <e> <s> that is more than the whole of the money available to the newcastle and gateshead authorities for the repair and maintenance of their schools <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that in the important problem raised by my noble friend a contributory factor is the world population explosion particularly in developing countries <e> <s> we appreciate what the government are doing and the noble earl will recall that we had a debate on this subject before the summer recess <e> <s> will the minister give an assurance that all the assistance given and work now being done by the government will continue and increase <e>"]
