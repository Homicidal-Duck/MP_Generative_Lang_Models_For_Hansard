["<cs> my lords it is all right on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees of this house for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the lord greenwood of rossendale be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene for a moment because he has drawn me to my feet against my wishes although as in a way this is a maiden speech perhaps i should not do it <e> <s> the noble lord is making a great deal of the word astonishment i think the astonishment expressed by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer was that this matter had not been dealt with by the party opposite while they were in power <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the kiribati bill has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the bill at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the <e>", "<cs> my lords might i thank both the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord byers for what they have said and also say thank you for the part played by noble lords who in the interests of the house as a whole gave evidence and the noble baroness who gave a considerable amount of evidence to the boyle committee <e> <s> it was obviously effective evidence that was given and it has evidently been taken into full and due account by lord boyle and his committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to himself as an ordinary back-bencher <e> <s> i do not think that any-body would share that view of him <e> <s> as to whom it should be left to it is in very good hands at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for raising that point <e> <s> what commissioner gundelach was saying was that had his proposals got through the council of ministers as put to them <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not the case that the increase as a result of the settlement on agriculture will be million extra to last year <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the fact is that it is going to be million more than if the commissions proposals had been accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is something in what the noble earl said <e> <s> it is not only what you say but also how you say it <e> <s> we all know that the noble lord lord peart used to say things extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> in june both houses agreed to a proposal of the joint committee on statutory instruments that orders in council made under the northern ireland act should be excluded from their consideration <e> <s> at the same time a consequential amendment was made to the public business standing orders of the house of lords to exclude northern ireland orders from the scope of standing order no <e> <s> which requires that no motion to approve an affirmative instrument shall be moved until the report of the joint committee thereon has been laid before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> in doing so i should like briefly to explain why i am moving this motion <e> <s> the message from the house of commons that they have appointed their committee on statutory instruments was received only yesterday <e> <s> this house has therefore proposed that the joint committee on statutory instruments should meet next tuesday and a message from the commons responding to this proposal is expected this afternoon <e> <s> this means that there has not been time for the joint committee to consider and report on the iron casting industry scientific research levy amendment order as required by standing order no <e> <s> <e> <s> it was for this reason that the army air force and naval discipline acts continuation order was withdrawn by the government from the order paper on tuesday <e> <s> in that case as my noble friend lord strathcona indicated at the start of the defence debate there was no immediate urgency to <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls i can assure him that all the other horses will remain in the stable and that this is a once-for-all situation <e> <s> i do not think he need worry about that although i take his point that it would have been worrying had it so been <e> <s> to answer the noble lord lord airedale he is right to say that it is not the fault of anybody in this house but i think it would be hard if one were to infer therefrom that it was the fault in the sense of the word fault of another place during these weeks they have been reconsidering the whole of their committee structure <e> <s> this will not we hope happen frequently in future <e> <s> it is a once-for-all situation and i agree with the noble lord that the fault does not lie with us it is the fault of circumstances rather than people <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon will understand the situation <e> <s> when the present government were elected to power in may this year there were certain matters to do with company law that had to be put into operation that had to go through all the legislative process in order that we should fulfil our commitments towards the eec <e> <s> it was because of that that the companies bill was hurried forward <e> <s> the noble lord will have some idea of what this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both the noble lord the leader of he opposition and the noble lord lord byers for their questions <e> <s> the noble lord the leader of the opposition touched on a number of topics relating to what is going to happen internally in this country <e> <s> although i did not as the french say hold the candle in tokyo i doubt very much whether those topics were a feature of the discussions there <e> <s> however the noble lord touched upon some very important questions which showed me quite clearly that soon there will be a need for a general energy debate in this house when matters of this character can be discussed <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are going to have a debate tomorrow and it will be a good opportunity for these matters to be raised and also hopefully answered <e> <s> turning to the allocation of supplies the noble lord is quite right in saying that it will be comparatively easy for us compared with other countries less fortunate than ourselves so far as energy supplies are concerned to live up to our commitment not to import a greater quantity of oil than we did in <e> <s> it will be harder for some countries than for others to live up to that commitment <e> <s> at the moment we do not see the need nor do we think it would be wise to think in terms of rationing or allocating supplies <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure the noble lord lord wigg that if the prime minister is an apprentice she is doing pretty well as an apprentice <e> <s> that is all i can say <e> <s> as to the statement which the prime minister made about whether or not her majesty would visit lusaka she said that a decision would be taken when the time was right as to whether or not advice should be given to her majesty <e> <s> the commonwealth conference is going to take place in lusaka and at the moment the position is that her majesty will be going there <e> <s> whether or not the position will change before that time i do not know <e> <s> of course the prime minister is well aware of the fact that it is not only the prime minister of this country who has a say in this matter <e> <s> on the other hand it is the prime minister of the united kingdom who must when the queen is in the united kingdom take the final responsibility for the advice which is given to her majesty <e> <s> i have no doubt that this advice would not be given without the full and proper consultations which are constitutionally laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords the advice will be given in whatever form represents the proper constitutional practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anyone is thinking of putting all the eggs into nuclear baskets as the right reverend prelate said but i think the hard fact is that unless we prepare ourselves to be able to produce nuclear power in the world this country and many other countries will fall seriously short of energy in the latter part of this century and the first decades of the next so i think a lot of effort must be made <e> <s> of course all safety precautions must be taken and various points of view must be taken into account but the hard fact is that the future of million people living in these islands will depend very largely at the turn of the century upon the extent to which we have succeeded in bringing nuclear energy to an advanced stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the two questions first on the question of the vietnamese refugees i think the noble lord lord janner will be aware that the prime minister took an initiative some weeks back with mr waldheim the secretary-general of the united nations pressing for an international conference on this matter because it is of enormous proportions <e> <s> we are speaking about a million or even million persons of chinese ethnic origin with nowhere to go and no one to accept them <e> <s> first the best thing would be to stop it but if we cannot do that we must react as best we can <e> <s> this is an international problem and the noble lord may rest assured that her majestys government will continue to play their part in trying to get other countries to take this view <e> <s> the trouble is that everybody tends to agree with this but when it comes to where the refugees shall go there are rather fewer candidates to take them in <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> steps are in fact taken to monitor the decisions taken at these summit meetings <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be for the convenience of the house if i informed your lordships that some staff working in the palace of westminster are taking industrial action beginning today <e> <s> the institution of professional civil servants the ipcs has instructed its members employed at the palace of westminster to strike for a fortnight from today <e> <s> thirty-two staff are involved but i cannot yet tell the house how many will obey the strike call <e> <s> these staff are engineers and technicians responsible for the maintenance and operation of virtually all services in the palace of westminster <e> <s> they supervise about department of the environment industrial staff who are not in dispute and are expected to continue to work so far as they can <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i sincerely hope not <e> <s> the trouble will arise if things break down <e> <s> the lifts will be working for example and those who work the lifts are not in dispute <e> <s> the only trouble will be if a lift breaks down <e> <s> but i assure your lordships that if a lift breaks down with one of your lordships inside it means will be found of getting him out of it <e> <s> where steam supply is concerned the boilers are automatic and that should go on all right unless it breaks down <e> <s> if it breaks down your lordships might be inconvenienced in the restaurant and places such as that <e> <s> the air conditioning could break down and that would be nasty particularly for the other place <e> <s> your lordships will be glad to hear that sewerage is unlikely to be affected <e> <s> but supply services including such day-to-day services as carpet repairs furniture moving and furniture repairs are likely to he disrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot immediately think what prompts that <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the last part of what my noble friend lord orr-ewing has said <e> <s> there are sonic very serious aspects to this industrial action of which this is but one example <e> <s> as to the extent to which the union has circularised its members about the offer i rather have the impression that it has concentrated more on its side of the case than on the governments side of the case <e> <s> on the other hand i have done my best and my right honourable friend the minister of state at the csd has also done his best to ensure that everyone in the country including of course the members of the union realise what the position is and the offer that is on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all of us will be grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for having introduced this motion which enables us to confront some of the really major vast and complicated anxieties which face us all today <e> <s> the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way he is asking us how many cuts there will be in this how many people will leave what will be the cuts in the other <e> <s> i think he probably realises that if the expenditure which was planned by the last government were to continue as it was planned and without any cuts at all the proportion of the gnp that goes into the public sector would continue to rise <e> <s> i am not asking the noble lord for a particular figure of what he thinks it ought <e>", "<cs> my lords i was nodding in disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry if the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby thinks that i have in any way maltreated the house <e> <s> certainly it was not my intention so to do <e> <s> i was informed and my experience is limited in this respect i must say that this is what has happened regularly year after year after year and that this is how the matter has been handled <e> <s> the fact that i dealt with it in this way was because i was advised that this is how it should be dealt with <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that i did not intend to treat the house with any over-degree of levity <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house may i respond to the few questions that have been put to me <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell said that he was in a quandary <e> <s> i have seldom known him not to find his way out of a quandary <e> <s> he said today that too often do we discuss in this house matters which do not later come to implementation <e> <s> well we are discussing the implementation of a decision taken by a review body to which successive governments put the question of how to handle the matter of expenses for this house <e> <s> they were asked to look into the expenses not into a salary <e> <s> this house has traditionally been a house that has not had a salary but whose expenses have to some extent albeit not very generously been met up to now at least <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords know there are difficulties about accommodation at this end of the corridor <e> <s> it has been looked at over a long period of time <e> <s> would that matters were better <e> <s> but they are not and we have grave difficulties <e> <s> i must say that my experience has been that if journalists have wanted to seek out noble lords they have always managed to succeed in doing so <e> <s> and as i say perhaps the lords bar could be used rather more than it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord need worry on that score <e> <s> we shall find plenty of means of explaining our policies both to noble lords and to journalists for whom they will be so self-evidently right that they will fall on receptive ears <e>", "<cs> my lords undoubtedly it would be nice if it were possible <e> <s> this has been considered by the administration committee and i have no doubt that if the house so willed they would be ready to consider the matter again <e> <s> it is not for me to give <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a considerable time back when this was done <e> <s> i think that the other place would have some difficulty in giving it up now <e>", "<cs> my lords this would be possible in fact it is possible <e> <s> if noble lords wish to i am sure that there will be the possibility of so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with the noble lord that one would wish to see greater coverage of what takes place here <e> <s> i must say that i think that since broadcasting was brought in what goes on in this house in the way of business and speeches has got to the public ear very much more successfully than happened up to that time <e> <s> i think that that was an important addition <e> <s> unfortunately the press gallery here is not always as full as noble lords would wish but this is a matter for the journals concerned <e> <s> certainly the more contact there can be between the lobby and noble lords the better <e> <s> i think that that has always been the case <e> <s> it is a question of working both ways <e> <s> it is not only journalists seeking access here but also us trying to put our points over to the media <e>", "<cs> my lords many efforts have been made but without the degree of success that we would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the thought that underlies the question <e> <s> there are two difficulties from my point of view <e> <s> one is that the administration committee has given a lot of thought already to this and will doubtless continue to do so secondly there is not the extent of accommodation that we would wish to have <e> <s> subject to that limitation the point has been well taken and i hope that it will be well taken not only within this house but also outside it <e>", "<cs> my lords everyone in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly not confined to members of your lordships house <e> <s> it is open to anyone in the palace of westminster to use <e> <s> it is a bar where such activities as underlie this question could be carried on <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so <e> <s> it is very agreeable and has access to the terrace <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl is right because the peers <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i did not see the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i can say in answer to the noble baroness is that if we never do worse than to write the th for the th july we will not have done badly <e>", "<cs> my lords on th june the government announced that they were going to review the programme of civil service dispersal <e> <s> the hardman report of had produced three possible options <e> <s> our predecessors then produced a plan which was significantly different from any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to the noble lord lord peart from the point of view of regional policy of course there are other moves which the government were tempted to take <e> <s> what we had to do was to balance first the changing circumstances of today secondly the cost and thirdly the cost-effectiveness and the need for promotion of a regional policy <e> <s> we have tried to steer a proper course between these three and i am grateful to the noble lord lord byers for having acknowledged this in the question that he asked me <e> <s> regarding the posts which we are moving because it is posts rather than people to scotland and to the north-west these are posts which under any circumstances we expect to see continued <e> <s> i am grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> this was not the easiest decision to reach for there were many arguments on both sides but we have tried to steer a course in the greatest national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords one must take some knowledge from history as well <e> <s> it is not the first time that there has been dispersal to glasgow and the surrounding districts <e> <s> i was told that on almost every occasion various objections were raised by people who were having to move as a result of dispersal <e> <s> but in fact once they had been there for some time they adapted themselves very much to the situation and wild horses would not have brought them back again to london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for confirming that what i said has been the experience in the past <e> <s> all i can say is that the savings as worked out by the treasury which as noble lords know seldom makes mistakes are of the order that i have indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to underestimate the value of dispersal <e> <s> of course it is true that certain jobs would be thrown up by dispersal but on the other hand as it was post-moving inevitably a lot of people would have moved as well in the initial years <e> <s> it is only really when we come to wastage that the benefits of dispersal become very great <e> <s> you have the wastage then the jobs being filled by people coming in from the local areas <e> <s> a number of areas of the united kingdom as a whole were concerned <e> <s> we considered various sites as i say and we have ended up with a balance between the necessary savings that we have to make on the one hand and on the other hand the benefits of dispersal <e> <s> so far as the unions are concerned the general feeling i do not say there were not some exceptions to this is that we do not expect them to be hostile to this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord davies <e>", "<cs> my lords of course as my noble friend lord carrington has said we all know that the conference is still proceeding <e> <s> perhaps it would be better if the house now passed on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked for a full-dress debate on this matter <e> <s> there will of course be a debate on wednesday in which a number of these points will be raised and of course the matter will be discussed through the usual channels <e> <s> i am not all that experienced in the rules of the house but i have looked up how we should tackle these matters and i read that ministerial statements are made for the information of the house and although brief comments and questions for clarification are allowed such statements should not be made the occasion for an immediate debate unless the house so orders <e> <s> i thought i would point that out <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i understand that this is the right procedure <e> <s> the house expects that when a statement is made it should be followed by questions which relate essentially to that statement <e> <s> that was the burden of what i read out to the house <e> <s> i had a feeling that questions on this particular subject were rapidly coming to an end but we could discuss this matter through the usual channels if there is any doubt <e> <s> however generally speaking i think the situation is appreciated by the house and i hope that we can move on <e>", "<cs> my lords as to the last question asked by the noble baroness that is indeed correct <e> <s> as to her first question i must say that it is very much the hope of the government that we shall be able to deal with this bill on monday because it is a matter of great urgency and because there is a final moment by which we want to get it <e> <s> therefore i hope very much that it will be possible in view of the fact that it is an enabling bill of i agree enormous importance to complete all its stages on monday <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall put down a motion to suspend the relevant standing order which will enable the house to take the bill through all its stages on the same day <e>", "<cs> my lords not if i get my way <e> <s> the bill will be taken through all its stages in this house on monday <e> <s> what happens in another place on thursday thursday night or friday i wot not of but we shall not be here on friday <e>", "<cs> my lords this will enable orders in council to be laid whether some of them or all of them will be affirmative as opposed to negative orders i am afraid i cannot say at this juncture but i will inform myself as soon as may be <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill will be published and it will be available in the printed paper office at any moment now <e> <s> it will go through all its stages <e> <s> i thought the particular question that the noble lord lord wigg was asking me was the same question as the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones asked my noble friend the foreign secretary that is whether all the orders that flow from this enabling bill will require an affirmative vote or not <e> <s> my noble friend regretted that he could not give an immediate answer to that and as he cannot give an immediate answer i am terribly sorry to say that i cannot either <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are deeply grateful to my noble friend lord thorneycroft for having initiated this debate <e> <s> i am sure that there are few in your lordships house who have had more experience over the years than my noble friend in the matters that he has discussed both in government and i remember the happy days when he and i sat next to each other in cabinet and used to pass each other rude messages from time to time and later in industry <e> <s> my <e>", "<cs> order <e> <s> my lords one at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords from the opposition and the liberal party for what they have said and for the understanding that they have shown in these difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret this <e> <s> i would not have thought that it was advisable for the house to meet just for starred questions <e> <s> i can only apologise for the difficulties involved for noble lords who have put down questions <e> <s> a possible answer given these difficulties is for the questions to be withdrawn and put down for another day or they may be left and they will receive written answers whichever noble lords prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to follow the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts in winding-up this debate from this dispatch box <e> <s> rhodesia is a question which has always attracted numerous and distinguished contributions from noble lords in all quarters of the house when it has deen debated and todays debate has lived up to that standard <e> <s> i shall do my best to answer as many points as possible that have been raised by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the british government take whatever responsibilities they will need to take in this regard and they will look to the rhodesian government to take the responsibilities that the people who are elected should take <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i missed what the noble and learned lord said <e> <s> i was being complimented as i always am <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says it is months since this matter was referred along with a number of other matters to the top salaries review body <e> <s> it was understood at the time that there were some priorities in this and that there would be more than one report coming from the review body <e> <s> one report has already come from this body covering four out of the eight <e> <s> i have no doubt that they will take note of what has been said in the house today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt whatsoever and certainly it would be the hope of the whole house that the noble lord will have many years yet to enjoy the fruits of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed there are a number of members of this house too who are involved in this that i know <e> <s> i am sure that the review body and particularly their chairman will take note of all that has been said in the house today <e> <s> they have already reported on some of the points they were given an order of priorities and it is my hope that it will not be long before they report again <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure about that my lords <e> <s> i must declare an interest myself <e>", "<cs> my lords let us hope it will bubble over very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a statement on the business of the house for next week <e> <s> the house was to have been occupied with the committee stage of the protection of official information bill on monday and tuesday of next week <e> <s> the government have now decided that it would be right for the bill not to proceed further in the present circumstances <e> <s> the committee stage will consequently be removed from the order paper <e> <s> no new business will be tabled for monday next <e> <s> tomorrow i shall move a motion to advance the second reading of the european communities greek accession bill from monday rd december to next tuesday th november <e> <s> other business will also be tabled for next tuesday <e> <s> the second reading of the shipbuilding bill will be postponed from monday rd december to tuesday th december <e>", "<cs> no not learned <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to reply to the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> however may i say to the noble lord lord byers about his question concerning the intention of the government in the far future that time for further reflection is going to be taken by the government <e> <s> what the outcome of that reflection will be i should not like to forecast <e> <s> however further reflection will be given to the matter and i would ask the house not to press me today too far on that <e> <s> perhaps we shall have more news later for the house <e> <s> may i say to the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that of course there was a lively second reading of the bill <e> <s> we all know that <e> <s> the government were expecting a number of amendments <e> <s> however as i have said certain unusual and <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of the remarks and proposals made by the noble lord lord byers without committing myself about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather regret that this has caused the noble lord to withdraw his starred question because i have no doubt that we should have had an agreeable interesting and diverting debate <e> <s> the reason for the withdrawal was not to give satisfaction to for instance the media <e> <s> the reason for the withdrawal was that following on <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as this bill is concerned the content of the policies goes without saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not noticed that my noble friend lord barnby suffered very much from being shot down but any question that he wishes to leave upon the order paper will of course receive a written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the question-and-answer period and the period of statements having taken over minutes it is perhaps time that we moved on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that was more in the form of a statement than a question and i have the feeling that the house would rather like to get on to the shipbuilding bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it was to meet the strongly expressed desires of the noble lords honourable friends in another place that this was done <e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that he is preaching to the converted <e>", "<cs> my lords i have yet to see many of the bills that are coming up this session fall into that category <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a statement about the governments review of the size and cost of the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to asnwer some of those questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord peart referred first to his anxieties that essential services might be cut <e> <s> i can assure him that this is not the case <e> <s> this has been avoided i would say almost at all costs <e> <s> this has been a review by departmental ministers throughout their departments in response to a request and the question has been asked what would you have to cut if you were to cut x percentage out of the total of your staff costs <e> <s> what would this involve <e> <s> this was then looked at and some things were immediately jettisoned not even considered others were considered and discussed and then jettisoned some were accepted straight away and others were argued over which is why it has taken a bit of time before i have come to the house <e> <s> this has been an exercise which i think has been worth while <e> <s> i also think that certainly where i was concerned and probably where the noble lord lord peart was concerned too up till now ministers certainly this was the case for myself have tended to concentrate on the policies of their departments rather more than on the administering of them and to leave the administration to the civil service <e> <s> what this exercise has done is to bring ministers absolutely slap into this field into the realisation of their being responsible for the administration and for watching over the efficient working of their departments <e> <s> this is going to continue and i hope have benefit in time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords the staff of the foreign and commonwealth office has not been cut very substantially in this operation <e> <s> the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts referred to it as a shorn lamb <e> <s> i must tell the noble lord that having held discussions with almost every departmental minister in this operation there was hardly one which did not consider itself to be already a shorn lamb <e>", "<cs> my lords the british council would have come under the foreign office review i think but do not hold it against me if i am wrong <e> <s> i am now told british council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> yes we were absolutely convinced that this was a job which needed doing <e> <s> it is not an easy one to perform <e> <s> i am not saying that there are not areas where i am rather disappointed that we have not been able to go further but this is not the end of the road <e> <s> as i say a number of reviews are still in train and ministers will be constantly watching to ensure the efficiency of their own departments and for just the sort of situation to which my noble friend referred <e> <s> i think this is a matter of balance <e> <s> it is not as easy as it sounds doing this operation <e> <s> what had to be done was that tasks had to be taken away <e> <s> there was a limit to how much you could do by as it were just cutting off fat and tasks had to be reduced <e>", "<cs> no not in the front end my lords <e>", "<cs> no my lords we would not consider that to be right <e>", "<cs> my lords they certainly cost a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is funny but i did not think it was <e> <s> the answer is no because this is not the way it happened <e> <s> all the departments came up with what would need to be done if they were to cut their staff costs by a certain amount <e> <s> it so happened that in the ministry of transport it was decided that more could be done than elsewhere <e> <s> it was not a question of the civil servants in the ministry of transport coming out with more ideas than came out of other departments <e> <s> it was that we found that more could be done with less damage there than could be done in other departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if it had been that to any marked degree i should have been misleading the house <e> <s> i would not wish to do that <e>", "<cs> in answer to the first part of my noble friends supplementary question the foreign and commonwealth office is very much smaller today than was the foreign office the colonial office and the india office in times gone by <e> <s> the increase in the civil service has come about by virtue of the fact that governments over the years have to a greater extent increasingly every year touched the lives of the people at more points than ever before <e> <s> that is where the increase has been and that is where we have had to look <e> <s> in answer to the second part of my noble friends supplementary question the department of employment employ a number of people on a regular basis to do the job that he outlined so vividly <e>", "<cs> my lords simplification of the tax structure is something which all chancellors of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not thought of that <e> <s> frankly and i am not being pi here i think that those civil servants in the departments with whom i have had contact in this exercise have genuinely gone about this exercise with a will <e> <s> i do not think that they would have looked kindly upon the idea of cash benefits for it <e> <s> i think they did it in the line of duty <e> <s> may i suggest and i do not know whether i can defend myself on this matter that perhaps it would be of convenience to the house that we move on to the ordinary business of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that we have had enough of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i make a statement on the governments intentions regarding the bill on iran which is being introduced in another place this afternoon <e>", "<cs> thank you my lords <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the prime minister on the efficiency and size of the civil service <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to address myself to the questions of the noble lords lord peart and lord byers <e> <s> i turn first to the questions of the noble lord lord peart <e> <s> i hope that he did not get me wrong <e> <s> i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should like to commit my right honourable and honourable friends to any particular time limit regarding announcements <e> <s> we announced quite a considerable chunk of reductions in the past and we are now giving what we consider a proper figure at which to aim over the course of four years <e> <s> i think that there will be announcements when ministers feel it right to inform parliament <e> <s> this involves not just the civil service department but individual ministers in charge of their respective departments and i think that there will be announcements when they think it right to inform parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord plant generalises a bit when he says that the civil service will be dismayed by this <e> <s> there may well be some civil servants who are but i think there will be a lot who are not <e> <s> i think there are a lot who will be only too glad to see and feel that they are working in an effective and efficient machine which has been slimmed down and which has the prospect of being able to do its task efficiently and without undue waste <e> <s> i think a lot of them will think this <e> <s> in fact i know a lot of them do and will <e> <s> but this is not to say that all of them will and this is not to say that there will not be personal anxieties <e> <s> i appreciate that but i really do not think it is right to say that it will not be well received <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a false analogy to look at the civil service in the same light as closing down pits or closing down railway lines <e> <s> they are really not the same <e> <s> what we are seeking to have here is a civil service which can do what government needs of it and can serve the nation well but i do not think that anybody not least the civil service itself would like to think that there are more civil servants than are necessary to do the job <e> <s> this is not an exact science <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord thinks should be the right size for the civil service <e> <s> what we are saying is that taking into account the examination which we have given to this over a year in office we think that after four years is the right figure at which to aim <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will believe us in this that this we think is in the best interests of the nation including the government <e> <s> i assure him that his questions will still be answered as will the cbis and those by all the other organisations <e> <s> but it is not just that <e> <s> of course it is a very broad area industrial and non-industrial that we are covering here <e> <s> as to the civil servants being asked to co-operate in this and to make suggestions themselves i assure the noble lord that this is exactly what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend of course the tasks performed are a vital element in this connection <e> <s> this is not just a question of doing things better it is also one of how many things have to be done of examining whether or not we are asking for an unnecessary number of things to be done or for some things to be done in a too gold-plated and rolls-royce fashion and whether we could not do things more cheaply <e> <s> i think the nation will be pleased about this <e> <s> we are not doing this just for cost considerations but cost has its importance <e> <s> a per cent <e> <s> reduction in the size of the civil service is equal to about million a year of taxpayers money <e> <s> the civil servants themselves think that they owe it to the taxpayer that it should be done rightly and properly <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that we are not intending to do this by any sleight of hand by saying that from now on there will be no prison warders counted as civil servants and that therefore we have reduced the size of the civil service by <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to differ from the noble lord in that we have already expressed a lot of specific intentions where reductions are concerned <e> <s> the saving of some posts which i announced early in december last year related specifically to various departments where the cuts would fall <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that there is no question of everybody doing an exact per cent <e> <s> over four years <e> <s> that cannot be so <e> <s> some will cut less some will have no cuts at all and others we hope may be able to cut more than that <e> <s> i hope the house does not think that the government should <e>", "<cs> my lords this will apply both to the industrials and to the non-industrials <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord was talking of when he mentioned planning was an area which falls within local government <e> <s> this is not what i am talking of today <e> <s> i am speaking of the civil service and central government <e> <s> but i do not in any way disagree with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> there are great areas in local government too where staffs have increased beyond all recognition over the years and the ratepayers are paying very highly for it <e> <s> we would hope that the same sort of <e>", "<cs> my lords to improve efficiency rather than to remove inefficiency is the best way to put it <e> <s> we all know that in an organisation of people there is always room for improvement in efficiency <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with the noble baroness that that is our thought or that it would be right <e> <s> the object is not to remove employment but to have an efficient civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the inland revenue is decreasing in size but the size of the inland revenue depends very much on the structure of taxation <e> <s> as to the publication i will bear in mind what the noble lord has said <e> <s> perhaps he will forgive me for not answering immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords yes and i think that this is a good example of that <e> <s> i do not know the exact figure or proportion but i believe that less than per cent <e> <s> of the total in fact did not turn up for work today <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on the contrary it is not only in this house that this particular proposal has met with a <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said there are some trade disputes going on at present between various civil service unions and the government <e> <s> but that does not mean that they should think it advisable and in the event i am glad to say that they did not think it advisable to pursue those disputes on this particular day in the particular manner proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that it is for me to say what effect the attitude of the opposition is likely to have on the political thinking of our fellow countrymen <e> <s> that is for them to judge <e> <s> personally i do not think that today they have increased their standing <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the diocese in europe measure has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the measure at the disposal of parliament for the purposes of the measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is now six and a half months since the deplorable events in which members of the united states embassy in tehran were taken hostage <e> <s> during those months a sustained and strenuous effort has been made by the united states supported by many western countries to secure their release by diplomatic pressure and so far alas <e> <s> that has come to naught <e> <s> it is in this context this afternoon that i introduce for its second reading a short bill which represents the governments response to a plea by the united states a plea which has been similarly made to our other allies in the european community in the alliance and more widely to take further steps of concrete support for the united states including the imposition of economic sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords while in no way disagreeing with the noble lord as to the services which are rendered by members of all these boards generally speaking where the particular situation of mr macgregor and british steel is concerned it was one particular man who the government thought was right to run this particular industry and to overcome the very considerable difficulties which we all know confront that industry and so special arrangements were made <e> <s> perhaps it is the exception which proves the rule <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the general point made by the noble lord lord avebury of course we are awaiting the report and i think it would be premature to say what the report contains <e> <s> i do not know what the report will come up with in terms of increases in salaries in this particular area so i am sure he will forgive me if i do not comment on it <e> <s> as to the point to which he linked his general observation about the tendency of everybody to think that he is as good as mr macgregor i think the market place has something to do with that as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i heard every word that fell from the noble lords lips but i think i heard the term market place from him <e> <s> what i was referring to was not the market place in just these particular industries <e> <s> but when it comes to picking men out from the market place to put them into these industries the market place will often give you a guideline as to what those men could command within that market place <e>", "<cs> my lords that i feel is a matter for individuals and not a matter for the leader of this house or the lord president of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot give an exact answer to that question off-the-cuff concerning the extent to which this limitation applies but i think we feel that in the case of those who are executive board members of nationalised industries as opposed to non-executive board members it is a very full-time job and generally speaking one would not expect them to be using their energies outside that particular job <e> <s> however as i say where mr macgregor is concerned this can be expressed as the exception that proves the rule <e> <s> but i do not want to take it too far if the noble lord will excuse me because i am not yet absolutely certain what are the guidelines <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will content himself for a second or two i think we shall soon be on to the mounted police <e>", "<cs> my lords in seeking greater efficiency and further economy in the civil service ministers will be looking across all the activities of their departments <e> <s> their detailed plans will take into account both the need for those activities and the scope for making them both simpler and more efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend will appreciate that this is very much a matter for the individual ministers concerned <e> <s> it is not for the judgment of the minister responsible for the day-to-day happenings in the civil service department as to what should be cut or run down in which department <e> <s> however i know that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will of course take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord is talking about happened such a long time ago that i do not remember it so i do not agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell will understand that it was not i who tabled the question <e> <s> my noble friend lord sandford refers particularly to supporting small businesses which are certainly very wealth-creative <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord will understand me when i say that my noble friend the minister of state for industry will i am sure take note of what he says <e> <s> of course he will <e> <s> however it is not for me to say whether or not a certain priority will be given within a department to one aspect or another of its work <e>", "<cs> well my lords i do not think that we are doing badly <e> <s> if i am partially satisfying my noble friend lord renton then that is already something <e> <s> as regards pressing on i do not honestly believe that the real trouble as regards bills flows from the number of parliamentary draftsmen and parliamentary counsel <e> <s> i think that noble lords on both sides of the house will agree that frequently the faults lie with those of us who are ministers who very often expect miracles from parliamentary draftsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot totally disagree with the noble and learned lords sentiment <e> <s> he has put his finger on a very tender pressure point but it will be better next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to the noble lord lord davies of leek and i of course associate myself with what he has said <e> <s> i think that the work that they do is absolutely miraculous considering all the pressures that are put upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite something for me to know that the noble lord opposite shares my view and finds it difficult as well <e> <s> it is quite something to know that it is not only me who finds them difficult to understand <e> <s> however i would ask the noble lord to be understanding to me because he has asked a rather far-reaching question whereas the original question concerned how many parliamentary draftsmen there were at a particular date <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that perhaps we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have heard enough on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> i suggested that we should move on to the next question <e> <s> i feel that this is the wish of the house and i hope that he will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords we need a proper mixture <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose it is always said but i really do mean it this afternoon i think we should be exceedingly grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for having instigated this debate and i say that for two reasons <e> <s> one that i suppose public sector pay in general is probably one of the most complicated and certainly one of the most important matters which government in the present circumstances and the present economic difficulties through which the country is passing have to face <e> <s> secondly it is extremely timely because with one pay round coming to an end and another one just about to begin for there is not much gap between the two this is as it were on the front burner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lords lord goronwy-roberts and lord gladwyn for their comments and questions <e> <s> to take first of all the remarks of the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts at least that aspect of his statement that comprised questions on coal and uneconomic pits the fact that we were going to try to increase production that those seven countries with all their resources would do their best to increase very considerably the production of coal referred largely to a number of those countries particularly the united states where coal is not produced at anything like the rate that it could be <e> <s> this does not mean that her majestys government will be in any way altering their policies towards economic or non-economic pits <e> <s> there may be room for disagreement on what is an uneconomic pit <e> <s> but all that i can say from the dispatch box this afternoon is that once her majestys government have decided what are economic pits then it is not the intention because of this meeting and what was decided at this meeting to go for opening up pits again if it is thought that they are uneconomic <e> <s> it does not have any effect on that aspect of her majestys governments policies <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the noble lords first point he has a very nice and tidy mind and likes everything explained exactly and i for long admired it when i was working for him indeed as one of his ambassadors <e> <s> as to what was said regarding coal i can only repeat what i said before <e> <s> it was understandable at least i understood it and i am sorry if the noble lord did not understand it <e> <s> it was thought possible that those countries participating in this conference could double the production of coal <e> <s> i can only tell him that my understanding of that is that it does not mean coal at any price because that would not be very wise <e> <s> what i think might have been meant is that it is thought that those countries could double the economic production of coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about the noble lord but i have had some experience of north-south meetings and i do not think it is particularly wise <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i cannot tell the noble lord if he would like to put down a question it will of course be answered what stage the governments consideration of the brandt report has reached <e> <s> more than this i fear i cannot tell him i think that it is not dependence on each other so much as interdependence which is a term which has now been on our lips and tongues for many a long year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is not envisaged that this will in any way affect the governments plans for investment in oil <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to lay down what will be the agenda for the next conference <e> <s> but i shall certainly ensure that what the noble lord with all his experience has said is drawn to the attention of those whose responsibility it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord peart and lord wigoder for their comments <e> <s> may i just pick up one or two points <e> <s> yes of course commitments have been made to the civil service <e> <s> the prime minister referred in her statement specifically to assistant secretaries and senior principals <e> <s> also commitments have been made to the house of commons by this government <e> <s> but the situation has changed and the government regard it as their duty when it is necessary to make the necessary adaptations and openly to say all right we are sorry <e> <s> in the national interest we feel it right that we must go back on these commitments <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer first of all to the last question asked by the noble lord lord taylor yes this is the last time that the salaries of the chairmen and board members will be recommended by the boyle review body <e> <s> their next round which will not be before this time next year will be settled by the ministers who have a certain measure of responsibility for each particular nationalised industry in consultation with the chairmen with an overall view as it were being kept by the minister in charge of the civil service to ensure that it is not too much out of line bearing in mind that indeed the responsibilities of some are greater than others <e> <s> it may well be that they will not be the same they are not now and they will not be necessarily the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for the questions he has asked <e> <s> where differentials of salaries are concerned no the problem has not been cured and indeed to have cured it would have required an increase of salaries to executive board members which would have been beyond what the government think would be right in the present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords hopefully it will do more than that <e> <s> hopefully it will encourage others to settle for less high wage increases and that will have a major effect on unemployment <e> <s> i see what the noble lord is trying to say and i am not going to accept it because we have a very broad span of increases which have been reported to this house in the public sector in recent times from per cent <e> <s> to the nurses down to per cent <e> <s> to cabinet ministers <e> <s> if that is an incomes policy it is a very broad one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about the noble lord but i am alive and no i am afraid this does not form a part of the boyle report though i know that the point raised by my noble friend is taken <e> <s> but it is not taken by lord boyle he was not invited so to do <e>", "<cs> taking the first point first my lords i have a figure of million of savings in my head <e> <s> i must own up to your lordships in that whether that applies to report no <e> <s> or nos <e> <s> and together i am not absolutely certain but no <e> <s> is certainly where the large money is <e> <s> as i say the figure i have in my mind is million and i do not think that is far out for the total <e> <s> as to whether or not it is draconian it was not seeking to be draconian <e> <s> as i said and can only repeat what the government thought they were doing was performing their duty given the circumstances and fitting in the natural desires of those concerned in effect trying to match that on the one hand with the national interest on the other <e>", "<cs> i do not know from whom such statements would come my lords or whether i would have any influence over them in what i say but of course what the noble lord asserts is absolutely correct it has already been said by the noble lord lord wigoder and i have confirmed it <e> <s> this is purely for expenses incurred and there is no element in it of salary whatever <e>", "<cs> that was a gross figure my lords or at least i hope it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will agree that we should move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> never mind <e> <s> it is all right <e> <s> my noble friend should say he agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know why the noble lord should go so far as to say that he does not think there was any connection <e> <s> i should think there most probably was <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may intervene for a second to suggest that in the interests of the <e>", "<cs> and therefore perhaps shorter as well <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two motions standing in my name on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for all that various noble lords have said on this matter <e> <s> it is quite obvious that it is widely accepted in the house that junior ministers need some improvement in their remuneration <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who asked me specific questions the fact that i said in my statement that the government are looking at this matter shows that we too are treating it seriously <e> <s> we are looking at it with a view to doing something <e> <s> the question is what is best to be done <e> <s> there are difficulties about every course <e> <s> if i may i will leave it at that for the time being <e> <s> we have looked at a number of courses and we are trying to discover which is the best the easiest and the most satisfactory to pursue and i hope it will not be very long before a decision is reached <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is agreed by everybody that the main problem is the acoustics but it will not be possible because it would be so costly to put into this chamber on a temporary basis the sophisticated microphone arrangements that there are in our own chamber <e> <s> everything that can be done will be done to improve the existing microphone system <e> <s> more work will be done over the weekend <e> <s> however it is bound to be of a temporary nature <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is dangerous to enter too much into semantics in this regard <e> <s> both are true <e> <s> there is no question but that we believe that the system practised in the world the system which we follow in the industrialised western world is the best system for the world as a whole <e> <s> but that does not mean that there have not been many fundamental changes ever since the first oil hike in which have had dire effects on a number of undeveloped countries notably those that are not oil producers <e> <s> all this has to be taken into account in deciding how best to go forward <e> <s> it is very good that this session is to take place and the noble lord can rest assured that we shall participate fully in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must admit that it would be simpler if we were to make the statement then <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot of factors are involved <e> <s> this is a major topic and not one which is all that easily dealt with by question and answer either in this house or in another place <e> <s> it covers such a multitude of facts and factors <e>", "<cs> my lords again there is something in what the noble lord has said but i do not agree with him that it is we who have spread bad government <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would forgive me <e> <s> i have a statement to make first on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think any of us including the noble lord lord shinwell i am sure it is the last thing he would want to do would wish to push anything too far as he mentioned in his intervention <e> <s> i really do not know what happened in another place <e> <s> there was no intention of making any announcement so if there was any discourtesy it was certainly an unintentional discourtesy <e> <s> those of us who know the rules of order of another place will appreciate that at it is question time <e> <s> there was certainly no original answer to any question which was intended to give such a reply <e> <s> what exactly was said in the reply which i imagine was passed to the noble baroness lady birk i am afraid i do not know <e> <s> i do not know what was said but it would have been said in answer to a supplementary <e> <s> i am sure no discourtesy was intended to this house and i am also sure that no statement has been made on what the government intend to do in another place which presumably they will decide when the moment comes <e> <s> i would suggest that this is not in any way a wilful indiscretion or incivility from one house to another <e> <s> if it is i am sure the government would share my regret <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could help to clear this up <e> <s> of course it would be a matter for regret if any slip of the tongue appeared to be a matter of discourtesy but certainly we are talking about no more than that <e>", "<cs> had this not arisen the bill would have gone from this house to another place and at the proper time the government would have announced their intentions of which this house is not yet aware <e> <s> they would have announced them when it got to another place <e> <s> it is my belief i cannot be sure because i was not there but i do not think that is necessary that nothing has been said which could be construed as being more than a discourtesy and certainly nothing which would warrant the postponement of this bill being given a third reading in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend would allow me to say that it looks as if the wish of the house is that it should divide on this matter <e> <s> i should just like to point out that there is in effect no way by which we can discover the exact words used in another place until tomorrow until we see the <e>", "<cs> there is no other way in which we could find it out <e> <s> this motion has been put to the house by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> in reply to the noble baroness i would say that we are absolutely convinced that we know enough about it to know that no statement has been made which could affect this house in any way except in so far as it might have been a discourtesy <e> <s> and i have already told noble lords that if it be a discourtesy the government will of course regret it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been able to confirm though of course unofficially until <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but not before publication in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that your lordships have had a good hunt after my noble friend and perhaps we might move on to the next question <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will make a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to thank the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord wigoder for the remarks that they have made <e> <s> i know that the house will join with them in thanking the psa staff indeed the whole staff and black rod and i think the administration committee for having taken this matter in hand and providing what i think is the proper and probably the only solution to suit your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be a wise suggestion made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot comment on his assertion that the ceiling has not been inspected since <e> <s> i do not think that anybody in this house goes back in memory quite as far as that <e> <s> once it has been inspected and redone i should like to think it will last for quite a while before having to be inspected again <e> <s> there are probably other lessons to be learned about other chambers in the palace of westminster which might need inspection <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord shinwell there will i think be a marginal effect on the acoustics in the chamber while the false ceiling is in position <e> <s> i am hopeful that it will not be anything with which we cannot all comfortably live <e> <s> the acoustics were excellent before <e> <s> i hope they will be at least good when we go back with a false ceiling <e> <s> they will be better than they are here anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that if the noble lord lord mishcon was right it would have been <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is inspected every year underneath <e> <s> i do not see why that should not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall have to see what it all looks like at the end of the day <e> <s> the inspection process will go on when the house is not sitting and not while the house is sitting <e>", "<cs> i learned a sharp lesson the other day not to start talking about bills when they are in another place <e> <s> i am not going to say anything but there will be all sorts of things that will be sayable i have no doubt at the proper time <e> <s> it would not be right for me to say it now nor to comment upon it at all <e> <s> i think that the less i or any of my noble friends say about this bill at this particular juncture the better but that is not to say that there will not be all sorts of things good things to say about it later <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that this is the first i have heard of figures anything like those which the noble lord has just mentioned in terms of starvation and i do not think that they at all tally with the facts in zimbabwe <e> <s> there is a considerable distribution problem owing to the communications having been very disrupted during the war but it is much more that than anything else <e> <s> there are certain areas which the food is not reaching but the situation has nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a little hard to answer that question because as the noble lord rightly said this is something which occurred yesterday or the day before i think and is obviously in the nature of things <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise very much with what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has said and it is our hope that the contemporary and temporary preoccupations will have passed before the aid donors conference comes into being <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty here in that the noble lord was kind enough to give me notice that he intended to ask this question <e> <s> on the other hand as leader of the house i must say that this question about two specific young ladies and what happened to them when they came into england seems to me to be rather far from the original question about what success they have achieved in persuading their allies to contribute to the aid fund for zimbabwe <e> <s> however since notice was given i perhaps might do my best to answer the noble lords supplementary question which is that when these two young ladies came into this country they were not given leave to enter on the grounds that they had no evidence of <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are refused entry they will have to go back to zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper

debate i feel that as leader of the house i should put one fact before your lordships <e> <s> this is an item of subordinate legislation <e> <s> it was decided that unlike primary legislation subordinate legislation should not be affected <e>", "<cs> my lords whether orders of this character prove to be controversial or in the end non-controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness feels herself to be as it were split over this issue and does not know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has himself been leader of the house <e> <s> i inquired about the matter because i thought it right to do so and to inform the house about it <e> <s> if the noble lord feels that i should have done so sooner then i am sorry that i did not <e> <s> but i certainly felt it right so to do <e>", "<cs> my lords in my last statement to the house shortly before the summer recess i expressed the hope that we would be able to return to our usual parliament chamber in october <e> <s> to my relief this has indeed proved possible and i am sure that the whole house is relieved and thankful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the remarks of both the noble lord lord peart and the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> the government were always aware that we were setting a rather ambitious timetable in trying to get our programme through in time <e> <s> it was of course in the interests not just of getting the governments business this session but also of next session as well <e> <s> the th november is late for the beginning of the new session of parliament <e> <s> but we knew it was ambitious at the time and we always knew there was a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now talking about the next session <e> <s> the noble lord is asking rather a lot <e> <s> does he mean this session <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords <e> <s> i thought the noble lord was asking when the next session would end <e>", "<cs> my lords that will depend <e> <s> we cannot yet say exactly on what day prorogation will take place <e> <s> what we have done is to leave plenty of time both for this house and for another place to give proper scrutiny to the affairs before them <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were not in this house i would answer in unparliamentary language <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will of course be aware that we have set up a committee under sir bernard scott to look into the full cost of the indexing of public pensions and more particularly what should be paid towards them by public servants <e> <s> as he said <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> i could not give that figure <e>", "<cs> my lords this is what we have asked sir bernard scott to advise us on <e> <s> we are talking specifically about the contribution that is paid towards this by the civil service <e> <s> it was i think gauged at per cent <e> <s> by the government actuary and we have asked sir bernard scott to advise us whether he and his committee agree that this is a proper figure or whether it ought to be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords paid for according to what the government actuarys figure was which was taken into account by the pay research unit <e> <s> what sir bernard scott will do is to make <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can commit myself and my colleagues to today is that we will give full consideration to sir bernard scotts report <e> <s> of course my noble friend will realise that the figure for public service pensions is tied to the figure of increase for retirement pensions generally at present <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as members of another place have index-linked pensions that is so <e> <s> i never talked about buying out <e>", "<cs> my lords i outlined to the council of civil service unions on st august a number of changes which the government wish to make to the civil service pay research system <e> <s> discussions on these are continuing <e> <s> meanwhile the government have made clear that in the cash limit will be the main determinant of the civil service pay settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at the moment in conversation with the unions concerned <e> <s> we have put forward to them a number of proposals some of which were included in the most interesting debate which was initiated by my noble friend some months back <e> <s> as to the high settlements of late i am sure that the noble lord in using these words has borne in mind the fact that three years ago there was a very low settlement in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i really dissent from what my noble friend is getting at but i must dissent when he says that it is the trend-setter <e> <s> indeed pay research is has to be and can only be having a pay settlement in the civil service alongside what has already happened in the private sector and indeed outside the civil service generally <e> <s> so i would not say that it was a trend-setter <e> <s> on the other hand in the present economic situation the government are determined that they should have major control this year over the levels of settlement and it is for that reason that we have said that cash limits will be the major determinant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am not quite aware of what the noble lord is asking me in that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the statement which my noble friend lord belstead has just repeated it might <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is a little early for me to say that but obviously from the governments point of view it will be the sooner the better after the bill has passed through both houses <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there is no doubt about that and indeed it was that fact which prompted the prime minister to make the statement to which i have just referred <e> <s> as to the timing it is a complicated and somewhat detailed matter more complicated than it looks on the surface as we have found when we came to look into it and no doubt others have found the same thing before <e> <s> all i can assure my noble friend is that there will be another announcement as soon as possible as soon as we have reached a conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems quite evidently in a matter of this kind is the general economic position of the country <e> <s> inevitably this has to be taken into account by her majestys government but i would not like to go further than that in answering the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite know to which particular people on the opposition front bench my noble friend is referring <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the noble baroness has certainly put it in my mind <e> <s> in order not to raise any false hopes i think i should say to the noble baroness that the people who are being considered are the equivalent in this house of those who get paid other than parliamentary salaries in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords this is absolutely true <e> <s> one category is prohibited from earning a living outside others we might say are inhibited from earning a living outside <e> <s> as my noble friend rightly says there is a difference between the two and as i said those whose pay is under some scrutiny at the moment are those in this house who have their equivalents in another place who are being paid beyond the parliamentary salary <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble lord lord aberdare be appointed to take the chair in all committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the noble baroness lady white be appointed principal deputy chairman of committees for this session <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was trying to say and i regret if i did not explain myself well was that the total bill this year for subsidies for the external financing limits of nationalised industries as a whole is over billion <e> <s> this is not to say of course that there are not some who either through efficiency or by having a monopoly and control over their prices are not in fact making profits <e> <s> of course there are <e> <s> i am talking generally speaking of the whole spectrum of nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> no my lords i believe that the noble lord is going to speak and i think that answers the point that he made <e>", "<cs> my lords may i rise for just one second <e> <s> i have spoken for a long time so i will not detain your lordships but i think it is important to get this right <e> <s> the assurance which the prime minister gave to which the noble baroness has referred was about pensions not being eroded but continuing to be index-linked <e> <s> what this figure of per cent <e> <s> is about is this <e> <s> this year there was misjudgment about the degree of inflation and therefore per cent <e> <s> more than the index linking is being paid and the figure of per cent <e> <s> lower is to contain the figure within the index linking <e> <s> that was the assurance given <e>", "<cs> that is what i said my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i was not denying that that was the situation in i was saying it is quite different today <e> <s> i said in my speech though i do not think the noble lord noticed it that this is the reverse of the coin of being an oil-rich nation <e> <s> our currency is so high very largely because we are an oil-rich nation <e> <s> it makes our currency high but it is based alas <e> <s> on an uncompetitive industry <e>", "<cs> my lords there is at least one consistent theme which has run through this whole debate which is one of gratitude to my noble friend lord alport for having introduced this bill and given the house the opportunity to talk about this matter of fundamental importance <e> <s> i should like to add my words of thanks and congratulations to him not only for the form and the manner but the matter of the speech he made introducing this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how many different views there are in another place about what sort of reform if any there should be of this house <e> <s> certainly some of my colleagues think that there ought to be radical reforms of this house <e> <s> there are others who think that there should be some reform and yet others who think that at the moment it is probably better as it is <e> <s> i am not sure that i could not make a speech in favour of either view or in favour of all three views if put to it <e>", "<cs> my lords all these matters were taken into account by the offices committee who knew what the size was going to be <e> <s> there is a considerable saving in machinery <e> <s> new machinery has been installed <e> <s> it was realised at the time that there would be a considerable saving in both machinery and in practice and day-to-day working <e> <s> many of us have been accustomed some of us for many more years than we choose to remember to a particular size of <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should say to the noble baroness that this has quite a lot to do with the introduction of metrication and i understand it is likely that more and more papers will be printed on a size paper <e> <s> so in any case filing systems will gradually be adapted to take more and more a size paper <e> <s> whether one does ones own filing or somebody else does it the same applies <e> <s> i do not for the moment do my own filing and i hope that i shall continue not to have to do it for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> that was reflected also in the short debate that took place in this house afterwards <e>", "<cs> well perhaps the wish is father to the thought <e>", "<cs> i think that that is a rather pessimistic view my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble viscounts point <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only give the estimate of the savings which was made at the time <e> <s> i am afraid that we have not been at it long enough to be able to give an exact figure <e> <s> the figures are on machinery and a year on manpower <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house will agree that it has a had a good run and b had some good answers and perhaps we should move on <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that we had spent minutes on two questions <e> <s> there are two more questions to come and there is a lot of business to come afterwards <e> <s> i think we should move on if the house would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounds to me a very agreeable course <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord spens will let me know where it is <e> <s> but as to subsistence over a four-day period being extravagant <e>", "<cs> absolutely my lords and i must apologise to the house for the flippancy of my reply to the noble lord lord spens <e> <s> this is a very serious matter and the courses are absolutely necessary <e> <s> i have mugged up this subject for the purpose of these replies and it may interest the house to know that there were in fact civil servants who went through some form of course or other as they were moved from one place to another and of those a very small proportion actually went on residential courses <e> <s> where the foreign office is concerned not only the language courses but also the courses to prepare them with knowledge of british industry and the like which is necessary when they are posted to foreign countries are i think invaluable to this country and on the whole they are well done <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful also to the noble lord and i know this to be true <e> <s> probably training is one of the last things in which we should try to make extravagant cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords it was for this reason that it sounded to rue much more like a hotel than a residential training establishment to which the noble lord lord spens was referring <e> <s> i was not aware of this particular one and that was why i asked him if he would be so good as to provide me with the details <e> <s> most of the residential courses are in colleges like for instance the civil service college at sunning-dale which is not run like a hotel and does not have these facilities either in the bedrooms or in the breakfast room <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that over a four-day period would be thought excessive by the country at large for people on a course away from home albeit with their major bills for board and lodging paid <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view exchanges of this kind are to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> i think that it would be more advisable if he addressed himself to the subject rather than to who actually is sitting in the gallery <e> <s> i believe that that is not within the general form of address in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord trefgarne in fact made a statement to this effect to the house immediately after that debate which i think set the record straight <e>", "<cs> my lords it means exactly the opposite to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> it says that the <e>", "<cs> my lords long before that happens i have no doubt that the matter will have reached fruition <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course that is up to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords if i remember rightly this was a point made by the noble lord during the course of the debate <e> <s> it is one of the many knotty problems associated with this question and that is why the matter is still under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have spent minutes on the statement might i suggest that we move on to our other business <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank both noble lords for their on the whole welcome for the statement i have made and particularly lord rochester for his support for what we have said <e> <s> to answer him first on his question about differentials i do not think differentials are ever altogether right and this situation has not perhaps been helped by the fact that there was a pay research system which recommended pay levels for the civil service as a whole and then there was the tsrb a different body which recommended the pay levels for the higher echelons <e> <s> this is the same problem as exists in the services as well <e> <s> differentials have been a problem and it is something which undoubtedly we must consider <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to my noble friend is that this question did arise <e> <s> i think it is recognised generally that the armed services and the police are a special case <e> <s> they run considerable personal risks and dangers <e> <s> also the armed services and police are required to abide by a discipline code and to obey orders <e> <s> this is a different situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sufficiently cognisant of the exact figures to reply to that point at the moment <e> <s> i am not sure about the police <e> <s> i think the armed services certainly are <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally and the government as a whole will be grateful to the house for the general degree of support which has been given to this bill from all quarters <e> <s> few enough noble lords have spoken to enable me to reply i hope to each individual point that has been made <e> <s> if i may start with the leader of the opposition i am grateful for the general welcome that he personally gave to the bill <e> <s> it is something which exercised his mind a good deal when he was leader in another place <e> <s> he knew of the hardships suffered by some and of the inequity which is an important aspect of this matter and which we are trying at least to some extent to put right by this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have misunderstood <e> <s> i was going to say if it had been the noble lord lord shinwell who had been pitchforked into this house some pitch some fork <e> <s> but of course the noble lord is not affected by this bill he was referring to a noble friend of his whom he says was in poor circumstances but did not like to apply <e> <s> now if he falls within the rules he will need to apply but he will receive what is due to him as of right <e> <s> all he has to do is to let it be known that he would like to have it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is considered to be sufficient for the members fund to be able to make regular increases in the light of inflation <e> <s> that is how i would put it and i hope that i have got it about right <e> <s> that was the intention <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it is the total number <e> <s> but there is also discretion left to the members fund this had to be taken into account and if they feel that they have sufficient money left over having paid as of right all those with years service and other people applying who have had perhaps marginally less than years service then they will be enabled under this bill to pay the same amount of money to those ex-honourable members <e>", "<cs> i am so sorry my lords <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor also served on longer but i apologise to him <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for the welcome that he gave to this bill <e> <s> as i said he and i sat opposite each other for a long time and this debate took one back a bit because everybody who participated in it has in fact been a member of another place <e> <s> so i quite understand the slip of the tongue of one noble lord who referred in his speech to mr speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate all that my noble friend has said <e> <s> consideration of this matter has taken very much longer than we had either expected or hoped <e> <s> although i recognise that this may give my noble friend little comfort i can only say that the issues involved are complicated much more so than we at first thought <e> <s> i can only say that i hope i will be able to give him a more definitive answer when my noble friend next asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for a question which if i may say so is typical of his attitude towards these matters and his magnanimity towards the government <e> <s> as ministers they are remunerated in the same way as are junior ministers in the other place <e> <s> but their cash flow is much smaller <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think i might reply whom are you telling <e> <s> but i assure the noble lord that all the arguments he has just developed are very much in our minds <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are considering is the remuneration of ministers in the house of lords inasmuch as this refers to all ministers <e> <s> but it is junior ministers that are a particular cause for concern because of the level of their ministerial salaries <e> <s> that is the principal cause of our concern <e> <s> but we are looking at the question of ministerial salaries in this house <e> <s> i do not want the house to feel in any way that i deal with this as a matter of levity it is an extremely important point <e> <s> these are obviously personal matters but i absolutely take the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in his supplementary question that this also affects the way in which this house works <e> <s> it is essential that those who have responsibilities need not be looking too much over their shoulder at their own financial difficulties when they carry the kind of burdens which everyone in your lordships house knows ministers do carry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think when it comes to remuneration the question of supply and demand should always be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords on that note i suggest that we might move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may perhaps answer those two noble lords first <e> <s> the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts asked me two specific questions and made two specific points as well <e> <s> on the question of whether we would be prepared to sit around the table and discuss with the unions the institution of a new pay system as i said in my statement we are ready whenever they feel ready to come and discuss these matters with us <e> <s> as to the second question that he raised of looking again at the figure of per cent <e> <s> i must point out to him that this flows from a cash limit of per cent <e> <s> for pay within which already more than million nearly million in fact public servants have already settled <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course respect very much what the noble lord lord houghton says on these matters <e> <s> he has enormous experience in this area <e> <s> but i really think that i made it perfectly clear that we are ready to talk <e> <s> i cannot force people to come and talk to us but we are ready to talk <e> <s> we hope that they will be ready to talk <e> <s> when they are we shall be more than ready to receive them and to have discussions with them <e> <s> we should like to discuss with them how in future pay settlements should be arrived at because this year is this year st april has gone by <e> <s> i know what is occupying their minds and the noble lord himself knows very well what is occupying the minds of numbers of civil servants who do not want to take industrial action but who nevertheless have considerable anxieties about the prospect of pay being settled by government fiat in the future <e> <s> that is not what we are seeking to do and we are very ready to discuss it with them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have this very much in mind <e> <s> i think that the spirit of what my noble friend has said so well was also in the reply which i gave to the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts <e> <s> i go along very much with my noble friend <e> <s> what is more settlements are coming down constantly <e> <s> they are now well into single figures <e> <s> as i have said before there are many millions of people in this country who would be glad of a per cent <e> <s> increase and who also take into consideration the degree of job security which is to a very large extent the name of the game these days which exists within the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord i think i can but say that we all deplore the action in the courts in scotland <e> <s> it is meaning long delays and that a number of people are not being brought before the courts <e> <s> this we deplore <e> <s> in answer to his question i am in close touch with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the kind things which he has said <e> <s> of course i shall do my best <e> <s> what i should like to see is this dispute brought to an end as soon as possible <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that both the door of my department and the door of my own office are open from now on as indeed they have been hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who like his noble friend lord houghton of sowerby has great experience of these matters <e> <s> he went along with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in saying that he hoped that i would be more specific <e> <s> i hope that lack of warmth is not one of my failings <e> <s> any invitation that i give is of a warm character i like to think <e> <s> as to the half day a week the noble lord knows as well as i do that he should not believe everything he reads in the press <e> <s> i can assure him that we have been working long and hard on these matters for some while <e> <s> there is the immediate future to be thought of and the more distant future to be thought of <e> <s> on both of these matters i should welcome discussions with the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i must take up the noble lord on his last point <e> <s> why should it become the most discontented civil service in the world <e> <s> it has got a pay offer which is in tune with the times which is both fair and reasonable and which is seen to be such and thought to be such by the vast majority of our citizens <e> <s> that is what we believe <e> <s> secondly have said and i have no doubt that the unions are well aware of what i have said if they are not they will be within the next minute or two and i have made it abundantly clear in my statement that i really do not think that it is necessary for me to add anything at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not have that sort of detail at my fingertips <e> <s> all i know is that the necessary work has been done and as i said earlier in the week i only wish it had been done by those whose job it was to do it <e> <s> if it had to be done in other ways i am sure it was in as practicable and effective a way as possible <e> <s> i am not after nit-picking in this it is too big a matter for that and i hope we can set about resolving it in all seriousness <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to talk to the unions when the unions want to talk to me <e> <s> there is no earthly point in my asking to talk to people who do not want to talk to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful for support particularly from my noble friend <e> <s> perhaps the house will forgive me if i suggest that it would be in the interests of the house if we were to move on to other business <e>", "<cs> my lords as leader of the house i am naturally concerned about any factor which may prolong question time unduly and it is always necessary for the house to exercise restraint and to respond to collective discipline <e> <s> but i am not certain that the situation at present is such as to warrant my intervention as leader of the house in support of the suggestion made by my noble friend <e> <s> however if he wishes himself to raise the matter with the procedure committee he is of course free to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take advantage of my noble friends supplementary question which i am sure he is going to ask only one of to remind the house of the guidance on starred questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the key to this was common sense and judgment from time to time <e> <s> but it would be wrong to think that it would be in the best interests of the house that every noble lord should automatically be enabled to ask more than one supplementary question <e> <s> equally it would be wrong to suppose that any noble lord could never ask more than one supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in answer to the first part of his question that is true <e> <s> the methods of arranging civil service pay have not been looked at since the priestley commission report which is now over years ago and which was in a totally different time and economic circumstances from those appertaining today <e> <s> i think that we all agree that it is time to have a fresh look at this and we think that an independent inquiry would be the best way in which to approach it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> it is absolutely necessary that we should take the stand that we have on this <e> <s> i think that it would be a great mistake if people got it into their heads that all that was necessary was to indulge in industrial disruption in order to get a pay offer reviewed <e> <s> but equally at the same time i must say that i should dearly like to be able to discuss with the unions how best to bring this dispute to an end <e> <s> i think that what i have put forward to them should be seen as a basis for just that <e> <s> i cannot believe that the great majority of civil servants whatever may be their views about the dispute can be at all happy that their unions continue to refuse even to discuss possible ways forward for the future and appear content to maintain apparently indefinitely their disruptive actions with all the inconvenience and costs that that imposes upon the public <e>", "<cs> yes i can my lords <e> <s> they are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not mention the priestley commission it was my noble friend lord orr-ewing who drew attention to it <e> <s> this is not to say that we foresee a repeat of priestley <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for asking the question so that i can put this right <e> <s> we seek to have an impartial inquiry <e> <s> the main reason for this given the experience that we have had over the past years would be to advise us on fresh arrangements in order to arrive at decisions on pay for the civil service in the same way i agree as the priestley commission did years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i hope that the civil service unions will read the question that he has posed me <e> <s> certainly <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first part of the question yes it is true that over the last two years the pay increases have been of the order of per cent <e> <s> but in all fairness i must point out to the house that that came after two years of incomes policy during which their increases were very small <e> <s> however the figure which my noble friend gives is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i replied to the noble lords question before he asked it or at least the first part of it in my previous answer <e> <s> the dispute is not holding up benefits and i hope that that will remain the case <e> <s> as to the defences of the country i think that the house can be assured that until now at least there have been no ill-effects upon the main defence structure for the country <e> <s> that is not to say that we do not suffer from some strikes because we do the whole country suffers and there is no way round that <e> <s> but i think that i can safely say that our defences have not been damaged <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is really asking whether the government would consider giving support to some measure of the character of the bill which he introduced giving us a valuable opportunity as i think the whole house will agree to debate this matter at the beginning of this session <e> <s> he is asking whether the government would give support to a similar measure to be introduced next session again without consideration of the composition and powers of your lordships house <e> <s> what i tried to say in my original answer was that we think the two should be linked together and that it would be wrong to proceed with one without giving due and proper consideration to the important question of composition and powers at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is quite as simple as that <e> <s> as i have said my noble friend did a service to the house in introducing this bill <e> <s> many views were expressed in the debate on the second reading of the bill but since that debate the government have weighed all the pros and cons and in particular what was said during the course of that debate and although there seem to be advantages and disadvantages on both sides we felt that what i have put to the house today was the right answer <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many reasons why i think it unlikely that such an eventuality will <e>", "<cs> my lords all this was taken into account <e> <s> there was a balance of arguments but i do not think that question time is a proper time for a further debate on the advantages and disadvantages such as took place on the second reading <e> <s> all i can say is that the government have considered every aspect of this question and have come down on the side of what i have suggested to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed examining it and we realise that this is a matter that cannot be allowed to trail too long <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a hypothetical question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and the noble baroness for the questions that they <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> as to future plans and where we go from here the government will of course be giving thought to this when considering what action the unions in fact take from now on <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear as long ago as august of last year <e> <s> i said to the unions at a meeting we had together that for the settlement cash limits as opposed to pay research had to be the dominant factor because of the overwhelming need in the national interest in view of inflation rates and the like for the government to keep a firm hold of the increases in pay of those for whose pay they themselves were responsible <e> <s> in august i said that it would have to be the major feature and as time went on i then said that it had to be the determining feature and because cash limits are the determining feature and only the government can judge what they can give within those cash limits and that cannot be judged by arbitration it was decided that this year in those circumstances it could not go to arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shinwell has referred to two totally different factors <e> <s> what i think have had their effect on outside pay settlements are the economic facts of life of today <e> <s> these are what have had their effect upon decisions by unions and individuals outside on what is a reasonable pay settlement for this year <e> <s> as to whether or not further steps are to be taken by the government in other matters in terms of relationship between the trade unions and management this is a totally different question <e>", "<cs> my lords they are indeed most important matters <e> <s> i can assure noble lords that the government have taken all steps possible within their power in the way of contingency planning in the way of arrangements that have been made to ensure that the minimum of damage is done to individuals as individuals or to the country as a whole <e> <s> as to the details perhaps the noble lord will understand if i do not go into them <e> <s> it would take rather a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that one can put that in the terms of reference <e> <s> the government must decide what the cash limits will be <e> <s> no arbitrator can decide such a thing that can be decided only by the government if they wish so to do <e> <s> they cannot hand that over to any other body <e> <s> once they have decided what the cash limit is then again only the government can work out what can be afforded within that cash limit <e>", "<cs> well my lords i take my noble friends point but i have always been one who does not believe that you increase your dignity by standing on it <e> <s> nevertheless i have no doubt that my noble friends wise words will be paid attention to by the review body when they write their next report <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart and to the noble lord lord taylor of blackburn <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord taylor i would say that those members of the opposition front bench who are officeholders are of course included in this it would be a mistake to think otherwise but only those who are office-holders as has been traditionally the custom in your lordships house <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter all i can say is that i should like to thank him very much for his kind words and that it has been possible to rectify this only thanks to the determination and co-operation of many both in this house and notably of course among my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> yes my lords hopefully this may well be so <e> <s> we are making progress <e> <s> as i say the <e>", "<cs> my lords in this particular case the pressure comes from outside rather more than from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad <e> <s> i know this is a matter which my noble friend has very close to his heart <e> <s> indeed we are most grateful to him for all the work that he and his committee did nearly years ago <e> <s> i hope he gains satisfaction from the fact that it is beginning to come to fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is a reason for not proceeding and computerising where great benefits are to be derived therefrom <e> <s> i hope that the solution to this problem will be found in less industrial disruption taking place <e> <s> but i do not think one should say that because there is a danger of industrial disruption which i do not think in this particular case is all that great therefore we should not proceed with modern methods <e> <s> i do not think that would be a very wise approach <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me <e> <s> i suggested to the house that we should move on from this question and i think that that was the general feeling of the house <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement which i made to the house about the civil service dispute on th june i explained that our talks with the civil service unions had concerned both this years pay increase and the future arrangements for determining civil service pay <e> <s> i made clear that the government were satisfied that it would not be right to increase our per cent <e> <s> offer for the settlement but that in response to the unions anxieties about the future we had told them that we were ready to set up an independent outside inquiry to advise on the best up-to-date arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord peart for what he has said <e> <s> he went through not dissimilar problems a couple of years ago and he knows the complexities and difficulties of them <e> <s> of course i hope with him that this inquiry may well lead to the unions deciding that this can prove to be the end of what has been a long road <e> <s> there were three areas of anxiety one was this years per cent <e> <s> and the government have made abundantly clear there can be no move away from our per cent <e> <s> cash limit and that per cent <e> <s> is the most that we feel we can offer within the per cent <e> <s> cash limit <e> <s> the second was next year where we have said that we will have genuine negotiations with them without a predetermined cash limit <e> <s> so that is done <e> <s> now hopefully this will resolve the longer-term discussion <e> <s> with the amount of distress and trouble being caused to our fellow citizens by the industrial disruption i hope most sincerely that this will help to bring matters to a rapid conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord houghton who has knowledge which goes long into the past on these matters <e> <s> he talked about whether this would lead to harmony <e> <s> it takes two to arrive at harmony <e> <s> the government regard the setting up of this inquiry its terms of reference and all that we are hoping from it and have made public that we are hoping from it as a considerable contribution to harmony <e> <s> we hope it will be responded to by the unions <e> <s> as to we have said a lot for instance that we will have genuine negotiations without a predetermined cash limit <e> <s> as to having recourse to arbitration now in is not the time to decide whether or not that will be necessary <e> <s> i hope that it will not be and that we shall be able to get reasonable negotiations and a reasonable fulfilment of those negotiations <e> <s> but that does not mean that the government should let out of their own hands the final determination of pay <e> <s> whether they will look to arbitration or not is something that will have to be decided at the time <e> <s> i do not think it is wise before we even open negotiations and when we are still talking about to talk about what we intend to do in the event of a breakdown in <e> <s> i do not think that would be wise <e>", "<cs> my lords if the industrial action continues the government obviously will have to consider what further response they should make including reconsideration of the operative date of the present pay offer <e> <s> obviously it would be preferable not to penalise those who have not taken industrial action but who have continued to work normally and even harder than usual in some cases during <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the last bit the answer is definitely no <e> <s> in answer to the first bit the terms of reference were discussed with the unions which is the governments proper role in these matters <e> <s> the government have to discuss them and then have to agree them themselves after discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i think the noble lord is reading too much into what my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said <e> <s> he did not talk in terms of per cent <e> <s> or indeed of any other percentage <e> <s> what he did say was that it was vital for the long-term interests of this country that wage settlements as a whole should be brought considerably lower than they are today that they should be more closely related to production than they have been in the past and less closely related to the rates of inflation that it was this which would make a considerable contribution to the competitiveness of british industry as a whole and that government and the public services also had to take these matters into account when playing their part such as it is in determining these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is that they are not being ruled in or ruled out <e> <s> what i am saying is that now is not the time to make these decisions and i cannot give any commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not think it is right in the present circumstances <e> <s> having fixed the cash limit at per cent <e> <s> it means that it has to be kept to within per cent <e> <s> and the government do not think it right to put the question of the cash limits into the hands of anybody else other than the government themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords it certainly is not designed in any way to be an affront if i may make that totally clear to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> as to the point which the noble viscount lord simon first made about the urgency of the matter there is of course a constituency which does not have a member <e> <s> a writ has to be moved <e> <s> we do not want that constituency to remain unrepresented for any longer than necessary <e> <s> so as far as the timing is concerned the point is specifically that here is a constituency which is unrepresented awaiting the moving of a writ <e> <s> on the next point as to the timing i take what the noble lord lord mishcon said <e> <s> this is not something which the government like to do to rush legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords on the other hand you could repent very much if you did not legislate quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> the noble lord did ask a supplementary question and there have been a number of other supplementaries <e> <s> we have spent minutes on this question and i think it is time we moved on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is time that we got back to the business of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that there are a number of noble lords who would like to ask more supplementary questions but this debate has been going on for the best part of half an hour <e> <s> we have a lot of business before us and if i get right the feeling of the house it is that we should return to the main business of the house today <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends whether he is doing some other work or not but if not he would be temporarily relieved from duty in those circumstances he would not be paid and so that time would not count towards his pension <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept that the question asked by my noble friend lord boyd <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must say that when civil servants indulge in industrial disruption and take action which results in our pensioners not getting what is their due it is a thoroughly bad increase in strike action and something which ought to stand condemned and i am sure it does in all parts of the house <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not <e> <s> if that should be so for the civil service why is it that the national health ancillaries and the local government employees have all accepted pay increases within a per cent <e> <s> cash limit this year without any industrial action whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there has been a long run of supplementaries on this question <e> <s> important as it is i suggest that we move on to the next business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most indebted to the noble lord for raising this matter because i think that this is a misunderstanding <e> <s> i do not think that it is <e> <s> in fact once there was a specific question put to me on this very subject <e> <s> the noble lord was not actually in the chamber i remember when it was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is only the second time that the noble lord has been inhibited from asking a second supplementary then i am afraid that redounds to my discredit because it must show that i have not intervened often enough before <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure my noble friend is aware we have gone to considerable pains to invite those who are in financial difficulties as a result of this action to write in and given the constraints imposed on us by this industrial action we shall do our very best to meet them <e>", "<cs> my lords a number are being manually prepared <e> <s> that is the whole point that when individuals write in to the paymaster-generals office pointing out that this is causing them personal financial difficulties the effect is that that case is handled manually <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not withdraw any accusation if the cap fits but if the cap does not fit i said whether wittingly <e>", "<cs> i said whether wittingly or unwittingly and not only in this house but in the country as a whole <e> <s> there are many who wittingly or unwittingly advocate unilateral nuclear disarmament and i repeat that any who do that are wittingly or unwittingly in my view playing the russian game <e>", "<cs> those were the days <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to intervene for a moment just on the question of costs <e> <s> i am not sure that i understand him correctly <e> <s> i bow to the noble lords great knowledge and experience in respect of increasing costs not only for successive generations of equipment but also as he has said within the same generation <e> <s> referring to trident however as opposed to tornado surely the americans have carried the expenditure on the research and development of trident and it is on the point of coming into service in the united states if it has not already done so <e> <s> that being the case there is no reason why trident should escalate in cost to us any more than polaris did because the americans have borne the heat and burden of research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that they give pleasure to the russians <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it does <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one second <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness would like to get this right <e> <s> it is of course correct that there are limitations on the people of hong kong immigrating into this country but i hope that she will not forget that the whole purpose of this bill is to alter british citizenship to those who are specifically and intimately connected with the united kingdom and only with the united kingdom <e> <s> if we were to give british citizenship to say the people of hong kong that would be ruining the whole thing and going right back to where we are today where a lot of people have citizenship of the united kingdom and colonies but have no right of entry into this

what has been said particularly by the noble lords lord oram and lord underhill with particular reference to british leyland and the name of sir michael edwardes its chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give my support to the noble baroness over the broad thrust of this question <e> <s> for a long time i have felt that divided responsibility for financial control on the one hand and

the european monetary system i must first say how glad i am that my noble friend lord ohagan has chosen this subject <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lever of manchester said we should look at this not only in parochial community terms but also in the widest international terms <e> <s> we joined the community not just in the hope that we would enrich ourselves by so doing by being in a larger market

"<cs> my lords i shall not detain your lordships for many minutes <e> <s> indeed as someone who is rather naive on these matters compared with the great knowledge possessed by many who have taken part in this royal commission and who have contributed to this debate there is just one point that i wish to make <e> <s> immediately i must express an interest inasmuch as i am a ratepayer in the county of hampshire along whose shoreline pass many ships from many nations <e> <s> the point arises as to who should pay for what <e> <s> as i see it i think that prophylactic measures to prevent pollution along coastlines are a very proper form of expenditure for a local authority <e> <s> that is the first point that i would make <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand my noble friend to say that he had

given us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> so far it has been an exceptionally high-class debate <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be hard to find anybody either in this house or in another place who has a greater knowledge of the south atlantic and the antarctic than the noble lord lord shackleton who spoke with such knowledge and with such force about these matters and whose opinions we value <e>", "<cs> my lords what i thought i heard from the noble lord was that he was not going to discuss them and then he went on to discuss them <e> <s> we have all done this from time to time <e> <s> therefore all i shall try to do will be to say a few words about the backcloth against which i believe that we should be judging these events <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be no doubt

come out into the open and explain why they have to do so <e> <s> no government is going to want to do that if it is palpably absurd <e> <s> it certainly would not do it twice because the foreign secretary has to explain it to his colleagues and they have either to agree or to disagree with him and it will be evident after a bit whether or not there is substance to it <e>", "<cs> my lords will

good that we should be discussing this subject today <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend permit me to intervene <e> <s> i think it would be a pity if he left with us the view that her majestys government are of the opinion that to take for instance the production of sugar having risen from million to million tonnes over a period of a few years was to use his own words a sensible insurance

tonnes because we are committed so to do and then to go on and produce so much more at home as to be exporting million tonnes is not really much of a dividend <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend

security council of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords now that we have seen the full effects of motorways being built only for years can my noble friend say how many years life is anticipated

grenada in their hour of greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> a great deal of the most interesting matters that he is covering will we hope be considered by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deeply grateful to those of your lordships who have taken part in this debate which i believe has been thought to be interesting on all sides of the house <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to my noble friend the lord president of the council and the leader of the house for the great support he gave to the concept of televising the proceedings of the house <e> <s> i know it is something he has believed in for a long period of his political life <e> <s> indeed for quite a while he and i have thought as one on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords it has nothing to do with the subject at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me infinite pleasure to be the first speaker on this side of the house to whom it falls to congratulate my noble friend lord fanshawe on what was without any doubt an excellent and refreshing speech on this tricky subject of europe <e> <s> it gives me such pleasure for a number of reasons <e> <s> first he and i have been friends not only politically but in the holidays as well for some years or more and secondly he and i have been involved closely together in this european saga before during and after british entry and i have the greatest respect for the part that he played therein <e> <s> he has ministerial experience in the foreign office and he knows a great deal not only about europe but also about other parts of the world and of course he has considerably more general political experience as well <e> <s> so i believe that the speech was an outstanding example of what speeches should be on a subject such as this unlike every speech that has been made during this debate and i am sure your lordships will join me in hoping that we shall hear frequently from him <e> <s> though it is a formality to say that in some ways on this occasion i personally feel it most deeply <e>", "<cs> my lords undoubtedly it plays its part <e> <s> it is a meeting of the permanent representatives of all the member states meeting in brussels <e> <s> it always has played its part it always will and if anything it should in my view play more rather than less a part <e> <s> but there has got to be proper preparation <e> <s> if the march meeting fails the next meeting will be in june <e> <s> with france having the presidency and being intent upon having a successful presidency as is every country when it has it and with france having particular problems i believe it to be vitally important that during its presidency france which did so much to create europe should succeed in saving the community from its own destruction <e>", "<cs> no please i must go on i have been talking for too long as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords on my noble friends last point about the budget contribution i am sure that he will remember that during the entry negotiations we made a good deal of fuss saying that we were sure that if the arrangements as they then were continued as we were prepared to let them continue we were pretty sure in our own minds that they would lead to an inequitable situation <e> <s> a statement was made by m jean francois deniau on behalf of the commission saying that if that occurred then evidently a solution would have to be found and new arrangements would have to be made <e> <s> i go along with much of what my noble friend says about our imports from the commonwealth and having to pay for them across the exchanges <e> <s> on the other hand i believe that in effect this was bound to be inequitable and i believe it still is <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise most profusely to the noble lord for not having been in my place when he began his speech <e> <s> i was with <e>", "<cs> my lords he shakes his head not nods it <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister of state any information which she could give the house about aid contributions made by other countries to mozambique and in particular russia east germany and eastern europe generally <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the rumours that have been rife recently in the press would my noble friend confirm that no intelligence was received by the government which might have led them to believe that violent action would be taken from the libyan peoples bureau against the demonstrations that were going to take place the following day <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short time available i find it necessary to talk in shorthand <e> <s> there are many things i should like to say for instance about the speech of the noble lord lord paget of northampton but they were said and well said by the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> i agree with him and i leave it there <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> could he give the house one example where the judiciary has misbehaved in the manner which he has just described <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to my noble friend the minister that perhaps after this visit plenty of time be allowed for quiet consistent patient and secret diplomacy before there are any other visits of a character that attract a great deal of publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords all this sounds a very sorry story <e> <s> given the situation that now exists is it out of the question that some of the water that is being sold from water authorities that have plenty to spare i believe to gibraltar might be sold to south wales <e>", "<cs> in large tankers my lords <e> <s> i am surprised that the minister does not know <e>", "<cs> my lords in the meantime will the noble viscount answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i have made clear that there are tankers ships carrying water in large quantities at the moment to gibraltar <e> <s> it sounds a very profitable business <e> <s> however could not some be diverted to south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend inform me whether the nature conservancy council is in order under the act when it instructs landowners not to cut thistles and other weeds because of the existence of rare flora <e>", "<cs> oh good <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is a great achievement for the diplomacy both of her majestys government and of the government of the peoples republic <e> <s> as to the longer term future this must surely depend upon the awareness of the peoples republic of china of hong kongs importance for them as well as for the people of hong kong <e> <s> her majestys government will have a considerable part to play in the next or years in assuring that awareness <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind in this context before he writes to my noble friend lord nugent that what matters is that the fastenings should be effective <e> <s> to invite the commission to make every member country of the community have exactly the same fastening seems to me to be encouraging the commission to make just the sort of regulation which it is often brought into ridicule for making <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been frequently stated in this debate and the house has been reminded that your lordships voted by a majority of three to one in favour of the televising of its proceedings for an experimental period and instructed the sound broadcasting committee to report not on whether but on how this decision should be implemented <e> <s> i thank the sound broadcasting committee for its most detailed report <e> <s> i do not agree with everything that it contains <e> <s> in the round however it is i think an excellent report which demonstrates that a lot of hard work went into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will forgive me for one minute <e> <s> which debate is he referring to when he says that he has not heard one argument in favour of the experiment <e> <s> is it this debate or is it that of th december last year <e> <s> if it is this debate this is not what this debate is about <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just two points to make <e> <s> there are many other speakers in this debate <e> <s> i am among those who are very grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for having initiated the debate <e> <s> it is high time we had such a debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> of course my lords and that is so of every government in turn one after the other <e> <s> has the civil service been taken too much for granted because it was so good <e> <s> has there been that type of feeling among ministers of successive governments <e> <s> a conscious effort has to be made by government by parliament and by the people to realise what is at risk how good this service is and what they stand to lose if morale is not upheld <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend inform the noble lord lord cledwyn that miles which he says is the total length of the sewerage system in this country is less than the kilometres which lord cledwyn reckons are over years old <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> is he including television in the generic term cultural heritage <e> <s> if so is that not overstressing the term a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i agree so much with the main thrust of what he has said but i know he would like to be scrupulously fair in these matters <e> <s> is it not a fact that when our long-distance fleet had to go by the board that was not because of our entering into the community but for other reasons <e> <s> we could not fish off norway because of an agreement with them we could not fish off iceland because of an agreement with them and because of the law of the sea we could no longer go to canada and off the eastern seaboard of the americas <e> <s> so it really was not that we suffered because of going into the community <e> <s> surely on going into the community we suffered by being the one country which had waters that were still prolific in fish <e>", "<cs> that is right my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been constant reference to the luxembourg compromise <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether her majestys government still construe the luxembourg compromise as being one which enables any member state of the community to be the sole judge of whether a particular matter is in its vital national interest <e> <s> may i suggest to my noble friend that if this continues there will not be one quarter of the progress made in the european community towards which most people in all countries aspire <e> <s> if a country wishes to use the veto because the arguments go against it that problem can be resolved only if the fact that it considers the issue to be of sufficient national importance to itself is debated before the main question comes before the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> well generally speaking my lords <e> <s> i cannot speak for the noble lord who has always been hostile to this idea but generally speaking i should say that that was true <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend permit me for a second to intervene <e> <s> do i understand that he says he is talking as a member of that committee <e> <s> can he then tell me why this recommendation was not made in its preliminary report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all your lordships who took part in the debate <e> <s> i feel that i should perhaps explain to your lordships why i put down the motion <e> <s> i seemed to me necessary for a motion to be put down by a back-bench member of your lordships house so that it could be debated without any question of whips or authority of any character being imposed upon your lordships and also because if something like this had not happend the motion which was passed some time back by your lordships for the experiment to last six months would have been invoked and it would all have come to an end today <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i am so sorry i was just welcoming my noble friend <e>", "<cs> but my lords would my noble friend bear in mind that as she said there needs to be a lot of progress yet and that perhaps her majestys government would find it wise not to indulge in any further celebrations until the tenth anniversary of when the helsinki final act has been respected and implemented in particular with regard to human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way for a second <e> <s> he has spoken about the attitude of the leaders of the front line states towards sanctions <e> <s> the noble lord knows something about it <e> <s> i think i know a little about it too <e> <s> in my view there is great relief in a number of those states and among their leaders that in fact heavy sanctions have not been imposed by the commonwealth upon south africa because they know full well the damage that they would have done to their countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me for a second <e> <s> doubtless he heard the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter a few moments ago that the whole of military history consists of first offensive weapons being matched by defensive weapons and then new offensive weapons being introduced and new defensive weapons <e> <s> can the noble lord explain to the house why in his view it should be that because we are living now in a nuclear age the desire to introduce an anti-nuclear missile system should not go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to assure the noble lord lord underhill that i did not need any prompting from him before deciding that i would of course declare my interest in this debate <e> <s> one remark that he made did not fill me with satisfaction <e> <s> it was to the effect i think that these were his words that we shall then know what value to put upon his words <e> <s> it gave me a little the impression that the noble lord felt that if someone was working in any way for any of these schemes this meant inevitably that he was <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord said that because a decision was taken in another place <e> <s> but that is the stance of the labour party they wanted a public inquiry <e> <s> i ask myself why did they want a public inquiry knowing as they must do that a public inquiry would kill it <e> <s> does this mean that they did not want a fixed link <e> <s> if they do not want a fixed link say so <e> <s> do not go through the charade of asking for a public inquiry in order to kill it <e>", "<cs> a very good aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps in the important position that the noble lord holds outside this house as chairman of one of the big clearing banks he might tell the house what he thinks would be his attitude and the attitude of his bank in respect of financing of this scheme had the labour partys request for a public inquiry been acceded to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me again <e> <s> i wonder whether in this scheme which is purely a rail one he envisages that it would be possible to continue to run a shuttle though that tunnel taking on passengers and lorries at the point of entry to the tunnel and at the same time run though that tunnel sufficient ordinary fast trains at the same <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will allow me to intervene for a second this matter has been put to the international maritime association which knows all these things <e> <s> were what my noble friend fears true i think i can assure him that this would not have been proceeded with <e>", "<cs> my lords it is private money that is the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to intervene for one second <e> <s> i know that he is a seeker after accuracy <e> <s> the noble lord made much play with the length of a tunnel and the number of miles one would have to drive in it <e> <s> the noble lord of course knows that there are four schemes before the assessors <e> <s> one has no road at all the other has a bridge a third has a short tunnel of the order of miles and there is only one out of the four that has the long tunnel <e> <s> perhaps that also will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he direct his mind to this <e> <s> he has spent a lifetime really in the two houses <e> <s> i am sure he has given thought before to the question he raised today at some length about the future of this house <e> <s> he was talking about the reform of this house <e> <s> many of us have looked at this <e> <s> my noble friend lord home of the hirsel as he said went into it in great detail <e> <s> but generally speaking certainly i found this when i had the honour to lead this house there are any number of people who want to see this house reformed but those who want to see it reformed can never agree on what sort of reform should be brought about <e>", "<cs> my lords i want very much to follow the line taken by the noble lord lord barnett when he introduced this interesting motion <e> <s> i do so because i think it is important that in this house the international ramifications of our economic policies should be well considered <e> <s> that is the topic on which the noble lord concentrated wisely and well if i may say so <e> <s> it is to that matter and to two of the points which he made much of that i should like to address myself this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but the noble lord must take it off my time <e>", "<cs> my lords one does not fix the world price of oil according to the advantages or disadvantages to any one particular country <e> <s> i do not wish to be drawn into that matter <e> <s> i was not going to talk about it and if i do i shall go well over the top time-wise <e>", "<cs> my lords leaving aside oil does this mean that the noble lord foresees the proper exchange rate of the dollar to the pound being about parity <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of a small european advisory council to general motors i did <e>", "<cs> it never will work my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that it should be the job of government to introduce some form of incomes policy to ensure that in manufacturing industry wages do not rise faster than either productivity or the inflation rate <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in view of the close association of the noble lord lord jenkins with cnd it is natural for him to try to add to public disquiet such as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i might have expected such a reply <e> <s> what i should like to know from my noble friend is this <e> <s> first now that the oil price has come a long way down without sterling having suffered that surely has removed the argument of the petro-currency <e> <s> on top of that the relationship between sterling and the deutschemark is satisfactory to sterling now and thirdly it seems to be fairly common knowledge that the chancellor of the exchequer the foreign secretary the governor of the bank of england and the chairmen of the clearing banks are all in favour <e> <s> what are the government waiting for before they make up their minds in a positive fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that surely the time has come <e> <s> we have been arguing about this for a long time and it is always the same answer when the time is right <e> <s> what is right in this matter <e> <s> i do not want to repeat my arguments but this really is not good enough on the part of the government <e> <s> given the present circumstances compared with what they were a year ago what can be righter than today <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that when i visited zimbabwe in the early part of this year there had recently been a mine explosion just over the border in south africa <e> <s> this made both the prime minister and the government of zimbabwe extremely angry because they have said consistently both in private and public that they did not wish their territories nor did they intend to allow their territories to be used for raids on south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing to be surprised at <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting him but do i gather from his argument that the new airport should be sited where unemployment is bad rather than where the site is good from the point of view of passengers who wish to fly into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not hear very well what the noble lord was reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in the brief time which i understand that the usual channels wish to be taken by <e>", "<cs> no i am sorry my lords i shall not give way <e> <s> i have been held to five minutes <e> <s> sanctions have not worked and no one has quoted an instance where they have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may say of course it is but there is a great difference of opinion as to what constitutes the end of apartheid <e> <s> is it just the cancelling of legislation such as for instance the group areas act <e> <s> that is part of the legislation which adds up to apartheid <e> <s> does it go further <e> <s> does it go into the custom which has been built up over the years <e> <s> how does one measure the end of apartheid <e> <s> it is not easy <e> <s> i do not think that it is enough anyway <e> <s> we might start off with that but that is not enough <e> <s> it is not what the people who say put on sanctions have in mind <e> <s> do they have in mind power sharing <e> <s> do they have in mind a central federal or unitary government which would be largely black and white all sharing power and taking it for granted that there will be proportions which vary from time to time after elections in the sense that we know the democratic system in this country <e> <s> no that will not be brought about easily <e> <s> is it one man one vote in a unitary state in other words a black government <e> <s> my noble friend lord murton asked the noble baroness lady seear at the end of her interesting speech why it was that as the democratic system as we know it has not worked in any other african country she thought that it would work in south africa <e> <s> i do not think that she found it all that easy to answer <e> <s> she said that the fact that it has not worked very well anywhere else does not mean that we should not try it in south africa <e>", "<cs> they hate hearing the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house that the government have been discussing for many weeks with the other main trading partners of south africa what action they should all agree to take if the highly regrettable state of affairs comes about whereby the government of pretoria refuse to take further steps to dismantle apartheid of their own volition <e>",
