right <e> <s> it was a slip of the tongue <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity of pointing to some of the conclusions which i think have to be drawn from reading this paper and from the present situation <e> <s> first there is the big question should we revise our system of immunities for trade unions to break the law with impunity and instead adopt the system which might be called the continental system of granting positive rights which both employers and trade unions would have to accept <e> <s> one has only to look at the fascinating annexes to this green paper to see how obviously superior is the system of positive rights <e> <s> no wonder our industries lose their place in world markets and are unable to compete or to attract new capital as they groan under the

is adequately covered by the text of the bill <e> <s> i would like to say that you have to think what a lot of trade unionists and employers and other people without much legal experience are going to read this and are going to have to decide what they should do about it <e> <s> i think it is good to have it laid on the line that this point made by lord halsbury is really in the bill <e> <s> i believe it makes the position clearer <e> <s> it protects the position of professional people which is very desirable in the world we live in <e> <s> as regards the excellent amendment of the noble lord lord howie i would be happy with it if it did not say engineering i think it should apply to everybody <e>", "<cs> without lengthening this debate perhaps i may say a word because i warmly agree with my noble friend lord spens <e> <s> looking at this and i am not sorry to have studied this question in various parts of the continent the vagueness of our industrial agreements leads to a great deal of trouble <e> <s> if the texts were more clearly established and people knew exactly what their rights were there would not as the noble earl has said be more opportunity for minor petty dominations in various ways <e> <s> i think that there would be greater clarity of what peoples rights were and what was expected of them <e> <s> i believe that this is a serious weakness in our present system and i see nothing to be proud of about it <e>", "<cs> i greatly welcome what the noble viscount has just said <e> <s> i take a purely practical view in these matters and for a moment i should like to revert to a discusion which we had just now <e> <s> how does the noble viscount think that the provisions of subsections and could be efficiently carried out with a ballot for thousands of employees unless the union agreement was written down <e> <s> they might not agree what they were discussing <e>", "<cs> i hope that without unduly lengthening this debate i may be allowed to say a few words <e> <s> i do not share the view of the noble earl about the action which the government have taken having been so successful in the industrial relations field <e> <s> i must honestly say that i think that the government were elected in order to protect the public interest from unreasonable action by sectional parts of our community <e> <s> i really do think that the great majority of our people would go along with my view that the government have not really taken the action that was expected of them <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that this extremely delicate institution has been the subject of considerable investigation by the bbc in particular by panorama and that many people including myself were really scandalised by a panorama broadcast some months ago which gave a great deal of information about the institution its whereabouts and the people who worked there <e> <s> will the government also recall that a book was written by phillip agee an american communist who has since been expelled from this country who came over here especially in order to throw light very desirable from the soviet point of view upon the workings of these institutions <e> <s> and would it not be desirable to pass legislation to prevent books and other publications including those by organisations other than the media going into this sort of thing in real detail to the detriment of national security <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider when working out their future policy about the royal dockyards that the falklands force could not possibly have got off in such a short time or with such striking efficiency if it had not been for the dockyards in chatham portsmouth and other places including gibraltar <e> <s> will the government realise that a lot of people will require a great deal of convincing that it is a good thing to dispose of or wind down these first-class industrial assets which are necessary for the navy at a time like this <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that in some areas at least quite a number of people are buying microcomputers and that the children have considerably less difficulty with these than some of the grown-ups <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we may have one speech from the cross-benches <e> <s> i do not want to add to the length of this debate and i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> i want to congratulate the government first of all on the way they have handled this bill <e> <s> i think that the front bench have shown extraordinary powers of resistence and continuity and in particular i have admired the way they have leapt all the obstacles in <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord paget of northampton will allow me to intervene he has made a very interesting speech about the arab-israeli conflict but what about begins intention to assume total control of the west bank and probably of gaza as well <e> <s> what is going to happen to the very great number of palestinians who live there <e> <s> i do not believe that they are all assassins <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to a very interesting and constructive speech by my noble friend lord weidenfeld

able to progress now that it is liberated from the terrible scourge of the armed palestinians who have led that country a most terrible dance <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of reference have been very carefully drawn but rather narrowly drawn if i may say so <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether the government will also look at this very unpleasant case in its wider implications <e> <s> when i was in the foreign service it was strictly forbidden even to mention gchq and i was amazed last winter when panorama put on a programme giving very complete information about mi mi and also gchq with pictures of the headquarters buildings and a great deal of other information <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming greatly what the government have said may i ask whether they share the hope of a great many people that by market forces interest rates can be kept at the low rates which now appertain and will not receive encouragement to rise unless it is absolutely unavoidable and that the government will continue to encourage the americans to keep their rates low since in the past they have tended to drag up our rates <e> <s> because low rates of interest are vital to the recovery of our industries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind the tremendous importance of keeping together the technologists who understand this type of <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard a remarkable variety of expertise in this debate <e> <s> i find it difficult to believe that any legislative chamber in the world can equal it <e> <s> it is just under a quarter of a century since i

most valuable for scientific experiments <e> <s> later i visited dounreay to see the megawatt prototype reactor and i have been there again since <e> <s> dounreay is an installation of extraordinary interest when one takes into account the reprocessing facilities and engineering and research facilities that are connected with it <e>", "<cs> my lords might i interpolate <e> <s> we have in fact sold a power reactor to japan and another to italy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i ask him to clarify his fascinating speech <e> <s> is there not a soviet threat to the united states from nuclear missile submarines <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard some very interesting speeches but i want to come back strictly to the white paper <e> <s> i am full of admiration for this white paper on the lessons of the falklands campaign for the conclusions the government have come to and for the measures they are taking in the light of these events <e> <s> i am sure we are right to retain a naval presence in the south atlantic and to send hms endurance back <e> <s> i shall give my reasons later <e> <s> i warmly congratulate the prime minister on her visit to the falklands <e> <s> it really was no mean undertaking and i very much hope that she was not overtired by such great exertions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord skelmersdale aware that most sensible people who are not beleaguered on this horribly controversial question will be extremely glad if the government can find an amicable solution which will enable discussions to continue among all concerned with a view to finding a solution to this problem which may one day affect the peace of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested to hear the speech of the noble viscount lord colville of culross because he is always immensely practical while having great legal knowledge and experience behind him <e> <s> i have learned over the years to appreciate very widely his intellectual approach which is combined with enormous common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i do not think i wanted to include written material <e> <s> i blanched when the noble lord lord wigoder mentioned it <e>", "<cs> my lords might there be time for a question from the cross benches <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government tell the house whether any encouragement is being given to industrial and chemical research with a view to producing a substitute for lead which will maintain the octane level in petrol without being equally damaging to the health of the population <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the controversies about the curricula for british school examinations may we take it that the new body which has been formed will look at the international

giving industry every possible encouragement by abolishing or removing the obstacles which make it harder for business to progress <e> <s> i am thinking of such matters as the special tax on motorcars the poor communications with many of our ports and the bad conditions in the ports which make it hard for exports and imports to move <e> <s> may we in general ask the government whether they are really devoting every possible means so as to get industry going <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government agree that it is terribly important to go on talking to the russians whatever our relations with them across the world <e> <s> is it not equally important not to be bamboozled by the peace campaign that seems to be starting in soviet external relations at a time when the communists are trying to mop up central america <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the most important aspects of this business the finding of a location for the reconciliation conference to take place <e> <s> until this conference meets are we not liable to have further incidents of this sort <e> <s> my recollection over many years is that the middle easterners tend to produce very rough incidents of this kind when international meetings are about to happen <e> <s> therefore would it not be in everybodys interests that our government and the other governments concerned should do everything they can to hasten on the lebanese meeting upon which so much depends <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that the governor of the bank of england directly encouraged the building societies to raise funds in the market over years ago at a meeting in i think eastbourne <e>", "<cs> my lords i was greatly impressed by the very interesting and thoughtful speeches made by the noble lords lord home of the hirsel and lord soames <e> <s> i feel we need to look at the grenada affair on a much broader basis than some of the speakers in this <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord allow me to ask him a question <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble and learned lord think that the governor general ought to have done <e> <s> the government had been destroyed by force there was a forceful rgime which was totally unrepresentative and the governor general was the only one left <e> <s> surely the noble and learned lord does not bar him from taking any action whatever to restore the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that one feature of the present situation which worries people most is that the two parties have ceased to talk <e> <s> it is terribly important to go on talking to people when you disagree with them <e> <s> i suppose that there will be quiet ambassadorial discussions about this but will the government agree that it is terribly necessary to promote and encourage those discussions <e> <s> it is easier for the americans to do that than for us <e> <s> an awful lot hangs on these results <e> <s> will the government also agree that one feature of the recent negotiations that has worried people has been <e>", "<cs> my lords having just come back from that area and having seen the hundreds of lorries stepped two deep all the way along the roads on the other side of the alps bearing in mind that the difficulty has originated with the italian customs officers who feel that they are overworked and in view of the enormous interference with european trade that is going on may i ask the government whether there are any means of getting the common market to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> if it is the noble lords intention to blame the common market for our industrial failure is that really fair <e> <s> do we not have to take account of the colossal decrease in productivity in the united kingdom while our workers were encouraged to quarrel about nothing but pay and so on <e> <s> we passed legislation which enabled anybody to do anything with complete impunity in british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon for interrupting him a second time <e> <s> i am really blaming our politicians for passing laws affecting industry which did not encourage the increase of productivity and which led to the disastrous decline of our performance inside the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an arcane and esoteric subject where angels would certainly fear to tread if my noble friend lord obrien and his very able committee had not illuminated it <e> <s> we get a certain amount of mud slung at the house of lords but i do just wonder how many other legislatures can produce from their own members a committee including two ex-governors of the national bank in our case the bank of england several former economic advisers to the government and other members with such distinguished backgrounds and experience in banking finance industry administration and government <e> <s> the composition of this sub-committee is really remarkable and so is its report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that it is truly impossible to export british products of a defence nature unless the government buy

both for the development and the defence of the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who habitually listens to the bbc world service on shortwave when abroad may i ask the government whether they are aware that it is often difficult to sort out a relatively weak signal from among all the very strong signals that come from eastern europe <e> <s> would it not be desirable therefore i am not just talking about southern africa for the bbc to be enabled to increase the power on its broadcasts <e> <s> the content of them is admirable but with the power that is used they are often fairly difficult

amendment <e> <s> if we are to organise well-conducted trade union elections it is very important that the people who vote should know who they are voting for and an amendment such as this seems to me
