["<cs> my lords the received wisdom of political life that doctrinaires in opposition frequently turn pragmatists in office seems to have been strikingly enriched by a new twist for here under our eyes we see a party which taking pride in its empirical and commonsense approach while on the road to power once there begets a government tempted by doctrine the doctrine of indiscriminate curtailment of public expenditure <e> <s> how else can we explain the wisdom of cutting and as i think crippling the external services of the bbc <e> <s> for this is bound to be the effect of the intended budget cuts which for a saving of per cent <e> <s> would reduce broadcasting time by between and per cent <e> <s> and endanger the whole overhead structure quality in some cases audibility and continued availability of wavelengths and ultimately the efficacy of what will remain <e>", "<cs> my lords for over years the <e>", "<cs> my lords for the past three years the middle east has been subjected to a chain reaction of turbulence <e> <s> the power vacuum left by the shahs demise has brought forth reverberations and reopened latent feuds from the western sahara to the eritrean desert from kurdistan to the gulf and from the lebanon to the sudan <e> <s> old power struggles temporal and religious have flared up with probably graver feuds and threats to come <e> <s> amid this darkness the solitary shaft of light is the settlement between israel and egypt <e> <s> imperfect open-ended equivocal it may well be but it has already been an enormous achievement constructive and positive <e> <s> it has been achieved through american mediation and through the courage of the leaders of egypt and israel with only faint applause and very little help from europe <e> <s> for underneath its lip-service and diplomatic nicety europes attitude has been ambiguous from the start and america has been to be absolutely frank puzzled by europes reaction crystallized in the venice declaration and apprehensive about its motives its thrust and its possible consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i pay a tribute to the maiden speaker lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i particularly congratulate him upon his ability to be both forceful and moderate and above all very constructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with those noble lords who consider that perhaps the gravest and most pressing issue before us right now is the creeping crisis of confidence within the western alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel we are indebted to the noble lord lord gladwyn for initiating a debate on a crisis which not only represents the most flagrant violation of the spirit and letter of the helsinki agreement to date but goes beyond it <e> <s> maybe it is a kind of watershed for both east-west relations within the atlantic alliance and it is a crisis which must not be allowed to slip from our attention as a result of last weeks tragic events in the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have found so remarkable in this debate so far is that nearly all contributions even those with which one might find oneself at variance as regards argument and reasoning contained elements that were constructive helpful and even hopeful <e> <s> i refer especially to the maiden speech of the noble earl lord oxford and asquith <e> <s> i congratulate him and hope that he will enlighten us more frequently in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to join with others in congratulating the maiden speech of the noble lord lord maclehose of beoch whose great distinction and knowledge of an area of mounting importance to the world is a great gain for your lordships house and will enrich future debates <e>", "<cs> my lords on the day that i first saw mention of this debate for which we are so greatly indebted to my noble friend lord kennet i distinctly noticed six headings on the front page of my morning paper all focusing on the middle east news of horror terror war in the gulf the west bank southern sudan the edge of the sahara chad the streets of london and of course the lebanon a grim reminder of the polycentric and indeed hydra-headed turmoil in the arab world <e> <s> this observation is relevant to our approach to any individual crisis in the area and thus to any discussion of how her majestys government and the european community should view the lebanon <e> <s> for we must focus on each problem on its own merit and not persist in that obsessive notion epitomised by the hapless venice declaration that all ills in the area stem from lead to and pale before the arab-israeli conflict and the palestian issue <e>", "<cs> my lords let me congratulate the two maiden speakers on their pertinent and thoughtful remarks <e> <s> i must say that it is heart-warming to be able to welcome two new contributors to future debates on cultural topics topics which are rarely perhaps i dare say too rarely debated in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now my turn to pay tribute to the three maiden speakers and to congratulate them on speeches which were highly informative distinguished and moving because of the presentation of passionately held sincere views <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has proved abundantly that lying athwart the whole complex of our foreign relations and defence of burning urgency and unchallenged priority is our relationship and that of europe with the united states <e> <s> as my work makes me spend part of the year in america perhaps i may be allowed to talk about those united states concerns and european reactions which vex americans and seem to bar progress on the common road of the atlantic alliance <e> <s> of course it is well understood that grievances are mutual that true democracies are pluralistic and that no democracy is more pluralistic than the united states <e> <s> washington often speaks through more than one voice and recently and very irritatingly it speaks through many voices <e> <s> but basically we have an american administration who have a deep and courteous concern for european and british interests a proven record of loyalty and solidarity <e>", "<cs> my lords for introducing the debate the noble lord lord bonham-carter deserves the thanks of all of us who feel that cultural diplomacy in britain has suffered at the hands of <e>", "<cs> my lords it was just a little over years ago that the eminent zionist leader dr weizmann addressing a royal commission described the jewish-arab conflict as not so much one of right and wrong as of two rights and two wrongs <e> <s> he added <e>", "<cs> my lords at twelve oclock noon a week ago i found myself at clock square in ramalla in the west bank <e> <s> flanked by an israeli military patrol and shielded by sharpshooters on the roof we stood by expectantly for noontime usually spells trouble <e> <s> youths tend to come out of recently reopened schools and out of alleyways quite often in an ugly mood <e> <s> it so happened that last wednesday and indeed all last week it was calm there <e> <s> one could almost say all quiet on the west bank <e> <s> however just as in erich maria remarques historic novel even that laconic phrase conceals horror pain and suffering experienced on both sides that very day <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone travelling today on both sides of the great potsdam divide of europe must be struck by the perception that britains and especially her prime ministers views on foreign policy are closely monitored <e> <s> although they are variously received they are recognised as having the merit of consistency <e> <s> she is seen to be firmly in the drivers seat putting the brake on european political integration and pressing the accelerator on the liberalisation of eastern europe urging modernisation of the tools of defence while warmly supporting <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that since mr shamirs plan is perhaps the only realistic one available now it was endorsed yesterday by the israeli government it would be counter-productive to continue high level talks between members of her majestys government and plo leaders with the credentials of mr bassam abu sharif or possibly chairman yasser arafat in view of the fact that mr sharif has endorsed the recent bus killings on the outskirts of jerusalem and described them as a natural human response and not untypically chairman arafat was among the first to congratulate the peoples republic of china upon breaking the students resistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to congratulate the noble lord lord richard on his maiden speech which reflected his considerable first-hand knowledge and his wide historical perspective of the european question <e> <s> it is with that historic perspective that i should like to begin my remarks <e> <s> when we discuss today following the lead of the noble lord lord jenkins the future of european unity we must first of all count our blessings for never in a thousand years of history has there been a more auspicious and stable europe than that of the european community <e> <s> it is not only a functioning institution it is also the epicentre of an evolving process <e> <s> but with all its imperfections the europe of the twelve is a healthy organism which is flexible enough to weather much turbulence and bend to changing circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments firm handling of the gulf crisis and the consensus in your lordships house on our common objectives are of course very reassuring but this objective to restore the status quo ante in kuwait is and must remain our unqualified priority <e> <s> i say that because any exiguous concession would help saddam hussein to see himself as well as to be seen by his supporters and even some of his more volatile opponents as the triumphant victor in a holy war <e> <s> if gamal nasser could emerge after his defeat in the six day war as a hero saddam hussein would certainly be hailed as a saviour if he kept but the tiniest fraction of his loot <e> <s> worse still we could then face in quick succession the subversion or overthrow most probably from within of arab regimes from morocco and egypt to the gulf emirates and indeed the saudi kingdom <e> <s> no amount of american or worldwide readiness to help those regimes could staunch internal change a change that could be plausibly masked by the rise of populist governments or even feudal figureheads picked from among disgruntled scions of junior beds of various princely families <e>", "<cs> my lords two flying hours away from where american and british troops are stationed in the gulf an ancient king croesus of lydia years ago stood poised for battle and hesitant consulted the oracle which told him if you cross the river halys you will destroy a mighty empire <e> <s> he crossed fought and destroyed an empire his own <e> <s> he had hesitated too long <e>"]
