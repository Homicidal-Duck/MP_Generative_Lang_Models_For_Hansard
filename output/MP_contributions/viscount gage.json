["<cs> my lords belonging as i do to an age group which has been warned not to use the underground and having observed what happened to my noble friend lord home the other day i am very glad to hear about what is being done <e> <s> could we possibly be informed whether there is any likelihood of the underground being made safe for the likes of us <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord wallace of coslany that it is a very bad position <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord evans of claughton will be moving an amendment on this subject later on i presume he thinks that housing associations might provide accommodation rented accommodation in rural areas <e> <s> and when he says that this is the only way as he has just said he would agree perhaps i refer to his own amendment that they might serve that purpose <e>", "<cs> if a man buys his house and then after four or five years dies under the amendment moved by the noble baroness will the widow be compelled to live in that house until the years are up before she can sell it <e>", "<cs> i was for many years president of the national federation of housing associations <e> <s> for that reason and as i very rarely bother your lordships perhaps i may be allowed to make one or two general comments before coming to this particular amendment although everything that i say will be connected with the amendment <e>", "<cs> does what the noble lord is going to say about clause contain any suggestions as to who is to build new rented accommodation in these areas of outstanding natural beauty <e> <s> i made a suggestion but nobody else has made any suggestion as to who is going to provide new rented accommodation in these special areas <e>", "<cs> i think that we should be grateful to the government for allowing housing associations these rights <e> <s> it is a fairly complicated formula <e> <s> i doubt whether it will ever persuade new housing associations to form themselves with the object of providing new accommodation for rent <e> <s> that is a question which i keep on asking <e> <s> i cannot find anybody who is able to answer it <e> <s> who is to supply new accommodation to let in rural areas and particularly in the areas of outstanding natural beauty <e>", "<cs> i do not understand the amendment but i am very grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will look at the figures produced by my noble friend <e> <s> i have noticed in other directions that where there are basic principles which i am in favour of they sometimes produce ridiculous results <e> <s> there ought to be some ministerial power to make some sort of allowances <e> <s> it is a difficult question but i do not think that all these things should be grouped under the heading of a principle which in no circumstances can be changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not understand one thing my noble friend lord bellwin said <e> <s> is a flat constructed for the warden of an old persons home for the aged protected <e> <s> is it excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to join in this interesting exchange concerning members of the labour party and the relationship of the front bench and the blackpool conference <e> <s> this is a mystery to which we shall perhaps one day discover the answer <e> <s> i think that i have been a member of this house for as long as anybody else over years and for the whole of that time i and other hereditary peers have been subjected to a sort of ritual campaign of abuse sometimes very rude <e> <s> the curious thing is that after all this time the whole result of this protracted campaign is nothing at all we are still here still patiently awaiting reform <e> <s> it also suggests that whatever anybody may think about the present house it is not very easy to invent a better one in a country which has no written constitution <e> <s> that has been brought out by events <e> <s> in my period there have been seven serious attempts to reform this house and all have failed <e> <s> all failed for the same reason they all attracted more hostility than support <e> <s> i feel that there is little reason to suppose that any new suggestion for reforming our composition and powers will be any more successful although i may be proved wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief because my views such as they are have been expressed much better than i could express them in the second leading article in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not extremely unlikely that there would be any general agreement about comprehensive reform <e> <s> would not the government be well advised to consider a modest measure of this sort and by doing so might not the queen be relieved of having to take some very difficult decisions <e>"]
