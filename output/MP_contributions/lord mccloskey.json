["<cs> on this question i want to make just two brief points <e> <s> first of all at second reading i referred to this clause as an example of the government by-passing the scottish law commission i pointed out that the scottish law commission is currently considering the law of evidence and is going to make recommendations and i regretted the fact that this change was being made in advance of those recommendations <e> <s> however i do not repeat that point because the government are entitled to proceed in this way if they choose to do so <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support this again fairly briefly <e> <s> when i was solicitor-general for scotland in and had not been in private practice for a number of years i received a fee payable in guineas dating from some imprecise time before decimalisation <e> <s> it was probably about years since i had earned the money and it was worth only a fraction of what i would have received had i received it promptly <e> <s> in those days the salary of a solicitor-general was so small that it was gratefully received albeit years late <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that commons amendment no <e> <s> is an improvement and i welcome it <e> <s> it derives from the debates in this house <e> <s> commons amendment no <e> <s> is slightly more than a drafting amendment but it is an improvement and the improvement derives from the critical analysis of the provision when the bill was before this house on a previous occasion <e> <s> those two improvements illustrate a point which i sought to make earlier namely that part of the function of this house is to improve a bill by suggested revisions to the text <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has not addressed himself to my point <e> <s> in the english bill in clause the provisions include the matters which are currently in the new clause namely <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> e seeks to leave out lines to in the new clause before clause <e> <s> your lordships will see that it is printed on page of the marshalled list <e> <s> the effect of taking out lines to inclusive is to take out the reference to the criminal proceedings in the high court of justiciary <e>"]
