["<cs> my lords i do not think that one can really separate the activities of the various parts <e> <s> i cannot see that there is any substantial difference or indeed any difference between what was contained in the manifesto and what was said in the gracious speech <e> <s> i went on to say that we are now considering how best to implement those policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords intervention can be answered very simply indeed <e> <s> the major difference was that the periods of high growth were periods of conservative government and the periods of low growth were periods of labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to interrupt the noble lord but as we are dealing with a question of fact perhaps i might make this point with reference to the figures that he quoted <e> <s> the table on page shows that the net reduction in taxation for the current year amounts to million over a billion pounds tax reduction <e> <s> the figure that he quoted is the forecast for a full year but before that full year expires there will be another budget and my right honourable <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me he must pay regard to the fact that it was this government which had to find the money out of which those increases in allowances were paid <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully appreciate the important contribution made by the hotel industry in common with other industries which produce invisible earnings <e> <s> but in the governments view it is unlikely that the increase in the rate of vat on hotel accommodation would of itself deter many potential overseas visitors whether they come on business or on holiday given the many factors which people take into account when planning a visit abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government do not propose to relieve the hotel industry from vat the noble lords question does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for recognising the common sense which actuates the government in all their policies <e> <s> far be it from me not to recognise a compliment paid by a noble lord opposite <e> <s> we have looked very carefully at the question of the importance of the hotel industry in relation to foreign earnings the government realise how important it is <e> <s> they do not regard the vat increase as a crucial factor here <e> <s> however perhaps the noble lord would also care to take into account the fact that if relief from tax is given on one item of expenditure the cost of the relief must be recouped elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most obliged to the noble lord for the information which he has given us <e> <s> all taxes are unpopular and everybody paying them would be only too glad to be relieved from them <e> <s> the governments policy is in the long run directed to curb the level of government expenditure and thereby to reduce we hope the level of taxation <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not only the tourist who has to pay vat on the food element in a hotel bill the resident of this country also does <e> <s> in fact we are holding the scales fairly between the residents and the i visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the hotel industry itself will take every step it can to attract visitors during the off-season <e> <s> however in the governments view this does not itself constitute a case for giving relief from vat <e>", "<cs> my lords the government entirely appreciate the importance and the value of the educational process and we believe that everything possible should be done to improve the flow of information to those who take part in decisions affecting pay bargaining <e> <s> ministers have repeatedly made their views on this subject known both in another place and in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords we are fully aware of the importance of improving public understanding of economic policy but when it comes to embarking upon discussions of the kind to which the noble lord refers it is very important that this should be got right <e> <s> the issue is a difficult and complex one and we are anxious to ensure that whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are obviously not responsible for statements which are made by other people but we have made it clear again and again that we are determined to stick to our monetary targets <e> <s> as a result if there are excessive pay increases they can result only in threatening jobs and in putting firms on which jobs depend out of business <e> <s> this is a matter which we would expect responsible bargainers on both sides to take fully into account <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not fixing guidelines and we have taken great care not to do so <e> <s> what we have done and will continue to do is to draw the attention of everybody concerned to the inevitable link which exists between excessive settlements and jobs and the prosperity of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very happy to agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we have endeavoured both in your lordships house and elsewhere to impress these facts upon public opinion and we shall go on doing so <e> <s> the specific suggestions which the noble lord makes are interesting and we shall be very happy to look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords ministers have held discussions with bodies representative of both employers and employees and they will go on doing so <e> <s> the governments views in this matter carry great authority and we very much appreciate any help or assistance which is given by other people in bringing these truths home to the mass of our people <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no platitudes in the governments policies <e> <s> in fact the governments policy consists of actions specifically directed to curing the ills of the british economy which were created by five years of mis-management of our affairs by a labour administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reminiscences <e> <s> i myself was not born in he th century <e> <s> the policies we are following are directed to the problems of the last quarter of the th century <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is incumbent upon her majestys government to express views about the level of productivity of members of the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is abundantly evident that the noble lord lord mishcon is totally unaware of the economic plight to which the policies of the government whom he supported brought this country <e> <s> we found our-selves faced with a rising and accelerating rate of inflation we found ourselves faced with a money supply which was at the top end and threatening to exceed the guidelines which they themselves had laid down and we found a public sector borrowing requirement substantially in excess of the figures to which the then chancellor of the exchequer had committed himself <e> <s> in those circumstances it was absolutely essential that the government should take action and the government took the action which was required <e> <s> the only way we can safeguard the future of this country the only way we can ensure a soundly based recovery and the only way we can ensure that in the long run we have jobs for our people is to squeeze out inflation and that is what we are determined to do <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal first with the points raised by the noble lord lord kaldor <e> <s> the noble lord is a well-known and very distinguished follower of the late lord keynes who was ultimately responsible for the theory of fine tuning <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made clear in his budget speech we do not accept that the policy of fine tuning has been to the advantage of this country <e> <s> indeed we believe and i explained this at great length in the speech that i made in your lordships house when we debated the budget strategy that its long-term effect has been to depress output not to increase it and therefore to create for the country greater not fewer difficulties <e> <s> nor do i accept the noble lords claim that our present difficulties are due primarily or largely to external causes <e> <s> our difficulties are primarily due to ourselves <e> <s> we must get a higher level of output and productivity and we must bear in mind that if we pay ourselves more than our level of productivity warrants the result is inflation <e> <s> the policies of her majestys government are directed primarily to squeezing out inflation as we believe that this is the necessary pre-condition of a recovery in both output and employment <e>", "<cs> my lords we use words in their ordinary english meaning <e> <s> we are just as concerned about the level of unemployment as is the noble baroness or indeed anybody else in the country <e> <s> the present level of unemployment is a result of the kind of policies that have been followed in recent years and if the level of unemployment regrettably goes up and i emphasise the words regrettably goes up it will be because of the necessity to take measures to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords under the noble lords government people would have had to wait until after christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for suggesting that the noble lord had any degree of responsibility for the previous administration <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the noble lords analysis of the situation <e> <s> the measures which have been taken by the government were absolutely essential in the context of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to calculate three months from the present day it would seem to take us approximately to the time when parliament will be reassembling anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred to this statement as having been made against a background of rising unemployment a high rate of inflation and pressures on company liquidity <e> <s> this is of course the price that we are having to pay for five years of labour government and if therefore what my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer has announced this afternoon represents a complete break from the policies which were followed by the previous administration which led to the disastrous results which the noble lord lord bruce of donington has outlined i should have thought that that was the strongest possible argument in support of what we are now doing <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason whatever to suppose that this measure will stifle investment in the british economy <e> <s> investment in the british economy depends as much as anything on the prospects for the british economy and particularly the prospects for profits <e> <s> we are doing everything we can to restore confidence in the british economy <e> <s> all the evidence of the past is that direct investment overseas by british companies and indeed by british individuals has tended in the long run to benefit the british economy by creating greater export opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not having answered that point <e> <s> i was endeavouring to make a large number of notes and unfortunately i did not reply to it <e> <s> the investment dollar premium market is a private market for which the government have no responsibility at all <e> <s> it is difficult to believe that in the absence of exchange control such a market will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend draws attention to a point of great importance <e> <s> an improvement in our standard of living can only come from an increase in national output <e> <s> this depends upon productivity and an improvement in productivity depends in part at any rate on the removal of restrictive practices <e> <s> the government are themselves doing their part by squeezing inflation out of the system by following a strict fiscal and monetary policy and they are providing tax incentives in indirect taxation at all income levels <e> <s> so far as individual restrictive practices are concerned that is primarily a matter for the employers and employees of the industries concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are doing a first-class job in <e>", "<cs> i was my lords speaking with all due modesty <e>", "<cs> yes my lords investment in industry is a matter of very great importance <e> <s> investment depends upon confidence <e> <s> the government are endeavouring to restore confidence in industry not least by squeezing out inflation which has been one of the greatest impediments to growth and one of the greatest deterrents to investment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i had the great pleasure of working with the late lord keynes at the treasury while the white paper to which the noble lord referred was being written <e> <s> its emphasis upon removal of restrictive practices and improvement in productivity is just as valid today as when those words were written years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been no sharp turn for the worse as a result of the change in government <e> <s> in fact on the contrary the prospects of this country are much better than they were during the years of the labour government <e>", "<cs> all the evidence my lords is that investment from this country overseas creates export opportunities and therefore improves matters so far as british industry is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord wishes to look at the history of the stock market in any detail but if he would care to examine the progress of prices under the labour government it would give him no great comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not directly or indirectly responsible for stock exchange prices <e>", "<cs> but if the noble lord wishes to follow this point may i remind him that in the heyday of the labour government the stock ex <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend does well to draw attention to these matters <e> <s> one of the greatest problems we face is the low growth in the last five years and the fact that the previous administration based so many of their plans on a projected rate of growth which was not and could not be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems we face at the moment are the result of the high rate of inflation which we inherited from the previous administration and there is the absolute <e>", "<cs> need to deal with this problem as a prerequisite for the resumption of growth which is an objective i think we all share <e>", "<cs> my lords i need no reminding by the noble baroness <e> <s> the underlying rate of inflation in may exceeded per cent <e> <s> the latest figure for the rpi is somewhat over per cent <e> <s> of that per cent <e> <s> is a once-and-for-all change due to the increase in the rate of vat which was introduced partly to finance the reductions in the level of direct taxation which were so sorely needed as well as to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement which was <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested indeed to listen to the speech by the noble lord which would require a speech to answer it but in so far as he made one point which is relevant to the question on the order paper namely that referring to the publication of unrealistic forecasts which then fuel expectations which cannot be achieved i entirely agree with him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords needless to say while i have listened with great interest to the comments made by the noble baroness lady birk i do not agree with anything that she has said <e> <s> the biggest danger facing this country is inflation and all our other problems flow from that <e> <s> the government remain determined that inflation shall be beaten <e> <s> there is no question of any change in our policy <e> <s> in fact the statement indicates that the government are resolutely pursuing their policy and will continue to pursue it towards a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords it is deflationary it restricts credit and in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to join the noble baroness in the forecast that she is making <e> <s> she must be responsible for her own forecasts <e>", "<cs> my lords the forecasts under the industry act will be published shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords there is of course a fundamental difference between the noble lord lord kaldor and the present government on questions of economic policy <e> <s> we reject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord robbins for what he says <e> <s> i agree with him that no major inflation has occurred without an inflation in the level of the money supply <e> <s> this is why we are determined that there shall be no inflation in the level of the money supply now <e> <s> the noble lord went on to ask how the money rate of interest that is the nominal rate of interest compares with the rate of inflation the difference between the two of course representing the real rate of interest <e> <s> the present minimum lending rate is only marginally above the last figure for the increase in the retail price index <e> <s> currently therefore it represents an extremely small real rate of interest <e> <s> from this point of view of course the effect on investment is of very great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to the need for national unity <e> <s> on that point and that point alone of course i agree with him <e> <s> but if he seriously thinks that the deplorable events which occurred this last winter under a labour administration were a demonstration of national unity f think he ought seriously to reconsider the ordinary use of the english language <e> <s> the greatest evil and the most divisive influence that this country faces is inflation <e> <s> it is only by the conquest of inflation that we shall be able to re-establish national unity that we shall be able to re-establish progress in this country that we shall be able to re-establish industrial peace and that we shall be able to offer all of our people a better future <e> <s> it is for those reasons that we are prepared to face the problems that we do face to deal with them and in the end to overcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a suggestion which has been made on a number of occasions <e> <s> the problem that one gets into quite simply is that the more direct controls of this sort one imposes the greater the ingenuity of the financial community in finding ways around them <e> <s> we believe therefore that the best solution is the one we have put forward namely the increase in the minimum lending rate <e> <s> but there will of course as i have said be a discussion paper published shortly on various means of controlling the money supply including the interesting suggestions which have been made about the use of a form of monetary base control <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> it was the failure of incomes policies as well as of other devices which brought it home not only to the government but to most people that there was no alternative to a strict monetary policy supported by a proper fiscal policy as the means of controlling inflation <e> <s> we shall continue with our policy and we shall continue with it to the end of defeating the menace of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord balogh asked me whether i agreed with him <e> <s> the short answer is that i do not agree with him <e> <s> most of the proposals he put forward and the arguments he advanced were proposals for dealing with the symptoms of inflation <e> <s> we believe that as with any other disease the correct thing is to deal with the cause and if you cure the cause the symptoms then disappear <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his support and for the comments he made <e> <s> on a personal note i too remember well the occasion when bank rate was increased from to per cent <e> <s> as i was then working directly for the noble lord lord butler of saffron walden who was my senior sponsor when i came into your lordships house <e> <s> it is of course entirely true that a monetary policy needs to be supported by an appropriate fiscal policy and it is the governments determination to go on so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords remarks might well de drawn to the attention of the banks because i felt very much that they were intended to be helpful in a most difficult situation that we all face <e> <s> we believe the best way of rationing credit is through the price mechanism that is through the rate of interest rather than going in for direct control of individual kinds of borrowing which would require among other things a considerable administrative bureaucracy to operate it and which is unlikely in the end to be satisfactory <e> <s> the true rate of interest which is paid by people who use these special forms of borrowing i was about to use a different term but i was very careful such as access is in fact very high <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why the noble lord should be disappointed to hear that matters are under constant review <e> <s> i should have thought that he would have been disappointed had he been told that the matter was not under constant review <e> <s> with regard to the figures he quoted they have been widely quoted without the qualifications which were given at the time they were quoted to the estimates committee <e> <s> in commenting on certain estimates that had been made by other people sir william pile said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i give the noble and learned lord some information of what the constant efforts have brought forth <e> <s> evasion is essentially a question of enforcement by the revenue boards <e> <s> in the last three years the total charge raised as a result of detected evasion by the inland revenue was as follows in the year to the st october it was million in the year to st october it was million in <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer very simply is that i was not asked for them <e> <s> incidentally the figures are published <e> <s> may i refer the noble baroness to the st report <e> <s> perhaps i ought to qualify that and say that the figures for the first two years i quoted are published in the st report of the commissioners of inland revenue which is available in the printed paper office <e> <s> in order to give the latest figure to your lordships i had the figure for the year to st october brought out in order to bring the picture up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords there is indeed a clear distinction between tax evasion and tax avoidance a distinction which is well understood by most people <e> <s> my reply dealt with both of them when i said that these matters were under constant review <e> <s> the supplementary questions of course related to tax evasion which is why i confined my reply to those matters <e>", "<cs> that my lords is a totally different matter <e> <s> overpayments do not normally arise as a result either of tax evasion or of tax avoidance <e>", "<cs> my lords when one comes to debate morality one is in a very difficult field indeed <e> <s> one of the great problems with tax avoidance is that there is no unanimity of opinion as to what constitutes tax avoidance <e> <s> if i may remind the noble lord there has been legislation against the deed of covenant in and <e> <s> nevertheless the deed of covenant is the main instrument used for charities in raising their funds <e>", "<cs> my lords tax avoidance is a matter for legislation <e> <s> if the noble lord was referring to tax evasion the importance of dealing with tax evasion is well known to the chairman and the members of both revenue boards <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that the heavier the burden of taxation the greater is the temptation both to evade and to avoid the burden <e> <s> i think however that it would be too optimistic to think that reductions in taxation would totally solve this problem which has been with us for a very long time indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not customary for ministers to answer questions of that nature <e> <s> the effect of the abolition of exchange control on avoidance and evasion was considered by ministers before they took the decisions which they did <e> <s> the abolition of exchange control was essential from the point of view of the economic health of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether it is possible to provide figures of that kind <e> <s> i shall certainly have a look at the matter to see whether figures can be obtained <e> <s> of course a great deal of the work on tax evasion is part and parcel of the daily work of the staff of both revenue departments and it is very difficult to separate out one part of their work from another <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect to the noble lord that i fully understand the difference between tax evasion and tax avoidance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a number of questions <e> <s> inevitably as was clearly stated in the document to which he refers it was necessary to make certain assumptions <e> <s> the assumptions were as stated <e> <s> there is of course a difference between an assumption and a forecast <e> <s> so far as the level of pay settlements is concerned it is a matter of great importance that it should come down <e> <s> we believe that the present level of inflation does impose very great difficulties for our exporters and we think that the best way that these difficulties can be overcome is by reducing the level of inflation <e> <s> it is to that end that her majestys governments policies are directed <e>", "<cs> my lords success in exports of course depends on a large number of factors other than price competitiveness <e> <s> it depends on the quality of goods and on excellence of design <e> <s> it depends on good delivery dates it depends upon adhering to those delivery dates it depends upon after-sales service and the availability of spares <e> <s> moreover there is a difference between price competitiveness and the level of retail prices <e> <s> the prices in an export market do not necessarily follow precisely the trend of retail prices in the country of origin <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already made the point that price competitiveness depends upon quite a number of factors other than the level of retail prices in the exporting country <e> <s> the most important of these factors is the level of productivity <e> <s> many of our exporters and it is greatly to their credit and we should pay them a tribute for this have succeeded in obtaining substantial increases in the level of productivity <e> <s> we hope that they will continue to do so with the co-operation of their work forces and this will maintain our position in the export market <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to accept any such assumption on the noble lords part <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand entirely the point that my noble friend is making <e> <s> there is however no evidence that we have proceeded too quickly or too far in restraining the level <e>", "<cs> my lords extrication of our country from the fools paradise in which they were living under the labour government is a central part of our policy <e> <s> nobody takes any great pleasure in cutting public expenditure or in cutting public services but the nation is in exactly the same position as an individual <e> <s> we cannot spend money we do not have <e> <s> the future of our country must lie in a rise in the level of production and that can be achieved only if we lift from the shoulders of our people the burdens imposed upon them by an excessive level of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend says the position is that the current level of public expenditure in real terms is the same as it was last year <e> <s> we are of course now engaged in a major review of the whole field of public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the criterion that we apply is whether the nation can afford the level of public expenditure concerned <e> <s> it is perfectly obvious from what has happened in this country particularly in relation to the level of the governments borrowing requirement and the resulting rate of inflation which has flowed from that that the level to which public expenditure was raised under the previous administration was an insupportable one <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the objective of the government to govern in the interests of all the people of our country and we shall continue to do so <e> <s> as i have said we are reviewing in detail public expenditure in every aspect and the question of waste and inefficiency are two important matters that are in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords that particular question goes somewhat wide of the one on the order paper but deficiencies in particular in the case of nationalised industries are reflected in the public sector borrowing requirement and at the same time surpluses made by the nationalised industries appear as credits in the public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> therefore one would not get any improvement by failing to charge proper prices <e>", "<cs> my lords public expenditure is expenditure not only on goods but of course on wages and salaries as well <e> <s> the reason for trying to curb the level of public expenditure is to make room in the economy for the growth in the private sector and from the point of view of the long-term health of the economy that is preferable to and much healthier than a growth in the public sector <e>", "<cs> the gap my lords is unfortunately very wide indeed <e> <s> we have a rate of inflation of approximately per cent <e> <s> per annum and a growth in productivity at present of virtually nil <e> <s> that is why i said at the end of my answer that our future rests upon achieving a much better level of productivity <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not have any such effect at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for his opening sentence <e> <s> i am well aware of the standing and reputation of the people who produced these estimates but i do not think that they would lay any claim to papal infallibility and <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and on some suitable occasion i would always be prepared to give the noble lord some tuition in elementary economics <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely share the noble lords sentiment in deploring left-wing governments of all complexions but so far as the rest of his question is concerned i do not agree with him on any point <e> <s> it may be well within his recollection that one of the major causes of the present inflation was the high level of the public sector borrowing requirement and the excessive growth in the money supply created by the labour administration <e> <s> dealing with these matters inevitably involves taking measures which are unpleasant but it is essential <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question seemed to me to be interesting but not directly related to the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the fact that under pressure from the imf in the year the labour government were following a path of much greater fiscal and monetary prudence <e> <s> unfortunately in the following year under pressure of electoral considerations and dissension within their own party they allowed public expenditure to get out of control and this was the proximate cause of our present difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords while i entirely appreciate the sentiments expressed by the noble and learned lord the governments policy is clear and consistent and we believe it is the only effective way of dealing with the very great problems we face <e>", "<cs> my lords the reductions in direct taxation made by the present government benefited people at all income levels <e> <s> they resulted in a substantial rise in the threshold at which income tax liability commences an increase which was double the figure prescribed in the existing legislation and double the figure included in the labour partys first finance act of <e> <s> there were also reductions in the basic rate of income tax as well as reductions higher up the scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start first with the serious contribution to our debate which was made by my noble friend lord campbell of croy <e> <s> i shall deal afterwards with the contribution made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of croy raised a number of points of real importance <e> <s> he referred in particular to the impact of petroleum revenue tax on smaller fields <e> <s> we do of course recognise the importance from the point of view of the future development of the north sea of obtaining the maximum yield from the smaller fields which tend to be the less profitable ones <e> <s> the department of energy in conjunction with the oil industry the treasury and the inland revenue are currently reviewing the effect of the whole range of government policies on the less profitable <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not a cosmetic affair <e> <s> what the government have to do is to finance the public sector borrowing requirement which emerges in this year <e> <s> they also have to finance in due course next years public sector borrowing requirement and the revenue will not be lower next year as a result of the bill <e> <s> while the bill accelerates the payment of petroleum revenue tax this year it correspondingly accelerates the payment next year <e> <s> so next year we shall still get two full instalments plus some million left over from the accelerated instalment plus a further advantage as the totality of north sea revenue rises <e> <s> there is no question of this bill merely transferring revenue from one year to another <e> <s> it improves the level of government revenue for many years to come <e> <s> from that point of view therefore it is an effective not a cosmetic measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for making his views no less unclear than they were before <e> <s> the public sector borrowing requirement is one of the vital components which go into the level of the money supply and we cannot effectively control the one unless we control the other <e> <s> there is indeed a very great deal that the government can do about these matters and they are determined to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for her interesting suggestion which will certainly be examined <e> <s> however i see one immediate problem namely that the increase in the duty on the more expensive houses might need to be quite considerable to make good the loss of revenue on the smaller properties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his excursion into history <e> <s> the stamp duties are of course one of the oldest and most honourable of our taxes <e> <s> their origin lay in the greater ease of taxing a piece of paper rather than taxing a somewhat elusive individual <e> <s> the current yield of the stamp duties is of course quite considerable namely some million and my noble friends suggestion therefore does raise certain difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a suggestion which has been made on a number of occasions <e> <s> the stamp duty itself is not charged either on the buyer or the seller it is charged on the conveyance itself <e> <s> it so happens that because the purchaser is the person who needs to have the deeds <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am always grateful to receive suggestions suggestions for the imposition of new taxes are not always particularly popular <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely familiar with precisely what the noble lord said on that occasion <e> <s> i am grateful to him for repeating it <e> <s> he made two statements <e> <s> the first was exactly the one that i repeated i read it word for word <e> <s> it remains precisely true as i have said that we are well down in the league of gross national product per head and on this basis it is quite wrong and unreasonable to expect this country to be able to afford anything like the same level of public expenditure that other much wealthier countries can sustain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord we have at any rate found some measure of common agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the lateness of the hour i hope i may have your lordships permission to speak for a second time <e> <s> there have been a large number of speeches made of very high quality and very great interest <e> <s> i am only sorry that i will not be able to reply to them all in detail but i do assure all noble lords who have spoken that what they say will be studied with very great care <e> <s> i do not on this occasion have the pleasure of congratulating a maiden speaker but i do instead have the pleasure of congratulating the noble lord lord boothby on his th birthday which i understand took place yesterday <e> <s> the passage of time has dimmed neither his wit nor his wisdom nor his enthusiasm for gold as the sole medium of exchange <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord balogh in a most interesting speech and one which will clearly repay a great deal of study afterwards asked why monetary theory had so quickly been adopted and in a space of a few years had become universally accepted <e> <s> he attributed that to the fact that it absolved everyone from all and every responsibility <e> <s> i do not think that that in fact is a really adequate explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the great pleasure of listening to the noble lords contribution to the debate last week and i am grateful to him for reminding me of it <e> <s> i would however be misleading him if i were to suggest that his views were shared by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord presses his case with great charm and ability <e> <s> nevertheless the simple position is as his own question indicates that the only country which is in a position to do this either from the point of view of economic strength or from the point of view of possession of the quantities of gold required is the united states <e> <s> there is no reason whatever to believe that the united states has changed its policy of wishing to see gold demonetised <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the original intention of the concession was not to provide complete meals or perhaps even complete ham sandwiches but to give a relief which was equivalent to the subsidy given in the industrial canteen <e> <s> recent inquiries suggest that while the average subsidy is somewhat above the present figure for the luncheon voucher it is not all that much in excess <e> <s> the present concession costs about fl million per annum and to double it would therefore cost another million <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a well-known point <e> <s> the vat does apply to restaurant meals but it does not apply to food which is taken away and this reflects the general policy not only of the present government but of course of their predecessors of relieving expenditure on food as such from vat <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government did not double vat <e> <s> the standard rate went up from per cent <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise the contribution which the theatre makes to our national life and are aware of the situation which it is facing at present <e> <s> i am afraid however that it would be invidious to single out the theatre from the numerous other claimants for especially favourable vat treatment <e> <s> our support for the theatre as for other deserving causes must be limited to what the country can afford <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost of zero-rating theatre tickets would be of the order of million per annum but the real point is that if a concession of this kind were made to the theatre and incidentally there are of course eec problems in relation to the extension of zero-rating it would be quite impossible not to extend it to all sorts of other deserving causes where very strong representations are also made <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble and learned lord in his tribute to the national theatre but i do not share his gloomy prognostications for the future <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the theatre has been hit much harder by declining audiences due to the spread of television than it has ever been hit by the vat <e> <s> as far as the arts council is concerned the grant-in-aid this year is million which is substantially greater than the million actually issued last year <e> <s> about two-thirds of the total of the grant goes to the performing arts <e> <s> it is the view of the government as it was the view of the previous government that this is the best way in which assistance to the performing arts can be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept these arguments <e> <s> we agree that the theatre is going through a difficult time at present <e> <s> but we believe that it will show great resilience in the future as it has in the past <e> <s> it is also a very valid point that at the time the vat was put up income tax was reduced substantially <e> <s> people have therefore more money in their pockets to spend <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord is not suggesting that because they now have more control over their own expenditure they are less willing to spend it on going to the theatre <e>", "<cs> s my lords i have said that we recognise the immense importance of the live theatre but we take the view that it would be quite impossible to hold the relief at the live theatre if it were given <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord occupies a unique position in this field and he puts his case with immense persuasiveness <e> <s> we recognise the unique position of the british theatre <e> <s> if i did not have noble lords continually to draw my attention to it my attention to it is so drawn at home as well <e> <s> nevertheless the position remains that we believe the right way to channel help to the arts is through the grants to the arts council <e> <s> over the last decade these grants have increased very substantially indeed in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lords historical recollection is entirely correct <e> <s> it is true that the living theatre was at one time charged half-rate on entertainment tax and then relieved altogether from it <e> <s> shortly afterwards the cinema was relieved on the same argument and a few years afterwards the whole of the tax collapsed <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise the unique contribution that the subsidised theatre makes to the cultural life of this country <e> <s> this is why it is the subject of considerable grants from the arts council and this we believe is the correct channel for providing support rather than through tax relief <e>", "<cs> my lords far from being unsatisfactory my reply assured the noble lord that his suggestions which are always worth paying attention to whether or not one agrees with them have been noted by my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the position is that under the terms of the petroleum revenue tax act which went through your lordships house last month an additional million of tax is being collected from the north sea revenues this year a further million next year and additional sums thereafter <e> <s> as a result the total tax take including royalties from the north sea this year will be four times what it was last year <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first point made by my noble friend it is also true that barley which is used in the production of beer is zero-rated but the final product is not <e> <s> that is a common feature with a tax like vat <e> <s> as regards my noble friends second point the reason for confectionery being charged to vat is based on revenue requirements and not on any arguments about the nutritional or other value of the products concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that arguments of that type are advanced but i personally would not wish to become involved in them <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned the overriding factor in this particular case is the amount of revenue involved <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not work like that <e> <s> if agricultural fertilisers were exempt from vat it would be necessary for the manufacturers to distinguish between their exempt and their chargeable output as most manufacturers of fertilisers also manufacture other chemicals <e> <s> that would result in a considerable increase in the burden of administration and create considerable problems <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a very valid point and what he says is entirely true <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble lord so much appreciates the efforts of the government in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend tabled this question there has been a dramatic fall in the price of silver which reached a peak of an ounce just after christmas but which <e>", "<cs> there was nothing flippant in the replies i gave my lords and if the noble lord lord goronwyroberts cares to cast his mind back he may recall that in the days of the labour government under the late mr clement attlee silver articles were at one time charged at per cent <e> <s> that even in more recent times they were charged at per cent <e> <s> and that therefore the per cent <e> <s> vat at which they are at present charged represents a very considerable reduction on those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate what my noble friend says <e> <s> there are grants which are made to silversmiths through the crafts council <e> <s> the problem of working capital is one which affects large numbers of small businesses and the governments general policies arc designed to help small businesses in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in fact complaining about anything <e> <s> i was merely drawing attention to what the facts were <e>", "<cs> the operation of the market my lords is a matter which lies outside the scope of this question which refers to vat <e>", "<cs> my lords vat is not in any way responsible for the violent fluctuations in the price of silver <e>", "<cs> that is why i am assisting the noble lord by pointing it out <e> <s> i do not think that any discussions of the kind that he has in mind would have prevented the occurrence of the situation with which silversmiths are now faced <e>", "<cs> my lords the news that i am giving the noble lord is that the proposition that there should be special relief from vat for silver articles is not one which is acceptable to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the government decide the necessary reductions on the basis of a comprehensive review of public expenditure <e> <s> the forthcoming public expenditure white paper to be published on budget day will reflect a careful judgment of priorities in selecting items for reduction <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the simplification of procedures and the promotion of efficiency is of the essence of the work which is being done by sir derek rayner in collaboration with ministers <e> <s> there are undoubtedly important savings to be made in these areas <e>", "<cs> no my lordsthat is not the right way to look at the problem <e> <s> we have to look at reductions in public expenditure in the context of the governments overall economic policy which is designed to eliminate inflation to reduce taxation to improve incentives and thus to lead to a higher level of output and a higher level of employment <e> <s> had we followed the policies of the previous government which entailed higher expenditure and higher taxation the future prospects for the british economy would he much worse than they are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that it was the party opposite which renegotiated the terms of entry and claimed that they had come to a satisfactory conclusion a claim which in common with so many of their other claims has been completely falsified by events <e> <s> nobody can give place to my right honourable and noble friend the prime minister in drawing attention to this problem and as she has repeatedly said we are determined to find a solution which is satisfactory to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important that reductions in public expenditure should be made by reference to individual programmes rather than by reference to cuts across the board <e> <s> that is why it is important for the house to await the publication of the public expenditure white paper before it is possible to pursue these matters in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the fact that i did sobut if i did it was an inadvertent slip of the tongue <e> <s> i used the phrase my noble friend in relation to the lord president of the council which is entirely correct from both aspects of the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing and what is essential from the point of view of the economy is to reduce the level of inflation <e> <s> that can only be done by a firm monetary and financial policy <e> <s> reduction of public expenditure to an amount within the capacity of the country to pay is an integral part of such a policy <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is quite untrue <e> <s> if one casts ones mind back to the events before the general election the fruits of the kind of policy followed by the party opposite are abundantly and painfully clear <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i have made it abundantly clear that excessive wage settlements can have only one result to reduce the level of activity and thereby to reduce the level of employment <e> <s> this is one of the facts of life that union negotiators and employers as well need to keep continually in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate and it has brought forth a number of penetrating and interesting speeches from both sides of the house <e> <s> i was however astounded that the noble lord lord bruce of donington started by claiming that insincerity was a virtue <e> <s> i have long since ceased to follow some of his particular intellectual exercises but that one seemed to be more unusual than usual <e> <s> he has complained also that he does not always get replies to the questions that he asks <e> <s> i am going to start therefore despite the lateness of the hour by explaining to him simply what is the connection between the money supply the psbr and the rates of interest <e> <s> the rate of interest is the key to the level of the money supply <e> <s> if the noble lord lord bruce of donington wishes to throw that key away as he has suggested it is not surprising that he abandons hope of controlling the money supply <e> <s> if the psbr goes up it follows that the government have to borrow more money <e> <s> they can only borrow more money at higher rates of interest <e> <s> this lesson was abundantly demonstrated last november <e> <s> if rates of interest rise those rates of interest impose a burden on industry and cut down the demands for credit by industry to match the increase in the psbr <e> <s> therefore an increase in the psbr results not only in higher rates of interest it results in damage to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have indicated the amounts recovered from investigations into tax evasion have shown a steady increase over the years <e> <s> the number of staff employed on special investigation work in the inland revenue has also increased <e> <s> there are at present five special investigation offices and that number will be increased to six in the coming year <e> <s> the number of staff employed in customs and excise in specialised investigation units has also shown an increase and it is the policy of both departments to continue to deploy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think if i may be permitted to say so that it is also disgraceful to fiddle the inland revenue or the customs and excise <e> <s> we all greatly deplore tax evasion and must do so and every effort is made by both revenue departments to deal with this matter in the most effective manner <e> <s> both revenue boards are to be congratulated on their successes in this field which are amply demonstrated by the figures that i have quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness that is not the subject matter of the question which relates to tax evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of dealing with tax evasion is essentially a question of the proper deployment of the available staff rather than one of simply increasing the number of people employed <e>", "<cs> my lords this question relates to tax evasion and i am quite certain that no inspectors of taxes have left the service of her majestys government in order to advise people on tax evasion <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates entirely to evasion and it was to that that i directed my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> figures of this kind are published in great detail in the annual reports of both revenue departments <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a legitimate observation but it does not arise out of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord about the difficulty and unreliability of such estimates which is why i was somewhat surprised to find them in the noble lords own question <e>", "<cs> no my lords the increase in interest rates in the two cases that the noble lord mentioned was designed to prevent inflation being imported into those countries <e> <s> had that action <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree that that is the best way to tackle this problem <e> <s> in the very short run an increase in interest rates does tend to be passed on in prices but the ultimate effect of such an increase is to reduce the rate of inflation not to increase it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords argument is entirely incorrect <e> <s> the important factor is to control the level of the money supply <e> <s> the rate of interest is an important weapon in this regard <e> <s> there are heartening signs that the level of the money supply is coming down within the target range set by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords no one has ever pretended that there is a mechanical relationship between the two nor has it ever been maintained that the time lag is necessarily a fixed period of two years <e> <s> however all the evidence is absolutely clear <e> <s> it is that accelerating inflation is accompanied by an increase in the total money supply and if the money supply is brought back under control it will ultimately result in a reduction in the rate of inflation <e> <s> the sooner these facts are recognised in particular by people engaged in wage bargaining the quicker will these measures have their effect in reducing the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not go that way round at all <e> <s> the effect of high interest rates is to curb the growth in the money supply and ultimately to bring down rates of inflation <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have not said that there is never any connection between the desire on the part of some countries to strengthen their reserves and an increase in the rate of interest <e> <s> this was in fact a common phenomenon under the old bretton woods system when there were fixed exchange rates and where the rate of interest was a major weapon in ensuring that those fixed parities were maintained <e> <s> but the bretton woods system broke down in the early s and since then rates of interest have been used primarily not exclusively but primarily to control the rate of inflation rather than to influence the exchange rate of any given currency <e>", "<cs> my lords once people are convinced that the rate of inflation is likely to fall interest rates also will fall <e> <s> it is the expectation of a fall in rates of interest which makes people eager to subscribe for gilt-edged securities <e> <s> we therefore look forward to the occurrence of this happy state of affairs in the future as a result of the policy followed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord has a large and unsatisfied appetite for gilt-edged securities a point which seems to be somewhat in conflict with that made earlier by his noble friend lord kaldor <e>", "<cs> my lords this information is not available as the amount of interest paid to overseas stockholders is not separately recorded <e> <s> however in the year ended st march the percentage of national debt held by overseas holders including international organisations and central monetary institutions was estimated at rather more than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of both these points but so far as the first point made by the noble lord is concerned namely that the payments of interest on the national debt last year will be equal to the public sector borrowing requirement i have to remind him that during the period of office of the labour government the total national debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the fact that the noble lord was not endeavouring to score party points and that is why i drew his attention to the facts as they exist <e> <s> the other point i would make to him which is relevant in this connection is that the total of interest profits and dividends flowing into the united kingdom is greater than the amount flowing out <e> <s> on the international balance therefore we are in credit and not in deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very valid points made by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> the reason why we place such emphasis on the need to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement is because we are so fully aware of the points made both by the noble lord lord beswick and by my noble friend who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not entitled to make any such assumption as is contained in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> the terms of issue of a particular stock depend upon the governments need to sell sufficient stock to fund the borrowing requirement and the acceptability of the terms to the people who are going to purchase those stocks <e> <s> there is a substantial demand for long-term stock from the institutions and the government need to take advantage of this demand <e>", "<cs> no my lords they do not carry any such implications <e>", "<cs> my lords the public buy them because they think that in relation to the current rates of interest the stock represents a good buy <e> <s> perhaps i might remind the noble baroness that <e>", "<cs> no my lords the government do not accept the noble lords analysis of the correct basis of management of new issues <e> <s> if the government were to attempt to raise all of their requirements by short-dated issues it would merely have the effect of driving up the rate of interest on the short-term bonds even further than the present level <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is of course the complete answer to the noble lord lord kaldor <e> <s> the coupon on the stock to which the noble lord lord beswick refers was per cent <e> <s> which is less than the current rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never attempt to emulate the noble lord lord shinwell who is as fit and active today as when i first saw him cross the political spectrum when he won the election at seaham harbour <e> <s> nevertheless i look forward to seeing the year and to see who is right about the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords there is an arithmetical equality between the amount of public sector borrowing requirement and the amount of interest which is being paid <e> <s> it does not necessarily follow that one is the consequence of the other because it is equally arguable that the size of the public sector borrowing requirement is a reflection of the high level of government expenditure generally <e> <s> the noble lord is trying to hypothecate particular items against other items <e> <s> this is not really an acceptable approach <e> <s> so far as the rate of interest generally is concerned we recognise the burden that it imposes upon industry <e> <s> we shall be only too glad to see when the rates of <e>", "<cs> my lords british industry has shown remarkable success in facing the problems that confront it <e> <s> our exports today are better than they <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a matter of considerable debate in your lordships house <e> <s> there is no doubt whatever on the basis of the evidence that an expansion in the money supply is followed in due course by a rise in the rate of inflation and control of the money supply will be followed again after a time-lag by a fall in the rate of inflation <e> <s> the rate of inflation from which we are currently suffering is very largely a reflection of the lack of control over the money supply during the dying days of the labour government of a lack of control over public expenditure by the labour government and of an excessive public sector borrowing requirement by the labour government <e> <s> these unfortunate effects cast a long shadow in front of them but the time will come when we get out of that shadow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his support <e> <s> as has been said in debates in your lordships house on many occasions the real key to success lies in higher productivity and this i am sure is supported by noble lords on all sides of the house <e> <s> it is also true that as long as pay settlements continue at their <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am most grateful to my noble friend for his very long supplementary question i think i would make only two comments <e> <s> the first is that the exchange rate and the present high level of the exchange rate is of course influenced by north sea oil as well as by other factors <e> <s> secondly a high exchange rate while it poses certain problems for industry also brings certain benefits to the country because it keeps the price of our imports much below what they otherwise would be and this in turn tends to lead to a lower level not only of consumer prices but of wage settlements in the country <e> <s> it also means that industry is able to buy its raw materials which of course is a matter of very great importance at much lower prices than it otherwise would <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not such an expert either on gramophone records or on repetitive statements as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend i do not think the question of public sector pay settlements is within the ambit of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that question is even wider of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the first part of that commentary has anything at all to do with the question on the order paper <e> <s> the second part of the commentary is denigratory of british industry and i should like to dissociate myself from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is better classified under the heading of vulgar abuse than under the heading of intelligent comment <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with anything the noble lord said <e> <s> negotiations between the imf and jamaica were broken off by jamaica <e> <s> one hopes that at some stage those negotiations will be resumed <e> <s> i do not think it would in any way assist the matter in endeavouring to debate it by way of question and answer in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble baroness was endeavouring to distinguish between mr michael manley and her noble friend <e> <s> i have already said that we are well aware of the negotiations between jamaica and the imf and of course that they talk <e> <s> negotiations are essentially a matter for the management of the fund and the country concerned <e> <s> i do not think it would assist either in the resumption of such negotiations or in their successful conclusion to endeavour to debate the matter in the terms which both the noble baroness and her noble friend have used <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because i am aware of the circumstances that the noble baroness has mentioned that i have made the point that i do not think it would assist the matter by endeavouring to debate in your lordships house an individual case of this type in the kind of terms which have been used by noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness about the rights of members of your lordships house <e> <s> nevertheless it is a perfectly valid point that some of the comments of the kind which have come from benches opposite are not the sort which assist the furtherance of negotiations in a matter

guidelines were revised in <e> <s> we need to see what the effect of those revisions will be <e> <s> there are periodic meetings at ministerial level where all these matters can be and are kept under review <e> <s> the last such meeting was held in hamburg in april and another meeting is scheduled for washington in september <e>", "<cs> my lords the brandt commission report is a matter to which

a matter for the imf to defend their own decisions i do not accept that they are acting outside the guidelines which have been laid down <e> <s> i have already said that these matters are kept under review that there are periodic meetings at ministerial level that one such meeting has just taken place and that another is scheduled for september <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kaldor is of course <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord cares to read my reply he will see that i have in fact answered that but i shall answer it in more detail if he wishes to detain the house <e> <s> the present rates of interest payable on long-dated gilt-edged securities are in fact substantially below the current rate of inflation <e> <s> they are therefore in real terms being sold on negative rates of interest <e> <s> in deciding therefore whether to contribute or subscribe to or to purchase these securities institutions have to balance the real loss short term against what they hope to be a gain longer term and the experience shows that the rates and maturities which are decided for the issue of government securities are those which are needed in the market place for the sale of the quantities required <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late hour let me say no more than that i do not accept any part of the noble lords diagnosis <e>", "<cs> my lords the bank of england endeavour to maintain a good standard of banknotes <e> <s> this task is in fact delegated to the clearing banks which examine the notes which go through their hands and withdraw those which are in an

these lines <e>", "<cs> he was supported elsewhere in your lordships house <e> <s> the problem here is that if one changes the date of the accounting year one either has to have one very short year in which event one has two years in the course of one calendar year or one has to have one very long period of accounts in this instance it would be an account for months which raises very difficult issues of forecasting <e> <s> interestingly enough this is an issue which has been raised in this country over the last years over the question of the financial year in the united kingdom <e> <s> many

been made <e> <s> the same considerations apply very much in the case of the community budget <e> <s> but do not let me deter my noble friend from continuing to press on this front if he feels that this would be the right solution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the comments he made in the first part of his <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will find that i dealt with this matter at length in the speech that i made in the debate in your lordships house on th june and i invite him to re-read that speech <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is true and an increasing number of firms are realising that in their own interests and the interests of their employees they need to settle at reasonable levels <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters are of course the subject of debate and discussion in a number of places not least of course in the national economic development council <e> <s> i believe that a general view that restraint in these matters is in the interests of everybody concerned is now becoming more accepted throughout the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course going very wide <e> <s> while i very much appreciate what my noble friend says we believe it is important that the public sector should set a good example in this matter and this is what we are endeavouring to do <e>", "<cs> my lords companies in the private sector are subject to the disciplines of the market place <e> <s> in the case of public sector corporations external financing limits are set <e> <s> the constraints which these impose are similar to those to which private sector companies are exposed <e> <s> the public sector is not therefore at a disadvantage <e> <s> in both public and private sector pay increases must be related to the ability of the organisation to pay but success and skill can still be properly rewarded <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot give any assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that where a concern in the public sector is making losses there is a very heavy responsibility upon it to improve its performance and to endeavour to reduce its unit costs with a view to returning to profitability <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> i think that there is universal agreement that the plight of british steel was such that it was absolutely essential to find the best management available anywhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can follow the noble lord very far down that path except to say that i believe that there is universal agreement that in these matters the laws of supply and demand are of importance <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept any conclusion of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the conclusions which the noble lord expresses <e> <s> i accept entirely that there needs to be a sense of fairness but the whole objective of the governments policy is to be even handed between the public and the private sector and thereby to create a sense of fairness <e>", "<cs> no my lords the fall in output is due to three main factors <e> <s> first the world recession which affects everybody as well as ourselves <e> <s> secondly the long-term declining trend in productivity in this country and thirdly the failure of wage bargainers to respond to the tighter monetary conditions <e> <s> i have repeatedly made clear in speeches in your lordships house that the effects of excessive wage settlements will be a loss of output and a loss of jobs <e>", "<cs> yes my lords

level of productivity and that means the removing of restrictive practices and excessive manning levels <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we need to improve the effective use of capital equipment and

supplementary question the vital thing is to reduce and ultimately to eliminate inflation and that is the only way in which we and other countries will succeed in resuming a path of growth <e>", "<cs>

supplementary question the question of a tax on the banks windfall profits was dealt with in the budget speech of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer on th march and i have nothing to add to what he said on that occasion other than that with the fall in mlr and we hope the progressive reduction in interest rates this will reduce the level of windfall profits accruing to

appropriate level <e>", "<cs> my lords i said quite clearly and specifically that the measures that it was essential to take to reduce and eliminate inflation had a transitional cost and those measures include the present level of interest rates <e> <s> but the burden imposed on industry by interest rates is only a fraction of the burden imposed upon industry by excessive wage settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend draws attention to a point of great importance <e> <s> many of the nationalised industries are not subject to the same pressures of the market place as are industries in the private sector and too often this has meant that their costs have increased and their prices have increased to a far greater extent than has occurred in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord is suggesting that the government should intervene in the conduct of the nationalised industries <e> <s> that is not our policy <e> <s> we believe that the nationalised industries ought to be conducted efficiently and well and it should be possible indeed there is a very heavy duty resting upon them greatly to moderate the level of their price increases <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal in what the noble lord says <e> <s> many of the nationalised industries are in a monopoly position and as with all monopolies this enables them to pass on excessive cost increases and excessive price increases <e> <s> it is the governments policy to reduce the monopoly of the nationalised industries wherever this can sensibly be done where the monopoly continues it has been the governments policy to refer some of these monopolies to the monopolies and mergers commission for a report <e>", "<cs> my lords the present question relates to the prices charged by the nationalised industries <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord is trying to suggest that the high level of these price increases is due to the loss of the two chairmen in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not go quite as far as my noble friend suggests but where they can sensibly be privatised we are following that policy <e> <s> but there may always be a residual core of industries which remain in the public sector and we believe that it is in the interests of everybody not least in the interests of the nationalised industries themselves that they should be conducted efficiently that they should restrain their cost increases and that they should keep their price increases down to more reasonable levels <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to gas prices the noble lord is not entirely on a good point <e> <s> for the period covered by the question and the reply gas prices rose by just over per cent <e> <s> which is substantially less than the increase in

durables have risen by about per cent <e> <s> the position is that shop prices generally have risen substantially less than the rpi <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not true <e> <s> there are of course some price increases which are due to factors outside the control of the individual nationalised industry <e> <s> this is particularly true in the case of energy prices <e> <s> but far too often the

advance in accounting methods <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by my noble friend is a very valid one <e> <s> inward investment of this kind is of great value to the united kingdom economy both for the jobs it creates and for the new skills and new products it brings into the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the rising trend of investment in the united kingdom has created additional employment in the united kingdom <e> <s> the level of unemployment would have been higher but for this inward investment <e> <s> it is a matter of considerable significance that during the s the

opportunities and it is those profitable investment opportunities that we need to create <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is directed to the inward investment in the united kingdom <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes figures for outward investment which is the reverse of inward investment perhaps he would table a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think with respect to my noble friend it is valid to make the point that inward investment from japan is of a very small order indeed <e> <s> in fact million over the period to does not represent any very significant inflow <e>", "<cs> my lords

terms <e> <s> so far as the first supplementary question of the noble lord is concerned he is assuming that outward investment is to the detriment of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is nothing of the sort it is of value to the united kingdom in many directions not the least because outward investment often provides exports from the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i am glad to have his support that outward as well as inward investment is of great value to the united kingdom <e> <s> so far as the figures are concerned i have made the point in reply to his noble friend that the question relates to inward investment in the united kingdom <e> <s> if he wishes the figures for outward investment perhaps he would table a question <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i have given relate to direct investment in british industry in the form of buildings plant machinery and working capital <e> <s> that is

this country is approximately per tonne <e> <s> that is one of the highest but not the highest in europe <e> <s> it represents less than per cent on the price of the oil and in relation to the costs

his budget and i obviously cannot anticipate what decisions he might take in that connection <e> <s> i can however assure the noble lord that what he says will be duly noted <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not necessarily follow that if a tax is reduced the whole of the reduction in taxation appears in profits and that therefore contributes to corporation tax <e> <s> a reduction in indirect taxation often results in a reduction in price and indeed the object in mind when people suggest that the fuel oil duty should be reduced is to reduce the price of the product and therefore to make the product more competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords my reply indicates no more than that in accordance with long-standing tradition ministers do not anticipate any decisions by the chancellor on budgetary matters <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that any representations which have been made and any comments made in your lordships house will be brought to the attention of my right

wage claims in excess of increases in productivity and it comes from excessive government expenditure <e> <s> it is these excessive demands and their accommodation by an increase in the money supply

increase the price level and correspondingly if governments refuse to increase the money supply to accommodate excessive demands <e>", "<cs> may i just complete what i wish to say <e> <s> the noble lord spoke for minutes and i am endeavouring to answer him in about two <e> <s> that policy ended up with an exchange rate of dollar cents to the pound and had the imf not been called in to rescue the then administration i have no doubt that the pound would have disappeared from view altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord ought to read his own speech and he will find that the clear implication of it was that the pound should be reduced in value to meet a loss of competitiveness <e> <s> that is precisely the policy which was followed by the government of which he was so distinguished a representative <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly entitled to place whatever interpretation he wishes upon his own words <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to accept the interpretation that he places upon them <e> <s> it is a great pity that he did not make that clear in his original speech and the inference to be drawn from his words was absolutely clear <e> <s> the

of it by saying that the board themselves are very concerned indeed with the situation that has been revealed <e> <s> it was revealed as a result of a special study initiated by the board themselves <e> <s> they are now taking vigorous action to deal with the matter and this action will be followed up <e>", "<cs> my lords where errors are discovered they are corrected if they fall outside the tolerances which are normally applied <e> <s> the position is that where a person has underpaid his paye by a figure which was in the period in question but which has now been increased to it is not the normal practice to make an assessment <e> <s> correspondingly if the over-payment was less than it was not customary to make an assessment and repay the money unless the taxpayer asked for this to be done <e> <s> where errors are found the normal procedures are followed but the obvious objective is to ensure that the number of errors made is reduced to an absolute minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different question <e> <s> i believe that it is the experience that errors tend to be made under a computerised system as well as under a manual system and many of us can pay

lord makes i do not think that a charge of inconsistency really lies <e> <s> there are problems with the extension of selective reliefs <e> <s> this is why last year my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer gave very substantially improved conditions for charitable giving <e> <s> the period for deeds of covenant was reduced from seven years to four years and for donations up to a year relief is now available against the higher rates of tax <e> <s> the object of this was to enable people to give increased donations to the charities in which they were particularly interested and i hope very much that the charities will take advantage of these improved conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> at this time of the year representations are received from a wide range of bodies and organisations <e> <s> all of these are given the most careful consideration by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and i can assure the noble lord that what he says will be considered very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> nevertheless the tradition is that the budget is presented by the chancellor of the exchequer and not by anybody else <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> i can go no further than to say that the comments that he makes will certainly be considered <e>", "<cs> no my lords no u-turn is involved here <e> <s> if i may quote the speech that i delivered in your lordships house a year ago what i then said was this <e>", "<cs> my lords the excess growth both in the money supply and in the public sector borrowing requirement are matters of real concern <e> <s> this is why my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced on th november a series of measures both to reduce the level of public expenditure and to increase revenue <e> <s> so far as the rate of inflation is concerned i would draw the noble lords attention to the fact that after reaching a peak of per cent <e> <s> it has come down every month since then and has now been reduced to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is assuming an instantaneous connection between changes in the money supply and changes in the rate of inflation <e> <s> this is a matter which i have also dealt with at length in debates in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> in looking at the money supply the government pay attention not only to m in terms of which the targets are announced but also to other measures of the monetary aggregates <e> <s> so far as the rate of inflation is concerned it has come down very markedly and will continue to come down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am equally grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> on th november the government took vigorous measures and they will continue to take measures to ensure that on both fronts we keep within the desired range <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will find my own views on this matter which coincide with those of the government set out in detail in a number of speeches that i have delivered <e>", "<cs> my lords the two factors are not connected in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot of things are not connected and the unfortunate fact is that excessive wage increases lead to unemployment as people price themselves out of jobs <e> <s> the present level of unemployment is due partly to the world recession it is also due to the exceptionally high level of wage settlements last year <e> <s> therefore it is a matter of particular encouragement that the figures released this morning show a sharp reduction in the rate of increase of earnings <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is always very rightly greatly concerned about the rate of interest <e> <s> we share his concern <e> <s> there have been two reductions in the minimum lending rate and we look forward to further reductions as the economic conditions improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite certain that the noble lord is a great expert on gurus in the economic field and elsewhere <e> <s> we always pay great attention to views expressed by distinguished people in the academic field but it does not follow that we necessarily slavishly follow them in every respect <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with that proposition <e> <s> it is of course true that in a period of recession expenditure tends to rise and revenue tends to fall with the result that one has an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement over the desired long-term trend <e> <s> that is precisely what has happened in the last few months <e>", "<cs> no my lords we do not adhere to a mechanistic view that there is a precise two-year time lag between changes in the money supply and changes in the rate of inflation <e> <s> that again i have made clear in a number of speeches that i have delivered i would suggest that the noble lord should read them again <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not so <e> <s> the government are already succeeding in improving the underlying state of the economy and as time goes by we shall put the economy on a sound footing which has not been so for many years past <e>", "<cs> i very carefully referred to contracted-out benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course aware of the anxieties to which my noble friend refers <e> <s> nevertheless the position is as he indicates that the flow of funds into the building societies has been at a record level and is continuing <e> <s> this indicates that the building societies have met the situation successfully and they are to be congratulated on so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he says <e> <s> i think that the easing of taxation would be to everybodys benefit but so far as the vat threshold is concerned there was a very substantial increase last year from to and any further increase is a matter for my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lord my noble friend raises a number of points <e> <s> first of all the simple fact is that when the threshold was increased substantially last year some per cent <e> <s> of the businesses which were entitled to be deregistered did not do so <e> <s> we are of course anxious to reduce the burden of administration wherever that can be done but the collection of tax at the source and the collection of vat is an example of this has existed in the tax system of this country and indeed of almost every other country for a very long period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a perfectly true and valid point <e> <s> indeed very large sums of money are provided as working capital for business through the machinery which is adopted for the collection of vat <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a considerable growth potential in small businesses and we are anxious to give it every possible encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords the point raised by the noble baroness is one that has been raised on a number of occasions <e> <s> i very much doubt whether an increase in the registration limit would have any very significant effect on the size of the black economy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that a very large proportion of the total vat comes from a relatively small number of firms but that has no very direct bearing on the level of the threshold <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be most happy to convey my noble friends views to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion which has been tabled by the noble lord lord banks and which is the subject of our debate calls attention to the document recently published by mr david steel setting out his -point programme <e> <s> i have no intention of intervening in the bitter dispute which has broken out between the labour party and the liberal party <e> <s> the spectacle of the two former brothers i think that brothers is the correct labour party phrase for somebody you bitterly disagree with of the lib-lab pact falling out in public in this way is a most unedifying one <e> <s> however having tabled the motion the liberal party is entitled to have its policy debated and it is to that that i propose to direct my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord accused me of being asleep but he was making accusations about the present government which i shall refute in detail in a few minutes time <e> <s> the accusations were <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seems to be unaware of the fact that that system broke down and it is a situation which has been created by the final collapse of the bretton woods system which is one of the major problems that we have to face <e> <s> there is very little point in going back to the early years of the th century and debating what happened then <e> <s> we have to live in the s and solve the problems of the s <e> <s> the governments efforts are directed towards this <e>", "<cs> my lords if i might have the permission of your lordships to speak for a second time i shall endeavour to do so very briefly and i hope largely uncontroversially <e> <s> may i start by saying that i particularly enjoyed the speech of the noble lord lord hankey with most of which i agreed the speech of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie with most of which i disagreed and the speech of my noble friend lord boardman who analysed the document produced by mr david steel with great care and in great depth <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that the noble baroness would doubtless seek to tailor the form of <e>", "<cs> just a moment my lords <e> <s> that is perfectly valid <e> <s> just as we stand in favour of the present system of first past the post it is perfectly valid and honourable for the liberal party to stand for a form of proportional representation which will result in a very limited number of minor parties <e> <s> i imagine that one of the limited number of parties that the noble baroness would hope to see represented would be the liberal party <e> <s> i cannot see anything objectionable in that <e> <s> it leads to this kind of proliferation <e> <s> it leads to political bargaining <e> <s> i do not accept that the results of some of these coalitions that we see in countries where they have proportional representation are representative of the views of the people of those countries as a whole <e> <s> the big danger is that you end up in a situation where in fact instead of having a clear-cut policy you have fudging and compromise and a failure to tackle important issues that must be tackled <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now getting on to an entirely different point <e> <s> the conservative party has always been very free in discussing its policy <e> <s> it does not suffer as do certain other parties from a <e>", "<cs> my lords although i can understand my noble friends feelings on this matter i fear that i cannot agree with what he says <e> <s> the law has been in the present form for very many years and section of the income and corporation taxes act which is simply a consolidation measure says <e>", "<cs> no my lords this is not so <e> <s> i do not think that it came as a surprise either to the inland revenue or to anyone else that gratuities were paid to club servants at christmas time <e> <s> if these gratuities were not brought under the paye system there was an obligation on the employees concerned to include them in their annual income tax returns <e> <s> i am assured that no change in practice has taken place in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the position there is quite clear <e> <s> tips of that nature are liable to income tax and it is the practice of the inland revenue to endeavour to ensure that tax is paid upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise as my noble friend says that the value of the luncheon voucher exempted from tax has not changed for many years <e> <s> nevertheless there is nothing to prevent an employer giving luncheon vouchers to a higher value than p indeed last year no fewer than per cent <e> <s> of all vouchers issued were for more than that sum <e> <s> if a voucher is issued for more than p the first p still remains exempted from tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> i had some difficulty with the word <e> <s> according to the <e>", "<cs> my lords while i note my noble friends suggestion the exemption of the p does not itself involve any great administrative burden <e> <s> indeed the problem comes where one has to bring benefits of this kind into the tax net <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i would not accept any of the assumptions made by the noble lord in the series of supplementary questions that he has asked <e> <s> first as was explained in the article in the <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree <e> <s> it was specifically stated in the article that the calculation referred to direct costs only <e> <s> once one tries to include indirect costs one is in the field of examining the reasons for the particular rise in unemployment <e> <s> if i may give the noble lord an example to the extent that a rise in unemployment is due to an excessive level of wage settlements the tax the government recoup on those excessive settlements is greater than the amount of tax that they lose as a result of the consequent unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord destroys his own argument <e> <s> the reason for referring any matter to the monopolies commission is because of the existence of a monopoly <e> <s> he is now claiming that there are all sorts of other people offering alternative policies <e> <s> the fact that those alternative policies are uniformly wrong does not provide a case for reference to the monopolies commission <e>", "<cs> no my lords obviously i do not accept that view <e> <s> this is a very serious matter and i am sorry that the noble lord should seek to deal with it in a flippant manner <e> <s> there is nothing flippant about this <e> <s> the government have devoted and will continue to devote all their efforts to securing a solution of our present economic difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the solution to our present problems must come through a revival of the private sector and the efforts of her majestys government are directed to that end <e>", "<cs> no my lords i disagree with both supplementary questions <e> <s> the figure of million is a marginal cost for a specific change in the level of unemployment <e> <s> as i have said before you simply cannot multiply these figures together and argue that this is the total cost of unemployment of a very much greater order of magnitude <e> <s> there are so many other variables which come into this figure <e> <s> so far as the second supplementary question is concerned i think that it is universally agreed that there is very considerable scope for improvement in the level of efficiency of the nationalised industries <e> <s> i have made it clear on a number of occasions i did so in the last speech i delivered in your lordships house that we are very anxious to see an improvement in that level of efficiency <e> <s> we have been prepared to put a great deal of money in in the hope of securing that improvement in the level of efficiency and i think that it is legitimate to draw attention to this fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate what my noble friend says and i agree with him that the merits of this case should await the decision of the higher courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the assurance that he gives <e> <s> he has of course campaigned tirelessly on this subject for years and i am sure that he must understandably be disappointed at how little progress he has made <e> <s> the tide of both opinion and policy has continued to flow against him throughout this period <e> <s> so far as international trade is concerned one of the problems of the old gold standard was that it did not provide sufficient liquidity <e> <s> steps have been taken in recent years to expand international liquidity for example by the creation of sdrs <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance and i appreciate the point that he makes <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have policies to deal with all the problems with which we are faced <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as europe is concerned the noble lord will be fully aware of course of the european monetary system and this is a matter that her majestys government keep under constant review <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord agrees with the policies of her majestys government <e> <s> so far as the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned of course it ranges over a very wide field <e> <s> it is important to maintain the value of money and to ensure that money does remain honest money and neither inflation nor deflation represent acceptable policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> of course it opens up a very wide field of discourse <e> <s> the breakdown of the bretton woods system was in many ways the cause of many of the problems that we face <e> <s> there are great difficulties in re-establishing an acceptable and workable international monetary system but it is an objective which we all have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend that is quite a different question <e> <s> the banking act which was discussed at length in your lordships house provides for the setting up of a statutory scheme for the protection of banking deposits <e> <s> it is generally agreed that there should be a scheme in respect of building society deposits <e> <s> we very much hoped that it would be possible to secure voluntary agreement to this <e> <s> it has not been possible and therefore we have noted the position for statutory action in due course <e> <s> meantime the building societies association has adopted a resolution for the protection of depositors the general effect of which i summarised in the latter part of my reply to my noble friends original question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to assure my noble friend that in recent years no member of the public depositing money with a building society has in fact suffered any loss as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord in fact the record of the building society movement in this particular field has been admirable and when difficulties have arisen the movement as a whole has been able to deal with them on a very satisfactory basis <e> <s> the resolution that it has passed indicates that that position will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any of us disagrees with the general drift of my noble friends supplementary question <e> <s> it is very important that depositors whether with banks or building societies should be adequately protected <e> <s> in the case of banks appropriate provisions were included in the banking act and in view of present developments we have noted the position in relation to building societies in order to deal with it when building society legislation is next introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend says about pay and conditions in the civil service <e> <s> in looking at these matters it is only right to bear in mind that in the last two years pay in the civil service has increased by approximately per cent <e> <s> against that background the present offer of per cent <e> <s> is in fact a very fair one <e> <s> so far as the second part of my noble friends supplementary question is concerned i think that we all deplore inconvenience inflicted on the public and we hope that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think all i can say is that i will certainly consider the remarks made by the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that what he has said is not unassociated with a question that was asked recently in your lordships house to which a reply was given by my noble friend the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not agree with the implications contained in the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> all employers whether in the public sector or the private sector need to pay full regard to their ability to pay in the present difficult circumstances and it is only right that the government should draw attention to that fact and should pay regard to it in negotiations with their own employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i was totally unaware that i had made any strictures in regard to anybody <e> <s> in fact i took very great care not to do so and i hope that the noble lord will join me in taking that approach to this difficult problem <e> <s> so far as the present pay negotiations are concerned they relate of course to the non-industrial civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> what is important is the extent to which the vehicles are used and the quantity of petrol that they burn because this is what determines the amount of tax which is paid <e> <s> whether or not there is public transport there is very extensive use of private motor-cars by people commuting into the large towns <e> <s> in fact in many ways the people who probably cover the highest mileage of all are those who live in the country and work in the towns <e> <s> there are one or two misconceptions on this that i should like to clear up <e> <s> the first one is this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all aware of the problems that widows face <e> <s> last year my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer introduced a new allowance in the year of bereavement <e> <s> where there are young children in the family the widow receives the equivalent of the full married allowance and of course when she reaches the age of she receives the age allowance which is higher than the standard single allowance <e> <s> so far as the comparison with working wives is concerned they both pay the same amount of tax on the same total income <e>", "<cs> if i may say so my lords that goes rather outside the scope of the present question <e> <s> the position however is that in present circumstances a tax credit scheme would cost a very large sum of money indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the fact that there is a wide divergence of view on this and indeed on other subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords a widow who receives the basic widows pension only and has no other income will not in fact be charged to tax <e> <s> this is because of the assessing tolerances operated by the inland revenue <e> <s> they do not make an assessment if the amount of tax at stake is less than and this in fact covers the amount by which the basic pension exceeds the existing level of personal allowance <e> <s> of course if there is income over and above the basic pension that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the position was spelt out very clearly in the debates in another place and i think it is in fact in order to refer to speeches made by ministers in another place because they represent declarations of government policy or views <e> <s> i think that what i said myself was in fact perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of earnings-related pension is of course a different matter <e> <s> if a widow receives a earnings-related supplement over and above the basic pension she is in no different position from that of a widow who has income over and above the basic pension <e> <s> the amount by which the assessing tolerance exceeds the difference between the basic pension and the single allowance is i believe about <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of assessing tolerances was explained in great detail by mr denis healey when he was chancellor of the exchequer in when this particular problem arose it is not therefore a new assessment <e> <s> but i note what the noble baroness says and we will certainly ensure that the position is understood in local tax offices <e>", "<cs> my lords the government keep all these matters under regular review <e> <s> i would not like to hold out any particular hope to the noble lady <e> <s> there are a large number of groups who are disadvantaged and on whose behalf representations are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to all of the noble lords questions is no <e> <s> my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer announced that the per cent <e> <s> terminal bonus would be available on the second index-linked national savings certificates <e> <s> so far as the other matters are concerned i point out that the national savings certificates have certain advantages which are not available to the index-linked bonds and the index-linked bonds have certain advantages not available to the national savings certificates <e> <s> all in all the two types of security are tailored to the requirements of the particular market <e> <s> in the case of savings certificates in particular the national savings department offers a range of securities from among which the saver can choose <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> the government are committed to reducing the level of inflation on a permanent basis <e> <s> the problems that my noble friend envisages will not therefore arise <e> <s> i do not think that there is any true comparison between conditions in this country and conditions in brazil <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very greatly encouraged by the remarks of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments expenditure plans set out in cmnd <e> <s> cover the next three financial years <e> <s> the debt interest figures are total payments and figures for payments on individual stocks are not separately identified <e> <s> the stock is not redeemable until except under special circumstances outlined in the prospectus <e> <s> the question of capital repayments does not therefore arise <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> so long as a government are prepared to follow policies which will bring down the rate of inflation there is no time bomb here at all <e> <s> in the case of an index-linked bond the liability is in fact fixed in real terms <e> <s> what is not fixed is the amount of the liability in terms of money of the day <e> <s> in the case of conventional securities the cost is fixed in terms of money of the day but it is not fixed in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to give further thought to this matter he will perceive that a bond yielding per cent <e> <s> indexed is likely to prove cheaper in the long run than a conventional bond bearing a high rate of interest provided that the government concerned follow the policy that the present government are following of reducing the rate of inflation <e> <s> i am prepared to accept that under a different administration the situation might be very different but that is something from which we would all wish to be preserved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends point <e> <s> nevertheless the issue of this bond underlines the determination of the government to press their policies for the reduction of inflation through to a successful conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments record in this matter is in fact a good one and not a poor one <e> <s> the rate of inflation has been brought down sharply and is continuing to fall and in the medium-term will fall further <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is trying to read more into this matter than the issue of one single indexed bond justifies <e> <s> if he will turn however to the medium-term financial strategy which is set out in the budget red book he will see set out there the plans of the present government to bring the rate of inflation progressively down in the medium-term <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness seems to be unaware of the facts <e> <s> the rate of inflation has fallen sharply as the economy recovers as it will do the rate of unemployment in due course will come down too <e> <s> one of the more important factors here is to ensure that wage settlements are within a level that industry can sustain <e>", "<cs> my lords i would very much look forward to having a conservative government until but i would hope that the good example that we have set would lead any successor government in fact to follow the same policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> the issue has been greatly welcomed by the institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords the position as i have explained in your lordships house on many occasions is that at the time of the general election the underlying rate of inflation measured on a six-month basis was per cent <e> <s> and rising <e> <s> the rate of inflation is now below that level and falling <e>", "<cs> my lords a full analysis of the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and of the way that that capital expenditure has been financed appears in tables to inclusive in the white paper on public expenditure <e> <s> therefore it is possible from these tables to deduce whether money which has been allocated for capital expenditure has been used for that purpose or has been used to make good a shortfall in profits or an increase in losses <e> <s> i entirely agree with the point of substance made by my noble friend namely that it is quite wrong and in fact damaging to the economy generally if money which has been allocated for capital expenditure is in fact used for revenue purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the government have always given their support and indeed encouragement to the adoption by the nationalised industries of the highest standards of accounting <e> <s> consultations on these matters proceed on a regular basis <e> <s> the government have in particular given great encouragement to the adoption of current cost accounting and the publication of the new accounting standard ssap should result in an improvement in the level of current cost accounting for the nationalised industries as elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his support and i agree with many of the comments that he makes <e> <s> one of the points that is commonly overlooked in the present debate is that the capital expenditure on fixed assets planned by the nationalised industries in each of the next three years that is the current year plus the two following years is expected to be billion compared with billion in each of the last three years <e> <s> this is at constant prices survey prices <e> <s> we are therefore expecting a substantial increase in the level of expenditure by the nationalised industries on capital development compared with the position that existed in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously highly desirable that such a result should be achieved and it is the governments intention to use their best efforts and influence to ensure that it is achieved <e> <s> but it would not be possible to give a guarantee of the sort for which my noble friend asks <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the point that my noble friend makes and it is always a matter of regret when rising costs result in money which was intended to provide for investment being diverted to other purposes <e> <s> perhaps i might draw his attention however to what was said by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry when announcing the increase of million in british telecoms external financial limit <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the views expressed by the noble lord or quoted by him <e> <s> if he would care to refer to the actual figures for last year he would find that investment undertaken by the nationalised industries fell short of the original planned figures by no less than million despite the fact that external financing limits had been increased by million over the figure originally provided <e> <s> the reason for this was that the losses of the nationalised industries increased or their operating surpluses fell by no less than million <e> <s> the best way that the nationalised industries can provide additional funds for investment is to control their costs reduce excessive manning levels and improve their efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essential from the point of view of energy policy that gas prices should be realistic and the government are doing no more than that <e> <s> the very large apparent profits of british gas are really a rental from north sea equivalent to the kind of rental enjoyed by the oil companies operating in the north sea which is skimmed off by the petroleum revenue tax a tax which no doubt the noble lord supports <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a fundamental difference between british telecommunications and british rail <e> <s> british telecommunications are making a profit british rail are making a huge loss <e> <s> the loss which is estimated for the current year in fact amounts to well over million the figure is million which shows an increase compared with the last years loss of million <e> <s> the very large investment programme to which reference has been made in the press so far as british rail is concerned is primarily intended to enable them to continue to operate at a loss although at a smaller loss than they have hitherto achieved <e> <s> whether that is the right way to use scarce natural resources is a debatable question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord as i always am for his wholehearted support for the principle of privatisation which we propose pursuing as vigorously as we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear i cannot comment on the specific case raised by my noble friend <e> <s> i agree with him in his general proposition the most fruitful source of additional revenue for capital development lies in the nationalised industries improving their performance <e> <s> a reduction of per cent <e> <s> in their operating costs would make another million available for investment <e>", "<cs> the rise in unemployment is not primarily due to the governments policies my lords but is the result of three factors <e> <s> the first is the long-term problems of the british economy which were greatly exacerbated during the period of office of the previous government <e> <s> the second is the world recession <e> <s> the third is the very large rise in levels of pay in <e> <s> as for the general point which the noble baroness raises i would remind her that the money provided for capital development by the nationalised industries in the coming year will <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all anxious to see lower rates of interest <e> <s> but i do not think that the american administration would accept the noble lords description of american interest rates as being either arbitrary or excessive <e> <s> he will be interested to know as i hope he does that in the last few weeks rates of interest in the united states have already begun to fall <e> <s> in terms of the long-term health of the international community the overriding requirement is to reduce the rates of inflation <e> <s> this does from time to time entail maintaining interest rates which are higher than any of us would like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all certain that the noble lord was asking a question as much as making a long statement of policy <e> <s> of course in principle we all agree with international collaboration <e> <s> i am sure that all countries pay regard to the effect of their policies on other people <e> <s> but it would be quite wrong to regard the weakness of some of the european currencies at present as being primarily the result of funds being siphoned off to the united states as a result of the high rates of interest prevailing there <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is looking for a very brief reply to his question the answer is that the government recognise the overriding need for reducing rates of inflation worldwide <e> <s> this means from time to time that rates of interest are seen which are higher than one would normally like to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i in fact specifically answered the noble lord when i said in my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble viscount does me less than justice <e> <s> in the first major speech which i made in your lordships house after we came into office i said <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not agree with the noble lords approach to this matter <e> <s> the ends that he seeks to achieve of course are the ends which are shared i think by all of us <e> <s> however experience shows that a formalised incomes policy unfortunately does not produce the results that he expects of it <e> <s> we regard the responsibility as falling on the respective employers and the representatives of the workforce <e> <s> in our own field so far as the public services are concerned we are in fact taking a firm line on this and <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret to say that the noble lord also does me less than justice because if he reads one of my earliest speeches he will find quotations in it from mr gladstones speeches <e> <s> so far as the question on the order paper is concerned i have of course no responsibility for the terms in which it is phrased <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i need detain the house on this or whether the house would appreciate my detaining it but what mr harold wilson as he then was said in a speech to the durham miners gala a function of course with which the noble lord lord shinwell has been associated in a very distinguished way on th july was as follows <e>", "<cs> not in the least my lords i frequently read my own speeches to my own great benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords as a statistical matter it is perfectly possible to distinguish how much of an increase in money wages represents a real increase in income and how much represents merely an inflationary increase <e> <s> it is a simple matter of statistical arithmetic <e>", "<cs> no my lords the world has moved on a great deal in the years since <e> <s> repeated attempts in the last years to spend our way out of recession have merely resulted in higher levels of inflation and higher levels of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> while lessons can and ought to be drawn from history one thing we always need to remember is that circumstances today may be and indeed are very different from what they were half a century ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble baroness that one of the most important things to do is to break inflationary expectations <e> <s> a number of major speeches have been made by my honourable and right honourable friends in another place and have been designed to try to displace many of the inflationary expectations which unfortunately have grown up over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely reject both the allegations and the arguments of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the function of interest rates is to bring the demand for money into line with the supply <e> <s> increases in wages unmatched by increases in productivity reduce the demand for labour and hence create unemployment <e> <s> if this is what the noble lord means i would agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is perfectly true and we have made no secret of it that the control of the money supply is a difficult exercise <e> <s> nevertheless it is essential that we continue to direct our best efforts to doing this and it is what we are doing <e> <s> the statement that the noble lord made about inflation being due to too much money chasing too few goods is a popular truism in the sense that the more money there is and the fewer goods the higher prices will be <e> <s> but the natural consequence of that argument is to point towards reducing or controlling the money supply which is exactly and precisely what the governments policies are directed to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the reduction in the level of output is due to the slowness of the economy in responding to the economic measures taken <e> <s> the biggest problem here has been the persistence of a high level of wage settlements way beyond what the economy could afford <e> <s> this has produced severe <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed suffering from the problem of people demanding too high money incomes for the goods that they produce <e> <s> it is this which ultimately leads to inflation <e> <s> the main cause of the demand for too much money lies in the level of wage settlements <e> <s> fortunately this level is coming down <e> <s> the present level of settlements is about half what it was last year and we must look forward to a continued reduction which will be followed in due time by a fall in the rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the price of oil and there have been two great oil price explosions one in and a further one in did in fact spark off very severe inflation throughout the whole of the industrialised world <e> <s> some countries however coped with this situation much better than did others <e> <s> the german economy for example by following strict financial policies succeeded in keeping their rate of inflation much lower than we kept it in this country which was due to a failure to follow adequately firm financial and monetary policies <e>", "<cs> my lords the rates of interest have fallen from per cent <e> <s> last summer to per cent <e> <s> now <e> <s> that is a very considerable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised two points <e> <s> the provision in fact is to be found in the finance act and not in the finance bill at present before another place <e> <s> secondly the exemption is set out at length in the schedule to which i have referred and it applies to a wide range of bodies which satisfy the stated condition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the noble lord that it is no such thing <e> <s> as regards the united kingdom the provision is to be found in the finance act while the sixth directive was not passed until <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to write to my noble friend about that particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a most intricate point relating to eec legislation <e> <s> broadly the position is that in case of a directive as opposed to a regulation member states are expected to ensure that their own legislation is in line with the directive <e> <s> that is why i stated specifically in reply to my noble friend that the provisions of the finance act were in principle in line with the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an intricate matter which relates to the question of whether the arrangements in question are primarily for educational purposes or whether they are primarily for holiday purposes <e> <s> perhaps i might write to the noble lord about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in the noble lords views on matters of medicine but so far as the substance of his question is concerned contrary to what he implies there are already favourable indications that market forces are effective in the private sector <e> <s> the level of pay settlements in the present pay round is running at less than one-half of what it was in the previous pay round and we look forward to further reductions in the coming pay round <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the fact that the party to which the noble viscount now owes his allegiance are advocates of an incomes policy <e> <s> this is no doubt the issue to which his question is really directed <e> <s> however the noble viscount needs to ask himself two questions <e> <s> first why does he assume that he will be successful in applying an incomes policy when every other party over the last years has failed to do so <e> <s> secondly why does he assume that the trade unions will co-operate with him in such a policy when they have refused to co-operate with other parties and have publicly said so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the article to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i am also aware of the views of professor james meade <e> <s> his proposals however suffer from the defect that all incomes policies suffer from namely the virtual impossibility of enforcing them <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the governments criterion is the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not accept the noble lords view that a total freeze is a possibility <e> <s> we believe that realism is coming back into pay bargaining <e> <s> we believe that the present policy will permit a degree of flexibility that is not possible under a pay policy <e> <s> we believe also that our present policy will avoid the kind of trauma that are associated with the break-up of an incomes policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with either part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> the government do not operate an incomes policy <e> <s> secondly as we have made clear on many an occasion the real cause of the present level of unemployment which is a tragedy of course for the people concerned and a great waste of national resources something which cannot possibly be denied is the growing uncompetitiveness of british industry over a long period of time a situation which has been much exacerbated by the present world recession <e>", "<cs> my lords the present government are widely supported in the country <e> <s> they secured a large majority in and they will secure a large majority when the next general election comes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by saying how grateful i am to my noble friends lord selkirk and lord bessborough and to the noble lords lord houghton of sowerby and lord bruce of donington for the very warm tributes they have paid to mr keith brading <e> <s> on a purely personal note perhaps i may say that i entered the estate duty office in almost exactly the same year as he did <e> <s> i can in fact claim one year of seniority over him and it will give me particular pleasure therefore to pass on these good wishes to him <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that i have not yet sat down may i say that i would think that it is not appropriate to discuss in your lordships house the grading of a specific post in her majestys civil service <e> <s> nevertheless i shall certainly bring to the attention of my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer the comments that have been made on both sides of the house <e> <s> perhaps i may also make it clear that there is no question of the post being down-graded at this present moment <e> <s> the change in the grading of the post took place a good many years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the finance bill gives legislative effect to the governments proposals in the tax field <e> <s> taxation is of course only one part of fiscal policy <e> <s> the other part is public expenditure <e> <s> it is the balance between taxation and expenditure which determines whether the government are following a strict fiscal policy or a lax fiscal policy <e> <s> the difference between the money the government receive in taxes and other revenues and the amount they spend on services benefits grants and subsidies they have to borrow <e> <s> it is the amount they borrow the public sector borrowing requirement which is the measure of the strictness or laxity of their fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> i understand that the noble lord has put his name down to speak so perhaps he would reserve his remarks for that occasion when we can give them due attention <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter with which i have dealt on innumerable occasions <e> <s> at the time that we took office the rate of inflation was rising rapidly <e> <s> the big rise which occurred thereafter was very largely the responsibility of the economic muddle and distress that the labour government left behind them <e> <s> it was a major job to reverse the trends <e> <s> this we have now begun to do and the results of the reversal of policy are now being seen in significant improvements in a number of directions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is well aware of the figures <e> <s> the actual rate of inflation in may was just over per cent <e> <s> on an annual basis it was per cent <e> <s> on a -months basis annualised it was rising <e> <s> the rate of inflation is now down to just over per cent <e> <s> and it is falling <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can recognise the distinction between something that is falling and something that is rising <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not normally like to interrupt the noble lord but if he will excuse me he claimed that i had not mentioned the word investment <e> <s> i said we had provided more money not less for nationalised industries investment <e> <s> whether the noble lord feels that the nationalised industries are so undeserving that they ought not to be mentioned at all i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a wide-ranging debate perhaps rather more so than is customary <e> <s> the impassioned plea on behalf of brass bands by the noble lord lord noel-baker awakes an echo in my private heart but its connection with the finance bill seems at best to be somewhat tenuous <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington said at the start of his speech that what i had said represented an emphatic surrender to market forces <e> <s> those were of course emotive words and emotive phrases often conceal the shallowness of the thought underlying them <e> <s> i must ask what is wrong with market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i had not overlooked the point <e> <s> i was making the point that once the allowance is given to one group of people it then moves to another because people would then argue that if it was given to liverpool it ought to be given to manchester and then if it was given to manchester it ought to be given to birmingham <e> <s> this is what always happens <e> <s> if one is speaking in terms of very large sums of money i think it would be much fairer if the money were used to increase the tax threshold which is the noble baronesss other high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill he now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i had quite deliberately not commented on the speech of the noble lord <e> <s> lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> we have an industrial dispute which is still in progress <e> <s> we all very much hope that that dispute is now being brought to a conclusion <e> <s> it never helps in these circumstances for either side to make statements which are likely to exacerbate the situation <e> <s> we now in government hope very much that a conclusion will now be reached and i would prefer to leave it like that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question consisted of a statement namely that there was a record number of business failures followed by a conclusion that he drew from it <e> <s> if he would care to refer to the publication <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely disagree with the noble baroness <e> <s> it is not unusual for questions to contain statements of fact <e> <s> where those statements of fact are wrong or questionable i think it is only right that this should be pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords that is entirely correct which is why i refrained from following up the point made by the noble baroness about the question having been passed by the table <e> <s> it is not at all unusual for questions to contain statements of fact because the question presumably is based upon something

remarks of the noble baroness <e> <s> the noble lord apart from making a statement was asking for some information and i was endeavouring to draw his attention to the information that was available <e> <s> the information which is available does in fact indicate what i said <e> <s> i see nothing controversial about this i made no attack of any sort on the record of the labour government i could easily have done so <e> <s> all i did was to draw attention to the fact that in the last recession which like this one was sparked off by an oil price explosion we also had a rise followed in due time by a fall in the number of business failures <e> <s> this is a well known fact and i cannot see why it should be regarded as controversial <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> these are measures which have been taken by the government to assist the creation of new businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful to the noble lord for his assistance <e> <s> i do not think that from the dawn of history any economic policy or indeed any other policy has been an unqualified success <e> <s> all i claim is that we have done better than our predecessors a very modest claim <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult to give a straight answer to that question <e> <s> there are an enormous number of new businesses which have been created <e> <s> last year for example there were new companies registered compared with something like or which were liquidated <e> <s> but it would be quite wrong to pretend that we have entirely new enterprises compared with only or which have disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies are designed to provide a long-term solution to the problems which have been posed by the recession <e>", "<cs> my lords i would only say that we all greatly regret the number of business failures <e> <s> there is no dispute between the two sides of the house on that issue <e> <s> but i do not think that it is really helpful if one tries to exaggerate the size of the problem <e> <s> that is the only point that i have been trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords the present government are the friend of all the people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce raised a large number of points and i will take them in sequence <e> <s> he said the directive was made in and as he rightly said it provided a period of months for compliance <e> <s> however in article and there is provision for an extension of that period to five years <e> <s> mr denzil davies announced in another place in may that the implementation of the directive in relation to building societies would be deferred <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i require permission to speak again but if i do may i ask for it <e> <s> we are ourselves quite clear that the regulation is <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the comment made by the noble lord lord airedale is concerned of course the shorter the period that is allowed for the administrative arrangements to be made the greater the practical difficulties that arise <e> <s> i do not put it any higher than that <e> <s> the reason we set the st december as the date was that we felt it was not unreasonable to give people say the best part of six months in order to get their affairs in line with the requirements under the directive but in view of what the noble lord lord bruce of donington says i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords the scott report raised far-reaching and important issues which require very careful consideration <e> <s> in these circumstances i think that the time taken which is an indication of the depth of consideration which has been given is not unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this would be the right occasion on which to endeavour to debate the scott report <e> <s> on the civil service dispute that has now been settled and i think the important thing is to try to restore harmonious relations rather than indulge in discussion of the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i note what my noble friend says <e> <s> these particular issues were discussed at length in the scott report itself which is now the subject of the governments detailed consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords we are of course aware of various statements which were made and which are no doubt those that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> these are a matter of importance and full regard will be paid to them in consideration of this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as members of this house draw pensions they are covered by a different pension scheme from those which were the subject of the scott committee report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the point that the noble lord was trying to make but i fear that it lies outside the ambit of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the noble lord a full and comprehensive reply to the question that appeared on the order paper and i cited the evidence in support of what the chancellor had said <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord has not welcomed the news that i have just given to the house that manufacturing output increased by nearly per cent <e> <s> a not insignificant figure over the previous three months <e> <s> there are other factual items of evidence which support the view that progress is being made <e> <s> for example productivity has increased by per cent <e> <s> since last year the level of wage settlements is now down to single figures and the rise in manufacturing costs has now stabilised <e> <s> these are all welcome signs of progress being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i always read articles which appear in <e>", "<cs> the position in this house my lords is that the members of the party which support the government are solid in their support of the government <e> <s> the members of another place need to answer for their own views in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to notice that the noble lord disagrees fundamentally with his noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i hope however that they will resolve their differences in private <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question with respect is a classic example of what the logicians call <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the practice to publish revisions of budget estimates during the course of the financial year <e> <s> the overall effect on the revenue of the rise in petrol prices is not however likely to be significant one way or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords far from being uninformative despite the convention that it is not the practice to publish revised estimates i gave the noble lord a very clear indication of what the position was <e> <s> i said that the overall effect on the revenue is not likely to be significant one way or the other <e> <s> the position is that out of the approximately p a gallon tax on petrol at the present moment p or thereabouts is a specific duty which is not affected by any change in the price <e> <s> it is only the smaller proportion of approximately p vat which is affected by a rise in price <e> <s> at the same time an increase in price tends other things being equal to lead to a fall in consumption <e> <s> if there is a fall in consumption there is a loss of the specific duty as well as of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> speaking as somebody who has to spend a great deal of his time finding his way through the or more pages of the taxing statutes i have a very great deal of sympathy with his point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords we keep this matter under continual review <e> <s> in the last two budgets a whole series of measures have been introduced designed to encourage the flow of new capital into small enterprises <e> <s> this is an entirely new departure and one without parallel anywhere else in the industrial world <e> <s> we wish it well and will watch its progress with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the scheme itself which is without parallel elsewhere in the industrial world <e> <s> so far as putting flesh on the bare bones is concerned the simple truth of the matter is that the scheme has only just been embodied in legislation but the first claims by individuals investing under this scheme can be made only after april of next year <e> <s> it is only then that we shall be able to gauge how successful the scheme has been but it has made a good start <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be forgiven if i say with respect that i believe that possibly the noble lord may have in mind the loans guarantee scheme rather than the business start-up scheme <e> <s> the business start-up scheme is designed to encourage raising new equity capital and indeed there is a strong argument for saying that it is in the lack of equity capital that the weakness lies <e> <s> but the loans guarantee scheme has already made a very good start with more than loans having been already agreed amounting to approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the welcome given by the noble lord <e> <s> if i may i would make two comments on the specific points he raises <e> <s> first of all a large number of amendments were made on committee stage in another place which were designed to meet many of the criticisms which had been made with the result that the scheme as it finally emerged represented a noticeable improvement on the scheme as originally introduced <e> <s> secondly as my honourable friend mr john macgregor parliamentary under-secretary of state for industry announced on nd september a series of regional conferences and smaller conferences have been set up in order to explain the terms of the scheme to people who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords far from being out of step the position is that the united kingdom in common with most other industrialised countries believes that a firm monetary and fiscal policy is essential as a means of both dealing with inflation and in the longer term achieving lower rates of interest <e> <s> we do of course all regard the present level of interest rates as a matter of grave concern but we need to remember the reasons why those rates of interest exist <e> <s> most major countries including this country have very substantial budgetary deficits and it is the existence of those budgetary deficits and the large amount of borrowing that they entail which forced up interest rates to the present level <e> <s> if i may say so it was a very considerable achievement on the part of my right honourable and learned friend to have reduced the rate of interest at the time of the budget and to have kept it down over a period of a good many months <e>", "<cs> my lords it is i am afraid a fallacy to believe that high interest rates add to inflation <e> <s> they have precisely the reverse effect <e> <s> they represent one of the major weapons in getting inflation under control <e> <s> it is because of the burden of interest to which the noble lord rightly draws attention we are just as much concerned about it as he is that we need to follow not only a strict monetary policy but a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> interest rates of course are the result of the need to borrow large sums of money <e> <s> the need to borrow large sums of money flows from the size of the budget deficit and that is why it is important to do everything possible to bring the size of the budget deficit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the dilemma that the noble lord is trying to pose but i think we must recognise what an important burden interest rates are on the individual business as well as on the individual and our policies are directed to bring interest rates down when that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the present level of interest rates depends upon domestic as well as on international factors but it is quite impossible to separate the one from the other <e> <s> we could not in practice having regard to the very large proportion of our gross national product which comes from international trade live in isolation inside a ring fence <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be happy to read the speech of professor alan walters to which the noble lord refers and i have no doubt that professor walters would let the noble lord know his views on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course the position that in a period of inflation there is a considerable redistribution of income between different sectors in the economy <e> <s> these are sometimes redistributions which give rise to criticisms of the kind to which the noble lord refers but the answer to this is to eliminate inflation and the need for interest rates at this level <e> <s> it is not simply to complain about the results <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble baroness will forgive me if as a treasury minister i do not follow her into the wider issues of policy relating to northern ireland <e> <s> so far as the actual grant from the eec is concerned of course we very much appreciate the helpful attitude of all the organisations of the community towards this very difficult problem indeed <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state has made it very clear that if the grant is made available expenditure on housing in northern ireland will be higher than it could otherwise have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord could read into what i have said anything of the kind <e> <s> the total expenditure on housing in northern ireland this year is million <e> <s> the amount of the grant which is at present under consideration by the eec amounts to million units of account equal to approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has already had ample opportunity to make those points <e> <s> so far as the first one is concerned the rate of inflation was rising rapidly in and the big increase which occurred subsequently was largely due to the policies that had been followed by the labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords the government in their turn will provide the leadership the country needs to refashion its economy rebuild its finances and enable <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption a rather extended one that i have not yet sat down i shall he answering further matters when i come to speak to the amendment later in the day <e>", "<cs> my lords the contempt for the electorate expressed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington in the course of his speech no doubt reflects the contempt that the electorate will express for lord bruce and his party when the time comes <e> <s> we have had two distinguished maiden speeches from the noble lord lord mcfadzean of kelvinside and the noble lord lord marsh and i most sincerely congratulate them both <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcfadzean has immense industrial experience <e> <s> indeed there are few branches of industry with which he has not been associated <e> <s> he was a most distinguished chairman of british airways <e> <s> he speaks with great authority on industrial matters <e> <s> the noble lord lord marsh has great breadth of experience spanning politics and industry in both the public and the private sectors <e> <s> he is able to speak from direct personal experience of the problems that he discusses and this is a factor that your lordships always appreciate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is no doubt a great expert on these matters and we shall have an opportunity to listen to his views on crawling pegs and other forms of insect life some day in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he says <e> <s> we all greatly appreciate the efforts that the staff have made to clear this considerable backlog of work <e> <s> the number of claims still outstanding amounts to only which is a very small proportion of the repaid <e> <s> if there is any individual case of which the noble lord is aware which has as he suggests been mislaid or otherwise unduly delayed i should be happy to look into the matter if he would let me have particulars <e>", "<cs> my lords no the noble lord is entirely mistaken <e> <s> the oecd report contains no comment of any description other than on technical statistical matters which i imagine are of limited interest to the noble lord <e> <s> as regards his criticism of the increase in the proportion of the gross national product taken in taxation as i say this is a reflection of the increase in the proportion of the gnp taken by expenditure and if the noble lord wishes to see a reduction in the proportion of taxation presumably he supports a reduction in the level of government expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords the index was never introduced for a cosmetic purpose <e> <s> however i note the noble lords suggestion that information that he does not like should be suppressed <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are more than capable of looking after themselves without the assistance of the noble lord <e> <s> the fact that levels of taxation increased this year is a matter for regret <e> <s> i have explained the reason for it in the house on many an occasion <e> <s> the noble lord simply has to make up his own mind whether he wishes the present level of expenditure to be maintained despite the effect it has on the level of taxation or whether he is pressing the government to reduce the level of government expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so i had a considerable measure of personal responsibility for the introduction of that scheme and therefore i am as familiar with it as is the noble lord <e> <s> as regards the national insurance contribution it is not a tax it is a payment for benefits and the amount of the contribution is linked to the amount of the benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords in we reduced the absurdly high rates of tax on the top incomes <e> <s> tax rates of per cent <e> <s> on earned and per cent <e> <s> on investment income were completely unsupportable on any basis <e> <s> as regards the last budget the fact that we were unable either to revalue personal allowances or to revalorise the bands meant that the increase in taxation on the higher income groups was proportionately greater than the increase on the lower income groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for drawing attention to the problems associated with socialist governments <e> <s> i can assure him that a socialist government in this country would be even worse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for drawing attention to the statistical expertise of his noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> i trust therefore that he will gain great interest from reading the statistical introduction to the oecd report <e> <s> if the noble lord does so he will find that it lends no support whatever to the long and totally misleading dissertation he gave about the policy of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered the noble lords question in detail but in dealing with complex matters one can never give a simple yes or no <e> <s> this is the fallacy known to the logicians as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords assumptions are entirely unwarranted <e> <s> an increase in the gross national product is obviously the best way of improving our fortunes <e> <s> this is why the governments policy has been directed to providing incentives to removing controls and to pressing for improvements in manning levels and in productivity practice <e>", "<cs> my lords this is where i say that the noble lord is totally mistaken in his prior assumption <e> <s> the reduction in the gross national product was not the result of government policies <e> <s> it flowed partly from the world recession and it flowed partly from the uncompetitiveness of the british economy which as the noble lord himself has pointed out on many an occasion has built up over a long period of years <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord studies the report he will find that the proportion of the gnp taken in taxation in this country is not exceptional compared with that of

much greater inequalities of income both before and after tax than exist here <e> <s> we all deplore the present level of unemployment <e> <s> the government feels that it is a tragedy for the british

bear in mind that a great deal of it consists of portfolio investment by pension funds and other institutions <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord would wish to criticise the trustees of pension funds including those in the public sector as well as in the private sector for endeavouring to protect the interests of their members in this way <e> <s> as for the other part of his supplementary the level of investment in this country this applies to the public as well as to the private sector is determined not primarily by the availability of finance but by the availability of profitable investment opportunities <e> <s> unfortunately in the public sector much experience indicates that investment projects undertaken have not proved to be profitable <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is nothing of the sort <e> <s> so long as you have a freely-floating exchange rate it is a reflection of the very healthy surplus on the balance of payments which has been built up as a result of the success of

labour government at some time in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords in the first two months of this year there was a surplus on the balance of <e>", "<cs> my lords what causes concern is the low level of profitability of british industry <e> <s> if the level of profitability were significantly higher than it is then investment in british industry would be more attractive and there would be a higher level of investment <e> <s> this point is brought out very clearly in the report of the committee under the distinguished chairmanship of sir harold wilson <e>", "<cs> my lords on a question of this kind i do not think it appropriate to enter into a discussion about very short-run movements in the rates of interest <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware it is necessary to pay regard to both internal monetary conditions and international monetary conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friends analysis of the situation <e> <s> indeed one would expect to see a fall in the level of portfolio investment after the considerable increase following the abolition of exchange controls <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord beswick was referring to what he claimed to be <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i was drawing no inference of any kind <e> <s> i was repeating what the noble lord himself had said and i assume that the noble lord accepts responsibility for the statements that he makes <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble lords first supplementary question is concerned the gross receipts were million <e> <s> from that one has to deduct million which leaves us with million <e> <s> of that million was then used in the purchase of new shares which meant that the net proceeds would have been approximately million <e> <s> that i think is the correct figure <e> <s> as far as the second supplementary question is concerned it is true that when the shares first opened for trading they were traded at a substantial premium but the number of shares traded represented only a small proportion of the total and it would be quite wrong to gross up from that figure in order to obtain a profit made by the people who had stagged this issue <e> <s> stagging unfortunately is something which no one hitherto has found a way of avoiding although in this instance obviously duplicated applications were rejected <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may start with the last point first there is no substance of any sort in that allegation <e> <s> as far as the facts are concerned they are perfectly simple and on the record <e> <s> the offer for sale was made on st october <e> <s> the price has to be fixed at that date <e> <s> between the time the offer for sale was made and the time the shares were first dealt with there was a rise in share prices generally

whole of this period that is from the date when the price was fixed until today then the relationship that the current prices pays to the issue price is not all that much out of line with the movement in share prices generally <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises an important and valuable point <e> <s> when people invest money including bodies such as pension funds and insurance companies

what has happened is that half the shares in a company where there is no strong case for it being in the public sector are now in the private sector and we believe that this is a more satisfactory arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that anybody sold at in fact the highest price to the best of my knowledge was <e> <s> this is an important <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important

over a very wide span <e> <s> the important aspect rather than trying to estimate something which is inherently impossible to estimate because one is dealing with something which people are deliberately trying to conceal is to come to grips with the problem <e> <s> both revenue departments are doing so and have shown considerable success in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am answerable only for myself and not for others of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much fear that i cannot entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the retirement pension itself is liable to tax so that in deciding whether a person is or is not liable to income <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his tribute to the inland revenue <e> <s> as pensions are liable to

admire my noble friends tireless campaign on behalf of the producers of english and welsh wine <e> <s> the question of labelling is outside the scope of this question <e> <s> the simple truth of the matter is that we are dealing here with two quite different products and i am certain that my noble friend would regard the product of english vineyards made directly from the fresh juice of the grape as very different from the product manufactured from an imported concentrate <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter about which i could not do anything because the duty which is the only element in the price for which her majestys government are responsible is the same whether the wine is imported or grown in this country <e>", "<cs> that is quite outside the scope of the question before the house my lords <e> <s> it is perfectly true that conditions in this country often diverge from conditions in other eec countries sometimes to our advantage and sometimes to our disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my

wells-pestell <e> <s> if both of them care to search their memories they will remember that in the time of the labour government a change was made in the basis on which retirement pensions were uprated <e> <s> the change was from a past basis to a future forecast basis <e> <s> the effect of that change if i may dare use the noble baronesss own phraseology was to impoverish the pensioners by the sum of million <e> <s> the next thing that happened again in the lifetime of the labour government and i hate to mention these things and unless provoked i never do was that in all good faith at the end of their term of office they underestimated the rate of inflation <e> <s> one of the first things that we did was to make good that shortfall in the retirement pension <e> <s> a similar underestimate occurred this time <e> <s> these are estimates made by both governments in perfectly good faith <e> <s> we have made it abundantly clear that so far as the retirement pension is concerned that shortfall will be made good next year <e> <s> that disposes altogether of that point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has had ample opportunity we cannot go on all night on this

baroness herself intervened and i felt that out of all courtesy it was therefore necessary for me to reply to her intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords the child benefit was a factor <e> <s> i will certainly see whether the figures can be obtained and i will send them to the noble lord <e> <s> but in addition to the child benefit there was a whole range of other non-contributory benefits introduced in this period <e> <s> i think it is also relevant to point out to the noble lord as i did earlier that part of the cost of the child benefit is itself a non-contributory benefit <e> <s> it is not just a replacement of the child tax allowance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i was merely trying to help her to marshal her thoughts in an understandable fashion <e> <s> if it does not fall on investment income and does not fall on earned income perhaps at some stage she could explain to me what it is she is endeavouring to tax <e> <s> the fact of the matter is of course that the income tax does fall for example on the incomes of the elderly and the retired <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness is not seriously suggesting that we ought to tax the retired in order to provide benefits for those in work because if that is her proposition it seems to me to be a most extraordinary one <e> <s> the noble baroness and others also suggested that the upper earnings limit as it is described should be removed altogether <e> <s> to do so would obviously weaken the contributory nature of the scheme because benefits are also linked to the upper earnings limit <e> <s> the abolition of the upper earnings limit would also have a serious effect in increasing still further the contributions paid by employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention because he has raised the next point that i proposed dealing with in my reply <e> <s> the question of the national insurance surcharge is entirely a budgetary matter and as a former distinguished treasury minister perhaps i may rephrase that and say as a distinguished former treasury minister my noble friend will realise that on matters of that kind i can make no comment at this time of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords we do of course note all the opinions that have been expressed on this matter <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord spens for his

<e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords anxieties about events in another place lie outside the field of this question <e> <s> so far as the facts are concerned the position is that output has been increasing that productivity has increased quite remarkably that orders in important sectors of industry are picking up that leading indicators do show the prospect of further improvement and we do look forward to a slow but sustained recovery in the british economy <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> perhaps i might draw the noble lords attention to the fact that since unit labour costs in this

which lies at the root of our difficulties at the present moment <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not agree with the thesis put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> i think it is entirely wrong for people to believe either in wage negotiations or in other matters that they are entitled to automatic compensation for rises in prices <e> <s> the obvious example is of course the rise in oil prices where there can be no question of people in this country protecting themselves from such increases <e> <s> the increasing sense of realism which is occurring in this country at the present moment under which many wage settlements indeed the great majority of wage settlements are being negotiated at figures below or well below the increase in the retail price index shows that both sides of industry have a greater sense of realism than the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for the point that he makes which is of course entirely valid <e> <s> the quite magnificent performance of british industry in the export field is something for which we all ought to be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords we are suffering very grievously from the errors of the past to

lord is an optimist <e> <s> one of his major attacks upon the united states administration has been on their interest rates policy and he himself has repeatedly drawn attention in your lordships house

united states authorities would bail him out in these circumstances i am not sure i think it is most unlikely <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce followed up the point he raised on second reading about the balance in the fund which currently stands at approximately billion <e> <s> there are two separate documents that we need to look at <e> <s> the first is the report of the government actuary

directives of the eec is not a narrow or technical point at all <e> <s> secondly on the point of substance my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer has said on a number of occasions that we had no intention of reintroducing exchange control <e> <s> so far as the question of speculation and damaging uncertainty is concerned there is no support for that view in the figures <e> <s> on the contrary looking at portfolio investment which is the most sensitive item from that point of view in the first quarter of the outflow was billion in the second quarter billion

surplus we have earned on the balance of payments a thing in which i think noble lords opposite would take as much satisfaction as we ourselves do <e> <s> had there not been this outflow of sterling

distinction that the noble lord is endeavouring to draw <e>", "<cs> my lords what my noble friend has said is entirely true <e> <s> if any sector of the community behaves in an unreasonable manner it

not only supporting but advocating the expansion of large tax-free benefits to people in the upper income groups but the contrary policy has been followed by successive governments not just this

agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord with respect the governments reply also will be public property <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the noble lords question arose out of the first part and it is perfectly correct and proper therefore that the reply to the second part should arise out of the reply to the first part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the allegations to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> they are in fact part of the substance of the report of the public accounts committee and that is why i say that the correct procedure is for the government to reply to that report and that reply will then be available to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we have said repeatedly that any lessons to be drawn from what has happened on previous occasions will be drawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of that statement and it is one which might be taken to heart in many parts of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for what she says <e> <s> we and the country owe a great debt of gratitude to our exporters who have succeeded in putting up a very fine performance despite the considerable difficulties that many of them face <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lords economic analysis <e> <s> the fact that we have a surplus of billion means that we are investing this money abroad often for the benefit of the kind of economies the noble lord has in mind as well as using it for the benefit of our own economy <e> <s> so far as the price of primary commodities is concerned it is perfectly true that these tend to fall during a world recession which is one of the reasons why we and indeed all the industrial countries would wish to see our way out of the recession as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords acceptance of the fact that over-stimulation of the economy a matter with which he will be very familiar leads to deleterious results <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be only too glad to do so <e> <s> in fact i myself led a deputation from the committee on invisible exports to portugal last year and this was one of the major subjects i discussed with ministers in canada during my visit there last week <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord and i join with him in congratulating the workers in these industries many of whom have also put up a magnificent productivity performance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to write to the noble lord to give him some further information on that point <e> <s> in fact exports of oil during the first quarter of this year amounted to billion which was not significantly different from the figure last year <e>", "<cs> my lords a draft regulation and a draft directive on trade marks have recently been published by the european commission <e> <s> we will need to consider what action to take on service marks in the light of decisions taken on the community proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the mathys committee to which my noble friend refers reported in suggests that there has been no desperate sense of urgency in dealing with this problem <e> <s> the position which we now face is that the community have published a draft regulation and a draft directive <e> <s> these will have important bearings on the whole of our law of trade marks <e> <s> it will almost certainly be necessary to legislate if the directive is adopted and that would be the appropriate moment to consider what legislation to introduce in the case of service marks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his support of my noble friends description <e> <s> whether it was appropriate or not is not a matter for me to express an opinion on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed sympathise with the general case which is being made here <e> <s> but what the noble lord himself says underlines the very point that i have made namely that this needs to be considered primarily in the eec context <e> <s> so far as special legislation is concerned i think the noble lord will appreciate that the possibility of the government introducing a bill of this kind at a time when the legislative programme is so crowded is a remote one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i agree with him that these matters need to he approached with a sense of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely support the objective of expanding the service industries for which my department is particularly responsible <e> <s> but the point which the noble lord makes indicates the breadth of this problem and the depth of consideration that it requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that the noble lord is placing the wrong interpretation on the figures that i gave <e> <s> the figures related to the actual exports of oil during the quarter in question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is in a position to forecast the speed with which the european community will move he is in a much stronger position than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i really think that the noble lord is straying from the question of service marks which is an entirely different question from that of the export of oil <e> <s> but perhaps i might write to him to clear up any misunderstanding that he may have on the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly bear in mind the suggestion that the noble lord makes <e> <s> but i think that the best course would be for him to give me the opportunity of going into the matter in detail and i will let him know what conclusion i come to as to the course that we should follow <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the points to which consideration needs to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that strong feelings are held on this matter <e> <s> this is why i say that i will give it very full and careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is of importance which is why i promised to give it careful consideration <e> <s> so far as the rest of my noble friends question is concerned i will certainly ensure that the views that the government come to are made widely known <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely certain that my noble friend was not accusing me of any such thing and i would be horrified to believe that the noble lord himself harboured any such unkind thoughts <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made significant progress in promoting the wider ownership of capital in a number of different areas <e> <s> in particular improvements in the tax incentives for profit sharing and share option schemes in the finance act have been successful in encouraging wider ownership of shares and the further improvements announced in this years budget should help to build on this success <e> <s> other examples of government actions designed to spread the ownership of capital are the arrangements made to give council tenants the right to buy their homes and improvements in the <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first of my noble friends points is concerned approximately tenants have now bought their houses and a further million have had their right to buy acknowledged by their landlords <e> <s> so far as the business start-up scheme is concerned this was introduced in the budget <e> <s> it is still too early to give actual figures of the take-up of relief but there have been a number of investment funds set up for this purpose and a great deal of interest has been shown <e> <s> the present finance bill does in fact contain further improvements in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so that raises a quite different issue from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> a reduction in the rate of inflation has many beneficial effects <e>", "<cs> my lords my memory does indeed go back to the days when the conservative party invented the slogan a property-owning democracy and it extends over the period when they have brought <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question strays far from the one on the order paper <e> <s> i would however join him in paying tribute to the very valuable part played by the pension funds and the insurance companies in enabling people to build up modest amounts of capital and to protect themselves against their old age and other contingencies <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of the introduction of a scheme on the lines of the <e>", "<cs> perhaps it will be for the convenience of the committee if i indicate the views of the government on my noble friends amendment <e> <s> we enter the fascinating if at times perilous world of sales by auction <e> <s> many people who bid at auctions do so in the expectation of acquiring a bargain many are disappointed <e> <s> i do not suggest that auction rooms should carry the immortal words of dante <e>", "<cs> if i may speak briefly on this subject so far as making of loans is concerned the government take the same view as the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> in the case of the provision of credit there is an arguable case that this is a provision of services but at this stage i am not at all certain that an adequate case has been made out for their exclusion <e> <s> the right course i would suggest is that which the noble lord lord mishcon has suggested namely that there should be further consultations on this matter to see what the right way of proceeding is <e> <s> i shall be only too happy for such consultations to proceed <e>", "<cs> there is very little for me to add to what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i myself would be remarkably surprised to find if one entered into a mutual arrangement with a neighbour under which he mowed your lawn while you were on holiday and you mowed his when he was on holiday that the law regarded that as a contract <e> <s> indeed i think the important thing is that the clause as drafted applies only to contracts and does not apply to friendly arrangements which do not in fact constitute contracts <e> <s> i believe that this is the real answer to the case for the amendment <e> <s> but in the light of what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon i do not consider that it is really necessary for me to say anything more <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might express the view that i have some reservations as to whether this case is well-founded in law <e> <s> as far as i know there is no legal distinction between an executive director and <e>", "<cs> compensation will be payable to shipowners as provided for under section of the compensation defence act in respect of <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that the present position is unsatisfactory but it is not perhaps quite so easy to register an ex-foreign fishing boat in this country as she suggests <e> <s> it is essential that the company owning the boat should have its principal place of business in the united kingdom <e> <s> investigations are made to ensure that these conditions are fulfilled <e> <s> recently two such ships were removed from the register and we are now considering what further measures should be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of a common fisheries policy lies outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e> <s> what we are dealing with is a <e>", "<cs> my lords the basic problem is that the powers we have are those conferred by the merchant shipping act which i believe was passed by a liberal administration <e> <s> if we were to seek further powers it would require primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i was totally unaware of the fact that i had paid a tribute to the liberal party and apologise for so doing <e> <s> so far as the remainder of the noble lords question is concerned the fact of the matter is that there are many companies registered in this country which have their principal place of business here <e> <s> i have already said that i do not regard the present position as being satisfactory and we are investigating what further measures might be taken within the powers available to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the point my noble friend makes and that is why i have said that we are now studying what further measures can be taken in this field to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the government take action of this kind it is of course a matter of public record <e> <s> but if at any stage the noble lord lord molloy wishes further information i should be very willing to provide it either in reply to a question or in correspondence <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond briefly on behalf of the government <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said the bill has been widely welcomed both here and in another place <e> <s> it will i believe benefit both suppliers and those acquiring goods or services since it will be helpful to both to have the basic legal rights set out in clear statutory form <e> <s> it is difficult for people with the best will in the world to he certain about their rights and obligations under the law unless it is set out in clear and simple terms as this bill does <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course well aware of the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord hatch but i do not agree with the conclusions he draws from them <e> <s> the purpose of the export credit guarantee scheme is to give insurance to our own exporters <e> <s> it is not a form of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords the extreme brevity of my reply did not perhaps do justice to the amount of consideration i had given to the noble lords question before i answered it <e> <s> the very brief answer to the point he raises is that it is not in this countrys interest to supply goods for which it is not paid and for which it cannot be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so with respect the noble lord omitted a crucial word from the first quotation which he read <e> <s> according to my account it says <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> while i do not dissent from what was said in the bank of englands <e>", "<cs> my lords the fall in manufacturing production since the government took office is due to two major factors first the world recession and secondly the loss of competitiveness in british industry built up over a long period of time due to wage increases greatly exceeding the increase in productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware that clapping telescopes to blind eyes was a traditonal way of seeing the dawn <e> <s> in fact i would have commended to the noble lord the use of both of his eyes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful to the noble lord for his drawing attention to the profligacy of governments over a very long period of time in spending much more money then they raise in revenue thereby producing a large public sector borrowing requirement <e> <s> as the noble lord will remember it has been part of the governments policy to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is talking about the private sector then the answer to him is that interest rates are unduly high due in large measure to the tendency of governments all over the world to spend too much money which means that they have to borrow too much money <e>", "<cs> my lords if i misheard the noble lord lord hatch of lusby i am sorry but so far as commodity prices are concerned i dealt with that matter very fully in my reply to his supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords interest rates have been coming down <e> <s> they have fallen by something like three to four percentage points from the peak <e> <s> we hope that as borrowing is restrained the fall in interest rates will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord leatherland is wise enough to know that no minister would ever answer a question of that kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure nobody would ever feel that the noble baroness is losing her enthusiasm either for this or for any other subject <e> <s> i entirely understand her feelings about the delay which has occurred in dealing with these matters <e> <s> the consultative document was issued last december <e> <s> the representations which we received did not show the unanimity of view for which we had hoped <e> <s> we are however now working on the matter as diligently and rapidly as we can and i hope that we shall have something to report in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the sense of concern which is felt about this <e> <s> these are important matters <e> <s> it is important that we get the right answer and this is why i might perhaps ask that we should be given a little more time to think about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that my noble friends prior premise is not correct <e> <s> the difficulty is that people do not know what they want and it is because of the division of opinion which appeared as a result of the publication of the consultative document that we are having to take more time to look at the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness is going outside the scope of the present study which deals with consumer councils affecting the nationalised industries and not arrangements that would be made when industries are no longer nationalised <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i have already said that the present study relates to the nationalised industries <e> <s> if an industry ceases to be a nationalised industry and becomes part of the private sector that is a different question altogether <e> <s> indeed one of the reasons for privatisation is to remove the monopoly power which has hitherto existed and is one of the major reasons why these consumer councils were set up <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer made clear in his speech on th july that low pay settlements are essential in both the public and private sectors in order to maintain economic recovery and improve employment prospects <e> <s> whether firms need to pay higher or lower than average increases in individual cases is for them to judge in the light of the particular financial and market considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no responsibility for the pay of the chairman of the heron <e>", "<cs> my lords in the public sector the government are responsible for finding the money and therefore the level of pay settlements must be determined in the end by that factor <e> <s> as regards the private sector it is of value to everybody to ensure that we have a vigorous private sector which will provide employment for all our people <e> <s> i am not in any way saying that the government are defending or attacking the particular increase to which the noble lord draws attention <e> <s> i have been dealing with the general issue of policy raised by my right honourable friend the chancellor in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely right in drawing attention to the fact that a substantial proportion of high incomes does in fact go in taxation <e> <s> but it would be entirely wrong for me to be drawn into a discussion as to the merits or otherwise of a particular pay increase for an individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in some difficulty in responding to the noble lord because i would not share his strictures on the noble lord lord beswick <e> <s> on the other hand i would agree with what he says in the remainder of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear that i do not propose to enter into a debate about the merits or otherwise of this particular pay figure <e> <s> on the general point that the noble lord raises what my right honourable friend has said and what in fact i myself have said applies to pay generally and not to wages as distinct from pay <e> <s> in fact the difference so commonly drawn between wages and salaries is not entirely a justified one <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is not a matter for me but had the noble and learned lord been listening with care he would have heard that i dissociated myself from the comment made about the noble lord lord beswick <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble lord has picked out the phrase sanity and realism because this is what is really required in our economic affairs <e> <s> the greatest of all social injustice is the unemployment which flows from excessive wage increases and pay increases secured by other people in the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the favourable reception which these regulations have received <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede is entirely right in saying that the effect of the regulations is to spread the levy perhaps more thinly although in practice we think that the effect will not be very significant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede and the noble baroness lady seear for what they have said <e> <s> i am sorry that the statement was available at only comparatively short notice but these are important matters and i thought that we ought to give the house as full a report as possible at the earliest possible time <e> <s> in view of the fact that the negotiations continued right up until the expiry of the deadline on th july saturday and since clearly consideration continued after that date it was very difficult to have a completed statement available earlier than it was available <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple truth of the matter is that the attempt to open bilateral discussion with the united states got nowhere because when it came to the point they were not prepared to enter into such bilateral discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that we must do everything possible to prevent this dispute escalating <e> <s> i agree with him also that the basis used by the department of commerce in the united states for calculating the countervailing duties is really a quite insupportable one <e> <s> so far as the negotiations are concerned we have acted in close concert with the community throughout and i am sure that the press will take due note of this <e>", "<cs> my lords these negotiations are still continuing and i think it would be wrong for me to enter into details as to the negotiating position <e>", "<cs> my lords that i fear i am not in a position to answer at this stage but i will check the point and let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the point made by my noble friend and indeed this is the argument that we have consistently advanced to the american administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i start on a personal note <e> <s> i have always tried when i have opened a debate on behalf of the government to listen to the whole of the debate <e> <s> today unfortunately i shall not be able to do so as a number of important matters i have to attend to have arisen unexpectedly <e> <s> i apologise therefore to those noble lords whose speeches i shall not be able to listen to but i assure them that i will read what they say with great interest <e> <s> my noble friends on this bench will take notice of everything that is said during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have your permission to speak for a second time <e> <s> it is never easy in some minutes to answer a debate which has ranged so widely and which has lasted for virtually six hours but i should like to start by joining the many noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> whether mr roy jenkins has reformed or not is a matter that i leave her and the noble earl lord longford to fight out between themselves <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill raised the almost traditional question of the poverty trap <e> <s> this is of course an important matter <e> <s> but he seemed to regard the improvements made in the family income supplement scheme as indicating an increase in the number of people in the poverty trap <e> <s> but this is quite a misleading way of looking at the matter as it would mean that any improvement in welfare benefits for the lower income groups would automatically increase the number of people in the poverty trap <e> <s> such an argument is the economic equivalent of the logical <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords denial <e> <s> if in fact i have misinterpreted him i am sorry <e> <s> but we will read each others remarks tomorrow <e> <s> i have not the slightest wish to misinterpret him <e> <s> he referred to seamen on the canberra at some length and i thought he then went on to refer to imports into this country from low cost countries overseas many of which of course are in the third world <e> <s> we will read the report tomorrow <e>", "<cs> no the noble earl may not interrupt <e> <s> he started by a selective quotation <e> <s> i am now reading the complete quotation and the noble earl might at least do me the courtesy of permitting me to finish reading it <e> <s> i shall therefore start again even at the expense of taking an extra few seconds <e>", "<cs> my lords if you read those two replies together it is abundantly clear that what my right honourable friend was referring to was the availability of places in schools in further education and in training schemes <e>", "<cs> in a moment <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble earl should have put any other interpretation on those remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is doing exactly what i said at the beginning he was doing he is selectively quoting <e> <s> out of two replies he has not quoted even one of them in full <e> <s> he has picked out a single sentence without any relevance to the context the qualifications or what else was said <e>", "<cs> my lords had the noble earl himself taken the advantage of reading the whole passage he would not have misrepresented my right honourable friend in the way that he has done and he really cannot get away with that sort of thing <e>", "<cs> may i complete this point <e> <s> we went through a very difficult period in which the exchange rate was very high but that period lasted for a very brief while indeed and the current exchange rate as i say is not significantly higher than it was in and is noticeably lower than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords the only fair comparison is to take a basket of the currencies which are in fact trade weighted <e> <s> this is what is done in order to calculate the smithsonian parity and the figures are in fact as i have quoted them <e> <s> the current exchange rate is significantly lower than it was in and only a little higher than it was in <e> <s> the noble lord raised the question of the atlantic conveyer a subject which has caused a great deal of comment and rightly so <e> <s> we recognise the importance of this issue and very much hope that cunard will build in the united kingdom <e> <s> her majestys government continue to keep closely in touch with cunard about their decision <e>", "<cs> my lords if the position is as the noble lord says that it is going to be discussed in september i should hardly think it appropriate to discuss it now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to comment on what appeared to be a newspaper report <e> <s> i had assumed that the noble lord was giving us this information on his own authority but if he was merely quoting a newspaper report then i can only say that i have no comment to make on that <e>", "<cs> my lords a statement will be made in both houses but following the normal practice in matters of this kind the statement will be made by way of reply to a question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the noble baroness would have been pleased by the promptness with which i have dealt with the matter <e> <s> secondly if the statement is made by way of reply to a question for written answer the noble baroness will have time to study it before she comes to a conclusion on what the government say <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite normal it has been done on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be plenty of opportunity for the noble baroness to make her views known when she has seen the terms of the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in fact standard practice for statements of this kind to be made in reply to questions for written answer <e> <s> it would be difficult to say that this matter which relates solely to the question of financing the costs of security is of such overriding public interest that it demands an oral statement in your lordships house to the detriment of the other business on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that such a question will appear on the order paper when it is published <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not an exercise in one-upmanship it is an exercise in trying to make the information available at the earliest possible date <e> <s> i dealt with the matter finally only this morning <e> <s> the terms of the statement have not yet been settled <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord would appreciate my dealing with the matter with such speed instead of following what no doubt he regards as the normal practice of taking more time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression and i thought that the noble lord also knew that your lordships house will be sitting next week <e>", "<cs> no my lords the effect of the order last week was to reduce the security charge <e> <s> i should be surprised if the noble lord felt that the security charge should not have been reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords a full and comprehensive reply was given to the noble baronesss question which read as follows <e>", "<cs> the answer to it is that a statement will be made tomorrow <e> <s> it would have been perfectly possible i may say if the noble earls object is to try <e>", "<cs> my lords the opportunity arises frequently for governments to exchange views on economic affairs for example at meetings of the european council and the finance council <e> <s> the french government indicated a change in emphasis in their <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what my noble friend says <e> <s> the french government that came into power just over a year ago came in on the basis of a reflationary policy <e> <s> they have since had to modify that policy in very material respects <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not giving advice to anybody although from time to time i am tempted to give advice to the noble lord himself <e> <s> he will find that after months in office the french government have had to devalue the franc twice have had to introduce a freeze on wages and prices have had to reduce government expenditure and have now set a limit of per cent <e> <s> on the budget deficit a figure somewhat comparable to our own <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that i do not agree with a single word that he says <e> <s> these matters were debated at length in your lordships house as recently as monday and if i may suggest it with respect the noble lord having participated in that debate it would pay him to read the record of the whole of the debate again <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises what is in effect a very technical point <e> <s> we are in fact members of the ems but we are not members of the exchange rate mechanism <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to both parts of that question is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact re-read the whole of the debate <e> <s> i indicated at the time that i would be reading it and i did in fact re-read it <e> <s> i have nothing to add to the very full and comprehensive reply i gave to the debate or to the opening speech that i delivered on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the decision that the cost of security should be borne by the user

abided by the same principle <e> <s> it has been made clear throughout that the government did not propose changing that principle <e> <s> the inquiry that was conducted by my noble friend to which

year <e> <s> of course i accept that the people who at present pay the costs would prefer not to <e> <s> that is a very understandable attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most glad to note that the

favour of diversification of supplies in view of the uncertainties which we all know exist in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only right that i should make the point that the statement i have

course is that the air lines need a level of profitability to stay in business and so long as many of them are in fact financed by governments complete freedom to compete may be a desirable objective but one remarkably difficult to attain <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures are billion billion and billion respectively <e> <s> productivity has been rising substantially for more than a year now but to a large extent this has been offset by pay increases exceeding those in major competitor countries <e> <s> while a rise in productivity is helpful just as excessive pay increases are unhelpful it is not possible to provide a quantified estimate of its effect on the outturn <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures for which the noble lord asked and those i gave him related to imports only <e> <s> what matters of course is the balance of trade between ourselves and the european community <e> <s> contrary to the popular belief we did in fact on a balance of payments basis show a surplus in our trade with europe in both and although in the first half of the current year there is a deficit <e> <s> but europe remains our most important market both in the export and import fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord that the only thing that matters is the balance in manufactured goods <e> <s> in fact the balance in services and in other invisibles is also of very great importance <e> <s> nor am i prepared to disregard the importance of oil in the same way as the noble lord does <e> <s> if one analyses the trade figures in detail one can always pick out individual groups in which this country shows either a substantial surplus or a substantial deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not of course agree with the noble lords analysis <e> <s> that will come as no surprise to him <e> <s> i have never said and i do not now say that we have a surplus on our manufactured exports <e> <s> the point i am making which is a very valid one is that one must look at the totality of our trade and that one is not entitled to pick out individual pieces of that trade and ignore the rest of it because in this world our prosperity depends on the totality of our output and not simply on the output in specific areas <e>", "<cs> my lords on a question of fact the noble lord asked for figures of manufactured goods imported from the european community <e> <s> that therefore was the question which i answered <e> <s> had the noble lord asked for figures relating to exports or the balance of payments i would equally have willingly given them <e> <s> there is no secret about the figures which are of course published regularly <e> <s> so far as the general point which the noble lord is making is concerned it is perfectly true that great changes have taken place in the pattern of this countrys economic activity since but the important point that needs to be borne in mind is how important a market the european community is as a whole for the united kingdom that no less than per cent <e> <s> of our total exports go to the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord clearly moves in different circles from the rest of your lordships house <e> <s> a person who regularly makes a year in short-term capital gains must be an unusual individual <e> <s> quite apart from that the reason for the exemption was to take out of the tax people showing small gains many of which had accrued over a long period of time and i should be surprised to find the noble lord advocating that such people should be brought within the charge <e>", "<cs> my lords holiday cottages are treated in the same way as other assets for capital gains tax purposes <e> <s> we have now provided relief for future inflation and also increased the threshold to <e> <s> these measures will over time make the tax fairer and less oppressive <e> <s> we could not go back and provide what in effect would be retrospective relief for past inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if once again i do not find myself in agreement with him <e> <s> the exemption for capital gains tax purposes will be of benefit to all people with a modest amount of capital who have made gains which may be inflationary or real gains over many years past <e> <s> one needs to look at the two measures together the exemption and the future protection against inflation to get a true picture of what has been done <e> <s> the cost of going back to and providing relief for inflation which occurred back to that date would be far too high to be tolerable <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord aright he was advocating a higher rate of tax on short-term gains <e> <s> in fact in the early days of the tax gains made in less than months were charged as ordinary income <e> <s> this produced very little tax yield the reason quite simply being that people hold the assets until the period of high charge has passed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for his very wise intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords we have agreed in common with the governments of the other member <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand entirely the point that my noble friend is making <e> <s> indeed in the discussions which led up to the final decision we made the point very very firmly indeed that the exemption from excise duties and vat should continue <e> <s> we received specific assurances on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always some people who deplore the minor advantages which give pleasure to other people <e>", "<cs> my lords i clearly have no power to influence any decisions that may be taken by the european court <e> <s> we have no reason to believe that there is anything illegal in the exemption from vat and the excise duties <e> <s> this is a matter upon which we have taken a very firm line and we shall continue to do so <e> <s> may i quote the words actually used in the european parliament by commissioner tugendhat on th june <e> <s> what he said was this <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a suggestion which has been made on a number of occasions <e> <s> it has been considered and i gather that it would give rise to considerable difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear in the replies i have already given and i understood that this had been accepted by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that there is a very clear distinction between import duty customs duty and agricultural levies on the one side and excise duty and vat on the other <e> <s> it is only the first items which so far as this country is concerned are of very limited importance to intra-community travellers <e> <s> it is only in respect of those items that the ruling applies <e> <s> so far as the other items are concerned we propose maintaining our objection to any attempt to abolish the exemption <e>", "<cs> my lords the question does not relate to travellers to mexico however desirable a destination that might be <e>", "<cs> my lords the actual administrative arrangements for dealing with these matters have been discussed in detail with the operators of the duty free shops concerned <e> <s> an arrangement has been arrived at under which the relevant duty will be collected from the operators who will then pass it on in the price <e> <s> i would doubt in these circumstances because the amounts involved are very small indeed and so most purchases are not affected at all whether difficulties of the kind which the noble lord has in mind would arise but i am very willing to have the matter looked at and will communicate with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it might be valuable to draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of people intending travelling on airplanes hugging bottles of duty free liquor to their breasts <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the exchange rate is determined by market forces it is not in fact determined by the government at all <e> <s> so far as the level of costs in the united kingdom is concerned there is a heavy responsibility on both sides of industry to ensure that costs are kept down as far as possible <e> <s> that is the best way to meet competition from other countries <e> <s> so far as a depreciation in the value of the pound is concerned that may have an immediate effect on export prices and prospects but it equally has effects in the opposite direction <e> <s> the important thing is to ensure that we restrain increases in our own cost levels and these are matters within our own control <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked whether the government would do something about market forces if they produced large movements in the exchange rate <e> <s> the short answer is first that the fall that has occurred is in fact a moderate fall it is a fall of approximately per cent <e> <s> in the last week <e> <s> what has drawn so much attention to it is the suddenness with which the fall has occurred <e> <s> the position is that over the last months the effective value of the pound has fluctuated between about and and the pound is still within that broad band <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to assure the noble lord once again that i do not agree with any of his theories on this particular subject <e> <s> the position is that the government do not determine the exchange rate it is determined by market forces <e> <s> that was so when the pound rose steeply in value in and it is now the position when the pound has fallen modestly in value <e> <s> the fact that market forces can result in a movement of the pound in either direction demonstrates clearly that what i say that the value is determined by market forces is entirely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords numerous explanations have been given by the commentators for the present movement in the exchange rate of the pound <e> <s> the noble lord has added his own explanation <e> <s> as we believe that the value of the pound is determined by market values we listened to the noble lords dissertation but it does not follow that we agree with it <e> <s> the government propose to continue with the strict financial and monetary policy which we have followed hitherto <e>", "<cs> my lords by market forces i mean the well-known forces of supply and demand <e> <s> i was unaware that that was a controversial statement <e> <s> as regards the policy of the bank of england what in fact the bank does is no more than to smooth out sharp movements which occur in the exchange rate over short periods of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the points made by the noble lord <e> <s> it is not possible and certainly not our practice to attempt to forecast the movement of interest rates <e> <s> there are many factors which enter into this particular equation including as the noble lord so rightly says the movement of interest rates in the united states of america <e> <s> what we do is to exercise proper control in the field which in fact is under our own control namely that of our own financial and monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely right <e> <s> the problem however is that this unequal treatment arises under a treaty which was signed in between spain and the european community and we inherited the obligations under that treaty when we joined the community in <e> <s> we have been making strong representations on the matter through the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> this year the probability is that the deficit on our trade with japan will amount to billion <e> <s> other countries in the world notably the united states also have substantial deficits with japan <e> <s> this therefore is a worldwide problem and it is one of the matters to which the gatt ministerial meeting will be addressing its mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i would regard the halfpenny coin as real rather than artificial <e> <s> in the first six months of this year million of them were issued by the royal mint which indicates a substantial and sustained level of demand <e> <s> the coin is used in pricing by a number of organisations including grocery chains and supermarkets and as long as the demand for it exists there is a strong case for the government meeting that demand <e> <s> so far as the last part of the noble lords supplementary is concerned the coin is still economic to produce <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords interventions are always worth a great deal more than half a penny <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble viscounts comment <e> <s> i appreciate that the coin has a wide number of uses other than as currency <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> it is a serious point because there always is a risk that if this coin disappeared there would be a tendency for people to round up rather than round down <e> <s> therefore to that limited extent it does help against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is suggesting that we should now have a coin of even smaller denomination <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord it sounds to me as though he is advocating the introduction of a coin of the value of one-thirtieth of a penny <e> <s> i thought we had sufficient trouble with coins of a denomination of one half of a penny <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords wit never deserts him even in an emergency <e> <s> but on the present occasion i would suggest that the one-thirtieth of a penny of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany would be nearer the mark <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments <e> <s> i am extremely sorry about the very short notice that was given of the statement but the reason quite simply was that as i indicated at the beginning of the statement the discussions did not conclude until am this morning <e> <s> our negotiating team did not arrive back in london until pm this afternoon <e> <s> one therefore faces a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> what he says of course is entirely true <e> <s> we are trying to walk along a very difficult path in maintaining an open and liberal trading system on the one hand while at the same time protecting the interests of our domestic industry where those interests come under unfair and severe pressure <e> <s> i am most grateful to him for the tribute he has paid to my honourable and learned friend mr peter rees and the other members of the team who have not only made a notable contribution to the success of the conference but have also upheld the interests of this country in a very successful manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he says <e> <s> we do in fact recognise the great importance of services and took a leading part in ensuring that agreement was reached upon this study <e> <s> when i was in the united states i discussed this issue with the american administration and we make common cause on it <e> <s> it was largely our efforts and those of the american administration which produced the present result <e> <s> we intend following it up with vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises a point of importance <e> <s> i can assure him that we will watch the method of carrying out these studies very carefully <e> <s> we will ensure that the united kingdom plays an active part and makes an important contribution but as regards the exact administrative measures to be taken that is a matter on which agreement still has to be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords we live in a hard world in which the practical issues need to be borne in mind throughout <e> <s> where we or other people find a domestic industry very seriously threatened by a rising tide of imports it is almost impossible to justify taking no action <e> <s> the important point is to ensure that action of that kind safeguard action as it is known under the terms of the gatt and there is specific provision in the gatt itself under article for such action should be taken only where the facts so demand where the situation is sufficiently serious to justify the action taken <e> <s> the fact that the signatories to gatt agreed on a general declaration that it was in the interests of all of us to maintain a liberal open trading system represents a matter of very great significance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be well aware that with countries represented at an international conference there will be a wide divergence of views on a number of matters and that not everybody will take the same view as other people on separate issues <e> <s> so far as the procedures in the european community are concerned and my noble friend raised specifically the case of services the method of procedure which has always been adopted is for the european community to endeavour to establish a common line in advance although individual countries still continue to make their separate views well known <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the point which the noble lord makes i would not in fact agree with him <e> <s> international trade is of course by its very nature multilateral <e> <s> one has surpluses with some countries and deficits with others and if one tries to rely entirely on bilateral agreements the effect is in fact to limit the total amount of international trade <e> <s> there is no question whatever that the negotiation of the original gatt itself resulted in a very big increase in the level of international trade to the benefit of the world as a whole and of this country in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords the very fact that the ministerial conference as a whole subscribed to a document which expressed their confidence in the value to the world as a whole of the continuation of an open liberal trading system is a matter of immense importance <e> <s> the amount of progress that could be made while the world is in recession and while there are very strong protectionist tendencies is inevitably limited <e> <s> as i said earlier the progress that we have made is not perhaps as much as we would have liked but progress nevertheless it is and as such is of great value <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friends analysis <e> <s> the problem arises under a treaty signed in between the european community and spain the benefit or burden of which we inherited when we joined the community in <e> <s> when spain itself accedes to the community the duties will of course disappear <e> <s> we are pressing strongly for a very short transitional period of three years but we do not think that matters ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the complimentary remarks that he made at the beginning of his supplementary question <e> <s> the government have two feet and they stand firmly on both of them <e> <s> we believe that our membership of the european community is of great value <e> <s> nevertheless there are problems in the community and we turn our attention to solving them <e>", "<cs> my lords there were general discussions on the question of unbalanced trade between different countries <e> <s> there was a passage which appeared in the final communiqu referring to obtaining a better balance of trade <e> <s> the question of spain was not itself specifically discussed as the objective of the gatt ministerial conference was to deal with general problems rather than pick out specific problems relating to trade between particular countries <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> what we are concerned with now are the negotiations between the community and spain for her accession <e> <s> in those negotiations we are pressing for an early and substantial reduction in the disparity between the two levels of duty <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble baroness says is another example of the general problem that i mentioned at the beginning namely that the treaty between spain and the european community is a very unbalanced one <e> <s> that is a situation that we are trying to deal with both before accession and most certainly after accession <e>", "<cs> my lords the membership of this country of the european community is of very great value to us <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of our total exports now go to the european community <e> <s> many millions of jobs depend on our membership <e> <s> there are undoubtedly in some areas very considerable problems <e> <s> but we have more chance of getting these problems particularly the one relating to spain solved through the community mechanism than we would be able to on our own <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no power either under the terms of the european community rules or under the rules of gatt to impose such an embargo <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope to make an announcement and to publish detailed proposals before the christmas recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay tribute to the great patience of the noble baroness in this matter <e> <s> the reply that i gave in july and the reply that i now give are entirely consistent with one another <e> <s> in july i said that the proposals would be published after the recess and they are now being published before the next recess <e> <s> so far as the statement is concerned that is a matter to be settled through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the right thing would be to await the publication of the governments document and then to decide what we would like to do in the light of that <e> <s> but the question either of statements or of debates in your lordships house is one for the usual channels and it is not a matter i fear on which i can express any opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not accept the wide generalisation my noble friend makes <e> <s> cocom the co-ordinating committee keeps these matters under continuous review <e> <s> a full-scale review of the list was launched in october of this year and will be completed next year <e> <s> any revision required between major revisions is always subject to consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the convention on the law of the sea is concerned that is an entirely different point to the one raised in the question on the order paper <e> <s> with regard to the noble lords references to trade with the soviet union i understand the point he is making <e> <s> the restrictions operated through cocom apply only to advanced technology which has a military or strategic value <e> <s> one of the points we are pursuing in cocom is to ensure that when technology ceases to be advanced technology it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the view that my noble friend puts forward that we are in some disarray <e> <s> we are currently reviewing the list of items dealt with under the cocom procedure <e> <s> in so far as improvements to that procedure may be needed we are prepared with our allies to review the situation in the cocom machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord davies of leek makes a philosophical point which is of considerable importance <e> <s> the point on which we are all agreed is that we should not add to the military or strategic strength of the soviet union there is no disagreement on that point at all <e> <s> at the same time trade in commodities or articles which do not add to the strength of the soviets in the military field should not be discouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord mayhew would care to give me an example of the specific articles he has in mind i might be in a better position to answer his question <e>", "<cs> my lords in july of this year my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for trade asked the new chairman of the caa mr john dent to look at all the operations of the authority with a fresh eye and to let him have his views on the caas activities and his strategic objectives for the management of the authority over <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect there is a difference between publishing the review itself and publishing the result of the review <e> <s> clearly if there are going to be consultations there must be clear indication of the points on which consultation is being conducted <e> <s> therefore the broad conclusions will inevitably be published <e> <s> so far as the powers and functions of the caa are concerned this of course lies quite outside the scope of the present review being underaken by my honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter point that the noble baroness raises is one that i shall certainly be prepared to look at <e> <s> i should have thought that there were sound reasons why both the government and the civil aviation authority should be represented but i will look into the matter and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think the noble lord misunderstands the nature of the review being undertaken <e> <s> it is a continuous process by which both the government and public authorities like the caa look at their operations <e> <s> it is perfectly normal for <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on the nature of the document to which reference is made <e> <s> so far as this review is concerned it is essentially an internal review <e> <s> we will be consulting the airlines and the other people interested on any points which we think ought to be pursued but the review itself is essentially an internal operation and there is no question of a formal report being produced <e> <s> there is therefore no report to publish <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad indeed that the noble lord read the report produced by the select committee <e> <s> i am only sorry that it made so very little impression upon him and i would recommend him to read it again <e> <s> the vigorous defence of the community by my noble friend lord soames and the noble lord lord rhodes was particularly effective and encouraging <e> <s> i was also impressed as i am sure your lordships were by the careful analysis of the situation by the noble lord lord brimelow which led to the same conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to both the noble lords lord cledwyn and lord banks for what they said <e> <s> i entirely agree that these are both important and extremely complicated matters and i would not expect that anybody would come to any final view or conclusion on them without the opportunity of studying the papers in detail <e> <s> i felt and i am sure this would be the feeling of the house that it was important that i should report to the house at the earliest possible opportunity <e> <s> the agreement was reached yesterday and therefore it was only right that i should report to your lordships today <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree my lords <e> <s> our negotiators under the leadership of my honourable friend the minister for trade have done a magnificent job <e> <s> they have both looked after the interests of the united kingdom while at the same time recognising the interests of the third world <e> <s> it has not been an easy balance to strike but it has been done remarkably well and i am grateful to the noble lord for the tribute he has paid <e>", "<cs> my lords if it were ever thought that i had even tried to administer a rebuke to the noble lord lord shinwell i would immediately deny that i had ever tried to do that his wisdom and experience far transcend anything i would pretend to possess <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question is that they are both there are global quotas for the community and individual quotas for the members <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if i say that i do not agree with any of the points that he makes <e> <s> the multi-fibre arrangements are of great benefit to the developing countries as well as to the industrialised countries because they ensure a guaranteed market in the industrialised countries for the products of the developing countries and that is of immense value to them <e>", "<cs> my lords a very large proportion of the total imports in fact come from the developing countries that is perfectly true and one of the objects of the arrangements is to ensure that on the one hand the industries of the industrial countries have sufficient time to adjust themselves to the changes that are taking place <e> <s> we do in fact have a duty to our own people and that duty we must discharge <e> <s> at the same time we are offering an important and guaranteed access to our market for the developing countries and that is of great value to them as well <e> <s> in all of these matters affecting international trade we are trying to maintain a fair balance between the interests of our own people and the interests of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for attributing the reference to king lear to him and not to his noble friend lord ardwick <e>", "<cs> my lords whether the noble lord was referring to the noise upstairs or the noise on the bench immediately in front of him i do not know <e> <s> all i would say is that the comments of the noble lord lord bruce of donington do no good service either to the international banking system or to the international community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i do of course entirely accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> but i entirely disagree with him on his interpretation of the role of the export credits guarantee department <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference between the insurance of credit and the granting of credit itself <e> <s> i do not think for a moment the kind of position that the noble lord has put forward either in the form in which i had deduced it from various writings which appeared in various places or in the form in which he now explains it more fully would be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords there has of course been a great deal of discussion and speculation on these matters and secretary regan was contributing to this discussion <e> <s> but he has made it clear that he regards the emergence of anything like a new bretton woods as a development that lies quite a long way off <e> <s> this does not in any way diminish the value of discussing these projects but anybody who thinks this is going to provide the answer in the near future is unlikely to have his hopes realised <e> <s> these are much longer term developments <e>", "<cs> my lords had my noble friend possessed himself in patience he would have had the answer very shortly <e> <s> the world financial system is passing through a difficult period <e> <s> about this there is no doubt <e> <s> many schemes of various kinds have been suggested both in your lordships house and outside to deal with these problems <e> <s> i have commented on a number of these schemes <e> <s> but in general i think we would do best to beware of schemes that involve tackling todays problems with institutional reforms that would inevitably take many years to implement and beware also of proposals that substitute government decisions for those better made in the market place <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact answered every one of those points and i suggest that the noble lord reads what i said with care tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and the noble lord lord banks for the welcome they extended to this bill rather more enthusiastic in the case of the noble lord lord banks and rather more muted in the case of the noble lord lord wallace but a welcome all the same <e> <s> i imagine that among the points of detail raised by the noble lord lord beswick he welcomed the bill as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is a very simple one there is no attack being made in this bill on the public sector <e> <s> as i explained in some detail the public sector is no worse off as a result of this bill <e> <s> it is no better off either but it is quite wrong to describe it as being an attack upon the public sector <e> <s> it is nothing of the sort <e>", "<cs> my lords there are circumstances in which an industry has a positive instead of a negative efl <e> <s> where that is so the positive figure will <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first point made by my noble friend is concerned this is a hazardous sport <e> <s> young men will always participate in hazardous activities and tragically from time to time fatal accidents occur <e> <s> one must draw a very careful line between overregulating an activity and making it impossible to carry on while at the same time ensuring that all reasonable safety precautions are taken <e> <s> as i indicated in my reply the caa has in fact already made very considerable progress in this field <e> <s> i am glad also to say that the two associations active in the field the british hang-gliding association and the british microlight aircraft association are joining in consultations with the caa with a view further to improving safety <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the points that he makes are entirely valid <e> <s> so far as noise is concerned two studies are at present in hand and we shall consider what can be done in the light of the results of those studies <e>", "<cs> my lords there are very few horses which would be encompassed within the term microlights <e>", "<cs> my lords i will with permission repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable and learned friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos and the noble lord lord gladwyn for their response to the statement <e> <s> the action of the parliament has of course highlighted the issue <e> <s> we do indeed fully understand the sense of exasperation in the parliament that a proper solution to this problem has not been reached <e> <s> i entirely agree that what we need is a proper long-term solution and not a series of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kennet raises a number of very broad issues <e> <s> the constitutional position of the parliament and the council of ministers in the european community is very different indeed from that in the united kingdom <e> <s> i do not think one could usefully draw analogies between the situation here and the situation in europe <e> <s> as far as provision for the refund is concerned what is in mind now and is inevitably in mind because of the dates is that provision should actually be made in the budget or rather by way of an amending and supplementary budget for the original budget having already been agreed <e> <s> as regards the funds they will not have been spent and it is simply a matter of carrying them forward from one year to the next <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises an important point <e> <s> my information is that it could not be done under the terms of the budget the supplementary budget having been rejected <e> <s> the precise mechanism to be adopted is now under consideration by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for what she says <e> <s> i should of course be only too happy to make a statement setting out the results of the arrangements when they are finally made <e> <s> on the last part of the question of the noble baroness the object of the exercise is of course to save costs <e> <s> i am sure that it will achieve a greater degree of efficiency in the operation of civil air transport in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords for some years now my noble friend lord bethell has pursued a vigorous crusade on the subject of air fares in europe <e> <s> this evening he has clearly gained a number of doughty recruits <e> <s> he has done an added service in keeping the noble lord lord harris of high cross from his bed thus allowing us the benefit of his wisdom in economic affairs <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady burton says this is no new problem <e> <s> i think all of us are convinced that certainly some and possibly many scheduled air fares in europe are too high when considered against costs <e> <s> it may well be that the costs are too high as well <e>", "<cs> my lords a variety of views have been expressed on this subject <e> <s> some people take the view as the noble lord lord kennet does that the fact that the husband will no longer bring home every friday a pay packet containing his wages in pound notes and coin of the realm will prejudice the wifes position <e> <s> there are other people who take the view that because the husband will always have a pay slip and in addition the bank will render a monthly statement showing in that statement the amount of pay he has received the wifes position will be improved <e> <s> these are all matters of speculation <e> <s> i think that as terence said <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend raises an important point <e> <s> her majestys government are in favour of cashless pay which in the sense that it would avoid the handling by employers and employees of large amounts of cash would represent a significant improvement in respect both of the work involved and of the security risks <e> <s> it would also encourage the spread of banking <e> <s> indeed the number of working people with bank accounts has increased dramatically in the last years <e> <s> apparently about per cent <e> <s> of all people at work now have bank accounts <e> <s> the matter was discussed at the last meeting of the national economic development council <e> <s> it was supported on all sides not only by the government but also by the tuc <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we have taken the view that this is a matter for negotiation between employers and employees <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue has been discussed at great length in public <e> <s> very few views of the kind that the noble lord has expressed have been put forward <e> <s> in fact the tendency is for people to stress the opposite point of view namely that with the pay paid through a bank it will be more possible for the wife to see what the husband is receiving if in fact the husband is prepared to make that information available <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not necessary to abolish the truck acts if this is done by way of voluntary agreement which is what we have in mind <e> <s> the general question of the future of the truck acts is one of the numerous matters which are under careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she says <e> <s> i should be only too happy to receive any further information she cares to send to me <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very difficult issues which were debated in your lordships house quite recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that the noble baroness has always advocated a second runway at gatwick but as the secretary of state my right honourable friend sir john nott announced on th <e>", "<cs> my lords that is raising the very wide question that was considered in <e> <s> the best advice available to the government is that with the second terminal it will be possible to handle million passengers but that of course depends on an extended use of wide-bodied aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of your lordships look forward to hearing the noble baroness pursuing this matter well into the s but i think today that that is a question of hope rather than expectation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for calling attention to that precedent <e> <s> he will remember that the late mr george bernard shaw was well into his nineties before that unfortunate event overtook him <e>", "<cs> my lords the matters to which the noble lord refers were the subject of extensive debate in your lordships house recently on an unstarred question asked by the noble lord lord lever of manchester <e> <s> we had a most interesting and valuable debate on that occasion <e> <s> i do not think that it would be right for me to traverse that ground again <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i note that he too thinks that the prospects of international agreement on these matters as distinct from the consensus to which i was referring is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me on this occasion to debate the merits of the policies followed by the american administration but the position in fact is that if one puts undue weight on monetary policy and insufficient weight on fiscal policy one may end up with interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been <e> <s> this matter has been brought to the attention of the american administration by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer and by others on numerous occasions <e> <s> one is glad to note that the american administration now realise the perils inherent in the very large budgetary deficits they have been running <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always happy to find that the noble lord lord beswick reads my speeches and i am sure the house will share his satisfaction in the governments very great achievement in bringing the rate of inflation down below per cent <e> <s> the lowest figure at which it has stood for years <e> <s> so far as rates of interest are concerned the rates now are lower than the per cent <e> <s> to which the noble lord referred despite the recent increase <e> <s> but it is perfectly true of course that rates of interest are affected by international considerations as well as by national considerations <e> <s> we would hope to see on a longer term basis a continuing reduction in interest rates in the world generally and in this country <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> in the first place i do not criticise the policies of other governments although from time to time i do draw attention to what i may regard as errors in those policies in the same way as i draw attention to what i regard as errors in supplementary questions <e> <s> we ourselves have always made it clear that one needs a mix of policies and that one needs to follow a sound financial and fiscal policy as well as a sound monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord i fear is confusing two entirely separate issues <e> <s> the first one is the domestic situation in the united kingdom <e> <s> the other matter that he touched upon is the international monetary problem associated with countries with large deficits and large borrowings <e> <s> so far as the domestic situation in this country is concerned nobody is more aware than we are of the very great problems facing british industry but those problems will be solved only when we can get the rate of inflation down and indeed we have reduced it significantly and with that reduction in the rate of inflation we will achieve a reduction in the rates of interest which will be of long and enduring benefit to british industry <e> <s> that is the objective for which we must aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord because he is simply quoting words that i myself used in a speech in your lordships house recently <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a matter which has absolutely nothing at all to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his courtesy which never fails him <e> <s> he was claiming that we did not support the interests of britain in the european community <e> <s> that statement simply is not true <e> <s> we have fought very hard for britains interests inside the community <e> <s> i do not want to go back over the history of the steel industry but one of the problems that arose and the noble lord must be aware of it was that over-capacity existed for a long time and we were much too slow in dealing with it <e> <s> when we did deal with over-capacity it meant that we were getting ahead of the rest of europe in bringing our industry back onto a proper economic basis <e> <s> the only point of the comment that the noble lord has quoted from a remark made by my honourable friend mr lamont is to illustrate that having taken those measures we were actively defending the interests of this country in the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the point on which there is a fundamental difference of perception between the noble lord and myself <e> <s> as i said in december and i adhere to this view the present situation is a cause for concern but not for alarm <e> <s> this is the difference <e> <s> steps were necessary it was essential to take them <e> <s> those steps have been taken <e> <s> the funds available to the imf have been substantially increased an increase of per cent <e> <s> is a very large one indeed <e> <s> the funds of the world bank have been replenished <e> <s> the most interesting thing here is the ability that has been shown both by the international institutions and by the governments of the leading industrial nations to work together to deal with these problems <e> <s> the noble lord and my noble friend lord soames were both pleading very rightly for international co-operation and here we have two instances where that international co-operation has been brought into play and if i may say so has been brought into play successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so my noble friend takes an unduly pessimistic view of the situation <e> <s> in fact the imf imposes considerable restrictions <e> <s> when it advances money it requires changes in domestic financial policy <e> <s> this in fact we learned ourselves in when the then administration raised funds from the imf and for a brief period during that administration public expenditure had to be brought under control because of the influence of the imf <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords we share the noble lords concern at the supply of arms to the argentine by third countries <e> <s> my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has made these views known very forcibly on a number of occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has not quite understood the chronoiogy <e> <s> the franks report says there was no reason to suppose that an invasion would be made up to st march <e> <s> the invasion took place on nd april which is a matter of three days after that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that there is and remains a complete ban on the supply of armaments from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the position here is that the loans were made by the imf <e> <s> we are members of the imf but of course we do not ourselves actually run the imf <e> <s> it is a joint international body in which a large number of countries are represented <e> <s> it has always been the policy of the imf not to attach political conditions to its loans <e> <s> nevertheless the conditions attached on economic and budgetary grounds would make it less likely and not more likely that the argentine would have money to spend on armaments <e>", "<cs> my lords while i entirely agree with my noble friend i have been endeavouring to answer the questions which have been put because the answer in most instances is perfectly straightforward <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lords comments about my right honourable friend the prime minister are entirely unjustified and completely inaccurate <e> <s> none of us has shown any indifference in this matter at all <e> <s> i have made it perfectly clear that there is and remains a total embargo on the supply of armaments from this country to the argentine <e> <s> as regards the imf we must operate within the terms of the imf rules and these i have explained in reply to an earlier supplementary question <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely understand the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> my right honourable friend the foreign secretary has made his views on this matter very plain to the governments concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not accept the innuendo in the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> so far as the second part of his question is concerned i appreciate that he believes there should not be any international trade in arms <e> <s> that is a point of view held by a number of people <e> <s> it is not held by the majority of people and certainly not held on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords we do apply restrictions on the supply of arms to countries by reference to breaches of human rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i have of course a copy of my right honourable friends reply in front of me <e> <s> it starts by saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point that my noble friend makes <e> <s> the reports of the monopolies commission are always expressed in great detail and the reasons for the decision are set out at length <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his initial remarks <e> <s> as regards the main point of his supplementary question there is an area of legitimate debate here <e> <s> the monopolies legislation on which the merger legislation in this country is based proceeds on the test of the public interest <e> <s> in the united states the relevant tests are purely competition ones <e> <s> there is a pefectly legitimate argument that the tests to be applied might well be more closely defined <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that that arises out of this question nor has it ever been the practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures are as i have in fact given them <e> <s> the unemployed person who is receiving supplementary benefit and who has two young children is now better off in real terms than either in november or in november <e> <s> so far as the person with a substantial income is concerned the position is that during the lifetime of the previous administration the rates of tax charged went up to per cent <e> <s> on investment income and per cent <e> <s> on earned income <e> <s> these rates were not sustainable and were bad from the point of view of the economic health of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the difference arises from the changes which were made in <e> <s> those changes were to put right what in effect were excessive and insupportable levels of taxation <e> <s> the important point which emerges from the noble lords question is that the position of an unemployed person who has young children and is on supplementary benefit has actually improved since <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for that most interesting information <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i cannot accept what the noble baroness says <e> <s> i was asked specifically for certain information <e> <s> that information i have given <e> <s> i drew attention to the most interesting fact upon which i have commented namely that the position of the unemployed person with young children on supplementary benefit is actually better now than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that i was being criticised from the benches opposite for the size of the reductions made in taxation <e> <s> i am therefore most encouraged by the support given to me by the noble lord lord bruce of donington who is advocating further substantial reductions in taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords there seemed to be some innuendo in the noble lords question which i hope he will forgive me if i ignore <e> <s> so far as the figures are concerned the position of the unemployed man as i have given it is not affected by taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would care to read the question it related to the position of a person on a year income and the position of a person who is unemployed <e> <s> i gave the figures relating to those two circumstances <e> <s> if there are any further or more detailed figures which the noble lord would like i shall be only too pleased to send them to him if he will specify precisely what he requires <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble viscount <e> <s> this is why we have set the reduction of inflation as one of our top priorities <e> <s> we have made very significant progress in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is committing the common fallacy of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords attempts at levity in the first part of his supplementary question belied the nature of the attack that he was endeavouring to launch upon me <e> <s> so far as the point of substance is concerned i drew attention to the fact and i thought it was a matter for some satisfaction that the position of the unemployed person with the circumstances i have mentioned is in fact better than it was in <e> <s> i would have thought that the noble lord would have taken some satisfaction from that fact as i and the other members of my party do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for the remarks in the first part of her supplementary question <e> <s> so far as the second part of her question is concerned the answer is yes this does make it clear that the approved fares must be charged <e> <s> we give every support to the airlines and to the organisations which represent them to encourage them to observe the proper scheduled and approved fares <e>", "<cs> my lords the ships in question were ordered in and delivered in <e> <s> the final instalment of million was paid in <e> <s> apart from a sum of in respect of interest no cost was incurred by ecgd <e> <s> no cost to the taxpayer is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords

him that when they were delivered in another labour government was in office <e> <s> i am not in any way criticising either of those governments but i do not think i am expected to answer for the actions they took during their periods of administration <e> <s> the remaining questions asked by the noble lord are not related to the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the important point is that there is now an absolute ban on the export of arms from this country to the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords that issue has been discussed in your lordships house and in another place on many an occasion <e> <s> i have nothing to add to what has already been said <e> <s> the deliveries to which the noble lord refers were made under existing contracts <e> <s> the exports to the argentine were made by third countries <e> <s> we have expressed both publicly and privately our regret that those exports should be made to the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords long list of supplementary questions all and every one are not related to the question on the order paper which refers to two ships which were ordered in and inquires whether any loss was incurred either by the ecgd or by the government <e> <s> i have answered that question fully and completely <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the noble lord that the facts speak for themselves <e> <s> not i nor even atlas could take on the task of supporting an explanation of all the actions that occurred under a labour administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that <e> <s> so far as my information goes the ships were delivered in <e> <s> whether they made any later visit to this country i do not know and cannot answer <e>", "<cs> that my lords is also a question which has been dealt with on numerous occasions in your lordships house <e> <s> the reasons for the lifting of the financial sanctions have been explained not only here but also in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at present giving active consideration to this and we have been in touch with the national association on this point <e> <s> i agree that it is important that we find somebody of wide experience who is able to bring a balanced judgment to bear on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one thing making the rules and the regulations which is what we have in fact done <e> <s> it is much more difficult ensuring that the rules are obeyed <e> <s> the chief offenders in this respect are the airlines themselves <e>

every <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> we have in fact taken action by way of persuading airlines where that remains the only course open to us <e> <s> but it is impossible i fear to solve this problem completely so long as there remains a large amount of surplus capacity in the airline business <e> <s> but as the noble baroness knows agreement has been reached on a number of important routes to ensure compliance with the published and approved fares <e> <s> that is progress and we will continue to do our best to ensure that progress is maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may refer to the joint statement which was made by the parties when the actions were settled <e> <s> it read as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for what she says <e>

will announce our conclusions as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the point made by my noble friend and i support his view that wherever possible people in this country prefer to buy british goods <e> <s> in fact we have greatly extended the scope of origin marking and we are considering what further extensions might be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a suggestion that goes rather wide <e> <s> we are restricted in what we can do in this field by our obligations towards the community and under international agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the trade descriptions act requires the origin marking of all imports which are supplied here under a united kingdom name or mark <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords it was richard brinsley sheridan who said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not propose to expand on what i have said which i believe answers the point that the noble lord has now made <e> <s> i wish to repeat that the last thing in my mind was to cast any aspersion or to cause the noble lord for whom i have great respect any distress in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i was well aware that the noble lord was going to take the line that he has taken and for that notice i am grateful <e> <s> but i was pointing out to him and i point out to him again that the line that he has taken is contrary to the established practice on an occasion such as this as indeed is illustrated by the speech of his noble and learned friend lord mccluskey on a similar occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in exceptional circumstances <e> <s> where we are dealing with normal circumstances i accept what the noble lord says but these circumstances are exceptional <e>", "<cs> my lords rates of interest as we have made clear on many occasions are affected by market forces <e> <s> it was market forces in the present instance which led the building societies to increase their recommended rate of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords this merely illustrates the way that the market can in fact work <e> <s> the banks have been tending to withdraw from the mortgage market <e> <s> that has been one of the factors that has increased the demand on the building societies <e> <s> that in turn has led the building societies to feel that they need a greater inflow of funds <e> <s> it is to encourage that inflow that they have increased the rates they are paying to depositors <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the noble lords argument correctly he is now claiming that he <e>", "<cs> my lords there are plenty of things that one regrets in this ife even if they are not ones own responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the distinction that the noble lord is trying to draw between disapproval and regret <e> <s> it seems to me that they both express the same reaction <e> <s> i was simply trying to assist the noble lord who asked the question to understand the circumstances which led to the building societies taking their decision <e> <s> however it remains the responsibility of the building societies and not the responsibility of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is entirely right in this matter <e> <s> while i would not attempt to speak for the opposition i understand that they did not attempt to fix the rates of building society mortgage interest <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that was not a matter in which the government were in any way concerned <e> <s> it is inevitable that certain events occur before polling day and certain events occur after polling day <e> <s> i have no doubt that the fortunes of the opposition stand much lower today than they did before polling day <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not answerable for what the british government may or may not have done in the s and s <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to pursue that subject it is a matter singularly appropriate for the party to which he belongs <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says there has undoubtedly been competition between the clearing banks and the building societies for mortgage business <e> <s> i can see nothing wrong in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> as regards the first part of his question i have no information about what the labour administration may have done <e> <s> on the second part of his question it is a matter of regret if i may be forgiven for using such a phrase that american interest rates have tended to pull up interest rates elsewhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords they are really two quite different matters <e> <s> so far a national savings certificates are concerned obviously a decision is taken by government but it is a decision which is taken against the general background of market rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now straying very far from the original question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now straying very far from the original question on the order paper and he is putting forward proposals for the generation of

statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for his support and also equally grateful to the noble lord lord banks for what he said <e> <s> i

lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for what she says <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the very big rise in expenditure under the common agricultural policy has tended very much to be at the

an increase in own resources is concerned again with respect i must come back to the statement made by my right honourable friend the prime minister because she made it clear that any change in the level of own resources was dependent upon reaching an agreement on effective control of the rate of increase of agricultural expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for the support that he offers <e> <s> i do not always enjoy it so i am particularly grateful to him <e> <s> i must take issue with some of the points that he raises <e> <s> it simply is not true that the common market always reneges on its agreements <e> <s> as the statement itself makes absolutely clear so far as is concerned the gross provision made in the draft budget correctly

reforms this one and the opening up of the membership which i think is also crucially important <e> <s> but here again we come up against the question of how quickly change can be <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first point is concerned the regulations under the european communities act are bound to be laid before the house <e> <s> i believe that answers that point <e> <s> so far as the measures are concerned for which we shall seek parliamentary approval it is too early to say precisely in what form they will be taken <e> <s> there are various possibilities <e> <s> one is for an order adding to the list of exemptions made in the existing order i might mention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord molloy for the complimentary statements that he makes <e> <s> first we ourselves of course rise today so that while another place does have a little more elbow room had the statement been made tomorrow it would not have been possible for me to have repeated it in your lordships house <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that we have made the statement at the earliest possible opportunity <e> <s> these were important and intricate discussions which have gone on right up to the present moment <e> <s> however much one would have liked to do so it was not possible to give further notice than we have <e> <s> the government are always in a more difficult position than the press because while it is open to the press to speculate the information given by the government has to be the full and accurate information <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to repeat a statement made by my right honourable and learned friend the chief secretary in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start by endeavouring to meet one of the points raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i should be only too happy if it were the wish of your lordships house to include the figures in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that the serried ranks of ex-chief secretaries in this house are likely to be strengthened in the not too distant future <e> <s> perhaps that will compensate the noble lord lord diamond for the fact that the ranks of ex-chief secretaries in another place have thinned out very considerably <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi raises a large number of specific points <e> <s> while the museums and galleries have had to make their contribution to the correction of the threatened overspend my noble friend lord gowrie has been able to limit that contribution to per cent in general in respect of arts bodies <e> <s> this is due to a temporary deferment of the building start on the theatre museum <e> <s> my noble friend is very hopeful that in spite of this a start on the theatre museum in the fiscal year may prove to be possible <e> <s> so far as the other points made by the noble lord are concerned perhaps i or more appropriately my noble friend might write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords these are matters between the individual customer and british shipbuilders <e>", "<cs> yes my lords this is entirely true <e> <s> the performance of british shipbuilders is not as good as we should like to see it <e> <s> a new chairman has just entered office and he is giving vigorous attention to these matters but there is certainly a great deal of room for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the first part of the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> the best way of bringing down interest rates is to follow a responsible financial and monetary policy <e> <s> this is what this country is doing as are other countries for example western germany <e>", "<cs> my lords these are complex matters <e> <s> there is a most important relationship between the level of the governments borrowing requirement and interest rates <e> <s> that is a matter to which the governments policies are directed <e> <s> i am only too glad to have the noble lords support for those policies <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the prime minister said in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise the importance of this matter <e> <s> it is however a matter as the noble lord will appreciate that will need to be the subject of decision by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer in relation to other priorities in the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords what in fact we are doing is not interfering with market forces but removing some of the obstacles to the free play of market forces <e> <s> because of certain tax limitations the building societies were restricted in the sources of finance that they could have <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment in the finance act was to enable them to tap a wider source of money and of savings <e> <s> i would very much hope that this would be of benefit both to savers in the building societies and to house purchasers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will realise that it would not be right for me to enter into the details of discussions that took place <e> <s> i stated very clearly in the reply that i gave that the government had accepted the argument put forward by the building societies <e> <s> i have no reason to suppose that the move was not also welcomed by the bank of england which in fact acts for certain of the building societies in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is perfectly correct the governor of the bank of england did make a speech some years ago <e> <s> i cannot from memory recall the exact date <e> <s> in that speech he advocated that building societies should be given the facility to tap a wider source of savings and this is what has now been done <e> <s> i think frankly without going into details of what may have been said by participants to discussions it is a move that has been generally welcomed as helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware rates of interest have come down by seven percentage points since they reached their peak and now stand at their lowest level for five and a half years <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i will repeat a statement made by my honourable friend the financial secretary to the treasury in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start with the points raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington although to some considerable degree they were also reflected in what the noble lord lord diamond said <e> <s> there is of course a clear conflict of political philosophy between those of us on these benches and noble lords on the benches opposite <e> <s> we have discussed these matters on many occasions in the past and we shall no doubt go on discussing them <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords question is concerned as a distinguished former chairman of a nationalised industry he will be aware of the continual complaints made by the nationalised industries about treasury involvement in their affairs and about the governments sitting on their backs <e> <s> nothing could be better from the point of view of running an efficient business than that the government should not be involved in that business and that the management of the business should be free to conduct it in the best commercial manner <e> <s> the success of this policy is shown by the very success of cable and wireless itself since it was privatised <e> <s> i am sure that it will continue along this road of success <e>", "<cs> my lords the important point is that the government should no longer be in control of the company <e> <s> it is even more important that the government should not be involved in it at all <e> <s> the government are not an investment trust <e> <s> it is not the function of government to be holding investments in companies <e> <s> the function of the government is to govern the country a job which they are doing with very great success as underlined by the results of the general election in june <e> <s> the right thing is for the private sector to run industry and business efficiently and profitably <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had very fully answered the noble lords question <e> <s> a wide range of costs is involved <e> <s> there is the cost for example of advice tendered to the government and advice taken by the government <e> <s> there are other preparatory costs involved in the preparation of documents the circulation of documents the insertion of advertisements <e> <s> there is the cost of the actual issue itself the underwriting costs and so on <e> <s> it is impossible at this particular point to say just at what point in the chain of the incurring of those costs the appropriate vote will be passed <e> <s> it is not possible at this stage therefore to say how much of the total expenditure will be charged against the contingency fund and how much of it therefore will come after the date when the vote has been passed in another place <e> <s> purely by way of illustration the cost incurred when the first sale of shares in cable and wireless was made was million but that of course included the cost of underwriting which is a substantial part of the total <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what my noble friend says <e> <s> first of course the improvement in the performance of bsc is a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords the west german figure for was tonnes of crude steel per man per year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind the noble lord that i paid tribute to both the management and the workforce in the steel industry for what has been a remarkable performance over the last few years <e> <s> on the other point that the noble lord raised we have put up a most vigorous defence of british interests in the community and that is borne out by the fact that in the last round of discussions on th july the reduction agreed in bscs capacity was only tonnes <e> <s> the total reductions called for were as follows <e> <s> in the case of germany a reduction of million tonnes compared with their capacity in the case of the italians million tonnes in the case of the french a reduction of million tonnes and in the case of the belgians a reduction of million tonnes <e> <s> therefore we have very successfully defended what i accept are the vital interests of the british steel industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he said in his first supplementary question <e> <s> on his second supplementary question i entirely agree that there are great and valuable skills here but of course many of our other industries also possess a highly skilled workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the tribute that my noble friend pays to jaguar <e> <s> this is a remarkable success story which reflects great credit on both the management and the workforce <e> <s> so far as privatisation is concerned both the board of bl and the government are committed to privatisation of bl <e> <s> the precise form and timing of that privatisation is under study and an announcement will be made at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords admiration for the jaguar motor car and the success which has been achieved <e> <s> what it demonstrates is that the combination of first-class management a good co-operative workforce and the determination to privatise at the earliest possible date are a recipe for complete success <e>", "<cs> my lords a very high proportion have been exported <e> <s> last year for example out of a total output of some no less than went to the united states alone <e>", "<cs> my lords the crucial point that the noble lord overlooks is that these outstanding management teams come from the private sector and this being so the return of these industries to the private sector in due course will provide them with a much better and greater opportunity in the future than they would have if they remained within the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble earl has more detailed information on that point than i have <e> <s> the original jaguar motor car and jaguar was only the model name the noble earl will remember that it originally went under a different name altogether it was originally called the swallow standard in fact was an outstanding motor car in the s and the s <e> <s> it fell upon lean times from which it has now recovered in a quite outstanding fashion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the points which will obvioulsy be taken into account when the final details of the privatisation are settled <e> <s> as a matter of principle i do not rise to every provocative statement made by the opposition <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords but the objective of the government is to bring industries in the public sector into profit as soon as possible and a considerable degree of progress has been made in that field <e> <s> the noble lord will no doubt call to mind a number quite apart from jaguar <e> <s> of course we have the turn-round in british airways from which i hope the noble lord will take great satisfaction as indeed i think will everyone in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the noble first part of the lords supplementary question is concerned i think we would all like to find a better term than privatisation <e> <s> i sometimes refer to it as liberation <e> <s> so far as the second part of his supplementary question is concerned i think it shows a grievous lack of understanding of the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comments <e> <s> it has been and will continue to be the policy of her majestys government to encourage shareholdings by employees <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his suggestion that all the nationalised industries should be privatised whether or not they are currently profitable <e> <s> we shall certainly bear in mind his wholehearted support in this matter when we come to consider individual projects <e> <s> so far as british airways are concerned the precise nature and form of privatisation has still to be settled <e> <s> this obviously includes the question of the capitalisation of the company <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very clear and specific in my reply <e> <s> there are a number of the nationalised industries which have gone through very difficult times <e> <s> many of them have made large losses they have been over-manned they have been a severe drain upon the taxpayer <e> <s> many of these things need to be put right and we have devoted a great deal of effort towards putting them right <e> <s> when they are put right these industries will we hope be privatised and we shall thus ensure their continued successful operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comment which i shall of course bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will cast his mind back he will remember that the reasons for nationalising industries were not by any means confined to the fact that the industries in question were making losses <e> <s> i would suggest that he reads some of the policy documents of the labour party however horrifying they may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> there was so much background noise as he began to ask his question that unfortunately i lost his introduction to it <e> <s> i am sure however that he has made a valuable point as he always does <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor has made a very important point and it is one which we keep in mind all the time <e> <s> the programming of issues of this sort requires great skill and a proper regard to market conditions at the time <e> <s> it is our objective as he himself says to ensure that the government receive a fair and proper price <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the noble lord is entirely right in saying that close relations ought to exist between public sector and private sector companies and very often they work together very well <e> <s> i do not want to go into the specific history of rolls-royce about which a great deal could be said and which throws no credit on the position and policies of certain prominent members of the labour party who are no longer as prominent as they were then <e> <s> but there may be circumstances where a company needs rescuing and this was so in the case of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always most grateful to the noble lord for his compliments and i can assure him that my abilities remain at the service of the government as long as it is the wish of the government to employ them <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords question is concerned perhaps the most relevant figure to give him is that since and revalued at current prices approximately million of public money has gone into the nationalised industries most of which has been lost <e> <s> this is the kind of thing that we wish to bring to an end <e> <s> to turn to british telecom the noble lord will no doubt have read the draft licence which has now been published and which deals in detail with the measures which british telecom are required to abide by for the preservation of services in rural areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i have in fact in reply to every question given a strictly factual answer <e> <s> the fact that certain noble lords may not like to look the facts straight in the face is not a matter on which i would wish to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have never made polemical attacks on public ownership <e> <s> our objective is to ensure that these industries are run for the greater benefit of the people who work in them of consumers and of the general public at large and in the main they can be run better more efficiently and more competitively in the private sector than in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords question is concerned receipts from the sale of assets are separately identified in the national accounts so that it can be seen exactly what has been received <e> <s> regarding the second part of his question it is not the case that all revenue is spent for current purposes only <e> <s> on the contrary a large amount of revenue is spent on capital projects <e> <s> for example many billions of pounds a year are spent on the capital programmes of the nationalised industries and of course there are large capital projects in other areas of government <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lord is getting rather emotional and he is mixing up his politics with his accountancy <e> <s> the first part of his exposition merely confirms what i was saying <e> <s> so far as the rest of his point is concerned the government spend every year a large amount of money on capital account and it is quite wrong to say that the birthright of the nation is being sold <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the point that i had made <e> <s> the point that i had made was that certain policies which had been followed did in fact lead to a situation in which rolls-royce went bankrupt and the noble lord will find that this is amply evidenced <e>", "<cs> my lords i reject entirely the claims made by the noble lord the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i said the noble and learned lord before the noble lord chose to try to correct me <e> <s> i simply do not accept the criticisms which the noble and learned lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i have never advised the noble lord lord george-brown either on that or indeed on any other matter <e> <s> the only occasion that i remember meeting him in that sort of capacity was when he was a parliamentary private secretary <e>", "<cs> to the late sir stafford cripps <e>", "<cs> in that event i withdraw the compliment that i paid to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i an grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for their general support of the bill <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is limited of course to providing the money necessary if i may be forgiven for using the phrase to keep british shipbuilders afloat <e> <s> perhaps the most appropriate time to be discussing the future of the industry and its future shape will be when mr graham day has completed work on the corporate plan and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry has considered it and come to a conclusion as to the future policy to be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all congratulate the noble lord lord barnett on a distinguished and elegant maiden speech <e> <s> he has of course great experience in these matters <e> <s> his appointment as treasury spokesman for the opposition will add lustre and illumination to the benches opposite <e> <s> i do not know whether that means that the speech this evening of the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord beswick is concerned the position is that the consolidated fund act has now lasted years <e> <s> so far as his second supplementary question is concerned public sector expenditure in the current year is estimated at billion <e> <s> the noble lord will find the figures in volume of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his observations <e> <s> the money to acquire those assets came of course from the general flow of government receipts whether revenue receipts or capital receipts <e> <s> the position is as i explained it to the noble lord lord beswick one cannot attribute any particular item to any specific item on the other side of the account <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e> <s> but it is not at all clear from the noble lords question whether he thinks we ought to be selling public sector assets at a greater or lesser amount <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord holds a number of extremely interesting and somewhat controversial views on this matter as indeed he does on a number of other subjects <e> <s> i realise that the noble lord is very dissatisfied with the state of public accounts a matter to which perhaps he ought to have directed his attention during the years when he was chief secretary to the treasury <e> <s> but i think the most important point is that there is a fundamental difference of philosophy between the noble lord and his noble friends on that side of the house and noble lords on this side of the house <e> <s> noble lords opposite believe that there is something particularly meritorious in public ownership <e> <s> we take the view that while in certain circumstances public ownership may be unavoidable assets ought so far as possible to be held by private citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords the point the noble lord raises is of course basically the same point raised by the noble lords lord beswick and lord diamond <e> <s> the simple truth of the matter is that there are large flows into the public accounts and large flows out of the public accounts and it simply is not possible to attribute an income flow and match it with a specific expenditure flow <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not propose to nationalise london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the point my noble friend raises strays somewhat far from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lord it is an increase in cash terms yes <e> <s> but the figure is in fact the public sector capital expenditure it does not include the expenditure by the nationalised industries which for the current year is estimated to account for a further billion <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting and instructive debate and it has been marked by a number of distinguished and thoughtful contributions <e> <s> the discipline exercised by the time limit has i think noticeably improved the quality of the debate even if it has somewhat reduced the quantity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am comparing it with for the very simple reason that that is when we reached the bottom of the recession <e> <s> if you are looking at the path of the economy you look at whether one is going up or down <e> <s> the noble lords gaze is firmly fixed on the past when we were going down <e> <s> the position for two years now is that the economy has <e>", "<cs> my lords i must take issue with the noble viscount <e> <s> i have endeavoured admittedly in a comprehensive form to answer most of the points that have been raised in the debate including the points raised by the noble viscount <e> <s> there is a problem in a debate of this sort because there is some limitation on time <e> <s> although i have spoken longer than i would normally have done due to the courtesy of noble lords in keeping their own speeches so brief i felt that it was not really appropriate for me to go on at any much greater length <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as businesses are concerned there are always casualties <e> <s> one greatly regrets seeing this happen <e> <s> the number of new businesses starting up is greater than the number of businesses that fail <e> <s> we have gone to very great lengths to give help and encouragement to provide incentives for small businesses <e> <s> as i mentioned in my speech we have introduced measures of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments <e> <s> may i remind the noble lord lord barnett of the saying beware of greeks bearing gifts <e> <s> one should equally beware of members of the opposition conveying congratulations <e> <s> i say that because when the noble lord referred to his own reputation for creative accounting i suspected that there was a sting in the tail somewhere <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that my right honourable friend will read his remarks and interpret them in the most charitable sense possible <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might say that i think there is some slight misunderstanding between the noble lord and myself <e> <s> there is a reduction compared with the increase that was provided in the public expenditure white paper last february but it still remains an increase <e> <s> i am sorry about this <e> <s> these are complex matters and i think the noble lord will find a full explanation in the autumn statement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is endeavouring to put words into my mouth <e> <s> the position as he well knows is that the government are responsible for setting the external financial limits and also for setting targets <e> <s> within the figures that have been determined it is a matter then for the industries themselves to decide what tariff increases are required <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first point raised by the noble lord lord beswick is concerned there is a difference between an estimate and a forecast <e> <s> the government actuary every year prepares a report on the national insurance fund <e> <s> for that purpose he is given certain assumptions <e> <s> i am not certain whether i used the right word <e> <s> there is a difference between a forecast and an estimate on the one hand and an assumption on the other <e> <s> so far as the government actuarys report is concerned the figure included is neither an estimate nor a forecast it is an assumption which is provided by the government <e> <s> this follows what has been done every year under successive governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the reasons for privatisation are not either entirely or mainly financial at all <e> <s> the objective is to introduce a greater degree of competition a greater degree of response to market forces and a greater degree of response to the interest of consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is a great optimist <e> <s> he is well aware that i can give him no assurance of that sort <e> <s> all that i can say is that the rates of contribution are not being increased although both the lower and the upper earnings or in this case profit limits are being revised on the basis that i indicated <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be more appropriate to deal with the details of these programmes on another occasion <e> <s> the noble baroness will find an exposition in the autumn statement itself <e> <s> in the case of housing for example there is an apparent substantial reduction in net expenditure but more than half of that is not a reduction at all <e> <s> it is a reflection of higher receipts from the sale of council houses <e> <s> so far as the home improvement grant is concerned the temporary home improvement grant scheme has come to an end <e> <s> it was originally a temporary scheme which was due to expire on st december and twice has been extended <e> <s> the expiry of the scheme has been announced <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first point is concerned the increase in output over the last year was per cent <e> <s> not per cent <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> referred to the increase in output since the low point of the recession was reached in early <e> <s> the noble lord asked for an analysis of that increase in output <e> <s> i am afraid that i could not give that to him without notice <e> <s> so far as the overseas aid is concerned the noble lord will find a complete commentary on all the programmes on pages to of the autumn statement itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord stoddart and the noble lord lord ezra for their general welcome to the statement and <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the points made by my noble friend <e> <s> i agree with him that it is very difficult to absorb a statement of this complexity in the few minutes which are available while it is being made <e> <s> the important thing is the publication of the white paper which people will be able to study at leisure <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole purpose of publishing the white paper in which these proposals are set out in some detail is to enable consultation to take place on the widest possible basis <e> <s> nobody is precluded from making his views known and in fact there is a general invitation in the white paper to all people interested to write to the secretary of state expressing their views <e> <s> so it is a very wide-ranging consultation <e> <s> it is perfectly clear from the statement that the regional grants and the selective grants will both be continued <e> <s> the important question will be the precise rules which will apply to each and these again are matters for consultation <e> <s> as to the precise impact of this on the scottish development agency and the welsh development agency i am frankly not in a position to answer that question immediately but i will write to the noble lord and deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords the enterprise zones are of course an entirely separate project with rules of their own <e> <s> they are beginning to show important advantages <e> <s> it is impossible yet to measure the degree of success but we hope there will be an important degree of success emerging from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says about the difficulty of distinguishing between modernisation and replacement and this is one of the areas which will require a very great deal of consideration <e> <s> i note also what he says about the indirect benefits that flow from schemes involving substantial capital investment <e> <s> but of course he will be aware just as i am of cases which have attracted great criticism because substantial amounts of grant have gone to projects which have involved very high expenditure but virtually no job creation at all <e> <s> therefore the precise criteria are a matter which need the most careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to my noble friend that i shall be happy to have that point looked into and i will write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may make a general comment which i hope will be helpful <e> <s> we have published a white paper dealing with the matters in some detail and that is because we realise that it is quite impossible to deal adequately with all the points which are likely to be raised in the compass of a statement <e> <s> the white paper itself specifically invites comments and is open to consultation on a large number of very important matters some of which are quite specifically set out <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord diamond will forgive me if i say that the most important point is to go through the white paper itself where many of the issues are specifically spelt out <e> <s> in fact the issue of the level of grant is one specifically set down in the white paper as a question of consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> i believe it is accepted that regional policy has in general been very successful in wales <e> <s> we have made it absolutely clear that the social considerations are extremely important <e> <s> in fact the view could be taken that the social considerations may in some instances be more important than the economic ones considerable doubts have been raised from time to time on the effectiveness of regional policy in economic terms but it certainly has a most important social role to play <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the sentiments uttered by the noble lord lord boothby <e> <s> perhaps i may make a number of points in reply <e> <s> first of all the taxation on scotch whisky raises approximately million per annum which is not an insignificant sum of money <e>", "<cs> secondly my lords during the lifetime of this government the taxation on scotch whisky the excise duty has increased by per cent <e> <s> while the duty on fortified wines with which the noble lord makes a comparison has increased by per cent <e> <s> the government have therefore significantly shifted the burden of taxation away from whisky <e> <s> thirdly as this is the season of goodwill perhaps i may mention that since under four successive governments of different political complexions the taxation of whisky the total tax on whisky has declined in real terms by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords fortunately i have no responsibility for the committee on lords expenses <e> <s> nevertheless i greatly sympathise with the noble lords objectives and i entirely agree with him that contrary to what the noble lord lord boothby said whisky is a drink favoured by a very wide range of people and not entirely by those in the upper income groups <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting suggestion and i shall draw it together with the other remarks which have been made by your lordships to the attention of my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords the tax structure does not discriminate against scotch whisky as opposed to other spirits <e> <s> nevertheless the position is and this has been the case for very many years that spirits are taxed more heavily than either wines or beers <e>", "<cs> my lords the points raised by the noble lord are clearly matters of interest but they fall outside the scope of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord brabazon of tara on a most interesting and well-informed maiden speech <e> <s> he has a very direct knowledge of these matters <e> <s> it is always of great value to have views expressed in your lordships house by someone with day to day experience of the matters about which he is talking <e> <s> from this point of view we were also most interested to hear from the noble lord lord obrien and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe both of whom while not members of the stock exchange have a very close knowledge and experience of financial markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord taylor of gryfe for their comments <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce said that the statement indicated a debonair detachment <e> <s> i must take issue immediately with his comment <e> <s> the statement said specifically that a further increase of the scale of unemployment implied by the cancellation of this order would be a matter of deep concern for the government <e> <s> i agree entirely with the comment of the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that this is a tragedy <e> <s> it is a tragedy for scotland <e> <s> it is a tragedy for british shipbuilders <e> <s> it is a tragedy for the management <e> <s> it is a tragedy for the workforce <e> <s> let there be no question about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord believes that the government should intervene in this individual case <e> <s> we do not think it is a matter for the government to intervene <e> <s> as far as british shipbuilders as a whole are concerned their total loss last year was million of which not less than million related to scott lithgow <e> <s> exactly what the future level of losses will be either for scott lithgow generally or in relation to this particular order must depend upon the outcome of the litigation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for not advocating that the government should intervene <e> <s> as regards the rest of his questions i did frankly answer them <e> <s> the financial consequences depend upon the outcome of the litigation and any negotiations which may take place between british shipbuilders and britoil <e>", "<cs> my lords no man is an island entire unto himself and any tragedy which occurs affects all of us <e> <s> i do not think that there is any dispute between any of your lordships on that point <e> <s> nobody is attempting to pretend that this situation is not a tragedy <e> <s> there is a point of difference as to the extent to which the government ought to intervene in a situation of this kind but let me not pursue that any further at the present juncture <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the text of the statement to which the noble lord refers and i would hesitate to make any comment upon it particularly as one relevant point is when the statement was made <e> <s> i do not want to go into an excessive degree of detail on this but the contract provides for notice to be served within a -day period <e> <s> the contract can extend days after the delivery date <e> <s> some of the points in issue in the litigation are whether valid notice was served within that -day period and whether or not the rig could be completed within the further days allowed under the contract <e> <s> but we are treading on very thin ice at the moment because the whole of this matter is the subject of litigation and i really ought not to comment further on the merits or demerits of the arguments being advanced <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble and learned lords first question is i fear no i do not know how long it will take <e> <s> the noble and learned lord himself is well aware and i have to be very careful that sometimes the law proceeds with greater speed than it does on other occasions <e> <s> the government have no plans and nor <e> <s> indeed are they in any position to intervene in the litigation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for the complimentary remarks which he made about the bank of england in the opening part of his remarks but i cannot i am afraid agree with many of the things that he said in the latter part of his speech moving this amendment <e> <s> i well remember the day when the late mr hugh dalton lord dalton as he subsequently became nationalised the bank of england in <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his intervention <e> <s> i think that there is for it came out in most of the speeches which were made very great respect for the bank of england and for the part that it has played <e> <s> there is always a risk that nationalisation of a concern or its being taken over by government may affect its impartiality <e> <s> one of the things that we have been very appreciative of is the fact that in the case of the bank of england this has not happened at all <e> <s> i should like therefore to go further and say that i can see no reason why joining the bank of england in this process of monitoring the progress made by the stock exchange in dismantling certain restrictive practices will prejudice the independence of the bank of england <e> <s> in fact on the contrary the bank of england comes into this process by virtue of its independence <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be for the convenience of the committee if i intervened at this stage <e> <s> this will enable noble lords who have not done so to read the manuscript amendment tabled by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> i should like to assure the noble lord lord bruce of donington that i was not in any <e>", "<cs> this is not intervention by the executive at all <e> <s> if there is intervention it is intervention by parliament or the legislature <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might deal first with certain allegations made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he claimed that directions were given by the secretary of state to the director general to discontinue the action <e> <s> no such directions were given and nor could they have been given <e> <s> the position was that the litigation was between the director general and the stock exchange and the application to the court was made by the stock exchange not by the secretary of state at all <e>", "<cs> it may help if i referred briefly to the law on this subject <e> <s> the restrictive trade practices legislation and the monopolies and mergers legislation are two parallel but rather different rgimes <e> <s> the position is that if an agreement comes under the terms of the restrictive trade practices act it is thereby <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce has made a large number of statements which are quite insupportable <e> <s> he says that the stock exchange have been allowed to get away with it that the stock exchange have done nothing and that inaction justifies their exemption from the act <e> <s> the truth of the matter is exactly the reverse of this <e> <s> what has happened is that the stock exchange far from getting away with it have agreed to dismantle the most important of their restrictive practices and substantial progress has already been made <e>", "<cs> the point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington is a perfectly different one from the one covered by the amendment in the name of lord taylor of gryfe <e> <s> lord taylors amendment provides for an immediate investigation by the monopolies commission and a report no later than st december <e> <s> the circumstances that lord bruce is talking about are totally different <e> <s> we believe that the stock exchange will proceed along the lines of the agreement that has been reached <e> <s> it has been reached in good faith <e> <s> we believe that it will be fully honoured <e> <s> we have set up a monitoring process to ensure that we know whether or not it is honoured <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is simply rehearsing all the arguments that he put forward on second reading <e> <s> the bill has only one operative clause and that is clause <e> <s> in effect therefore clause is the substance of the bill itself <e> <s> the noble lord said that the committee should understand the real implications of accepting clause of the bill <e> <s> the real implications are precisely the same as the implications in the case of any other services which are exempted from the restrictive practices legislation <e> <s> that includes not only the numerous services which are specified in the act some of which i read out because i thought the noble lord would be interested but also a schedule to the order which exempts a whole range of agreements none of which is particularly professional <e> <s> they include for example international sea transport air transport road passenger transport and the building societies interest rate cartel none of which can be described as professional activities <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for his remarks and also for his warning <e> <s> on this occasion may i say that i am quite unable for my part to help the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i am not able to give him the satisfaction of accepting his new clause <e> <s> the effect of the clause would be first to subject the agreements of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point that my noble friend is making <e> <s> the public accounts committee have a great reputation for probing matters of this sort in depth and with very great care and i think the wisest course is to await receipt of their report before going any further <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is supporting the point i am making no doubt much to his surprise <e> <s> it is very important that we do match the united states levels of productivity and i am glad that he entirely agrees on this point <e> <s> i do not understand really what the noble lord is arguing about because this is clearly one of the factors that have to be taken into account <e> <s> the evidence produced by british aerospace on this point is being considered very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position off the cuff to give actual figures for productivity on the a and the a <e> <s> it nevertheless remains absolutely true that one of the crucial issues is that we must match productivity <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that he is certain that we will match united states levels of productivity <e> <s> if we do that is splendid but it must be and it must continue to be a matter of considerable concern in this field <e> <s> this is particularly so because we are looking at a -year programme and it would be quite wrong to believe that united states levels of productivity will remain exactly where they are <e> <s> the point i am putting to the noble lord and i really do not know why he is disputing this is that we really need to look at all of the factors involved and this we are doing <e> <s> we look at them with an open mind and i hope the noble lord does the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very brief bill <e> <s> we have debated it at great length <e> <s> all the points raised by the noble lord were raised either on second reading or in committee <e> <s> on those occasions i replied in depth and in detail <e> <s> i hardly think that your lordships would wish me to repeat all the arguments once again <e> <s> having said that i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply given in another place which i have in front of me was entirely accurate <e> <s> so far as the rest of the noble lords question is concerned i realise that these are matters of some controversy but with respect they arise directly out of decisions taken by the labour government and announced by mr kaufman who was the minister then responsible on th july <e> <s> if the noble lord reads mr kaufmans statement which appears in col of <e>", "<cs> my lords neither i nor the government that i represent have any primary responsibility for these matters <e> <s> they arise directly from decisions taken by the then administration and i can do no more than inform the noble lord what the facts are and what statements were made when those decisions were announced to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to give the noble lord any such assurance <e> <s> i started by saying that this is a matter of some controversy and therefore i have deliberately confined myself to a statement of the facts <e> <s> it is open to anybody who is interested to place whatever interpretation on those facts that they wish <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now pursuing quite a separate matter <e> <s> the question relates to the development costs of the bae <e> <s> civil aircraft and i have done my best to answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the facts are not in dispute at all <e> <s> what i have said follows precisely what mr kaufman himself said in <e> <s> i can do no better than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the grant of million was converted into public dividend capital with effect from st december <e> <s> this was done for what were essentially technical reasons <e> <s> the public dividend capital was subsequently extinguished so that in effect the million reverted to the status of a grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i have answered the question on the order paper <e> <s> so far as the answer given in another place is concerned it was a precise and correct answer to the question that was asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it would be most inappropriate that we should refer in such terms to replies or statements made in another place <e> <s> as regards the million grant the money was paid to british aerospace and remained with british aerospace <e> <s> it was designated under different titles over a period of time <e> <s> it was first described as a grant it was then described as public dividend capital and the public dividend capital description was then extinguished <e> <s> but none of that alters the fact that first it was million and secondly it remained in the possession of british aerospace <e> <s> i do not think that those facts are in dispute <e> <s> nor can i see any grounds on which they should give rise to anxieties or doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to the noble lord lord diamond for the very warm welcome they have given nissan and their entry into the united kingdom <e> <s> i would be very anxious to join my welcome to the welcome they themselves have expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises three points <e> <s> first may i assure him that his arithmetic is approximately correct <e> <s> as regards regional grant assistance this is precisely the same figure to which any other company in similar circumstances would be entitled <e> <s> on the per cent <e> <s> local content we are satisfied that nissan will succeed in achieving that sort of level <e> <s> we will be monitoring progress but i think it will be quite unrealistic now to start thinking in terms of nissan failing to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock is quite right in saying that no firm decision on the site has yet been taken <e> <s> it is a matter for the company to decide <e> <s> i understand it is looking at a number of locations but has not yet decided whether the final location will be in a development area or a special development area but under the heads of agreement it will be in one or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point raised by my noble friend the timetable is in fact set out very <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether there might not be some slight misunderstanding on this <e> <s> the phrase that is used in the statement is greenfield site <e> <s> i believe this is a technical phrase used by people who construct factories and so forth <e> <s> i understand that one can have a greenfield site which is not in fact a green field <e> <s> the term refers to being able to start on a clear site so that there is an easy straightforward development project <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the major point raised by the noble lord lord dean is concerned the figure of that i quoted was a net figure which took into account all the repercussive effects both the favourable ones because it opens up a big new market for our component manufacturers as well as any that are potentially unfavourable on manufacturers in the united kindom <e> <s> but we believe that most of the production will be at the expense of imports and therefore it is a clear net gain to the united kingdom economy <e> <s> with regard to the other point that the noble lord raised speaking as a previous secretary of state for trade i would say that my own experience was that while the japanese were very tough bargainers they always adhered scrupulously to any bargain that they struck <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is trying to press me on the precise details of the timetable <e> <s> i wonder whether i may look into his point because on this i can do no more than tell him what is in the heads of agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the phrase is one which is customarily used in this field and it carries its customary value <e> <s> it includes i am told parts materials labour and overheads <e>", "<cs> may i first congratulate the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for being first in to bat on the committee stage of this most important bill <e> <s> i only wish that it could have been possible for me in due course to congratulate him on knocking the first ball to the boundary but i fear that will not be so <e> <s> i hope that in due course i will be able to say that the noble lord has been caught and bowled <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon ranged very widely in moving this amendment <e> <s> he started by referring to the results of the previous division as a close-run thing <e> <s> i am sorry to have to remind him of the implications of that phrase <e> <s> the words were used by his grace the duke of wellington when referring to his victory at the battle of waterloo over the defeated emperor napoleon and i am somewhat surprised to find the noble lord lord stoddart casting himself in the role of the emperor napoleon <e> <s> he then proceeded to quote in his support procedures in the united states <e> <s> of course the most important thing in the united states is that telecommunications are in the private sector and not the public sector <e> <s> whether the noble lords reliance upon united states precedents means that he has now seen the light of day i do not know <e> <s> but at any rate it would be a most helpful conversion <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain your lordships for more than a few minutes <e> <s> there is very little that i can add to the words of wisdom uttered by the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> i listened with great fascination to the description given by the noble lord lord bruce of donington of the qualities that would be required by a candidate appearing before the select committee <e> <s> the person who would best meet those qualifications is a distinguished lawyer a politician or a television personality and it does not seem to me that any of those three would be outstanding candidates for this post <e>", "<cs> i of course understand the concern that has been expressed both in this debate and earlier this afternoon that the director general should be a person who has the kind of knowledge and experience that will fit him to do what will be a job of outstanding importance and indeed of difficulty <e> <s> we intend to appoint as director someone both with relevant experience and with authority who will measure up to the most exacting standards <e> <s> i entirely agree with what my noble friend lord campbell of alloway said that this is another illustration of the old argument about the merits of specialists and generalists <e> <s> but of course the amendment goes very much further than that <e> <s> contrary to what the noble lord lord bruce of donington said when he described the amendment as one which set down parameters of a very general kind the fact of the matter is that the amendment creates a statutory straitjacket and this is the kind of thing which is wrong <e>", "<cs> i entirely accept the point made by the noble lord lord spens that this is intended to be a probing amendment <e> <s> it is on that basis that i deal with it <e> <s> clause says that the director general shall be appointed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon made it perfectly clear that his amendment was based on purely political motives <e> <s> so far as that is concerned the matter was settled on th june last year in the general election and it is quite unnecessary for me to add anything to that <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran says this amendment seeks to achieve two things <e> <s> first of all to ensure that a period of reappointment should not exceed four years as opposed to the five years provided in the bill and that there should not be more than one re-appointment making a total of nine years in all <e> <s> while it might well be that the individual concerned would not want to serve any longer than that period of time i could not entirely accept the noble countesss argument that after nine years anyone would be exhausted by the arduous nature of this job <e>", "<cs> only <e>", "<cs> i was in course of rising to my feet when the noble lord lord bruce of donington kindly interrupted me and i gather that he would have preferred that i had not given way to him <e> <s> having listened to his speech i share that view <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord lord stoddart lies in exactly what he himself said <e> <s> he said you may well need younger people <e> <s> of course you may well need younger people but it does not follow that an individual who has served with complete satisfaction and with great distinction should necessarily have his term of office brought to an end <e> <s> this is the whole point <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether on the wider issue i may make just one comment which i hope will be acceptable on both sides of the committee <e> <s> however good an organisation is there is always room for improvement <e> <s> british telecom is better and more efficient today than it was three years ago one would expect that <e> <s> we hope that it will continue to be more efficient in the future than it has been in the past <e> <s> perhaps i may leave the matter on that basis <e>", "<cs> i entirely take the point <e> <s> there would be no bar on the recruitment of staff on specific short-term contracts <e> <s> i was talking in general terms and i used what i thought was a suitable qualification by saying that generally they would be remunerated on civil service levels <e> <s> there would be no obstacle of the sort my noble friend refers to <e>", "<cs> of course the number of does not appear in the statute it is merely an estimate given in the explanatory memorandum <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to follow the noble lord lord stoddart down the tangled paths that he has been traversing <e> <s> therefore i shall stick to what the amendment itself deals with <e> <s> let me start by saying that there is an entirely legitimate field in which staff should be consulted and where appropriate this should be done through trade unions though not exclusively so <e> <s> but having said that it is clear that this amendment is intended to go very much further <e>", "<cs> once the bill is enacted the director will be charged by parliament with carrying out certain onerous duties <e> <s> it follows from this that he must have freedom to appoint the individuals he <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could quote me any case where the staffing complement of an office of this kind has been laid down in statute <e> <s> i am quite unaware of any such instance <e> <s> if i may take the noble lords argument in general what he is saying is that one ought to learn from experience <e> <s> i am entirely prepared to accept that and that is the basis of the argument that i put to your lordships <e> <s> what i am saying and said on one of the earlier amendments is that one ought to start with a tightly-knit organisation <e> <s> our belief is that we could effectively staff this office with people <e> <s> if experience shows that the director cannot carry out his duties with people the staffing level will be reconsidered and i said specifically that it will be sympathetically reconsidered <e> <s> but neither side of the committee would want us to staff the office beyond what the requirements of the job are <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to get the right number <e>", "<cs> the point of principle raised by these two amendments is precisely the same as the one that we were debating on amendment no <e> <s> namely the extent of parliamentary control over matters of this kind <e> <s> these are not i suggest the kind of matters which ought to be the subject of detailed individual parliamentary control <e> <s> the director general is a crown servant and the salaries of other crown servants are not fixed by parliament in the way that this amendment would propose <e> <s> the salaries of people who occupy comparable posts for example the director general of fair trading are not fixed by parliament <e> <s> there is no reason why the director general of oftel should be picked out and dealt with in any other manner <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is not entitled to place that interpretation upon what i said <e> <s> i am not saying that this post would necessarily be paid at the same level as that of the director general of fair trading <e> <s> i am making no statement of that kind <e> <s> i was comparing the nature of the post which is that of a crown servant with the nature of the post which is held by the director general of fair trading <e> <s> obviously when it comes to fixing the precise salary of the individual concerned there is a very wide range of factors to be taken into account not least the onerous nature of the duties concerned <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord molloy has strayed very far from the substance of this amendment <e> <s> i certainly do not propose as far as this is concerned to enter into a debate on the salaries paid to the chairmen of nationalised industries <e> <s> with regard to the point made by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe the staff of oftel will in general be civil service staff and will be paid on civil service scales <e> <s> the director general i have very carefully described as a crown servant <e> <s> i have made no statement one way or another about the level of his remuneration which is clearly a matter to which a great deal of thought has to be given <e> <s> i hope noble lords agree that it is hardly appropriate for me to be entering into a salary negotiation in your lordships chamber this evening <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of your lordships if i intervened now because i suspect that the noble lords amendment and what he has said are based on an understandable failure to follow through the particular way the statute is drafted <e> <s> if the noble lord turns over the page he will find in clause the words <e>", "<cs> i felt that as a matter of law the point was so plain and obvious that i would try to save your lordships time but as it is obviously not as clear as i assumed it was i need to go into it in greater detail <e> <s> the points raised by the noble lord lord weinstock arise on later amendments which we shall be discussing in detail <e> <s> but let me take the specific amendment tabled by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> as he says it is an amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> to a lawyer as distinguished as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i should have thought that the statute was plain in the extreme <e>", "<cs> as far as small businesses are concerned this is one of those fortunate matters on which harmony rather than discord prevails <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon admits that he was once a small businessman <e> <s> it would be unkind of me to ask whether it was a competitive or a noncompetitive business that he ran <e> <s> my most distinguished predecessor in my present office lord lever of manchester introduced a large number of measures to assist small businesses <e> <s> my government have introduced more than a hundred such measures and when i was a minister at the treasury i was a member of a team which tried to carry on that extremely good work <e> <s> so we all start therefore from the point of view of goodwill towards small businesses <e>", "<cs> this is an important matter and one on which i think everyone would share the general aspirations underlying the amendment namely that we all want to see an efficient progressive and profitable industry in this country <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said that british telecom at present obtains per cent <e> <s> of all its supplies from united kingdom sources <e> <s> that is entirely true <e> <s> he went on to say that in future there is a risk that as a private company they might wish to buy more from abroad <e> <s> perhaps i ought to start by saying that there is no formal control of british telecom at present and we see no good reason why there should be formal control in the future <e> <s> i am sure that the close relationship between british telecom and its united kingdom suppliers will continue in future <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon endeavoured to widen the debate on to import controls <e> <s> let me say this to the noble lord <e> <s> the economic policies of the labour government were disastrous for britain <e> <s> they ended up by being disastrous for the labour party but that of course was a good thing <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord why then is he advocating that we put it in the legislation <e>", "<cs> rarely have i listened to such intellectual muddle as that displayed by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> he says that the reason we cannot catch out the europeans in unfair practices is that they do not put it in the legislation whereupon he advocates that we put it in the legislation no doubt to enable the europeans to catch us out <e>", "<cs> i am trying to answer this point <e> <s> the noble lord has spoken at quite excessive length with very little enlightenment in what he says <e> <s> he will perhaps enable me to complete what i want to say <e>", "<cs> this is an obligation <e> <s> the bill itself says that is shall be a duty <e> <s> this amendment says that it shall be the duty of the director general and the secretary of state to do certain things <e> <s> i am prepared to accept an assurance from my noble friend lord trenchard that his amendment is meaningless indeed that might be so in which event it is difficult to see why it should be put into the bill <e> <s> but if it has any meaning it can only have a meaning in the sense that it imposes an obligation on the director general and the secretary of state to take action which was contrary to our international obligations <e>", "<cs> but my noble friend is now saying that his amendment will have no effect <e> <s> the amendment either has an effect or it has no effect <e> <s> if it has no effect there is no point in including it <e> <s> if it does have an effect it is an effect which is contrary to our international obligations <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is the best possible illustration of the legal maxim <e>", "<cs> i assume that the intention behind my noble friends amendment is that the policy to be followed by the united kingdom in international telecommunications organisations should represent the wider national interest and not merely the narrower interest of any one body or sector <e> <s> the government wholeheartedly endorse this policy <e> <s> the department of trade and industry is in fact already in the process of consulting telecommunications interests on the future arrangements for united kingdom representation in the international organisations which are mainly inter-governmental <e> <s> the basis of these arrangements must be that there should be adequate consultation within the united kingdom on the policies to be followed and that where governmental or regulatory policy issues are involved or where there are difficult conflicts of interest government itself should where appropriate normally lead or at least determine the line to be taken <e>", "<cs> there are many instances where the test of the national interest or the public interest <e>", "<cs> yes and the noble lord is entirely confirming what i said that we have spent a very long time ensuring that clause is right <e> <s> he himself has contributed to that discussion i am most grateful to him for doing so <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty in dealing with the arguments that have been advanced in favour of this amendment because the noble lord lord bruce of donington went to great lengths to explain that his amendment was different from amendment no <e> <s> which had been moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and which was rejected by your lordships last week <e> <s> but the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran went to great lengths to explain that the amendment of the noble lord lord bruce of donington was precisely the same as the one that he himself had moved <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> in substance the two amendments are the same <e> <s> they endeavour to set up a council or a body above the director general to whom the director general stands in some sort of relationship let me put it like that and the arguments for or against the creation of a body of that nature are very much the same in both instances <e> <s> there are differences in the detail of the two proposals but so far as the substance of the two proposals is concerned it is essentially the same <e> <s> in fact the drafting of subsection of the proposed new clause of the noble lord lord bruce is almost identical to that of amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> let me put it like this <e> <s> there is therefore a degree of similarity between the two <e> <s> i was making my point not as a controversial one i do not know why both noble lords are so sensitive about the parentage of their amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord supports me in his interruption <e> <s> i was merely drawing attention to what i thought was a fairly obvious point that both amendments were intended to cover much the same ground <e> <s> with that restatement and not wishing in any way to drive a wedge between the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and the noble lord lord bruce of donington perhaps we might agree that both amendments were designed to set up a new body which would stand in a position of adviser assistant or helper to the director general <e>", "<cs> as the point of principle raised in amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e> <s> there can be no question of the amendments being voted on or moved together <e> <s> it is simply that i think it would be for the convenience of the committee because i should like to make certain suggestions in this field which i hope will be helpful <e> <s> it would be more convenient if i could make them in response to the views of your lordships on the whole of the field <e>

hope therefore that i shall be forgiven if i speak at considerable length upon it <e> <s> it would only be right for me to analyse the background situation in order to indicate why we have come to certain conclusions <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first question raised by my noble friend we have of course met this point on almost every single occasion upon which either this or any other bill provides for a statutory instrument to be made and invariably the government have proposed the negative procedure and invariably the opposition have proposed the affirmative procedure <e> <s> the time may come when we have to fight this one out <e> <s> we ourselves believe that the negative procedure is the correct procedure in a case of this kind <e> <s> so far as the days are concerned perhaps i may write to my noble friend to elucidate the particular point that he raises <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely correct in so far as he says that the rpi minus <e>", "<cs> may i first reply to the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to read the statement that i made <e> <s> this is a very complex and difficult matter <e> <s> the statement was very carefully considered <e> <s> the short answer to his point is that the licence which will be made at the same time as the order is in its final form a signed licence <e> <s> that is essential if we are to meet a criticism that the secretary of state might alter the terms of the licence between the time that parliament saw it and the time that it was granted <e> <s> if parliament does not like the licence in the form that it has been granted it then votes against the statutory order <e> <s> if it strikes down the statutory order then <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the point has been noted and will he dealt with in the appropriate fashion <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the point that my noble friend lord mottistone is making <e> <s> the governments view is that the mandatory standards against which the terminal apparatus must be approved should be what is necessary but no more than is necessary to safeguard the staff and property of network operators and to protect the interests of the whole community of subscribers <e> <s> the noble lords amendment rests on the view that in this respect subscribers can look after their own interests without the help of regulation <e> <s> that is not a view that we could entirely accept <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the point that the noble lord has raised <e> <s> i was merely endeavouring to confine the examples i had given to the minimum necessary to make the argument that i was putting forward <e>", "<cs> i should be very happy to look at the question of whether or not further definition of the word meter is required <e> <s> so far as the point raised by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon is concerned there is no such thing as absolute accuracy when you are measuring physical quantities <e> <s> those of your lordships who are engineers will remember that variations are always quoted at the same time as a measurement is quoted that is the figure is given as plus or minus a certain accepted degree of variation about the absolute figure <e> <s> so that the word sufficiently is really intended to reflect the practicalities of life <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the point that the noble lord lord bruce of donington is making <e> <s> i shall endeavour to table the amendments at the earliest possible date <e> <s> i should think that the right course would be for the noble lord to study the amendments after i have tabled them and if there is then any point that he wishes to raise on them we can come back to them at the report stage <e> <s> i hope that that meets the very legitimate point that he is raising <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be for the convenience of the committee if i speak not only to amendment no <e> <s> a but also to the batch of related amendments which in fact are amendments nos <e> <s> a c a aandno <e> <s> aa <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will forgive me if i say that this has been covered in the other batch of amendments <e> <s> it is simply the way in which the amendments have been drafted <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> fell by the wayside to use the particular phrase that i had adopted <e> <s> they are subsumed in the other group of amendments nos <e> <s> a a c a a and aa <e> <s> i wonder whether with that explanation my noble friend would see her way to withdrawing this amendment <e> <s> otherwise it is simply duplication <e>", "<cs> i confirm the understanding of the noble lord of the position that we shall be building on clause <e> <s> i will use my best endeavours to ensure the amendments are tabled as promptly as possible <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mottistone has explained clearly that the purpose of these amendments is to divide british telecom into its component parts each organised with a separate subsidiary and then to privatise each part separately <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is entirely correct <e> <s> complying with these requirements poses a problem but the essential difference is that in wishing to privatise british telecom these problems would need to be solved before one could privatise <e> <s> that is why there is the delay <e> <s> if british telecom is sold as a single unit as we propose these problems can then be solved properly in due time and we would hope as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> i started by saying that this was one of those areas where one had to make a choice and adhere to it <e> <s> one could not possibly privatise british telecom and then a few years afterwards say that it could have been a great deal better had it been privatised in a series of separate companies rather than <e>", "<cs> may i take the specific amendment raised by the noble earl <e> <s> to a very large degree i dealt with this point when i was talking about the previous amendment moved by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> we appreciate that problems can arise in relation to the wide spread of activities undertaken by british telecom and the importance that its apparatus-supply activities its apparatus manufacturing business and its network operations should all be conducted on an arms-length basis <e> <s> the route that we have chosen to deal with this particular problem is to insert terms in the licence under which a separate subsidiary company would be established for the apparatus manufacturing business and open tendering procedures in relation to it would be adopted <e> <s> the licence also requires separate accounting and reporting arrangements <e> <s> i think that in practice therefore we have very fully covered the point which the noble earl raised <e>", "<cs> the position in fact is that british telecom at present has no subsidiary company and from that point of view therefore one could say that the amendment does not arise <e> <s> but i well understand what the noble earl had in mind <e> <s> i assumed that this amendment flowed on from the previous amendments which we had been looking at where the proposal was that british telecom should be divided into a number of subsidiary companies <e> <s> but there is a considerable overlap between this amendment and the previous one which is why it was necessary for me to delay your lordships by repeating many of the observations that i had made on the previous amendment <e> <s> i hope very much that that explanation satisfies the noble earl <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon will be aware a new clause in the same terms was twice moved in another place and was twice defeated on a division <e> <s> the noble lord will not be surprised therefore if i say that i could not accept the clause <e> <s> the reason quite simply is that a statutory provision of this kind would be out of keeping with the relationship between the government and british telecom as a private sector company <e> <s> this is not to say that we are out of sympathy with the spirit of the provision <e> <s> what we believe is wrong is its incorporation in statute <e>", "<cs> first may i thank the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge and my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for their personal support <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington dons the cloak of indignation like a well-worn garment <e> <s> it does of <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> as the noble lord will really realise i was saying that if such a statute were introduced it would be a subject for legitimate debate in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord rochester has played a prominent and valuable part in the encouragement of wider share ownership <e> <s> in their turn the government have taken important steps to encourage share ownership by employees particularly in the tax field <e> <s> the noble lord lord grimond made a number of very helpful suggestions <e> <s> i shall most certainly refer what he has said to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> i have also noted what the noble lord lord weinstock said and i shall draw the attention of my right honourable friend to his remarks as well <e>", "<cs> i should like first to deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> the intention was that these notes should be generally available <e> <s> that is the normal common practice when notes of this sort are prepared <e> <s> if something has gone wrong with the distribution arrangements i can only apologise to the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> i shall have urgent measures taken to ensure that the matter is put right <e>", "<cs> the comments made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington in proposing the amendment went much wider than the amendment itself <e> <s> they extended over the whole field of the structure that was to be adopted for privatisation <e> <s> i can perhaps deal with that at a rather later stage <e> <s> so far as <e>", "<cs> the point here is that the word dispose includes gift as well as sale <e> <s> the reason for the gift is precisely the point raised by the noble lord lord rochester that some free shares will be made available to employees <e> <s> we want to ensure that the legislation is drafted in a form that enables that to be done <e> <s> so far as the great mass of shares is concerned the obvious intention is to get full value for them <e> <s> one reason for including the consent of the treasury is to make certain that this is done <e>", "<cs> the issue of the debentures is necessary to avoid a tax consequence that would arise if the national loans fund advances were simply repaid in the ordinary way <e> <s> the intention is not in any way to relieve the successor company of the debt burden it inherits from british telecom <e> <s> we are really talking about clause in this respect <e> <s> the clause is necessary to close off a potential tax gain on the early <e>", "<cs> the debentures as i have explained will be issued in place of nlf loans <e> <s> they will remain in being as a liability of the successor company <e> <s> they will be subject to whatever may be the appropriate repayment terms <e> <s> privatisation will be carried out by the issue by the new company to the secretary of state of securities <e> <s> those securities will form the foundation of the flotation <e> <s> the excepted liabilities as they are called are quite a separate issue <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might start by assuring the noble lord that i am in complete disagreement with his views on matters of economic policy <e> <s> i shall be only too glad to debate these methods with him on a more appropriate occasion <e> <s> i would only ask him to compare the state of the economy today with the appalling state it was in when it was brought to its knees under a labour government in when they had to go crawling to the imf to bail them out of bankruptcy <e> <s> so let us leave those matters on one side <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to float them i am always prepared to argue them with him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington put down a question for written answer and my reply to that question gave him a very great deal of information which is printed in <e>", "<cs> i am not excluding the possibility that foreign investors may purchase some part of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is raising a number of points which really relate to the flotation <e> <s> i doubt whether it is possible to answer them specifically at this stage <e> <s> clearly before the flotation takes place the new company will have to be incorporated and it will need its articles of association and a prospectus will have to be issued <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may expand upon the reply that i gave earlier because i now discover that a draft of the articles of association was in fact laid in another place <e> <s> it is therefore available <e> <s> that is the first point <e> <s> secondly as i said the equity shares will all carry the same weight but in addition the secretary of state will hold a special share to protect certain provisions designed to ensure the independence of the company <e> <s> the equity shares all carry the same weight <e> <s> the noble lord lord weinstock was referring to the per cent retained by the secretary of state as compared with the per cent <e> <s> sold <e> <s> all of those shares carry an equal weight but in addition the secretary of state will hold a special share to protect certain provisions designed to ensure the independence of the company <e> <s> this has been done in the case of other privatisations <e>", "<cs> i should only like to say if i may in relation to that last point that we have made it clear that we adopt a policy of not intervening in the management of the company by virtue of the per cent <e> <s> shareholding <e> <s> that statement has been made quite clearly and publicly <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that at all <e> <s> in fact on the contrary i said that all equity shares would have exactly the same rights but there would be an additional special share held by the government <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is now trying to forecast what will happen in the future <e> <s> he must realise that the government have made it quite clear that they do not propose using their shareholding as a means of controlling the management or operations of the company <e>", "<cs> i shall not disappoint the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> the order-making powers for setting a new target investment limit under clause are exercisable by statutory instrument and subject to the negative resolution procedure by virtue of clause <e> <s> that applies the negative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree that logic is necessarily the determining factor in these matters but the needs of the revenue and the circumstances of the trade also enter into decisions on issues of this kind <e> <s> as the noble lord will be well aware my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer is introducing his budget on th march and he will pay regard to all representations that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not agree that an increase in duty is an incentive to additional consumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i doubt whether the average burglar inquires whether a burglar alarm is liable to vat before he decides to burgle premises <e> <s> the position is that there is a great deal of expenditure which people regard as a necessity but which nevertheless is chargeable to vat <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is obviously well acquainted with the ways of burglars <e> <s> his knowledge in this field certainly exceeds my own <e> <s> i remind him that the original installation of a burglar alarm in a new building and the first installation in an existing building are both zero-rated <e> <s> to that extent therefore he and i are on the same side <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is a great expert on the fiscal aspects of these matters if not on the burglarious ones <e> <s> concerning the latter part of his question a good reply remains a good one even if it is an old one <e>", "<cs> my lords there is considerable dispute about whether a burglar is assessable under cases i and ii of schedule d as carrying on a trade or profession but as far as i know burglars are not registered for vat purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true as my noble friend says that both inconvenience and a waste of police time are caused by faulty burglar alarms but i doubt whether this is really related to the question of the charging of vat on maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an expert on the habits or philosophy of burglars and i hesitate to be drawn further into this field <e>", "<cs> my lords that strays rather outside the ambit of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords a lot of other changes have occurred since the beginning of the industrial revolution <e> <s> last year our total exports of manufactured goods amounted to billion that is a very considerable achievement and we look forward to doing better in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords historical researches are no doubt of great interest to himself <e> <s> the data available going back to the times of the industrial revolution are suspect but it appears that there was a surplus in our trade of manufactures for most if not all of the intervening period <e> <s> nevertheless the important point is that very great changes do take place over a period of time as long as this and the important thing is to adapt to those changes and to take advantage of them <e> <s> this is in fact what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords a very great number of changes have taken place in recent years <e> <s> the fact that our manufacturing industry is not doing better than it is is well illustrated by the fact that in the years between and our share of world trade was halved and import penetration increased by per cent <e> <s> most of this was associated with a falling degree of competitiveness in british industry most of which was due to excessive increases in pay not matched by rises in productivity <e> <s> in recent years that trend has been changed and productivity in manufactures now shows an increase of approximately per cent <e> <s> per man as compared with the figures for <e>", "<cs> the situation my lords is changing <e> <s> last year our total exports of manufactures amounted to billion compared with billion in the year before and in the coming year we expect to see an increase of per cent <e> <s> in volume terms <e> <s> in addition there has been a substantial surplus on the balance of payments while in there was a deficit on the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords the general point made by my noble friend is entirely valid <e> <s> we earn a substantial surplus on our balance of payments on invisibles including services <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by my noble friend is entirely valid <e> <s> we export about per cent <e> <s> of our total output of goods and services <e> <s> japan exports about per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> only <e>", "<cs> my lords this goes well outside the ambit of the question on the order paper <e> <s> it is normal in the early stages of a recovery for consumer expenditure to increase but then that very rapidly moves over to an increase in investment exports and manufacturing activity <e> <s> this in fact is what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords on the last part of the noble lords supplementary we expect to see an increase in exports of manufactured goods in line with the estimate given by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer namely about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever we are asked for information in a particular form we always endeavour to supply it in the form in which it is asked <e> <s> in our day-to-day lives we conduct our transactions in terms of money of the day <e> <s> wages and salaries are paid in terms of money of the day and goods and services are bought and sold in terms of money of the day <e> <s> it is perfectly right and proper therefore that government expenditure should be planned on the same thesis <e> <s> wherever comparisons are made there is sometimes merit in statistical terms in expressing comparisons also in terms of constant prices and this is in fact extensively done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the noble lords attention to table in the public expenditure white paper which gives the information precisely in the form in which he is requesting it <e>", "<cs> my lords the suggestion by the noble lord that information is not available is not correct <e> <s> it is set out perfectly clearly in the public <e>", "<cs> my lords the point raised by my noble friend is an important one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not recognise any of the allegations that the noble lord makes but that is perhaps not surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords we have in fact got there before the noble lord because this years public expenditure white paper contains two such tables for which he asks <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures are set down fully and completely <e> <s> the noble lord will find a vast amount of information in all the governments statistical returns <e> <s> i hesitated to bore your lordships by reading out dozens of examples which i have brought along with me <e> <s> so far as debates are concerned that is a matter for the usual channels and not for me <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a most interesting account of the world as seen by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon through the rose coloured spectacles of his youth when he was an <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble lord lord bruce of donington does not share my view that in the last few years british telecommunications have made great improvements in the service that they offer to their customers <e> <s> i do not in any way associate this improvement with the fact that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has left the employ of the post office because that would be to commit the fallacy of <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect is not the amendment to leave out the clause because we are on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear there are some procedural difficulties <e> <s> we are not in committee and therefore a motion that we resume the house equally has no meaning <e> <s> there was a little local difficulty that we were trying to resolve for the mutual convenience of your lordships <e> <s> there is nothing more to it than that <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is taking much too narrow a view of what the bill does <e>", "<cs> and my lords this bill considerably extends the field of competition in these particular areas <e> <s> i am well aware of the noble lords views <e> <s> i do not accept them <e> <s> they are not accepted by my noble friends <e> <s> i do not believe that the arguments which he is putting forward are well justified either on the facts or otherwise <e>", "<cs> no my lords i believe that the primary explanation is an improvement in the efficiency of bt <e> <s> that improvement has taken place under the stimulus of competition <e> <s> the more competition we can provide in this field the better the service that is likely to be available <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who is much involved in the manufacturing industry is probably in a better position to answer that than i am <e> <s> what has happened in this field is on the record and is perfectly clear <e> <s> under the stimulus of competition very substantial improvements have been made <e> <s> we hope to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry <e> <s> the noble lord has already had two attempts at this <e> <s> if he wishes to make a speech which we will listen to with very great interest he is always entitled to do so but there are certain limits of procedure when we come to the report stage of a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord bruce of donington and i have both been reproved by the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge for making second reading speeches perhaps it would be more appropriate if we discuss part v of the bill when we come to part v instead of endeavouring to discuss it on clause <e> <s> we do of course have a complete answer to the points that the noble lord is making but i do not think that it would be right to go into detail in a discussion on clause on matters which are relevant to part v <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might reply briefly to the points that have been made <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone and to my noble friend lady macleod of borve as well as the noble lords lord somers and lord weinstock for their support for the proposals that the government have put forward <e> <s> we have genuinely tried to meet the wishes of the house in this matter <e> <s> there was hardly a noble lord who spoke on the last occasion who accepted that the amendment as drafted in committee stage that is amendment no <e> <s> had been satisfactorily drafted <e> <s> we were trying to get the words right and to put it in the right place <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it would assist our proceedings if i say that i would be prepared to recommend that the house accept both these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i would equally just oppose it <e> <s> i spoke at great length on this specific subject in detail in moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment was approved by your lordships by a large majority <e> <s> there is really nothing for me to add to what i said on that occasion or to add to the verdict of your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i started by saying that i would oppose the amendment and i thought i had made that quite clear <e> <s> if i did not perhaps i might repeat it <e> <s> the second point is that when i spoke on amendment no <e> <s> with permission i spoke also at <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall do so if the noble lord presses me <e> <s> he says that there was no reference to geographical location but indeed there was <e> <s> the whole point of amendment no <e> <s> was to remove among other things the words geographical location because that is what gave rise to the difficulty in the case of usage charges <e> <s> i said specifically that under the present system operated by british telecom and it is a very good system i do not want the noble lord to think that i am criticising bt i could put through a telephone call from westminster to lambeth and have to pay the same amount that i should have to pay for a telephone call between two other places <e> <s> it is that kind of discrimination which in fact at present exists but it is a perfectly proper and legitimate form of discrimination and i really do not see what objection there is to it <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will endeavour briefly to reply to at least some of the points which have been raised in the debate perhaps not briefly enough having regard to the hour of the night but certainly too briefly having regard to the importance of the contributions which have been made to the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the main purpose of the budget proposals was to improve the efficiency of operation of the british economy <e> <s> that will produce in due course changes both in the absolute level and in the distribution of incomes <e> <s> those changes which will be to the benefit of the british people as a whole can only be measured after the event <e> <s> so far as gini coefficients for past years are concerned they reflect not only changes in taxation but also changes in the distribution of pre-tax incomes including the effects of demographic changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> no my lords none of that is true <e> <s> i do not know what newspapers the noble lord reads but he will find a fairly universal approval of the proposals contained in my right honourable friends budget <e> <s> the important thing is that we need a growth in output in this country and the budget measures are designed towards that end <e> <s> from this all of our people will benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i feared that somebody would ask me that <e> <s> the gini co-efficient is the most widely used summary measure of the degree of inequality in an income distribution <e> <s> it can most easily be understood by considering a lorenz curve of the income distribution <e> <s> the area between the lorenz curve and the diagonal line of complete equality as a proportion of the triangular area between the curves of complete equality and inequality gives the value of the gini co-efficient <e>", "<cs> my lords the comment made by my noble friend about the removal of the national insurance surcharge is a very important one <e> <s> i should only like to add one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond pioneered a great deal of work on this particular subject <e> <s> every year in <e>", "<cs> my lords that was only one item in a very wide-ranging budget <e>", "<cs> my lords no none of those things is true nor do they follow from one another <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that vat itself is not a regressive tax <e> <s> for example food is exempted from vat and this has a very considerable bearing on the distribution of the burden of that tax <e> <s> the gini co-efficient as indeed do all measures of equality or inequality of the distribution of incomes also reflects the distribution of gross incomes before tax and the most important point is to obtain a growth in those gross incomes <e> <s> this is what we are aiming to do <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord was paying attention to what i said earlier but i said that every year in <e>", "<cs> my lords none of that is true <e> <s> the single most important measure in the budget was the increase in the income tax thresholds by per cent compared with a rate of inflation of just over per cent <e> <s> this big increase in the thresholds is primarily of benefit to the people at the bottom of the income scale <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly respond <e> <s> the answer to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the clause as it stands at present is defective and what we set out to do i am certain we have achieved it is to ensure that the protection we all want to give is given <e> <s> we have done this in two ways first of all by being absolutely specific by using the word must so that there is no room for doubt or argument and secondly by insisting that the exception should be put into the standard itself <e> <s> this is a very much better protection than is available under <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that most of your lordships will feel as i do that we have been here not once but many times before <e> <s> frankly there is no difference between anybody in your lordships house over the general principle involved <e> <s> where we differ is on how effect should be given to that general principle <e> <s> your lordships at the committee stage passed an amendment specifically designed to achieve the objectives set out in the noble lords latest amendment and in response to that i moved two amendments at the beginning of the report stage <e> <s> those amendments were accepted on a division <e> <s> we believe that the method of dealing with this problem set out in those amendments was much more effective than the method which the noble lord has endeavoured to set out not only in this amendment but in various previous amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak to the amendment to the amendment <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to establish a united kingdom advisory body <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b prescribes that its members shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i entirely take the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i was not endeavouring to erect any argument on the use of the word prescribe but merely trying to summarise the general effect of the two amendments <e> <s> but the kind of body proposed in the amendment to the amendment in fact is not all that dissimilar from the telecommunications council or the telecommunications advisory body which we discussed in very considerable detail earlier in our proceedings <e> <s> i do not in any way dispute that the director has a difficult job to do and that it would be useful for him to have specialist advice and information which will guide him in the exercise of his functions <e> <s> but i really do not think that a general advisory body of the kind proposed in these amendments is the best way to provide the director with such advice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with the leave of the house ask whether we have really put amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we had an amendment to no <e> <s> <e> <s> that amendment having now been withdrawn do we not now have to have amendment no <e> <s> put <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the noble lords pardon if i have made a mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not at all clear just how the system proposed by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran would in fact work because his amendment would appear to have been written in the light of the earlier amendments which have been withdrawn for the appointment of a top-tier advisory body <e> <s> if there were that kind of situation one could understand a proposal that in effect there should be a requirement or a proposal that if the recommendation or the views of one of the other bodies was not acceptable to the director it could be referred to the top body <e> <s> but under the proposal which we now have there is no such top body <e> <s> the director performs that function <e> <s> if a recommendation is made for example by the advisory committee on the disabled or the elderly it then becomes a matter for the director himself specifically to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision of public call boxes is one of the extremely important matters covered by clause a <e> <s> under clause the director is required to exercise his functions so as to satisfy all reasonable demands for such services subject to the conditions stated <e> <s> this function will be discharged through conditions inserted in bts licence and it is one of the directors duties to monitor compliance with licence conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission of the house i do not rise to the bait offered by the noble lord but i simply wish if i may be permitted to do so to give an explanation on one specific point the noble lord raised <e> <s> that was the question of the disabled the elderly and the small businesses <e> <s> the government amendment on that point which required the directors report to cover matters affecting them flowed from the decision to appoint special advisory bodies for the disabled the elderly and for small businesses <e> <s> these bodies were required to report annually to the director and it was therefore perfectly natural that the director should specifically refer to matters falling within the remit of these bodies in his own annual report <e> <s> so that in that respect it does not differ from the way that the director would deal with the reports from the four country advisory councils <e>", "<cs> i do indeed congratulate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey on his knowledge of <e>", "<cs> it was a charming admission by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that he was wrapping up an old point to try to make it look like a new one <e>", "<cs> it was a confession because i think that in this instance i entirely agree with him <e> <s> there have been many matters on which we have had disagreements and there have been important points on which we have had agreements <e> <s> as a result the bill has been amended to the advantage of everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the noble lords point and he carries his leek with great distinction <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter very properly drew attention to the very serious damage which would be done to the organisation and to all those who work in it by a protracted period of delay such as the present amendment proposes <e> <s> noble lords opposite have shown throughout our debate great and proper solicitude for the people working in british telecom <e> <s> why therefore they would wish to inflict this damage upon them is something which i do not understand <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would permit me to put one single point to him <e> <s> your lordships debates are widely reported outside this house and great attention is paid to the noble lord <e> <s> i can tell him that the very firm intention of the government is that privatisation should take place this year <e>", "<cs> my lords when a similar amendment was tabled in committee i assured your lordships that we were not seeking any discretion here beyond what had been conferred in past privatisation legislation <e> <s> parliaments broad authorisation for the privatisation is being sought through this bill itself <e> <s> it would be impracticable and inappropriate to have to seek specific approval for the details of issues of securities and share sales in advance though the details will in fact emerge in a most public way on the occasion of british telecoms flotation <e> <s> on these grounds i suggested in committee that the amendment was unnecessary and could obstruct the flotation <e> <s> i have heard nothing since to change that view <e>", "<cs> my lords a similar amendment was moved in committee and i then said that it would run contrary to our general policy towards industry <e> <s> this still holds despite the change in prospective beneficiary under the present amendment from manufacturing industry to the communications industry <e> <s> it would be inconsistent with our general approach to use the proceeds of sale to set up a fund to hand out money to a particular sector as an addition to the existing instruments of regional and industrial policy <e> <s> the noble lords sponsoring this amendment have switched from manufacturing industry to the united kingdom communications industry <e> <s> it would be interesting to know just why <e> <s> one might ask for example why they have left out biotechnology which is another important new technology or the robotics industry which will have much to contribute to the future <e>", "<cs> my lords this is essentially a technical matter <e> <s> it does not raise any point of political importance and perhaps i might discuss it on that basis <e> <s> i am sure that would be acceptable to the noble lord lord bruce of donington because we should like to allay some of the anxieties that he has expressed <e> <s> i should start by saying that although clause is long and complex its main objective is to close a tax loophole <e> <s> that is a matter on which there would be no disagreement on any side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal with the technical point before dealing with the political point <e> <s> the powers in clauses and are expressed to be usable only in the period before the successor company ceases to be wholly owned by the crown <e> <s> that appers in clause and again in clause <e> <s> the target investment limit deals with the situation when and after the successor company is privatised <e> <s> that is the answer to the preliminary technical point raised by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e>", "<cs> my lords these are accounting matters <e> <s> they need therefore to be dealt with with care <e> <s> may i first explain why the deed of covenant obligation referred to in the bill as the excepted liabilities is to remain with the statutory corporation and the method by which the obligation will be met <e> <s> the deed of covenant obligation is to make payments to the bt and post office pension funds in respect of deficiencies relating to the service of post office employees before <e> <s> it would be incongruous for such an obligation to form part of bt plcs balance sheet <e> <s> anxieties were also expressed by the staff about this liability being left with the successor company and fears that the pension rights of existing members might be prejudiced if for any reason the new company could not or did not meet the obligation under the deed of covenant <e> <s> the solution adopted of not transferring the liability to the new company but leaving it with what is called the shell company with special provision in pargraph of the fifth schedule that the liability would be met was designed to meet both points of view that i have described above <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of myself and my noble friends i am most grateful for what the noble lords have said <e> <s> we have appreciated the very fair way in which the arguments have been conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always criticisms of any statistics that are produced <e> <s> the tpi is a valuable insight into the effect of price and tax changes on the great majority of people <e> <s> the budget proposals will reduce the tpi by percentage points <e> <s> the budget will be of benefit to all the million or so people who pay income tax <e> <s> so far as the people who are not paying income tax are concerned the rpi itself of course clearly indicates the impact of changing prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all like to see a cut of p in the pound in income tax but that would depend upon large reductions in government expenditure <e> <s> i am glad to see that we have the support of the noble lord lord bruce of donington for movements in that direction <e> <s> the fact that people on average earnings are paying more tax than they were in is in part a reflection of the fact that earnings have increased in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier in our exchanges the noble lord appeared to be criticising the fact that we were publishing two indexes while he would prefer to have one only <e> <s> he now seems to be advocating the publication of an even further range of statistics <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the noble lords allegation that the poorer sectors of the community have suffered under this government <e> <s> that is not in fact true at all <e> <s> if one looks at the level for example of the retirement pension and of supplementary benefits in real terms these both show improvements over this period <e>", "<cs> my lords i will with permission repeat in the form of a statement the reply being made in another place by my honourable friend the minister of state for industry to a private notice question <e> <s> the reply is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord mackie of benshie for their welcome to the development which has occurred <e> <s> the important thing is that this industry has been saved and we hope that it will have a good future <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the last point raised by the noble lord lord mackie because it is an important one <e> <s> the whole of the existing workforce of scott lithgow of will be taken over by trafalgar house <e> <s> of course the future will depend upon the success of the company under trafalgar houses ownership and direction in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock strikes entirely the right note when he refers to a feeling of relief and satisfaction <e> <s> this has been a happy outcome of what at one time might have been a real tragedy and it is something for which we all ought to be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords hope springs eternal and nowhere more than in the breast of the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> the noble lord went to considerable length to try and explain that this was not a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i entirely accept that his motives are pure but i regret to say that i cannot say the same for his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> on an issue as important as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i value and appreciate the tributes which have been paid not just to myself but more importantly to my noble friends who have shared the front bench with me <e> <s> i am precluded as the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington said from replying to second reading speeches which have been made including the relevant portion of the noble lords own speech <e> <s> i shall study everything that has been said and on specific points i shall write to the noble lords who raised them <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with the comments made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i should have thought that if these events illustrated anything it was in fact the existence of real freedom of the press in this country and that this is an issue which is right out in the public arena <e> <s> nothing is being suppressed <e> <s> an editor has taken a very firm stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the points which have been very validly and properly made by the noble lord <e> <s> in a very judicial fashion we do need to be very careful in what we say now <e> <s> i think it is important to draw attention to the fact that it was my right honourable friend the previous secretary of state for trade who insisted that the conditions safeguarding the editorial independence of <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing legislation regarding newspaper mergers is very detailed and does provide adequate safeguards in the present circumstances <e> <s> this is illustrated by the action which was taken by my right honourable friend the previous secretary of state for trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says but i do not think it is right at this stage either for me or for the government to intervene in this matter <e> <s> the law makes provision for the matter to be dealt with in certain circumstances clearly specified in the law <e> <s> i think we ought to allow it to rest at that for the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the noble lords concern about the present level of unemployment as i think we all do <e> <s> the encouraging point is the way in which the total level of employment including self-employment increased last year <e> <s> so far as the future is concerned i share the first part of the view he expressed namely that what is required is an improvement in the performance of the british economy which is to be achieved partly by the government following a responsible financial and economic policy as they are and partly by the efforts on both sides of industry to improve competitiveness <e> <s> however i do not share the noble lords view that this is best done by intervention on the part of the government <e> <s> in fact experience suggests the contrary <e>", "<cs> my lords all experience since the time of the industrial revolution indicates that an increased level of technology and improvements in methods of production lead in the end to higher output and therefore higher employment <e>", "<cs> my lords we all including the noble lord lord molloy need to learn from experience <e> <s> the circumstances which exist today are very different from the circumstances which existed in <e> <s> many of the measures taken then were appropriate to the needs of the time but the world has changed a very great deal since then <e> <s> the kind of centralised direction of the economy which was practised for example between and is not only no longer appropriate but would not produce the results which both the noble lord and myself would hope to see <e>", "<cs> my lords we can debate the issue of unemployment but unemployment is due to two major factors <e> <s> the first has been the world recession the second has been the increasing uncompetitiveness of british industry <e> <s> as far as both those factors are concerned the world is moving out of the recession and i am very glad to say that as a result of great efforts made on both sides the level of the competitiveness of british industry is improving <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friends analysis of the situation <e> <s> the position is that as a result of growing uncompetitiveness particularly in the s our level of costs became out of line with those in the rest of the industrialised world <e> <s> as a result both our exports suffered and our propensity to import increased <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as a former chief secretary to the treasury speaks with great skill <e> <s> there is of course no connection between the first part of his supplementary question and the second part <e> <s> as he himself acknowledges the figures to which he refers are assumptions they are not in any way forecasts <e>", "<cs> my lords the treasury makes the assumptions on precisely the same basis as they were made when the noble lord himself was chief secretary to the treasury <e> <s> it is standard form that the assumption taken for the first year in the public expenditure white paper is carried forward unchanged to subsequent years <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment there is a substantial increase in the amount of overtime being worked <e> <s> this is perfectly normal in the early stages of recovery <e> <s> there are certain obstacles to the employment of additional people <e> <s> one of them of course was the national insurance surcharge which has been abolished in the proposals announced by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> i do not accept the analysis to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> in fact it is essential that the government should follow a responsible financial and economic policy in order to reduce the level of inflation <e> <s> the high level of inflation in past years has been one of the major factors causing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i will repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry on the privatisation of british telecom <e> <s> the statement is as follows with permission mr speaker i should like to make a statement about privatisation of british telecom <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that the issues of policy relating to the privatisation of british telecom were debated at very great length in your lordships house very recently and i do not propose either to reopen those arguments or in fact to respond to the specific points made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington and the noble lord lord diamond so far as that is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i assumed that the noble lord was quoting from the latest available accounts <e> <s> i accept his explanation that he was quoting from a rather earlier set of accounts but of course it does not affect the substance of the explanation that i gave <e> <s> so far as the accounts for the year to st march are concerned these are the certified accounts they will be published in july which will be in ample time before the flotation takes place <e> <s> i am not at the moment in a position to tell him when the final draft of the memorandum and articles of association of bt plc will be available but i shall get in touch with him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with that point rightaway <e> <s> the noble lord referred to publishing a full prospectus <e> <s> it is of course intended to publish a full prospectus in this country <e> <s> that prospectus will be included in four prominent daily newspapers <e> <s> as a result the full prospectus will in fact be available to anybody who wishes to see it <e> <s> the problem that we were faced with which was discussed at length in committee and particularly at the report stage of the bill is that one might require as many as million copies of it if a full prospectus were to be given to everybody who might be interested in the offer even if they did not subscribe for it <e> <s> it is for that reason that a shortened prospectus will be used as well as the full prospectus <e> <s> but there is no question of a full prospectus not being published in this country <e> <s> i am sorry if there has been any misunderstanding on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to give my noble friend an exact date because this depends also on the convenience in relation to the arrangement of business in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of those rare and valuable occasions when we have the opportunity of debating philosophical issues untrammelled by the need to defend or the temptation to attack specific legislative proposals although as the noble baroness lady seear said some of your lordships did fall into temptation <e> <s> in a very penetrating remark the noble lord lord molloy said that it was impossible to be neutral to the views expressed by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> we are therefore all of us greatly indebted to my noble friend lord beloff for initiating this debate and to all of your lordships who have participated in it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may complete what i was going to say <e> <s> i said right at the beginning of my speech that one needs to look at these developments over a period of time that we do have <e>", "<cs> my lords the conventions in this matter are long established and well understood <e> <s> the convention is that when we are dealing with the report of a select committee the government give their response to that select committee and not by way of question and answer <e> <s> it is particularly important that the convention should be respected when we are dealing with the report of a select committee of another place <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the point made by my noble friend is concerned the governments policy on monetary matters is set out in detail in pages and of the financial statement <e> <s> to turn to the future of interest rates it is not the policy of the government to forecast movements in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no responsibility for the questions that are tabled on the order paper i merely do my best to answer them <e> <s> if however my noble friend wishes to pursue these exotic matters he will find a genealogical table setting out the relationship between the various components of the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is essential to follow a responsible financial and monetary policy <e> <s> this is particularly important in relation to the health of the economy and of unemployment <e> <s> this in fact is what we are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord takes an excessively simplified view of the situation <e> <s> if he reads the financial statement he will find that two of the aggregates are targeted mo for narrow money and sterling m for broad money <e>", "<cs> my lords in no case have the targets been breached <e>", "<cs> reached <e> <s> this is not the position because last year most of the aggregates were in fact within the target range <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment the monetary aggregates are moving in a perfectly satisfactory fashion <e> <s> if one takes mo for example the change in banking april on a -month annualised basis was per cent <e> <s> on a six-month annualised basis it was per cent <e> <s> and on a three-month annualised basis it was per cent <e> <s> there is a similar decline over this period if one looks at sterling m <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate the points that my noble friend makes <e> <s> the forecast of the growth of the various monetary aggregates over the period covered by the medium term financial strategy shows a steady decline and the control of the monetary aggregates is one of the major factors in keeping the economy on a healthy growth path <e>", "<cs> none my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the relationships between rolls-royce and the government are governed by a memorandum of understanding dated th december <e> <s> this was published on nd june in the sixth report of the house of commons industry and trade committee <e> <s> my noble friend was a minister at the treasury at that time and this matter will therefore be well within his knowledge <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> any rebates due will be paid at the end of the strike when the individual returns to work <e> <s> the matter was however debated in full on the floor of the house in another place in the course of the committee stage of the finance bill on th may and the reasons for the change then made in the law were very fully explained by my right honourable and learned friend the then chief secretary to the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords the change in the law was made three years ago in <e> <s> there is no difference between the treatment of miners who may be on strike and anybody else who may he on strike <e>", "<cs> no my lords the position is very clearly laid down in the finance act and the national coal board are simply fulfilling the obligations laid upon them by parliament at that time <e> <s> the noble lord was himself at that period a member of another place and he will realise that a division was called and the government were supported by a substantial majority in the division lobby <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> the change was made in and it affects everybody on strike <e> <s> so far as the miners are concerned the primary responsibility for supporting people on strike clearly rests with the union <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the comments made by my noble friend but they do of course go outside the ambit of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear in reply to the first supplementary that the change in the law applies to everybody on strike <e> <s> there is no differentiation between miners and anybody else in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i have obviously not investigated that question but i find it impossible to believe that in general the law has not been strictly followed in all cases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be permitted to reciprocate the noble baronesss comment in the last part of her question <e> <s> of course i appreciate the point that she is making but i did not in any way deal with the comparative question of work done by miners and work done by other people <e> <s> the question relates solely to a point of tax law and i was saying that so far as tax law is concerned there is no differentiation between one group in the community and another <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of the fact that any of the ladies to whom the noble countess was referring were miners or that they were on strike and those are the questions that are dealt with in the question on the order paper <e> <s> but if there is any specific case which the noble countess has in mind i shall be only too glad to look into it and to communicate with her <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is very well aware these are matters for another place and not for your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it clear that the national coal board were simply carrying out their obligations under the statute <e> <s> the responsibility for the content of the statute is not a matter for the treasury but for parliament <e> <s> parliament took a vote on this matter <e> <s> i would suggest that the noble lord should read the debate which took place on th may <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not in a position to give that information <e> <s> the only relevant comment which i would make is that in respect of the period after th april no refunds would have been due <e> <s> because no tax would have been paid by people on strike at that date <e>", "<cs> my lords million worth of orders had been received by british leyland from fleet buyers at the time the car was launched on th april <e> <s>

was the ninth best seller in the united kingdom taking over per cent <e> <s> of the market <e>", "<cs> my lords the comments made by my noble friend are entirely accurate <e> <s> the car has made a good start and this is a good augury for the future of british leyland <e> <s> it is also a matter of some encouragement that in the accounts for which have just been published british leyland showed a profit at the operating level of million <e> <s> this represents an achievement by everybody concerned the workforce as well as the management <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords historical researches are no doubt of considerable interest to himself if to nobody else <e> <s> the important point is that after a period of great difficulty this very important company is now showing significant progress <e> <s> we must all wish this progress to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a specific figure but last year the austin rover group exported per cent <e> <s> of its total output <e>", "<cs> my lords i am clearly not prepared to give any such assurance to the noble lord <e> <s> in any event his question goes wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful both to the noble lord <e> <s> lord stoddart of swindon and to the noble lord lord diamond for the congratulations that they offer to british leyland <e> <s> the progress that has been made in the past few years is a matter of great satisfaction to all of us to the management and to the workforce <e> <s> it is something in which we all ought to take a measure of satisfaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has said <e> <s> the price of survival is the capacity to adjust to change and this is what is being done here <e> <s> but as my noble friend also touched on this aspect may i reply to two further points <e> <s> first jaguar will be in competition with bmw and mercedes over part of the range and they show a great capacity to meet that competition <e> <s> the performance of jaguar in markets like the united states and western germany gives one every confidence for the future because they have put up an extremely good performance in both of those markets <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why these arrangements should in any way damage the research and development activities of british leyland <e> <s> what is being done is being done not only with the support but on the advice of british leyland and what is happening here is that the government are accepting the views that british leyland have put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i entirely appreciate the depth of feeling expressed by the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> i myself started by saying that whenever a high endeavour of this sort comes to an end it is a matter of great regret for all of us <e> <s> but we have to face reality <e> <s> the market has shrunk to an extent where the whole future of leyland trucks is in danger and the measures which are being taken on the advice of the board of british leyland are the right measures which are the only hope that exists for the survival of leyland trucks as a whole <e>

exports to the two markets that i mentioned <e> <s> in the case of nigeria there are of course severe payments problems of which the noble lord will be aware <e> <s> the nigerian government understandably has greatly restricted imports into that country <e> <s> it will be a long time before nigeria is in fact out of the financial problems that it faces <e> <s> one cannot therefore look to a rapid revival of the market in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> we must all take satisfaction in the progress that has been made by british leyland

vehicles <e> <s> over <e>", "<cs> my lords the progress has been made in anticipation of privatisation and will we hope continue at an accelerated rate when that happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot quote figures offhand for productivity in japan <e> <s> the figure is substantially higher than that in the united kingdom <e> <s> it is important to bear in mind however that the japanese motor car industry buys-in a much higher proportion of its total components than does the manufacturing industry in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be the last to expect me to agree with the views that he has expressed <e> <s> although we must all take satisfacton in the progress that british leyland is now making it has been a story of very great difficulty over a large number of years <e> <s> the british taxpayer has now invested over million in this company in all and it is only just now for the first time coming into profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend that the privatisation of important parts of british leyland was included in our manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that the vehicles manufactured at bathgate are lorries whereas the question relates to passenger cars <e> <s> but so far as bathgate is concerned a statement was made on nd may by by right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> i repeated it in your lordships house and at this stage i do not think there is anything i can usefully add to that statement <e> <s> in regard to the waiting period for the delivery of land rovers particularly to the third world i do not immediately have that information which of course does not arise in any way out of the question on the order paper <e> <s> but the noble lord will himself be well aware of the fact that great difficulties have arisen because of the problem of payment by many of these third world countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friends analysis <e> <s> i was carefully refraining from going back over these historical matters which reflect very badly upon the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords circumstances do exist in which a government have to bail out an industry in the way the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> nevertheless this is not the right way of dealing with industrial problems of this sort <e> <s> the experience of british leyland ought to have taught everybody how totally unsatisfactory is that kind of procedure and many years of great effort and thousands of millions of pounds have had to be invested to put the matter right <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> but the really important issue is that experience shows that companies of this sort can be managed much more effectively and profitably in the private sector than in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that at the beginning of the day it was a labour government which created the difficulties which later had to be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords we can spend a great deal of time going back over the history of this <e> <s> the person who provided the impetus for these great amalgamations which ultimately led to the sort of troubles we are talking about is somebody who is now a member of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always right and indeed necessary that investment should be directed wisely and clearly that is true in the public sector as well as in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the announced policy of the board of british leyland that the various parts of the organisation should be privatised when the opportunity arises and experience shows that this is supported by the management of the units concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that any of the comments made on either side of the house deserve the kind of epithet that the noble lord is endeavouring to apply to them <e> <s> the noble lord began by asking would i not agree <e> <s> i should have thought that after all these years he at least would have realised that i never agree with anything that he says <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not necessarily follow that if an industry goes as the noble lord describes it bust we are left with nothing because a great deal then depends upon whether the industry can be restarted <e> <s> british leyland faced a situation of very very great difficulty in and <e> <s> we took at that time very difficult decisions which experience has shown were in fact the right decisions <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will pay tribute to the wisdom of the government in following the policy that they have followed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will find a full history of the inmos story in the fifteenth report of the public accounts committee for the session <e> <s> although it is a matter of satisfaction and indeed relief that inmos is now trading at a profit in other respects its performance has fallen far short of expectations <e> <s> it is important to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be at all surprised that i do not agree with any of the conclusions he reaches <e> <s> in the course of negotiations for the relaunching of this company into the private sector there are three considerations that the government will bear in mind <e> <s> the first is to secure continuing access to the technology by british industry the second is the development of the activity in the united kingdom and the third is to secure a price which adequately reflects the taxpayers past investment in the company <e> <s> apart from that i really would advise the noble lord lord bruce of donington before he plunges further into these matters to read the fifteenth report of the public accounts committee because that report deals not only with the qualified success of inmos but with the unqualified disaster of nexos <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first point made by my noble friend is concerned it is stated in the report by the public accounts committee <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of propositions are at present under consideration and they will be evaluated in the light of the three considerations i have mentioned which i am certain are supported by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> the first is to secure continuing access to the technology by british industry <e> <s> perhaps i might divert to say that there was an imported transfer of technology from the united states to this country and that kind of transfer of technology is something we wish to continue <e> <s> the second requirement is the development of the activity in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords speech contained a number of interesting points <e> <s> so far as the first point is concerned i was quoting from the report of the public accounts committee which is of course an impeccable source and an authoritative one <e> <s> there has been an increase in employment in this respect in the united kingdom since october <e> <s> there has also been an increase in employment in the united states of america <e> <s> there are still more people employed in the united states than there are in the united kingdom and the total employed falls far short of the original estimate of which was given at the time that this venture started <e> <s> indeed the public accounts committee in fact refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords the transputer is an interesting and new piece of technology <e> <s> it was for this reason that i referred specifically in the criteria that i mentioned to the maintenance of technology in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the point made by my noble friend in the first part of his supplementary question <e> <s> the important point is that these facilities should be available at the earliest possible date and her majestys governments efforts are directed to this end <e> <s> i understand that this is in fact a cryogenic wind tunnel

the second part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned i am not entirely clear what point he has in mind and perhaps he would let me know in more detail <e> <s> but the crucial point is that this particular project should not be held up while we may be pursuing some wider and better project which may lie many years ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with the aeronautical

my lords as i have already said the concession which has been announced is felt by the government to meet the main criticism which has been made of the proposals <e> <s> it is related specifically to listed buildings which can readily be identified <e> <s> perhaps i ought to add that in addition to this concession the government disburse approximately million every year in grants towards the repair maintenance and renovation of such buildings <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply cannot accept what the noble lord says in the latter part of his supplementary question <e> <s> on the contrary this government have done a very great deal to help and assist the preservation of our heritage <e> <s> i appreciate that the number of bodies consulted was limited but this was because of the necessity to make an announcement at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords the annual cost of this concession is stated to be million a year <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> what the noble lord said is not in fact true the scheme has not been universally condemned by the banks on the contrary it has made a very valuable contribution to the establishment of new small businesses and to the growth of existing

contains a great deal of very valuable information and a number of penetrating observations <e> <s> it is a published document <e> <s> copies of the paper are available from the printed paper office and i suggest that the noble lords reads it <e>", "<cs> my lords the point raised by my noble friend is an important one <e> <s> the amount originally authorised was million <e> <s> the total amount advanced to st may was million <e> <s> from that point of view therefore the scheme has been a considerable success <e> <s> the problem is that the cost to the exchequer has been greater than is desirable and the changes which are being made are designed to curb the cost to the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords the first observation made by the noble lord is entirely correct <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his glowing tribute to the agricultural scheme from which i am sure we have a great deal to learn but i do not think there is any great difference of opinion between the two sides of the house on this matter <e> <s> it is important that we create new employment opportunities in this country and the encouragement of new small businesses and the expansion of existing businesses is only one of the routes along which that success must be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords summary of what i said is inaccurate and the conclusions he draws from his own summary are also wrong <e> <s> the scheme has been successful in relation to the amount of money which has been made available to small businesses <e> <s> it does give rise to anxieties as i have said because of the high cost to the exchequer <e> <s> we are trying therefore to find a better balance between these two factors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining his supplementary question in greater detail <e> <s> there does seem to be some conflict between him and his noble friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to acknowledge the fact that the noble lord raised this matter on a number of occasions during our proceedings on the bill <e> <s> equally i made it clear that if the provision proved to be inadequate we would ensure that additional resources were made available <e> <s> for example if i may quote from column on th february i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the support that he gives me <e> <s> perhaps i might respond by saying that my noble friend lord glenarthur also made it clear that if additional resources were required they would be made available <e>", "<cs>

first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the agreement of the heads of government on the need for budget discipline was clearly expressed both at the brussels meeting in march and at the fontainebleau summit <e> <s> it was then remitted to the finance ministers to turn those general agreements on points of principle which is where one has to start into concrete proposals

agreements that this government have negotiated we have paid million less to the european community than we would have paid under the arrangements bequeathed to us by the labour <e>", "<cs> my lords

one <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned he will recall that on a number of occasions during our debates i paid tribute to the progress which had been made by british telecom <e> <s> this has been due at least in some measure to successive acts of parliament passed during the lifetime of the present government which have done so much to induce a spirit of enterprise in the case of british telecom <e> <s> as regards answering questions in the future about the activities of british telecom when it becomes a private limited company that will be subject to the general rules of your lordships house which will be found <e>", "<cs> my lords this is going far wide of the question on the order paper but this matter was discussed at great length in the course of the debates on the telecommunications bill as it then was and i refer the noble lord to what was said then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not an authority on the history of the early railways in the way that the noble viscount is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not entirely follow the point that my noble friend has in mind but if there <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord misunderstands the position when he refers to british telecom being answerable to both houses of parliament <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that all experience shows that when an enterprise of this character is transferred to the private sector its efficiency of operation improves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords question has nothing whatever to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to ask a question of this kind perhaps he will place it on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the job of the treasure trove reviewing committee to ensure that the valuation made by the british museum of any hoard of treasure trove to be retained by a public museum corresponds to a sum that might be paid for it at an open market sale by a willing buyer to a willing seller <e> <s> where finds have been promptly and fully disclosed to the authorities the sum will be paid to the finder as an <e>", "<cs> my lords a find that is a find

payments would be free of tax <e> <s> but of course if subsequently they formed part of a deceaseds estate they might in that respect then be liable to capital transfer tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their comments <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey should give such a grudging welcome to what is an imaginative initiative by the government one which in fact offers the developing film industry an extremely helpful deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness for what she says <e> <s> the cinematograph films council of course did a very good job of work in the years in which it existed but most of its functions were concerned with regulatory matters and these will <e>", "<cs> my lords i did of course have the great pleasure of meeting the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead when as secretary of state for trade i saw a number of members of the interim action committee and we discussed many of these matters <e> <s> many of the points he raises are of course matters of detail and i accept that they are important matters <e> <s> i shall note what he has said and ensure that his points are followed up <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for what he says <e> <s> perhaps we are beginning to wander a little wide and as he himself has said the most valuable thing would be for us all to study the white paper <e> <s> the removal of the eady levy is a specific measure that will help the cinemas <e> <s> the simple truth of the matter is that the essential habits of our people have changed so dramatically and many of the developments to which he referred are a reflection of those changing social circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am awfully sorry if the noble lord thought that i was making a personal comment my remarks were not in any sense intended to be a personal comment <e> <s> but if the noble lord will reread his remarks he will find that he exhibited if i may use the phrase a lack of enthusiasm for the governments plans which he may find entirely justified but to which i felt it perfectly legitimate to refer <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that there was never any intention of any kind of making a personal comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord beswick in regretting the increase in interest rates <e> <s> there is nothing between us on that at all <e> <s> as he refers to the effects on industry perhaps i may refer him to what sir terence beckett speaking on behalf of the cbi in fact said <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now straying wide from the original question <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would kindly wait to hear the rest of the answer <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that total output in this country is now higher not lower than it was in <e> <s> but the simple truth of the matter is that there are some matters which are outside the control of any government <e> <s> we cannot insulate ourselves from what goes on in the united states of america <e> <s> the united states of america accounts for per cent <e> <s> of the gnp of the world and therefore it is one of the facts of life which must influence what goes on elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords we are now moving from interest rates to exchange rates but the fact of the matter was that the rise in interest rates was not the result of a policy decision to try to fix the rate of sterling at any particular point <e> <s> we do not target the exchange rate <e> <s> the rise in interest rates was due to the feed-through effects on the money markets of the rise in american interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates to industry but if the noble lords question is whether the output of agriculture has increased since i should have thought that it had increased substantially <e>", "<cs> my lords the latter part of the noble lords statement is quite incorrect <e> <s> so far as the earlier part of his question is concerned perhaps i may ask him to repeat it <e> <s> he rather diverted me with his long diatribe <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be surprised to know that i agree with his basic thesis <e> <s> this is why our policies have been directed to getting interest rates down in this country <e> <s> i am glad of his support for the governments general financial policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we have on many occasions drawn the attention of the united states administration to these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first supplementary question asked by the noble lord is concerned the statement that i made that the government do not target the rate of exchange is one that has been made on numerous occasions by government spokesmen and it represents the position <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally different question from what appears on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i join so many of your lordships in congratulating my noble friend lord king of wartnaby on an outstanding maiden speech which combined both wit and wisdom <e> <s> he speaks from very wide experience in both the private sector and for the time being at any rate the public sector <e> <s> he has produced a transformation in british airways which is an outstanding example of what can be done by the application of great qualities of leadership and of wide managerial experience to the running of a business of that kind <e> <s> the views which my noble friend expressed on wider share ownership and on the involvement of employees generally found an echo in many parts of your lordships house <e> <s> he was supported by my noble friend lord bruce-gardyne by the noble lord lord weinstock and by the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords the relief is not given by way of an allowance against the bank interest <e> <s> the present exemption for the national savings bank is given effect to of course by no tax being deducted from the interest <e> <s> it is only when that interest is then returned for tax if it is ever returned that effect is then given to the exemption <e> <s> if you are going to attempt to reproduce the same kind of regime for all deposit takers and that of course is the technical term for these people it would open up a widespread avenue for avoidance of this kind <e> <s> you would also find yourself in the position and this is a perfectly legitimate point that i am making that if the relief were extended from the national savings bank to the commercial banks you would then have a claim which would be extended to the building societies and the next thing would be a claim that it should be extended to income in all forms either by way of interest or by way of dividends on shares <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is suggesting on behalf of the labour party that we remove the present exemption of on deposits in the national savings bank i fear that he will end up by being even less popular than he is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply say this to him <e> <s> total output in the united kingdom is now higher than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now growing and the noble lord singles out a particular sector of the economy and says that it has not done so well but as he very well knows the pattern and balance of an economy change over time and we are looking through a period when important changes are taking place <e> <s> the important point and i am sure there is no difference between us on this is to take full advantage of those changes and those opportunities when they occur <e>", "<cs> my lords we are treading on rather dangerous territory <e> <s> i have no knowledge of any conversations that may have taken place between the noble lord and his own chief whip <e> <s> nor do i think it appropriate that i should inquire into them <e> <s> i made no complaint of any kind about the noble lords speech <e> <s> i merely made the point right at the outset that i felt and this was echoed by many parts of your lordships house that it would be more appropriate to have a wide-ranging debate next wednesday on the economy as a whole and i felt that there was a great deal in the finance bill itself that would interest your lordships <e> <s> i can say no more than that other than that i look forward with great interest if not fascination to the noble lords speech next wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords to-days debate is the direct outcome of one of the amendments to the bill made in your lordships house and now incorporated in section of the act <e> <s> i think we can all take satisfaction in the number of important amendments we were able to make to the bill while it was before your lordships house <e> <s> many of these changes are reflected also in the licence we are now debating <e> <s> it is of course primarily the licence that we are debating and while nobody would wish to stop the noble lord lord bruce of donington in the full flight of his indignation and rhetoric i think a great deal of what he said was more appropriate to a re-run of the second reading debate on the bill as it then was <e> <s> i hope therefore he will understand if i do not follow him down that particular path but confine myself to the licence <e>", "<cs> my lords there is nothing to prevent british telecom from charging if in fact it so wishes <e> <s> but the most important point is that it requires to give satisfaction to its customers <e> <s> it is essential from a commercial point of view that it should make its services available as widely as possible and it is in the commercial interest of british telecom to ensure that its customers needs are met in the best possible way <e> <s> the conditions which have been introduced make it quite clear that the case of disabled people must be dealt with properly before there can be any question of charges being introduced <e> <s> that is the important point which was raised in your lordships house which we have met and which is fully dealt with in the licence conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords yes of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i thought i had heard him correctly and this is why i was so surprised at the figure <e> <s> the fact is that although there have been year to year fluctuations the total of personal disposable income today is significantly higher than it was on average during the s <e> <s> you can always pick out one or two odd years when the figures may have gone up or may have gone down but the total of real personal disposable income over the years has increased at a significant rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the house the country and indeed the community as a whole owe a debt of gratitude to your lordships select committee on the european communities for the very clear penetrating and impartial reports which it produces on matters of community interest and policy <e> <s> the present report is very much in that honourable tradition <e> <s> i greatly welcome the reports support for the european financial area <e> <s> this is an integral part of the white paper programme for the completion of the internal market by to which the noble lord lord kearton referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend can tell the house what the aggregate effect on employment is of all the plans of the ford motor company including the expansion of the engine plant at bridgend <e>", "<cs> my lords while one accepts that the question of fraud is of great importance and that measures ought to be taken to curb it and also that fraud extends beyond the cap into other areas can my noble friend explain why proposals which i put forward in on behalf of the commission to amend the mutual assistance directive to enable the commission in collaboration with member states to conduct investigations into fraud were vetoed by the united kingdom in conjunction with the finance ministers of the other eleven member states <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have now been named by my noble friend lord whitelaw perhaps i may say this <e>", "<cs> i shall put it as a question if the noble lord will kindly possess himself in patience <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that my right honourable friend the prime minister raised the matter very properly indeed <e> <s> does he recall that i began by saying that this is an important subject which needs <e>", "<cs> is the minister further aware that this is a matter of substantial importance <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the proposal which i put forward on behalf of the commission dealt with customs or agricultural matters <e> <s> i am reading from the actual document which also refers to missions in co-operation with the competent authorities of the members states not by the commission alone but in co-operation with the member states <e> <s> how does that differ from what the minister is now saying <e> <s> is she prepared to give the house an assurance that the government will take effective measures in this field and that they will support the commission in the efforts it is making including giving it the necessary powers in co-operation with the member states <e>", "<cs> it had not been my intention to intervene in the debate but in view of what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord roskill i am compelled to do so <e> <s> he made two comments about the thirteenth company law directive the first of which i entirely agree with that it is premature to be discussing the directive <e> <s> the second point he made i suspect is wrong <e> <s> the directive would not compel an individual member state to adopt lower standards than it wishes <e> <s> it prevents a member state imposing on other member states standards which are higher than those prescribed by the directive <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> i am sure that once a directive is examined in detail it will be seen that it does not undermine the operations of the takeover panel <e> <s> we went to quite extraordinary lengths to ensure that the takeover panel was left untouched as far as possible by the thirteenth directive <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a point made by my noble friend that should be questioned <e> <s> he said that the objective was to include the minimum amount of control that was required by the directive <e> <s> we are looking at a safeguard <e> <s> the position is that on a safeguard it is always open to a member state to provide for more than the minimum amount of safeguard <e> <s> that was the point which was debated by the noble and learned lord lord roskill and myself on th march <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of your lordships select committee raises issues of great importance which cause real concern and demand urgent and effective action <e> <s> i am only too glad therefore that my right honourable friend the prime minister is now treating this matter seriously <e> <s> i only express the hope that she will have the support of her own government which is more than i had when i tried unsuccessfully to take a step to deal with this matter in <e> <s> indeed this somewhat negative attitude towards dealing with this important problem is reflected in the explanatory memorandum which was sent to your lordships committee and of which it took a very poor view <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend kindly expand on his reply to the first supplementary question <e> <s> he said that it was the governments view that it was not appropriate for british citizens to learn to speak more than one foreign language <e>", "<cs> my lords with much of the analysis of the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow i agree although the conclusions that i would draw from it are not always the same <e> <s> i do not believe that time is on our side <e> <s> events are moving very rapidly <e> <s> we must be ready and prepared to deal

<e> <s> in so far as it shows a more flexible and constructive approach to the european community it is much to be welcomed <e> <s> but the proof of that pudding will rest in the eating <e> <s> the united kingdoms record on the completion of the internal market is not as simon pure as my noble friend has been briefed to say but it may be a bad thing that he thinks that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords

forward by mr dalton as he then was he subsequently became lord dalton for the nationalisation of the bank of england <e> <s> he specifically explained that on the basis that it was to enable the government to take control of monetary policy <e> <s> even then what the government could do was very limited because of the existence of the bretton woods agreement <e> <s> it was only in with the

overdraft the bank must not reply <e> <s> my noble friend is asking whether if the student goes to the loans company the loans company will be enabled to reply <e> <s> this point is crucial <e>",

different way and their powers are quite different <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend does not propose to issue a green paper would he nevertheless agree that membership of the exchange rate mechanism is a discipline and not a licence or a crutch and that in particular it will mean that no future government or perhaps i should say no government in future will be able to rely upon inflation as a means of counteracting errors in economic or monetary policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there is a clear difference between the rpi and the rate of inflation

figure for the oecd countries <e>", "<cs> my lords those of your lordships with modestly long memories although not going back quite as far as mr lloyd george will recall that during the lifetime of the late labour government an amendment was passed to the finance bill with strong support of the then conservative opposition particularly in the form of mr nigel lawson <e> <s> the amendment required the annual uprating of the income tax personal allowance unless parliament voted to the contrary on the ground that not to do so was a fraud upon the taxpayer <e> <s> whether one looks at the child benefit as a replacement of the old income tax allowance or as a replacement of the old family allowance in fact it was partly one and partly the other the case for uprating it is a very strong
