["<cs> my lords as regards the first point made by my noble friend it is also true that barley which is used in the production of beer is zero-rated but the final product is not <e> <s> that is a common feature with a tax like vat <e> <s> as regards my noble friends second point the reason for confectionery being charged to vat is based on revenue requirements and not on any arguments about the nutritional or other value of the products concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that arguments of that type are advanced but i personally would not wish to become involved in them <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned the overriding factor in this particular case is the amount of revenue involved <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not work like that <e> <s> if agricultural fertilisers were exempt from vat it would be necessary for the manufacturers to distinguish between their exempt and their chargeable output as most manufacturers of fertilisers also manufacture other chemicals <e> <s> that would result in a considerable increase in the burden of administration and create considerable problems <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has a very valid point and what he says is entirely true <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble lord so much appreciates the efforts of the government in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords since my noble friend tabled this question there has been a dramatic fall in the price of silver which reached a peak of an ounce just after christmas but which <e>", "<cs> there was nothing flippant in the replies i gave my lords and if the noble lord lord goronwyroberts cares to cast his mind back he may recall that in the days of the labour government under the late mr clement attlee silver articles were at one time charged at per cent <e> <s> that even in more recent times they were charged at per cent <e> <s> and that therefore the per cent <e> <s> vat at which they are at present charged represents a very considerable reduction on those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely appreciate what my noble friend says <e> <s> there are grants which are made to silversmiths through the crafts council <e> <s> the problem of working capital is one which affects large numbers of small businesses and the governments general policies arc designed to help small businesses in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in fact complaining about anything <e> <s> i was merely drawing attention to what the facts were <e>", "<cs> the operation of the market my lords is a matter which lies outside the scope of this question which refers to vat <e>", "<cs> my lords vat is not in any way responsible for the violent fluctuations in the price of silver <e>", "<cs> that is why i am assisting the noble lord by pointing it out <e> <s> i do not think that any discussions of the kind that he has in mind would have prevented the occurrence of the situation with which silversmiths are now faced <e>", "<cs> my lords the news that i am giving the noble lord is that the proposition that there should be special relief from vat for silver articles is not one which is acceptable to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the government decide the necessary reductions on the basis of a comprehensive review of public expenditure <e> <s> the forthcoming public expenditure white paper to be published on budget day will reflect a careful judgment of priorities in selecting items for reduction <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the simplification of procedures and the promotion of efficiency is of the essence of the work which is being done by sir derek rayner in collaboration with ministers <e> <s> there are undoubtedly important savings to be made in these areas <e>", "<cs> no my lordsthat is not the right way to look at the problem <e> <s> we have to look at reductions in public expenditure in the context of the governments overall economic policy which is designed to eliminate inflation to reduce taxation to improve incentives and thus to lead to a higher level of output and a higher level of employment <e> <s> had we followed the policies of the previous government which entailed higher expenditure and higher taxation the future prospects for the british economy would he much worse than they are at present <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that it was the party opposite which renegotiated the terms of entry and claimed that they had come to a satisfactory conclusion a claim which in common with so many of their other claims has been completely falsified by events <e> <s> nobody can give place to my right honourable and noble friend the prime minister in drawing attention to this problem and as she has repeatedly said we are determined to find a solution which is satisfactory to the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important that reductions in public expenditure should be made by reference to individual programmes rather than by reference to cuts across the board <e> <s> that is why it is important for the house to await the publication of the public expenditure white paper before it is possible to pursue these matters in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the fact that i did sobut if i did it was an inadvertent slip of the tongue <e> <s> i used the phrase my noble friend in relation to the lord president of the council which is entirely correct from both aspects of the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords the important thing and what is essential from the point of view of the economy is to reduce the level of inflation <e> <s> that can only be done by a firm monetary and financial policy <e> <s> reduction of public expenditure to an amount within the capacity of the country to pay is an integral part of such a policy <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is quite untrue <e> <s> if one casts ones mind back to the events before the general election the fruits of the kind of policy followed by the party opposite are abundantly and painfully clear <e>"]
