["<cs> my lords i intervene to comment only on the narrow issue of stansted and the surrounding area in the context of the governments airports policy <e> <s> i speak as one who farms in essex who has worked in local government there for many years and who has been active in the conservation movement in essex for many years <e> <s> i would add that i do not farm near stansted so that i have no personal interest in developments there <e> <s> i am hardly empowered to speak for those interests that i have mentioned but i can report how they feel about the stansted proposals in cmnd <e> <s> <e> <s> they view them with utter dismay <e> <s> i certainly view the proposals in the same way myself <e> <s> i think that anyone who has studied the intractable problem of providing london with efficient air transport facilities for the future must accept that arrangements should be made now to handle the likely increase in air passenger movements in the s and s <e> <s> many of us do not accept the projections made on the subject <e> <s> they have been badly wrong in the past and are just as likely to be wrong in the future <e> <s> i accept that there will be a big increase in passenger movements in the london area but where i believe the stated government policy in respect of stansted to be faulty is that in seeking to make proposals to meet the admittedly urgent needs of the air transport industry the government have failed to weigh up the irreparable damage that their proposals could cause other more important interests outside <e> <s> these outside interests in particular would seem to be agriculture and the conservation of unspoiled countryside near london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for the better protection of small antiquities found in the ground and elsewhere to amend treasure trove and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of this short bill is to give a more permanent protection to those small antiquities which from time to time are found in the ground or elsewhere and it seeks to do so by amending the law of treasure trove <e> <s> these small antiquities are often of historic importance of scientific importance or of artistic importance and sometimes they are all three <e> <s> they include rather infrequently objects made of gold or silver but more often made of other metals or of clay stone wood or glass they include jewellery and ornaments ancient tools weapons and household utensils ceramics and mosaics manuscripts deeds and scrolls together with many other ancient artefacts <e> <s> with the exception of those objects made substantially of gold or silver which receive a rather tenuous protection under the law of treasure trove these antiquities it seems receive no permanent protection in law at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course very glad that this bill seems to have had a generally sympathetic reception and i should like to thank all the speakers who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> they have made some very good points which if the bill goes forward we could possibly deal with at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i always listen very carefully to what my noble friend lord digby says <e> <s> he is an officer on the executive of a much respected association of which i am a back-bench member and which must be concerned with the bill namely the country landowners association <e> <s> i think i can answer the question which my noble friend has raised <e> <s> this is an antiquities bill <e> <s> the objects with which it is concerned must be antiquities <e> <s> my noble friend instanced a modern silver spoon being found in the garden of a house <e> <s> an element of treasure trove is that the object to qualify as treasure trove must have no known owner <e> <s> in the case of most modern valuables which turn up the precise owner may not be known but ownership can be established fairly easily <e> <s> it does not necessarily have to belong to an individual member of a family but if a modern spoon turned up particularly if it had a crest on it it would belong to the member of the family living in that place at that time if there was one <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> in reply to my noble friend there is nothing whatsoever in the law of treasure trove as it stands at the moment which is concerned with rewards <e> <s> rewards are purely a custom which has grown up comparatively recently <e> <s> there was a time when i wondered whether it would be proper to discuss them at all because it is a crown prerogative <e> <s> i have always been puzzled by the grievance which landowners expressed at times that it is the finder of an object who is given the reward rather than the landowner <e> <s> that may be correct but surely the remedy lies in the landowners own hands <e> <s> if he felt strongly about obtaining some possible reward he would not allow people on to his land unless he had made some fairly firm agreement that any reward paid should be shared between them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> if i may make one brief comment on it i believe that the subject of the bill the better care of antiquities has a wider than purely domestic interest <e> <s> if i may put it like this i think that we in britain would be concerned and distressed if states like egypt and israel or great nations like italy and greece did not take proper care of their antiquities <e> <s> antiquities are not only part of a national heritage they are part of the human heritage <e> <s> the countries i have mentioned would have an equal right to hope and expect that we in britain would take proper care of our portable antiquities too <e> <s> unhappily britain is behind other countries in this respect in our legislation but while i cannot claim that this bill aspires to being able to put a bad situation completely right i would claim that it is at least a step in the right direction <e> <s> the noble earl who has spoken for the government in our debates on the bill has suggested that the bill proposes a radical change in the law on property <e> <s> i can only say with the greatest respect that i cannot agree with him <e> <s> i would claim that the bill seeks no more than a fairly modest extension of the existing law the law of treasure trove <e>"]
