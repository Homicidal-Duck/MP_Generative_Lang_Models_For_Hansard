["<cs> my lords it remains for me to thank those noble lords who have turned what i feared was to be a duet into a debate and a very profitable one <e> <s> i particularly thank the noble earl lord cranbrook and the noble lord lord shackleton for guiding the discussion into constructive channels be <e>", "<cs> my lords biologists working in this field will be deeply grateful to the noble baroness lady young for the reply which she has given to this question <e> <s> i should like to ask her whether she would be willing to press the matter a little further with the council in two ways or ask her honourable friend in another place to do so when the council meets <e> <s> first will she reinforce the recommendations in this report by drawing the <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a salvation army hymn which begins tell me the old old story <e> <s> it would be an apt title for this debate because your lordships will have heard all this before with so to speak a different text on one occasion titanium dioxide on another the drins on another water for fish and now mercury <e> <s> but like the old old story in the hymn we have to go on telling this one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl and the noble lord lord beaumont have put the case so clearly that there is really hardly anything for me to add except to underline what they have said and to support the bill <e> <s> i have one contribution to make <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> on a subject so savagely controversial as this i wish to declare a disinterest <e> <s> half my career has been spent in experimental biology but it has all been with plants never with animals and therefore i have never been put in to the position of having to declare loyalty either to those who believe in using animals for experiments or those who oppose it <e> <s> so i came to the select committee with a completely open mind <e> <s> i am now equally completely convinced that the law needs to be changed that it needs to be changed as soon as practicably possible and that give and take a few compromises and amendments the law should take the rough kind of pattern which is in the bill that the noble earl has presented to us this afternoon <e> <s> when the bill was recommitted last june the noble lord lord belstead assured the house committee that the government were resolved to replace the present act <e> <s> he paid very generous compliments to the revised bill but went on to say that the government were not prepared to act yet and that the government were not prepared to act on the lines of the bill now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to be chancellor of the queens university of belfast and in that capacity i should like to express my great appreciation of your lordships house in that you have considered this which has been put before you so that a revision of the statutes can occur <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to begin by expressing gratitude to the noble earl lord cranbrook not only for opening this debate but for the enormous amount of patient work which he has put into the preparation of the report which is before the house <e> <s> it is i think the most important single directive to come from the environment and consumer service of the commission because it covers far more than just abatement of pollution <e> <s> i should like to put on record a compliment to that service under the leadership of m carpentier because there has been an enormous and dramatic improvement in the quality of the directives which have come from his service since he took office <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to find ones name on the list next to a maiden speaker <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to be the first to congratulate the noble viscount on making a valuable and charming if charm can be applied to hazardous wastes introductory speech <e> <s> the noble viscount observed that circumspection which is traditionally expected of maiden speakers but i am sure your lordships will have so to speak caught enough of a glint in his eye to realise that when he is freed from these restraints he will be able to speak even more forcibly and with great influence in this house <e> <s> i know i am echoing the view of all your lordships in this chamber in welcoming that maiden speech and in hoping that we shall hear him many more times in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord cranbrook has given your lordships a very clear and complete account of the material in the report and the noble baroness has put it in its european setting <e> <s> there is nothing that i need to do except add a few crumbs of opinion and at this time of night not many crumbs <e> <s> but it is a topic which is worth keeping your lordships here for a few minutes to talk about <e> <s> all of us today have asborbed between and microgrammes of cadmium and we do that every day <e> <s> it is times more toxic than arsenic or lead <e> <s> about tonnes of it are used every year in britain <e> <s> the recovery rate of cadmium is less than per cent <e> <s> and being a metal it cannot be destroyed it accumulates <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for introducing the house to this fascinating report <e> <s> she has confessed that she has conscripted a number of tame scientists to support the case <e> <s> as a ex-scientist i should like to make a small contribution <e> <s> i should like to begin with a digression <e> <s> we have listened this afternoon to a very important debate on science and government and some of the witnesses to the committee dealing with that subject emphasised the need to have some generalist scientists and the most important skill perhaps needed is the capacity to be able to interpret to politicians and to civil servants the complexities of the scientific issues and their relevance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this cut-off date of st july threatened also the opportunities for some school teachers to receive the benefits of their war service <e> <s> is he further aware that in order to meet that circumstance in the cut-off date for those who were intending to become schoolteachers but who were not yet in jobs because they do not begin until september was changed to the th september <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that an advance of no more than hours in that cut-off date to the st october will go a long way towards resolving this disgraceful lack of appreciation of the war service done by a good many university teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that in doing this the noble lord will also bear in mind if i may ask him to do so the fact that not everybody who takes a course in teacher training becomes a teacher just as not everybody who gets a higher degree becomes a university teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords have a long and important debate to follow <e> <s> i simply wish first to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his careful and encouraging reply to this debate and to thank other noble lords who took part in it <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank the noble baroness lady birk who drew attention to the importance of noise and the noble earl lord cranbrook who put it more securely into its european perspective than i did in my introduction <e>", "<cs> my lords the custom of putting the first speakers name again at the end of a debate has one merit which is that it allows him to thank the noble lords who have taken part in the debate and who have turned it into a very remarkable afternoon and evening <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friend lord nathan and myself i should like to thank the government chief whip for having arranged the debate at this time and noble lords who have taken part in it <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>"]
