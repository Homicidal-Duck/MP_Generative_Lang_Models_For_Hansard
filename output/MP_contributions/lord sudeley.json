["<cs> my lords the family is a highly charged unit and during the last second reading much was said about how if the bill became law matters would become worse rather than better <e> <s> there were sound practical reasons for the old <e>", "<cs> no my lords i did not say that it was sinful <e> <s> i said that it was now permitted to anglicans as it has hitherto been permitted to the jews <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer but may i ask him whether he would not consider it particularly appropriate for a direction to be issued by the secretary of state for the environment in this instance having regard to the fact that at the public inquiry of the historic buildings division of the greater london council withdrew at the last minute the evidence which it had prepared and the inspector declared that it was outside his competence to judge flaxmans significance <e> <s> furthermore is the minister aware that according to the report of the community housing association which i have in my hand the cost of new building in this instance would be one-third more than the cost of rehabilitation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware that there was a report in <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the principal benefits and the effects of this measure will be considerable and i shall not be concerned with that <e> <s> i have no doubt furthermore that from a liturgical point of view as the bishop of fulham and gibraltar wrote to me in his letter of th april the diocese is in most of those parts much more conservative than in any diocese here in the church of england <e> <s> i will not be concerned with that either <e> <s> my purpose is merely to create a storm in a teacup and therefore to intervene very briefly by drawing attention to a statement which was also given to me by the bishop of fulham and gibraltar in his letter of th april that in one or two isolated places in the diocese the clergy have the bit between their teeth over liturgical revision and have gone much further even than the bishop himself would have wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that answer may i seek the assurance of the government that they do not intend to introduce any legislation enabling assisted suicide <e> <s> because that would lay open the door to the activities of unscrupulous persons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for parishioners of any parish to require certain forms of service to be used in the parish <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the new services of the church of england have been the desire not of the laity so much as of the clergy <e> <s> three years ago i introduced a bill in your lordships house in an attempt to enable the laity who have the new services foisted on them against their will to enjoy the prayer book if they so wished in its place through a ballot of all members of the church electoral roll <e> <s> it would be decided by the ballot whether they preferred to have the book of common prayer at the three main services on sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is very late and what matters much more than any words from me are votes for the prayer book which is perhaps a bigger issue than any of us in the chamber <e> <s> i should like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate in particular the maiden speakers the noble duke the duke of portland and the noble lord lord dacre of glanton of whom i am just as much an admirer now as i was at oxford <e> <s> without any more ado i ask the house to give this bill a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that under the housing act rehabilitation orders are permitted only if compulsory purchase was made before <e> <s> given the recently imposed moratorium on local authority spending and the greatly increased emphasis recently on retention and repair would the minister not consider that it would be much more satisfactory if rehabilitation orders were permitted on acquisitions made post- as well <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to put in another supplementary question about houses like flaxmans house which are fit houses but included for demolition under the heading of added land <e> <s> does the minister not think that the authorities should be able to reconsider the demolition of fit houses which at some time in the past it has been judged necessary under the housing acts to demolish for the sake of the redevelopment of an area if now the authorities reach the conclusion that their earlier decision was wrong and the demolition of fit houses is quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she has any figures of the rate of death grant in other european countries especially in the common market so that we may compare them with the rates of death grant in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the minister whether she does not agree that like our case law the house of lords has a strictly prescriptive basis and therefore that any reform <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that children under the age of can obtain x certificate films and does he think there might be some advantage in amending the children and young persons harmful publications act in order to include video-cassettes <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly because my ancestor the first lord sudeley was chairman of the commission for the rebuilding of the houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that reply <e> <s> taking into account the original proposals to the law commission in this connection may i ask the noble and learned lord whether he might review his decision if i submit certain papers to him on such a matter on the basis that if a bill were tabled before the house the matter as such reviewed by the law commission would be fully debated in this house with a view to certain and general legislation on the issues involved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister what his view may be of the relationship between the recent vote in the house of commons on hanging and the opinion of the public at large on this question bearing in mind the very pertinent article on this problem which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide for parishioners of any parish to require certain forms of service to be used in the parish church <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in revising this bill of i should like to begin by mentioning that several noble lords have written to me very much regretting that they cannot be present this evening but at the same time they are very much behind my intention in the bill <e> <s> they are the noble lords lord dacre and lord vaizey and the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> my lords the hour is late so possibly it is the feeling of the house that i should not sum up in detail <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor quoted from a leader in <e>", "<cs> my lords i used an adjectival form of a softer vein <e> <s> i thought it was more appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords the sentiment would be better if it had been expressed in a softer vein <e> <s> i used the expression led astray not bamboozled <e> <s> i think it is the feeling of the house that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is perfectly correct that the bill would not be carried on second reading <e> <s> but i should like to thank very much all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and also the right reverend prelates <e> <s> chiefly i should like to thank very much indeed the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury <e> <s> the reason i particularly want to thank the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury is because the principal value and point of this debate has been the very clear terms in which he has expressed the need for training ordinands in theological colleges in the use of the prayer book <e> <s> the position has not been satisfactory and it ought to be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> he remarked that money is the cement of society <e> <s> may i ask him whether in his view the position was any different before the glorious revolution rather than after it with the importation of dutch bankers and the creation of the bank of england <e>", "<cs> there are two points i should like to make in reply to what the minister has said <e> <s> the first is that this is a non-party matter <e> <s> therefore in rejecting the idea of people being able to stand as candidates for local authority elections or for that matter parliamentary elections i think the conservative party is giving some political ground in a rather unnecessary degree to the two other political parties the liberal and labour parties <e> <s> the other point i should like to make is that the minister has provided arguments against candidates standing for local authority elections <e> <s> the arguments are much the same for local authority elections as for parliamentary elections <e> <s> if the minister had spoken on the previous amendment on parliamentary elections i think his arguments would have been much the same <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister if he can assure me that he will write to me before the report stage of the bill with his consideration and depending on that i can decide whether or not to re-introduce this amendment on report stage <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister very much for that assurance <e> <s> i hope that his answer will be favourable and that it will not be necessary for me to reintroduce the amendment at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and were put down separately <e> <s> however the noble lord lord tordoff said that he would like them to be taken together <e> <s> i shall speak to both although i shall put my remarks in two different pockets the first pocket being the first amendment relating to candidates between the ages of and being able to stand at parliamentary elections <e> <s> when i raised the question of local authority elections at the committee stage the minister said that there was not much support for anything of this kind in another place <e> <s> given that local authority and parliamentary elections come under the same umbrella i should like to call attention to an early day motion in another place signed by a number of honourable members which calls for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that encouraging reply <e> <s> may i ask whether he would be willing to reconsider his reply in the light of papers that i could lay before him in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord further whether he would consider the letter written to me about this question by his noble and learned colleague lord scarman <e> <s> in doing so will he consider whether the public money used in the extra hearings referred to in that letter might be more gainfully employed than in those hearings <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very quick <e> <s> let me make one or two remarks about the provisions of the measure referred to by the right reverend prelate that communion alms shall be disposed of by the parochial church council rather than by the incumbent and churchwardens in keeping with the old rubric of the prayer book that such alms shall be distributed to the poor <e> <s> anyone upholding the cause of the prayer book should be careful not to go too far in taking up the position of a fundamentalist <e> <s> it has to be seen that some rubrics of the prayer book over the years have become unworkable and here in particular we need to remember that parish communion has become more popular than matins and so the collection at the communion service may be the biggest indeed the only collection <e>", "<cs> my lords this legal aid bill is likely to dictate the character of legal aid for the next years in the same way as its predecessor of years ago did and i should like to concentrate on just one aspect of legal aid <e> <s> the white paper states that the success of legal aid has largely been due to the efforts of the law society <e> <s> but now i see in the literature of the law society on the legal aid bill that anxiety is expressed that for the sake of the good administration of legal aid there will be not enough solicitors who are willing to concentrate on this area rather that they may neglect it for the sake of privately paid work <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answerdoes he think it would be of benefit to the british railways board in these ecumenical times to commemorate a man who might be regarded as the founding father of worship in our mother tongue and the moving spirit of a book quoted as much as the authorised versionbearing particularly in mind that a locomotive has already been named after john wesley <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> does he think that the front of the building should be marked with broad banners which could be seen from the other side of whitehall on horse guards parade <e> <s> secondly bearing in mind that previous exhibitions organised by the coi were important occasions and have been provided with men dressed in costumes suitable to the period does the minister not think that one of these people should be stationed on the other side of the road on horse guards parade on a rota system to distribute leaflets about the exhibition opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> first why has the post office refused to issue a stamp marking archbishop cranmers quincentenary when a stamp has already been issued commemorating the welsh bible <e> <s> will the government consider being officially represented at the service at westminster abbey on th november to mark archbishop cranmers quincentenary at which the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury will be preaching <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government entertain any proposals for a parliamentary service to celebrate the quincentenary of archbishop thomas cranmer in st margarets church westminster <e> <s> are the government aware of any proposals to erect a statue to archbishop cranmer in st pauls churchyard similar to the statue already erected to john wesley <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be extremely brief and concentrate on just one small area <e> <s> the government are suggesting that the solicitors monopoly over who may apply for grant of probate or letters of administration should be abolished <e> <s> here the green paper offers two options <e> <s> option b would mean that anyone would be able to apply for a grant as agent for another <e> <s> option a would extend the classes of persons entitled to apply for a grant for award to such bodies as trust corporations chartered and certified accountants authorised conveyancing practitioners and possibly others invited to suggest themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the present plans for the rose theatre site should be called in for a public inquiry as the proposed new plan of the rose theatre trust has already been preferred by two archaeologists mr <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very disappointing reply <e> <s> is he aware that two leading shakespeare scholars professor andrew gurr of reading university and professor honigmann of newcastle have confirmed the strong presumptive evidence that shakespeare lived on or near the site of the globe theatre <e> <s> therefore with the current excavations at the globe and the rose theatre sites does he not think that the designation of the area would be very much to the advantage of the international tourist trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he say which newspapers printed the press release that he mentioned in his answer and what guarantee there is that the parties concerned read it <e> <s> secondly does my noble friend agree that the interest of individual bankrupts must vary and that some bankrupts could be much in need of the personal notification referred to in the question <e> <s> the information given to me by the dti about personal notification of discharges from bankruptcy following the insolvency act is that many parties move away without leaving a new address or take no notice of their notification <e>"]
