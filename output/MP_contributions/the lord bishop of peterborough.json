["<cs> my lords could the minister tell the house whether the eec has made any attempt to offer jobs abroad to the steelworkers in places such as corby <e> <s> if they have done so how many and how effectively have they done it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the founding of new businesses especially small ones would do much to restore morale and confidence in the economy of this country and if he so agrees is he able to indicate what steps the government are going to take now or in the near future to make this possible <e>", "<cs> from these benches and i speak for myself only one never speaks for another bishop i would hope that the minister can assure us that this point raised by the noble lord lord spens is covered in the bill as it is and i have tried to work it out translating it into the latin to make it clearer <e> <s> i wholeheartedly support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord spens <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will either define terminate which might terminate the debate or accept the amendment which the noble baroness has moved <e> <s> it seems to me utterly reasonable and the only consolation any of us has sitting in any kind of assembly whether it be in synod in your lordships committee or a parochial church council is to take refuge in dr johnsons dictum <e>", "<cs> i expect my lords that when i have finished you will say that what i will have said before you have gone to tea was more like a sermon than a speech but your lordships must remember that a sermon has one advantage over a speech it is shorter <e> <s> it has taken me five years to produce three speeches and i can rattle off three sermons in one day <e> <s> i believe the days may well have departed for a very long time if not for ever when it used to be well said that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the best defence or armour that the police force has is public esteem <e> <s> could not much more be done to commend the long-suffering police to the public <e> <s> will the minister investigate and perhaps propagate the new scheme for the police and the public which is to begin in northamptonshire on st january next <e> <s> if he does not know about it would he be glad if i told him <e>", "<cs> my lords to the ministers mind would it not be a sensible thing in order to diminish the number of unverified assumptions which will be bandied about in the next three weeks to bamboozle the voting public for the government to issue or words of plain straight english explaining exactly how the veto or the control of these missiles will work if it ever unfortunately has to be operated <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships must not think that all of us on these benches think the same <e> <s> i agree with every word that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said both last time and this time and also with the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord robertson will withdraw this amendment because it has the contrary effect to that which he intends <e>", "<cs> my lords if as the noble lord lord jacques said we are going to debate before we have a debate how long it should last would we not be in great danger in the light of what has happened this afternoon of spending an hour or two deciding whether it should be five hours or two and a half hours <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the government yes more than thank them congratulate the government for what they have done towards the redemption of corby the steel town in my diocese <e> <s> it was a place of deathly despair and it is now a bed of hope which is blossoming <e> <s> i wish they would go on from one good work to another and see to what has happened in the boot and shoe belt of northamptonshire where over <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister thank me if i suggested that his reply might be on the lines that if there is a possible chance of putting the tiniest bit of sense into the heads of the managements of these nationalised industries and the unions there is no reason in divinity morals or politics why the government should not have a go at it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister like to draw the attention of the noble lord who asked the question to a letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by joining the other speakers in paying tribute to the minister who with great concern and courtesy has dealt with all the matters that we brought to him at various times <e> <s> we are thankful to him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name down to speak in this debate <e> <s> i speak on behalf of those who officiate on such occasions <e> <s> although it does not affect the church of england we warmly welcome this bill for other churches for which the anomaly has undoubtedly been a handicap <e> <s> i must add that we are dealing with the desires of those who are marrying <e> <s> wherever they may worship regularly the attraction of gothic buildings and four-part harmonic choirs is greater than anything covered by this bill <e> <s> having said that i wish to add my support to this small but generous bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not have a chief whip on these benches although it might be better if we did <e> <s> i am entirely new to your lordships house <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to express enormous thanks for the courtesy and support which are always shown to us by members of the house who are present much more frequently than we are <e> <s> we should like to be here more often and who knows now that we have a new father things may change <e> <s> i think that i should warn noble lords that we are liable to become more religious <e> <s> finally i should like to join in the general thanks which have been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak as i am a member of this worthless body thus described by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> we make our points not from our own views but from the vast amount of inquiry and research which we carry out among the british public <e> <s> during the course of these long debates on the broadcasting bill i have observed that the people who are the least noticed are the viewers and the listeners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> we have been received most courteously by the bbc and the iba in contrast to the way i was received by the press barons when i was on the press council <e> <s> but the complaints are bound to be sieved through the central authority of the bbc and the iba which have a job to do <e> <s> our job is different <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not the noble baroness to whom i was referring <e>", "<cs> my lords i should reveal for the benefit of those who were not here when i last spoke that i am a future member of the broadcasting standards council <e> <s> i say that because we have no existence until after the bill is enacted although we appear to be rather busy <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have journeyed the country viewers have expressed to me a deep unhappiness about these matters as anyone who appears on any platform anywhere will also know <e> <s> they are not bothered about whether they come from programmes or advertisements <e> <s> by and large advertisers probably have a good record <e> <s> i am not arguing about that <e> <s> i am arguing about what the viewers see <e> <s> if they see programmes and advertisements as a whole it is easier for them <e> <s> if they are told that there is a subtle difference it is more difficult <e>"]
