["<cs> my lords i crave the indulgence of your lordships in addressing your lordships house for the first time <e> <s> also i am a newcomer but i am moved especially on this occasion today to speak if i may for the silent sufferers in society whom i feel so deeply about <e> <s> from the very wide spectrum of the problems among the handicapped and disabled i wish to confine myself to adults and children with cancer <e> <s> their lack of care constitutes one of the biggest gaps in our society <e> <s> i refer in particular to people who receive when possible surgery and treatment <e> <s> while some return to a full life others realise with some alarm that they have entered a twilight world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in adding my congratulations and expressing my pleasure to the noble baroness lady airey of abingdon <e> <s> we all admire her marvellous example of courage and service to others and her speech surely inspires each of us tremendously <e> <s> what an original idea it was of the late hugh dalton in to allocate from the sale of surplus war stores million to be the basis of the memorial to the dead of the second world war <e> <s> but how sad it was that the governments of both political parties forgot about his visionary policy and how awful it was that the treasury should have neglected to bring the existence of this sum earmarked as a war memorial to the notice of successive ministers <e> <s> however the blackest and bleakest moment occurred in when the government of the day filched the original million from the land fund and left it with merely the accumulated interest <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness in all that she has said and if i may add that those of us who have the privilege of working for the homeless for those who are probably the most unloved in society and for the sick and the disabled often find our work is to a large extent greatly hindered because of the whim of some local fire officer <e> <s> there are no national regulations laid down but if local fire officers take it into their heads to decide upon so many extra fire doors through which we cannot even get out wheelchair patients at night not only are we as a voluntary society greatly hindered because we must raise all these funds from the public but at the same time we are even prevented from opening further accommodation which is desperately needed for the homeless the sick and disabled <e> <s> there are literally thousands of them in this country those i call the silent sufferers <e> <s> i would believe that this committee would fervently uphold what the noble baroness has said that we should get all possible help not just moral support but actual financial support in particular because we are so cut in other directions <e> <s> if any assistance can he given we should all be extremely grateful and in particular in respect of the fire precautions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could there please be a further debate on this vital brandt commission report which affects all mankind in the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness lady masham for initiating this debate <e> <s> a great deal has been said and more will be heard tonight <e> <s> i am therefore especially conscious of time but here we have before us the resolution made by the united nations and the magnitude of this international year of disabled people <e> <s> its importance cannot be over-emphasised <e> <s> what can we do to ensure that well-meaning statements knowledgeable speeches and good intentions are not forgotten <e> <s> to quote his royal highness prince charles it has the opportunity of a new beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also be allowed to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of hereford on his excellent and sincere maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that i may be able to convince your lordships of the situation developing in poland <e> <s> i speak from experience for i had the honour of serving with the poles in the special operations executive during the war and have been with them ever since mainly in poland <e> <s> may i very briefly review the background to the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords as a social worker who has worked in prisons elsewhere since i have seen not only the consequences of crime on the criminal himself including many under sentence of death but also on the victims of the nazi system many of whom were victims of the crime of genocide and of unsurpassed brutality and hatred <e> <s> we have heard and will continue to hear extremely interesting views on what is an immensely complex and difficult subject <e> <s> there is no single identifiable cause of violent crime just as there is no single utopian solution anywhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment in the hope that if parliament passes this measure there is at least an opportunity to stop its evil in three years time <e> <s> there are alas many people in britain now who no longer attend any form of worship in churches or chapels on sunday or have no form of belief whatever <e> <s> but i maintain that they still need a quiet day in the week which is different from their working days when they can have the opportunity to relax reflect enjoy peace and spend the day with their family <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us including the noble viscount lord tonypandy who wrote such an excellent letter in <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of this disaster and as one who is a frequent traveller on ferries because of the work that i do in other countries will it become obligatory for passenger lists to be published <e> <s> it has always seemed incredible to me that for all these years the making of passenger lists has not been an essential part of the duties of these different ferries and other ships <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord lord henderson of brompton the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and all the other noble lords who have taken part in the debate up to now <e> <s> i can only stand here and say with great humility that i have been a social worker and that since i have visited thousands of non-german prisoners in german prisons <e>", "<cs> from what i have heard this evening it seems that we have clearly concentrated our thoughts and our attentions upon the prisoner <e> <s> that is only right and proper <e> <s> however we should also remind ourselves of the victims <e> <s> what do we think of years in regard to a person who has been murdered or a person who has suffered distress which is quite beyond all comprehension or explanation <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with my noble friend lady robson the right reverend prelate the bishop of gloucester and the noble baroness lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> the committees decision on this amendment will have a profound effect on the sue ryder foundation which i as founder represent <e> <s> it is an international charity which works day and night for people of all age groups who are dying and others who are handicapped <e> <s> in this country alone the foundation cares for over people who are severely ill <e> <s> it costs over per day to care for those with cancer motor neurone disease and huntingdons chorea to quote but three <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had to sleep rough in my life and have shared the conditions of being frozen by the cold and stiff from rain followed by the feeling of being unable to face the ordinary people of society and ashamed of being dishevelled <e> <s> as a social worker and auxiliary nurse i am never surprised in the work which i represent to see these homeless people resort to drinking from the tops of ordinary citizens milk bottles on their doorsteps or trying to pinch sandwiches or fruit from a barrow <e> <s> we cannot say that it is all their fault that these people are homeless because there are so many reasons for an individual to sink rapidly to this point <e> <s> they are travellers of the road the mentally deranged the genuine persons who cannot cope without a job in areas of high unemployment and who misguidedly thinks that by reaching london he <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many arguments of principle and logic to back up the amendment <e> <s> i endorse them but i am no expert in the field of local government finance and would not presume to trespass on the territory of noble lords with wider experience in that field <e> <s> instead my perspective on the bill especially the provisions concerning charity shops is influenced by the effect it will have on the foundation i represent and work for <e> <s> the sue ryder foundation exists solely for the relief of suffering <e> <s> by that i mean we are for the sick and handicapped from tiny babies to our eldest patient <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for initiating the debate <e> <s> my objection is to the slow erosion of sunday and its relegation to being just another day of the week <e> <s> that is the worst change of all <e>", "<cs> my lords there are as always complex problems about all bills <e> <s> as a catholic sharing my concern with many other religions i find certain aspects of the bill quite abhorrent <e> <s> we have heard from our noble friend lord jellicoe of childless couples yet we forget the million aborted infants <e> <s> surely some of the murdered children might have been adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords the first question that we have to ask ourselves in this debate is whether or not we are dealing with a human person <e> <s> we have heard the term pre-embryo used constantly today and we are asked to believe that it is a scientific term for the embryo before days <e> <s> this is a disputed term <e> <s> though some scientists doing research are now using it many scientitsts are not <e> <s> we should all be aware that this term simply did not exist five years ago <e> <s> it is an invented term <e> <s> it was invented following a public outcry over the warnock committee recommendation that experiments be allowed up to days <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully endorse all that the noble baroness lady cox has <e>", "<cs> my lords in making my case i wish to make it clear that i fully acknowledge the sincerity of those who take a different view from mine and as a mother i understand the depths of their feelings <e> <s> however we are dealing with two separate persons each of whom has rights sadly rights which are in conflict with each other <e> <s> on the one side we have the mother to be who has the right to live a life of her own choosing on the other the unborn child who having been conceived by its mother and father has the right to live <e>", "<cs> my lords i work frequently in poland and so far have not heard of or seen any special funds that have been allocated specifically to the health service there <e> <s> is the minister aware that the polish health service is in chaos <e> <s> conditions are desperate and far worse than they <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for the noble viscount lord caldecote and the noble baroness lady phillips in their deep concern in the matter <e> <s> i share that concern <e> <s> i do not think that this is a frivolous matter or something to be laughed about outside the chamber as we have seen on television or read about in the press <e> <s> it is a sacred and difficult decision <e> <s> it is something about which many of us feel extremely deeply <e>", "<cs> my lords in our society as a consequence of its very nature sadly there will always be a gap between rich and poor <e> <s> what is needed as much as anything else and more now than ever is the element of caring that people should care about the welfare of each other and that governments should care equally for every level of society and especially for the poorest level of all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord pitt for changing places with me in the speakers list <e> <s> i apologise to the house for not being able to remain until the end of the debate owing to a previous long-standing engagement <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand here this evening to support the bill because i have seen worked with and nursed the victims of one of the worlds worst tyrannies <e> <s> the fact is still not well known that a minimum of million innocent men women and children of over different nationalities faiths and races were killed under the persecution inflicted on them by men and women of the gestapo and the ss between and <e>", "<cs> my lords since i have had the privilege of working and living among thousands of handicapped children and adults <e> <s> it is hard to explain the joy and grace which these people give <e> <s> their enthusiasm and often their ability to learn despite their pain and disabilty and their striving to overcome those difficulties to lead a useful and purposeful life is quite remarkable <e> <s> many are brilliant in the way they cope and achieve what to an ordinary person would be impossible <e> <s> there are eminent people like professor stephen hawking who cannot talk <e> <s> he is a professor of superspace and supergravity at cambridge university and he is but one example <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the hospices and the sue ryder homes the lack of financial assistance adds greatly to the existing worries of the staff and even more to thousands of supporters who are bewildered and dismayed by the governments attitude and lack of help <e>"]
