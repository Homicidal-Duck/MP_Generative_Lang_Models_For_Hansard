["<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble earl in this important matter and in this very full house <e> <s> while i am certain that we all take great pleasure from watching members of our royal family being made honorary chiefs of various canadian tribes with their highly colourful headdresses and traditions we must bear in mind that this is not a tourist peepshow but a serious part of their history and heritage of which they are rightly proud <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord ever consider an alarm system <e>", "<cs> my lords at the committee stage my noble friend the minister said that he had sympathy with the pensioners of this scheme <e> <s> i have one specific question to put to him <e> <s> as i understand it the first of the increases in question is now due to be paid an increase of per cent <e> <s> backdated to march <e> <s> this means that everyone who has retired from the scheme since that date should now get per cent <e> <s> more <e> <s> i have inquired about individual cases and i should like to quote the example of a mr h who retired on th may this year upon reaching the age of <e> <s> he was a cellarman in the refreshment rooms at marylebone and he had entered the railway service in <e> <s> his pension at present amounts to per week <e> <s> this would now be increased by p per week if the increases allowed for by the government actuary in are introduced <e> <s> my question is if the board cannot afford to pay these increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am last but i shall be short <e> <s> i am and indeed i am sure we are all grateful to the noble baroness lady masham of ilton for introducing with great skill this very vital debate especially this year the international year of disabled people <e> <s> we have all listened with great interest to the previous speeches all raising important points and giving many of us food for thought and i think that it becomes more obvious that as a community we must all pull together especially with the difficulties of the limited resources that are now available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my

that these imported blood products are completely free of infection <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this chance to speak on the question skilfully introduced by my noble friend lord vaux on the need for the appointment of a minister to look after and co-ordinate the needs of children <e> <s> although i am not convinced that the actual appointment of a minister is required i strongly believe in the need for some liaison between the ministry concerned and the parent who needs help guidance and advice from that ministry <e> <s> for example we have seen in the past and i am afraid even now the confusion and contradiction between the medical profession and the department of education over the subject of dyslexic children their recognition and the special needs that they have in the field of education <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not consider possibly bringing back into this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what about our own television media <e> <s> do they help the

my lords my noble friend mentioned an per cent <e> <s> increase in exports between our country and nigeria <e> <s> can he say how far back he is going on that statement and by how much <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there must be something wrong in the system <e> <s> i was definitely sent three messages last week but did not receive any of them in any shape or form <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> everyone i know is conscious of the need these days to help the public services pay their way but in view of the growing public concern at the proposed handling charge or could i say blood money <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he would not agree that when money enters the matter it opens the door for malpractice or commercialisation which i believe is the case in america <e> <s> is it morally correct to make any charge for blood given freely and <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give an indication as to what the handling fee will be <e> <s> i gather from the british medical association that it will cost about per unit that is three-quarters of a pint <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the minister this if the diplomats car is removed in this normal process i presume he is bound to pay the normal fee or fine <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend give an assurance that the governments commitment to special educational needs will be fully implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend have any figures relating to those children with special educational needs who have been moved from their ordinary mainstream schools to special schools <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give me any figures in any shape or form as to those people who have appointments in the national health service but do not keep them <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say what it costs per tonne to find coal in this country compared with any other country in the common market at todays rates <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> will he not consider the idea of incorporating the mot test as an attractive inducement to the already over-burdened motorist <e> <s> also will he not agree that it be in the interests of safety <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the ira is not recognised by the irish government under section of their constitution <e> <s> may i also ask my noble friend whether the showing of the television programme is the right thing to do at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i am in rather an unusual position as i stand in your lordships house this evening to speak on this important matter <e> <s> i was born in the republic <e> <s> i am a peer of the united kingdom <e> <s> at the same time i am also an irish citizen holding an irish passport <e> <s> i have lived all my life in that country until approximately eight years ago yet my allegiance is to the crown and parliament <e> <s> however as your lordships can imagine i have a great love for home <e> <s> it is for that reason that for a long time i have remained silent but now i feel the time may be right to say a few words on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords basically i speak for myself but will my noble friend not agree that those who work in that particular company have always gone for something in which they believe <e> <s> if they believe in it they believe in this country and i hope we all go along with that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the motor industry and about industry in general <e> <s> we brought mercedes here and we brought volkswagen here <e> <s> they were built here <e> <s> i was one of the people who started that <e> <s> we built it up and it was a big industry <e> <s> now what do
