["<cs> my lords first i should like to thank noble lords for the great courtesy and understanding shown to me on my arrival in this house <e> <s> bearing in mind your lordships instructions that a maiden speech must not be controversial i was relieved to find that the majority of the recommendations in the national health service white paper were welcomed by the medical profession and i suspect by most of the employees in the national health service <e> <s> so by confining my remarks to the uncontroversial recommendations i hope to keep to the straight and narrow path <e>", "<cs> my lords what i had proposed to say this afternoon is no longer relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords during the debate on the embryology legislation last week i found myself very much in agreement with my noble friend lord caldecote <e> <s> in particular i agreed with him that the back street abortion era was a great evil <e> <s> that situation was improved by the abortion act <e> <s> that act permits the lesser of two evils <e> <s> i shall never forget seeing the tragic suffering of so many young women as a result of the sordid back street abortion system of the s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he kindly explain preferably not in violent language how it is that perfectly ordinary nhs hospitals refuse to carry out abortions after weeks <e> <s> is he suggesting that such a hospital is a religious organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> does he not realise that there have been some benefits from this industrial dispute <e> <s> what has come to light is that only per cent <e> <s> of the so-called emergency service is in fact emergency <e> <s> what is happening is very interesting <e> <s> instead of little old ladies in lewisham going by ambulance to roehampton for the fitting of their artificial limb a journey of four hours on average they are being taken in great comfort by limousine at a fraction of the price and in half an hour <e> <s> there are therefore some benefits from the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that in this dispute mortality had gone down <e> <s> i said that when health care workers go on strike the tendency is for mortality to go down <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord should be fooled by newspaper and television reports stating that because of the delay in the arrival of the ambulance of one hour mr so-and-so died as a result <e> <s> i have gone into some of these cases and that it not so <e> <s> one has a man of say there is an alleged delay of one hour but in fact he died of pneumonia not a heart attack as alleged <e> <s> one therefore has to examine all these shroud-waving reports <e>", "<cs> it was winter-time and the mortality rate increases then <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord holderness regrets his unavoidable absence from the debate <e> <s> he is exceptionally well qualified to speak on the subject because as a result of war wounds he has been severely disabled for almost half a century <e> <s> as chairman of the disablement services authority for the past few years he has been actively engaged in securing a better organisation to meet the short-range transport needs of disabled people in terms of the supply of artificial limbs and wheelchairs <e> <s> he has been instrumental in galvanising the service throughout the country to look at the total rehabilitation of disabled people in order that they may return rapidly to as normal a life as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that there is no question of a self-governing hospital acting outside the nhs <e> <s> it will not move outside the nhs <e> <s> just because the noble lord said it three times does not mean to say <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords professor keen has been a life-long member of the labour party and has communist connections and he is therefore very much opposed to these changes <e>", "<cs> my lords although it may seem that this bill is principally concerned with hospitals nevertheless i believe that the proposed changes will have a much greater effect on general practice making it much more important and giving general practitioners more say in what hospitals do and how hospitals will develop in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is a management decision and that the decision should be made by the management <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord jenkin <e> <s> he said that when he was secretary of state he tried to depart from the usual structure of management <e> <s> he has forgotten that in fact he succeeded in one area in doing just that <e> <s> he replaced an area health authority with five commissioners <e> <s> not one of them was a doctor or a nurse <e> <s> none of them represented anybody except the patients <e> <s> three of the five were past vice-chancellors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out that if this was i would view these amendments very favourably <e> <s> in i introduced a modest pilot study into the national health service simply to improve the lot of the junior staff of our hospitals throughout the country <e> <s> it was a small pilot study which gave them security for the first time <e> <s> the study looked at their families and family life <e> <s> was it right to move the staff around every year <e> <s> was it right that they should have absolutely no security <e> <s> i had no axe to grind because i had been treated very well as a member of the junior staff in my time <e> <s> therefore i introduced this scheme into a small part of one of the regions of england <e> <s> that was in <e> <s> no one was going to lose any money or prestige <e> <s> all that would happen was that junior staff would get a better deal <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word or two about these constant references to commercialism and how terrible it is that patients may have to travel miles to reach other hospitals <e> <s> i emphasise once again the fact that local gps in a district will sit down with the district health authority officials helped by experts such as epidemiologists to decide what are the needs of the community and how best they can be met within the district as indeed they have been for years <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that comment <e> <s> let us take cornwall truro <e> <s> the local gps all come into truro from time to time <e> <s> they can have a jamboree sit down and discuss at a day conference with the district health authority how best the people of cornwall can be served by their health authority <e> <s> the hospital in truro is extremely good <e> <s> all the clinicians work very hard indeed and provide a marvellous service for the people in that community <e> <s> it may well be that there <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back to that question <e> <s> the noble lord may be forgetting the altruism of the people who at present provide the services in the national health service <e> <s> they work all hours of the night and day to provide the best possible service for people in the community <e> <s> they will continue to do so <e> <s> it is monstrous to suggest that we must have all these regulations to make sure that they continue doing what they have been doing <e>", "<cs> i wish to emphasise something which may have been overlooked by the committee <e> <s> if they wish to have junior staff all the hospitals in this country are inspected regularly by members of the medical profession <e> <s> that is done on a quite large scale <e> <s> the inspection teams have teeth <e> <s> not only do they inspect the actual training posts but they go into the question of sleeping facilities for junior staff food library facilities and other matters <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal first with the issue which the noble lord lord ennals frequently mentions that is commercialism <e> <s> i should like to ask this question <e> <s> who was it who brought up the subject of the sordidness of money and cash limits <e> <s> who introduced cash limits into the hospital service in the first place <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals will no doubt correct me if i am wrong but i believe that it was the noble lord himself who did so <e> <s> therefore the great emphasis on controlling the amount of money which is spent came initially quite rightly from him <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however it is also true to say that no secretary of state has ever given enough cash to cover inflation <e> <s> if inflation is estimated at per cent <e> <s> and it turns out to be per cent <e> <s> it is part of the technique of the treasury to ensure that it remains at per cent <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to go into details or to blame anyone <e> <s> i should like to say that at a particular hospital there is a solution which answers the problem of st thomass <e> <s> there is apparently something called the suspense account <e> <s> if one receives a bill and is not sure what to do with it one puts it in the suspense account which is also known as the dustbin <e> <s> that is a reasonable technique so long as one keeps looking in the dustbin and paying the bills <e> <s> however if it is left for a long time one may find oneself in difficulty <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i said that it should be management <e> <s> it is a management decision <e> <s> i believe that the decision should be made by those who manage the hospitals <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that this country is not governed by referendum <e> <s> therefore i am puzzled as to why the labour party now seem to be so keen on having ballots <e> <s> i have always understood that the labour party have never believed in ballots in various walks of life <e> <s> indeed why did the labour government not have a ballot in on the controversial issue of phasing out pay beds <e> <s> so why is the labour party now so keen on ballots <e>", "<cs> i withdraw it is not a labour party amendment but to me it has the stamp of the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i continue with my second point <e> <s> the propaganda is that nhs trusts are privatisation by the back door <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> we do not want privatisation of our hospitals <e> <s> we have seen in other countries what privatisation does <e> <s> we have seen the situation in the united states <e> <s> the average american citizen has twice as much surgery done on him or her as the average british patient <e> <s> is that what we want <e> <s> i am a surgeon and i am all for surgery but do we really want our citizens operated on to that extent <e> <s> of course we do not <e> <s> we want them to have the right amount of medical care <e> <s> we want to focus on need rather than on demand <e> <s> that is essential <e> <s> thirdly <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to answer on behalf of the government but the noble lord should perhaps ask the secretary of state for health whether he has private medical insurance <e> <s> he has not <e> <s> he relies entirely on the nhs <e> <s> i believe that the government do not want to privatise the health service <e> <s> health considerations are different from any other walk of life <e> <s> to go down the privatisation line is to end up with the british people having twice as much surgery and we do not want that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lady hooper replies perhaps i may point out that it is rather difficult to guarantee what percentage of women enter a medical school each year <e> <s> as i am sure the committee is aware you make offers to a large number of candidates on the basis that they obtain the necessary grades so you never know whether there will be a predominance of women or men until the a-level results come out <e> <s> you cannot therefore guarantee the percentage <e> <s> when i was sub-dean of a certain medical school in london it became clear that the ladies achieved much better a-level results than the men so inevitably year by year the number of ladies that we recruited went up and up <e> <s> that did not make me particularly popular in that medical school because i was accused of plotting to prevent the school from winning the rugger cup in subsequent years <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may assure the noble baroness that we are very much aware that one tends to get double the amount of work out of two half-time lady consultant anaesthetists as one gets out of a so-called whole-time man <e>", "<cs> i agree very much that we need better access for disabled people and also that we need toilets suitable for disabled people <e> <s> i am not sure that this is the right way to go about it <e> <s> but when we talk about a civilised country having such services i hope your lordships will not mind my reminding you that the facilities here are none too good <e> <s> we need at least another two toilets for disabled people <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> did the noble lord lord ennals say that the gps in voting voted against this <e> <s> can he tell us the details of the voting carried out by the bma please <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i should like to ask the noble lord lord peston a question <e> <s> would he have any objection to identifying a general practitioner or a hospital consultant who spends a vast amount of money on a drug which is known to have no value <e> <s> presumably there would be no problem about applying sanctions or giving advice to such a person <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord lord ennals not understand that the reduction in bed numbers that he now sees is simply part of the reduction in bed numbers which has occurred since <e> <s> there has been a steady decline irrespective of which government has been in office <e> <s> if you look at a graph you can see that it is a straight line decline <e> <s> the noble lord cannot persist in saying that the government are closing more beds than any other previous government <e> <s> it is a trend <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble baroness <e> <s> in there was a marvellous surgeon called rex lawrie together with a spendid paediatrician called ronnie mackeith <e> <s> they decided in before there was all this hullabaloo about costs and beds that the best way to treat children having operated on them was to send them home the same day <e> <s> that was part of the policy <e> <s> it had nothing to do with saving money or beds because no one knew how much money or how many beds were there <e> <s> it was a distinct definite policy <e> <s> it is most certainly better simply to keep children in for <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> when he introduced the rawp formula it resulted in a reduction of services in some districts but it resulted in an increase in services in those districts to which the money was redistributed <e> <s> the noble lords rawp formula would have been a good thing if there had been sustained growth in the economy <e> <s> unfortunately there was not sustained growth in the economy so rawp became an appalling hardship in many areas <e> <s> that was the mistake but it was not the noble lords mistake <e> <s> there is no doubt that his rawp formula resulted in a reduction of services in some districts <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say how grateful i am to my noble friend lord young for his kind remarks about me <e> <s> i should also like to say what a splendid patient he was <e> <s> he taught us how difficult consumerism is in the medical sphere <e> <s> if one is nice to the patients they will never say anything that could possibly be construed as criticism of doctors nurses or even administrators <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that part of the problem of st thomass hospital is that resources in the nhs have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great sympathy with the amendment especially when i leave your lordships house at am and start work at the hospital at am by thursday i add up the hours <e> <s> they come to very nearly <e> <s> i therefore have great sympathy with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may draw attention to the present situation <e> <s> psychiatric patients cannot be referred outside their districts now <e> <s> therefore there is no choice right now for psychiatric patients <e> <s> the present situation for other patients is that most general practitioners will refer a patient to a particular hospital <e> <s> there are many places in the country where there is only one hospital anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords the current situation is entirely unsatisfactory because the gps do not refer their patients to hospitals where the waiting lists are shorter <e> <s> one of the strange facts in the national health service is that general practitioners will not refer their patients to a hospital miles away where the waiting list is shorter <e> <s> i do not blame them <e> <s> there are many reasons why they do not do so <e> <s> tradition is one of them <e> <s> they may say we have always sent our patients to hospital x and we shall continue to do so <e> <s> they have been very reluctant to consider sending their patients further afield <e>", "<cs> indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i can answer the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> let us suppose that a general practitioner in southend insists on sending his patients to the london hospital for an ingrowing toenail <e> <s> that would be deemed an extravagant use of resources when surgeons in southend are perfectly able to treat the condition <e> <s> it is an extreme example but it is valid <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment as it stands has one great defect <e> <s> if one works it out mathematically the waiting lists will eventually be measured in hours because of necessity as it is written in the amendment waiting lists will have to become shorter and shorter <e> <s> i do not believe that that is what the noble lords lord peston and kilmarnock have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether i am allowed to answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with what the noble lord is trying to do <e> <s> it is just that the mathematics does not make sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to take a view opposite to that of the noble lord lord butterfield because one of the reasons why i went back to guys to be professor of surgery was that he was professor of medicine <e> <s> when he heard that i was coming he promptly left for nottingham but i can forgive him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to take a contrary view and explain why i oppose the amendment <e> <s> i give as an illustration a certain district health authority which had more than people employed in its finance department <e> <s> to be fair to those people not one had a financial qualification and not one was paid adequately <e> <s> that was probably why the finances of that health authority were in such a mess <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add to the usual funereal dirge of the noble lord lord ennals about all the disasters that are going to occur next year <e> <s> i should like to quote this passage from certain sections of my own profession <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals says hear hear but i need to tell him the date of this funereal dirge <e> <s> it is <e> <s> we have had these statements for the last years <e> <s> my advice to the noble lord lord ennals is to cheer up a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords it was said in october and is a statement by the deans and presidents of the royal colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords the problem is that if ever you feel that you are short of money the only way to get money or seem to be able to obtain more money is to bring out these funereal dirges about how terrible everything is that everything is about to collapse and that the great ship of state the nhs is about to sink <e> <s> it has been sinking for a long time but it seems very much afloat to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to rise to defend the patient <e> <s> half the drugs that are prescribed are not taken <e> <s> we know that many patients have been put on large doses of valium for long periods of time <e> <s> that has certainly reduced the quality of their lives <e> <s> that is a fact <e> <s> downward pressure on the drug bill is therapeutic <e> <s> we have to protect patients from over-prescribing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what good it will do to put the words of the amendment on to the face of the bill <e> <s> people know what to do but it is impossible to force them to do it <e> <s> for example the noble lord lord ennals is very keen on preventing people from smoking <e> <s> and yet on national no smoking day there was a photograph in the press showing noble lords and members of another place smoking their pipes in defiance of that day <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ennals was not among them nor was any noble lord on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the reassurance of my noble friend lady faithfull it seems to me that we need the amendment only if <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the noble lord lord ennals is <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that i have never denigrated the staff of st thomass hospital because i am the chairman of the department of surgery of both st thomass hospital and guys hospital <e> <s> the nurses and the doctors do a particularly fine job of work <e> <s> it is the financial control that is the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> it is exactly the kind of encouragement that we need to give to disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how very pleased i am with this bill <e> <s> we can now move forward to implement it without further delay <e> <s> i believe that these reforms will work as i have already had personal experience of most of them for some years <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his helpful and careful response and also the noble lord lord clinton-davis and the noble earl lord halsbury for their helpful comments <e> <s> i reserve the right to come back on report <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord in his amendment <e> <s> my quarrel with this is the suggestion that gmos are dangerous and the qualification comes later which is a pity <e> <s> when this amendment was discussed in another place the minister made the point that controls must prevent damage rather than apply only after it has occurred <e> <s> it would seem possible that he may have misinterpreted what the amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> we are not talking about grammatical differences between one version of a definition as against another but trying to make the fundamental point that the present drafting of the description of damage to the environment implies that all gmos are dangerous and obviously this is not the case <e> <s> i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his helpful response and all those who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> having listened to all the arguments i believe that i prefer the amendment of the noble lords lord nathan and lord lewis <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> having worked for the bbc for about years in an advisory capacity on medical programmes i must say that i have been enormously impressed by the high standard of the programmes and the great care that is taken to get them right <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the real problem is that anyone who has such a test for aids finds it impossible to obtain an insurance policy <e> <s> that is the crucial matter <e> <s> even if the test is negative the fact that one has had it bars one from obtaining life assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment to the commons amendment my name is attached to it i should like to point out that i have supported the clauses in this bill which permit experiments on embryos <e> <s> secondly having seen the tragedies of back street abortions in the s and s i recognise that abortion up to weeks is the lesser of two evils <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down does he acknowledge that our amendment would not prevent one termination <e> <s> with this amendment we are not concerned with a handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that over the past years the district authorities of guys and lewisham have closed over beds because they were not needed <e> <s> further does she not agree that out of the total complement of beds beds have been closed for purely financial reasons <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will agree that those financial reasons were because our late and unlamented district health authority told us three months into the financial year that we were to receive million less this year than last even though its budget had been increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers on their splendid contribution to this debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady eccles for dealing so well with the problems of the national health service <e> <s> i too was very pleased to hear in the gracious speech about the governments determination to continue to improve the national health service <e> <s> in the past few months we have already seen a considerable improvement as a result of <e>"]
