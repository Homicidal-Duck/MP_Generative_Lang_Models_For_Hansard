["<cs> my lords a few weeks ago i was reading the memoirs of the man who was once vicar of the parish of st lawrence byker from about to <e> <s> some of your lordships will know that byker is a river-side district in the east of newcastle <e> <s> it has achieved some recent fame because of the imaginative and unusual housing redevelopment which has taken place there including the so-called byker wall <e> <s> however years ago the picture was very different <e> <s> the memoirs show that it was not unusual for a dwelling of four rooms intended for one family to contain four families and for upwards of people to share the use of one outside we and one outside tap both of which could and did freeze up in winter <e>", "<cs> i want to support the powerful speech made by the noble lord who moved the amendment <e> <s> although the noble baroness has said that there is nothing more to be said i hope that your lordships will forgive me if i make one or two points which have not been made and which might underwrite the case <e> <s> just over two years ago i was at a lambeth conference which some noble lords will know is a gathering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble baroness for her kind welcome and her kind remarks <e> <s> i noticed that the standing order of your lordships house concerning maiden speeches states that they should be unprovocative <e> <s> that makes yet more difficult the task of a maiden <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for an opportunity to take part in this debate as my name occurs several times in the report which we are discussing <e> <s> further i am grateful to the noble lord lord sudeley for the understanding way in which he has set out the background and the contents of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord trafford on his notable maiden speech and to say what a pleasure it was to listen to a speech of so much expert content delivered with such clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to assure the minister that i welcomed what he said <e> <s> he put into words the misgivings or hesitations which i had and i believe that those misgivings deserve to be expressed a little more fully <e> <s> they concern the familiar point about the english sunday and there is some danger that it will be trickled away and eroded <e> <s> not long ago we had the legislation concerning off-course betting on sundays <e> <s> we now have another detailed proposal <e> <s> details work cumulatively and surely the whole question of the nature of the english sunday and its observance deserves to be looked at in its own right <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his kind reference to me just now <e> <s> he spoke very persuasively in presenting his case on this amendment <e> <s> i consider the amendment to be regrettable though hard to resist <e> <s> we all know that good friday has long been a working day in some parts of the country and increasingly stores are open on good friday <e> <s> given these facts it would be difficult or repressive to try to prevent the purchase of alcohol on that day <e> <s> i regard this amendment to be regrettable because i and many others consider much in the present observance of good friday to be regrettable <e> <s> i shall be very much interested to learn of the ministers views on this subject in due course <e>"]
