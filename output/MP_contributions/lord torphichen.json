["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> can he by any chance give the house some indication of when <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to my original question and ask my noble friend whether he is aware that the so-called telephone interconnection industry is virtually denied to british firms by nature of the restrictions placed upon it by the british post office and that a quite small liberalisation of this monopoly could possibly pay dividends both to post office workers who would be given more work thereby and to british firms who would be able to export the products relating to the telephone system <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord wedderburn how he intends tax treatment to be comparable <e> <s> does he intend that trade unions may use tax free payments from their members to be applied directly to the labour party and does he intend that companies may pay money to the conservative party only after they have paid per cent <e> <s> corporation tax <e> <s> could he explain it please <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me which department which part of the home office or post office is responsible for this review and for allocating whatever frequency is to be allocated <e>", "<cs> i still have not been convinced by either the noble lord lord mccarthy or the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> may i preface my remarks by saying that i am probably the only member of your lordships house who could possibly find himself at the wrong end of a closed shop agreement and liable to lose his job thereby <e> <s> i have just changed my job from one firm which contemplated using the closed shop to one where there is a multipicity of unions on one site and no possibility of a close shop ever being in sight <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may jump in briefly with both feet probably putting them right in it and ask the noble lord lord mccarthy how he would judge a case in which the union dues were paid intermittently <e> <s> for example if a man was at sea five years ago being a member of the national union of seamen and had been ashore for a time and had not paid his subscription because he was in a shore job could he return to sea without having to pay five years back subscriptions without being caught by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl lord avon to think again about both the examples that he gave <e> <s> first there were the so-called rumble strips on the approach to the pass through glenfarg as one came off the m <e> <s> it is now outdated because a new section of the m has just been opened so that stretch of road is no longer in use <e> <s> to call them rumble strips is some civil servants bit of double talk <e> <s> they were certainly fairly small and fairly closely spaced but they were humps <e>", "<cs> i thought that this evening we had come to agree to put a safeguard into a bill which i shall not say accidentally by persistence passed its second reading <e> <s> i am not quite sure which is the favoured form of safeguard <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord boston could tell us which of the other amendments he favours if he does not favour this one or should we vote for each of them in turn <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon made the case identically for including in this bill adopted children <e> <s> adopted children are not included in this bill and the case that the noble lord made for <e> <s> stepchildren is in that case no different by his reasoning from that of an adopted child <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to start again <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what is commonly termed a lash-up <e>", "<cs> there is a saying of the arabs something like never let the camels nose inside your tent <e> <s> i am afraid that the prime instrument policy which somehow has been sold to this government is very much the camels nose followed by the entire camel right into the tent <e> <s> the question that i have to ask of my noble friend on the front bench is when this prime instrument is installed possibly with some wiring specified by the customer or forced on the customer is the customer then allowed to disconnect the instrument to connect his apparatus or must he keep connected to the exchange line this prime instrument <e>", "<cs> may i query this amendment <e> <s> it sounds as though the noble lord lord glenamara is ruling out that any form of financial inducement could be offered to employees to move to a new subsidiary <e> <s> i am sure that if a company in the private sector wished to set up a subsidiary in an outpost it would have to take some of its key men there first and nine times out of i suspect that they would do so at a very pleasant premium <e> <s> is the noble lord ruling this out for the post office <e>", "<cs> there is no law in this land which says that i may not buy an electricity standby generator there is no law which says that i may not dig a well there is no law which says that i may not go down to <e>", "<cs> in reply to the suggestion of the noble earl lord gowrie that british telecom might be excluded from the terminal market altogether i can only retort that they can do anything the secretary of state cares to give them a licence to do under this amendment <e> <s> so the only problem would be british telcom doing its homework and listing the services it is supplying and the systems it is running and having the licence written out covering them <e> <s> except for the time factor i do not see any objection at all <e>", "<cs> i believe i heard the noble earl lord gowrie endorse what the noble lord lord underhill said about the network being indivisible <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why one should not license sections of the network in exactly the same way that the iba licenses areas of the country for the running of television channels <e> <s> it would be more complicated <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord davies of leek has hit it right on the nail <e> <s> the set of terms used to define the monopoly seems to have gone back quite a way in the telegraphy and wireless acts <e> <s> obviously if we did not give the monopoly to someone the secretary of state the post office or whoever it happens to be it would be perfectly legal for anybody to set up his wireless transmitter on any frequency he liked and ruin everybody elses communications <e> <s> the answer to the problem might lie in an amendment saying without enhancement by the human <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether his words mean that the purpose of this clause as continued from the act has now changed <e> <s> in that originally its purpose was to allow the then post office or the crown to order the allocation of frequencies <e>", "<cs> i was referring to the noble lords remarks just now about including lasers and suchlike devices in the monopoly <e>", "<cs> returning to what i was saying to the noble lord lord lyell the wording of clause seems to have grown up for a very different purpose from that for which it is being used in this measure <e> <s> originally there was need to control who used what frequency or to prevent any tom dick or harry stringing up wires across the road and the language of the provision has gradually accommodated most of the ways of getting round the post office now the bt monopoly <e> <s> in the meantime the allocation of frequencies is no longer any part of bts responsibilities <e> <s> technology has given us ways of communicating across the street without stretching wires across to the danger of people <e>", "<cs> may i give a very short example of where this could cause problems <e> <s> there is a trade magazine <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> first i was worried that two different organisations with perfectly legitimate licensed machinery attached to their telephone lines could fall foul of the monopoly by communicating with other people and passing third party information and secondly how would the monopoly be enforced if the only way to do so would be by examining the messages going down the wires which seems very undesirable <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord glenamara has stressed among other things that one of the reasons for moving this amendment is to protect those parts of british industry which can or would supply attachments <e> <s> could i draw to his attention the problems which this industry has had to face during the past <e>", "<cs> in framing these rules and regulations is it the governments intention to produce both a negative and positive form of vetting <e> <s> there could be defined a very large class of shall i say <e> <s> receive-only terminals for telephone equipment which would need no more approval than their ability to meet conditions which ensure that they do not put dangerous voltages on the line <e> <s> in other words in approving such equipment nothing more complicated is required than the kind of approval that might be given to an attachment for a vacuum cleaner or some other item of household equipment <e> <s> if there is only one full-blooded rigmarole for positive examination of equipment that is to be attached i believe that the sheer number of appliances which will come forward for approval in time perhaps not this year but maybe next year could swamp the approvals system and prevent it working properly <e>", "<cs> my lords other noble lords have most expertly described how cable television may be organised and should be controlled <e> <s> i cannot follow that and i should like briefly to describe one or two ways in which it may be specified <e> <s> i presume the home office will in due course produce a set of ground rules and inevitably the interested parties will attempt to ensure that their requirements and interests are catered for <e>", "<cs> noble lords have been arguing rather minutely the length to which the government should go to compel british telecom to provide services to the limit <e> <s> but no matter how far they compel british telecom to go there will always come a point where the service will not be provided <e> <s> the government could get round that difficulty very easily by simply amending another part of the bill to ensure that where british telecom does not wish to or cannot provide a service either the individual who wishes to use the service or a third party shall be empowered or licenced to operate such a service and why not <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate why noble lords would want this amendment but the trend is away from using paper directories and manual means and the voice at the end of the telephone <e> <s> the french telephone authorities have tried it and so i am sure have the americans <e> <s> the trend is towards supplying directory assistance through prestel-type keyboard attachments <e> <s> that is fine for the people who can read and whose sight is good but obviously if one cannot read a telephone directory neither can one read a computer attached to a telephone <e> <s> the trouble with the amendment is that it only refers to directory enquiry services <e> <s> in due course a directory inquiry service might be quite a different animal from the one we are trying to protect today <e>", "<cs> i like this amendment a little but only a little <e> <s> perhaps i might be allowed to hang some comments and a couple of questions on it which would not sit very well elsewhere <e> <s> the amendment seeks <e>", "<cs> if i may come back briefly to run almost any of the services i envisage are promoted by this amendment one would almost certainly have to make some form of attachment to the british telecom system <e> <s> i am not talking about physical attachments but clause does not permit any form of attachment and use of the system without a licence <e>", "<cs> two noble lords have spoken to the effect that at times the home office has not sufficiently fought our case in the international arena for allocations of frequencies <e> <s> that is probably not really true to say <e> <s> the fact is that as in a number of other international bodies with one vote per nation as the number of third world small nations has grown the one nation one vote principle has become less sensible and less effective and has militated against the interests of industralised western countries <e> <s> but that is not at all part of this amendment <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn may i ask my noble and learned friend the lord advocate whether the advice that he has had concerning attachments choking up the system and leaving extensions apparently engaged referred to <e>", "<cs> i think that the point the noble lord lord kaldor has introduced is a very valid one <e> <s> the post office when it designed the subscriber trunk dialling system in the s allocated two types of number a first-class service for those in the major city areas whose codes were the same whether they were dialled from outside that area outside the country or whatever and those outside the major city areas who in general end up with a telephone number which is preceded by one of three possible codes first a very short code for local exchanges to dial secondly a slightly longer code for dialling that particular exchange from anywhere in this country usually different from the last digit of the first prefix and thirdly you may find that you have yet a third prefix which people dialling from outside the country must use <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say this to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i should have thought that the words of my noble and learned friend the lord advocate were quite sufficient because if there were an all-out strike which prevented compliance with the licence in some way it seems to us that the operator would be doing everything in his power to put everything right otherwise he would go bankrupt <e> <s> the only case that he could possibly be talking about is one where some form of selective action is contemplated by a union over some particular customer or class of customers be they black south african or whatever whom the union did not happen to like <e> <s> in such a case i cannot see there is any difference between having the terms of the licence breached by the operator or by his trade union organised staff <e> <s> it is just as had in either case <e>", "<cs> my lords there seems to be one thing which the change from should to must might unnecessarily rule out in future <e> <s> i shall need to read the speech of the noble lord lord cockfield to see exactly what the effect of these amendments will be but it seems to me that they might increase the separation between the public system and private systems built with the same components and the same technology in parallel and which quite rightly when they are built do not have to conform exactly to the letter of those standards which are right for the public system <e> <s> however they are likely to be built using very similar basic components similar methods and to the same standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see that this will apply mainly or only to trade disputes there are many other reasons why litigation might be needed <e>", "<cs> in view of the obvious good intentions of this amendment i do not like to be the one member of the committee to express an opposite view <e> <s> however there is one point that worries me <e> <s> i cannot see that there is here a definition of a volunteer which will stand the test of time <e> <s> can one of the movers of the amendment or perhaps the government spokesman afterwards attempt to tell us whether some organisation which would not fit the popular view of a charity or a voluntary organisation such as scientologists could simply claim that <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend lord ferrers to explain how the amendments to the bill which is an amendment to the act fit in <e> <s> in section a of the act the prohibition is for a person <e>", "<cs> the question i am about to ask would hang better on amendment no <e> <s> than on this amendment but the noble viscount lord dilhorne may not move that amendment <e> <s> what do the government feel will happen to the standard british army weapon in use from about to which i understand is a single-shot self-loading rifle based on the belgian fn weapon <e> <s> i do not know how many of these there are but their predecessor the mark iv enfield found its second use as everybodys first training weapon in schools and army cadet forces <e>", "<cs> i apologise for intervening again <e> <s> i was referring to the physical disposition of the weapons <e> <s> will the armys weapons be scrapped thrown down a mine or otherwise destroyed <e> <s> if not what market will they be put on to <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to understand the governments thinking behind this provision <e> <s> the numbers of these weapons will be very large <e> <s> there must be some understanding of whether the government are going to pulp the weapons or scrap them or whether they will be resold <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to return to this point again <e> <s> i intended to make a distinction between the burst fire weapons the sub-machine guns the kalashnikovs and the replacement british army weapon which may be fired either single shot or burst and the weapon that the british army used between and which had to have the trigger squeezed once and repeatedly once more each time the soldier wanted a single round to be fired <e> <s> there is a distinction there <e>", "<cs> the amendment uses the expression self-loading rifles in the last sentence <e> <s> it takes the words from clause ab and ac in the firearms amendment bill <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord wynford quoted a definition of a self-loading rifle from the other place which was totally at odds with the idea that i had of a self-loading rifle <e> <s> can my noble friend lord ferrers define what is a self-loading rifle <e> <s> in what way does it differ from the act definition in section a which states <e>", "<cs> surely the only way one can check a reference is if one personally knows the person who writes the reference <e> <s> i cannot see that this can be of any use in this case <e>", "<cs> that sounds fine but my noble friend lord ferrers has not indicated clearly enough that an applicant from a foreign country will have to know that he will have to ask for the appropriate wording to be added to his permit <e> <s> i can see that someone from a country which does not place territorial restrictions on visitors permits will assume that his permit covers the whole of great britain <e> <s> it will not occur to him that he has to ask specifically <e>", "<cs> i should like to return to the words <e>", "<cs> does the weapon come into that persons possession if it is merely on approval <e> <s> that will clarify my earlier problem <e>", "<cs> the police in edinburgh recently had a problem over how they dispose of guns <e> <s> it is not a certain thing <e>", "<cs> i entirely understand that <e> <s> i hope that i did not say anything out of line <e>", "<cs> he might board a fishing vessel or a holiday ship in error but if the transmitter were so small that he could make a mistake about it the transmission would not reach the land <e> <s> if the transmitter is seriously capable of reaching land some or miles away and causing interference there is no question that he could make a mistake about a holiday ship <e> <s> that does not wash
