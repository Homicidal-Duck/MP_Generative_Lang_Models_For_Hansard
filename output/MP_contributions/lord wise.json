["<cs> my lords referring to the noble earls reply to the question put by the noble lord lord kaldor does he not agree that sheep farmers today selling lambs would undoubtedly he losing money were it not for the subsidy being paid under the united kingdom guarantee system <e> <s> notwithstanding what happens to the french market does he not agree that it is essential that this form of guarantee or at least some similar form is retained in any common sheepmeat policy in order to safeguard the interests of the british producer and indeed to ensure a regular continuity of supply of fresh meat into the shops <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak briefly in support of this amendment and to follow on from what the noble earl lord malmesbury has said <e> <s> it is of great importance not only to the beekeeper but also to the fruit grower <e> <s> it has been established that of all the insects pollinating fruit blossom approximately per cent <e> <s> are honey bees <e> <s> i also understand that experiments have been carried out at rothamsted to ascertain the efficacy of bees in pollination <e> <s> trees were covered and bees were excluded from them <e> <s> in these cases i understand that absolutely no fruit set <e> <s> in other trees where bees were introduced the fruit set was some-where in the region of per cent <e> <s> i think that commercial fruit growers are quite happy as the noble earl lord malmesbury said with somewhere between per cent <e> <s> and if they are lucky per cent <e> <s> fruit set <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for his explanations but i still cannot understand when all else has failed why the secretary of state for the environment should not be obliged to call in the proposal in order to look at it with officials with the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> surely then the two departments could get <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first add my congratulations to the two noble earls who made their maiden speeches today <e> <s> they were superb and i think that we are fortunate indeed to have heard two such very fine maiden speeches in one afternoon <e> <s> farming is undoubtedly a high cost industry which in order to maintain profitability necessitates very high output <e> <s> it is also generally acknowledged that the countryside is to a certain degree dependent upon farming and if farming is thriving then the countryside is also thriving <e> <s> notwithstanding the remarks of the noble lord lord winstanley i feel that there is bound to be some conflict of interest and it is essential that farming interests are always fully aware of our national heritage <e> <s> as the noble lord lord buxton of alsa said a landscape feature which perhaps has been created over many hundreds of years can be demolished in a matter of hours <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the example is my own case <e> <s> the area so designated had a tree preservation order placed upon it first with the inference that it was to be in the future designated as a sssi <e> <s> that was done without any inspection of the land whatsoever <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i apologise if i have misled the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was most interested in the remarks of my noble friend lord chelwood regarding relief of capital transfer tax for owners of designated land <e> <s> i think that that could well be worth considering <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support my noble friend because i have in the past been adversely affected by a proposed sssi in selling my own property where the prospective buyer was prepared to pay a substantial sum of money more than i obtained if he could have reclaimed some waste woodland <e> <s> while i regret losing money i am glad in a way that it could not be done because i had nurtured this land for many years <e> <s> i am not concerned about that <e> <s> i am concerned about the small farmers who may possibly need to increase their acreage in order to retain a viable unit <e> <s> possibly they may need to sell this land in order to obtain more land <e> <s> it seems to me that they would be adversely affected if they did not receive some form of compensation by virtue of the fact that their land would be lessened in value <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already extended to my noble friend lord elphinstone on a first-class maiden speech <e> <s> my noble friend is a young man of wide interests and i hope that we shall have the pleasure of listening to him on many occasions in the future <e> <s> it is i believe evident that at the moment the farming industry in this country is really in the doldrums <e> <s> there is certainly nothing very buoyant about it and the outlook for the immediate future is not particularly bright but i feel that there is hope that conditions will improve in the long term <e> <s> the problem facing the industry at the moment is very simple but incredibly difficult to solve <e> <s> the problem is one of rapidly increasing costs with a more or less static return <e> <s> as my noble friend lord gisborough said and i feel that it cannot be emphasised too strongly farming income has been falling every year since and in fact it fell by per cent <e> <s> in real terms in <e>", "<cs> my lords in a bill such as this it is with some considerable trepidation that i put my name to any amendments <e> <s> but i do so to these amendments because i am certain that a scheme for statutory interest undoubtedly has great attractions for the smaller firms <e> <s> as i understand them these amendments would implement a scheme and therefore the smaller firms would be placed in a more beneficial position <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is the general practice for only the first three following speakers to congratulate a maiden speaker but notwithstanding that fact i would very much like to congratulate the noble lord lord northbourne on his fine maiden speech <e> <s> i think that his wide knowledge and business expertise will surely be a great asset to this house and i most certainly look forward to hearing him on many occasions in the future and not only on agricultural affairs <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i ask him one question relating to the levy <e> <s> am i right in understanding that the p levy will be paid only by the finishers of the pigs when they are sold <e> <s> will any levy whatsoever be placed upon the breeders of the pigs <e> <s> because it seems to me now that the balance is very heavily weighted in their favour if breeders are not going to subscribe at all to any levy and if the finishers are going to pay the lot <e>", "<cs> my lords while generally welcoming this bill i want briefly to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln and my noble friend lady elliot in emphasising the apprehension which is felt among people living in rural areas most especially those living in the more remote places <e> <s> i make no apologies for this for notwithstanding the safeguards in clause there are real fears in the rural areas that there will be a drastic curtailment of telephone services <e> <s> there is concern also that the number of kiosks will be considerably reduced and these kiosks as my noble friend lady elliot said are in many instances a lifeline and an absolute necessity for the well-being of isolated communities <e> <s> however they must be uneconomic and the annual loss on many of them is undoubtedly considerable and far too great for any private company to sustain <e>", "<cs> my lords do the new regulations regarding the standardisation of the non-rotating type of take-off shaft guard which i understand come into force on st january next apply only to new machines purchased after that date or will it be obligatory for farmers to replace existing guards which on some of the older machines are not entirely satisfactory <e> <s> will they need to be replaced by this new type of guard <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed grateful to my noble friend lord alport for raising this question this evening because controversy has ranged over the vexed question of straw burning for perhaps the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity to speak in support of this small bill <e> <s> it is a measure of some importance to the communications of east anglia <e> <s> i think if my memory is correct that <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all recognise that there is over-production of milk within the community and that some form of limitation is necessary <e> <s> it has been decided i think regrettably that this quota system is the way in which it has to be done but it is inevitable that quotas will cause unemployment not only in the industry but as the noble lord lord graham has said in all other ancillary industries as well <e> <s> the effect could be calamitous to small family farms in areas where milk production is the only possible means of livelihood <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not putting down my name to speak but i thought that i would not be in the house this evening <e> <s> however i want to make only one small plea <e> <s> it is for farm dwellings within green belt areas <e>", "<cs> my lords it is evident that the farming industry is facing a difficult time <e> <s> at the moment bank <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that i can verify the remarks of the noble lord lord winstanley because this time last week i was in fact lying in the westminster hospital after being taken there hurriedly from this building during the morning <e> <s> is my noble friend aware also that the care and attention i received and the kindness shown to me during the whole of my stay there could not have been bettered anywhere in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies i wish to follow on one point which was made by the noble lord lord john-mackie regarding agricultural land <e> <s> why is it necessary for those words to be included in the regulations <e> <s> it could be because a number of battery hens are kept on land which is not agricultural land <e> <s> there could also be a few calves which are kept in back gardens and therefore not covered by these regulations <e> <s> i think that they should be covered by the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the excellent speeches which we have heard this evening have been devoted to the problems of large-scale forestry enterprises <e> <s> i want to address my very brief remarks to the difficulties facing owners of some of the smaller acreages of mixed hardwood woodlands which were devastated by the october hurricane <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this bill would generally have had a much more favourable outlook had it been introduced three years ago or whenever it was in the immediate aftermath of the ghastly heysel stadium tragedy <e> <s> however even now one must recognise the governments good intention in promoting it <e> <s> but one must also doubt whether it will be effective in achieving its desired results or indeed whether it will he practicable in operation <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to what the noble lord lord peston has said regarding these two amendments <e> <s> there is considerable concern within the argicultural industry and the rural communities that due regard should be taken of their interests <e> <s> i understand that the secretary of state is determining that the number of consumers committees shall be the same number as the authorised areas but with possible additions of suppliers <e> <s> i am not familiar with those areas but it must be fair to say that the rural communities will constitute a considerable proportion of the majority of them <e>", "<cs> i should first like to thank all noble lords from all sides of the committee who have supported the amendments <e> <s> indeed we are grateful <e> <s> i am deeply appreciative of the remarks of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i am certain that his remarks will also be appreciated by the general public <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one point for clarification <e> <s> i am still not absolutely sure whether as a consumer living in a cottage on top of a hill i could pay more for the water that i consume than a friend living in a town miles away <e> <s> i am not sure about that <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that it is recognised that in practice with the possible exception of the scilly isles there is now a common tariff throughout the country <e> <s> i believe that it will remain so in the north of scotland <e> <s> it is considered relevant and useful there and so one can surely ask why it is unnecessary and undesirable elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly in support of my noble friends amendment <e> <s> surely all commercial businesses have to rely upon the courts for the collection and enforcement of all outstanding debts <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why the water and sewerage businesses should be an exception to this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs has described the highly complex nature of the vast number of inquiries with which the citizens advice bureaux deal year by year <e> <s> there is a tendency to believe that problems such as these exist only in the inner cities and that that is generally where one will find housing and overcrowding as well as unemployment and possibly low wages <e> <s> however all these problems are experienced also in rural areas where they are compounded by problems of isolation and possibly the scarcity of essential services <e> <s> it is primarily about the rural problems that i wish to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to my noble friend lord stanley for initiating this debate because it is opportune <e> <s> the number of agricultural holdings has been declining steadily for many years <e> <s> i venture to suggest that the main reason for that is purely economic although there are many contributing factors <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> the citizens advice bureaux have reported a number of cases where there is a relationship between the presence of social care and housing problems <e> <s> people with social care needs are often homeless or in entirely inappropriate housing conditions <e> <s> not only do those conditions exacerbate the problems but they make it impossible to deliver the necessary social care services <e> <s> that cannot be done until the housing problem has been resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the last member of the select committee to take part in the debate this evening <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will be glad to know that i shall throw the copy of my speech away <e>"]
