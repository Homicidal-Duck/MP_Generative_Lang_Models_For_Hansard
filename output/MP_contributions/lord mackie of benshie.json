["<cs> my lords i notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for upsetting the orderly procedure of this house but my concern was for your lordships safety <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord the leader of the house whether it is in order or whether it is to be a precedent for the government to carry swords while addressing this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree

hills does not in any shape or form conic into the category of the production of over-produced food such as milk and other commodities <e> <s> the production of lamb is in great need <e> <s> we need more lamb it is an expensive and much sought after commodity <e> <s> beef is really not in surplus in the world in any shape or form <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the statement <e>

tremendous problems coming along with the applications to join of spain and portugal <e> <s> i would ask the government to remain firm on one matter that we in this country control the breeding grounds in our own areas <e> <s> i say that because only we have the equipment and experience and indeed as would appear from the actions of some of our partners the desire to control the breeding grounds <e> <s> in this i hope that the government will remain firm <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not enter into competition in deciding which of the noble lords lord peart or lord thorneycroft is further to the right <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that they are both fairly conservative with a small c perhaps the noble lord lord peart even more so <e> <s> i think this debate is very apt <e> <s> i think it is perfectly true to say that the government are not only doing a balancing act on rhodesia but that they are in an extremely difficult position and they are tackling the problems in a fresh way <e> <s> it is also true to say that the labour government in the period after <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very careful to mention indexation <e> <s> to make million is good for the nation but

did i understand the noble earl to say that if because of skipping bail the accused failed to turn up and there was no trial one should be able to impose a larger sentence because he would not be tried <e> <s> is that logical <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl the minister not agree that the previous question was <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the statement which the minister has repeated <e> <s> it is one which will be extremely welcome throughout the agricultural industry and something which is very necessary indeed <e> <s> for example i take it as only an example in scotland last year real incomes in the farming community fell by per cent <e> <s> even more significant and more worrying in the long term is the fact that bank overdrafts of the farming community in scotland have nearly doubled in the last year <e> <s> at a figure of per cent <e> <s> or over this is a burden which it is extraordinarily difficult for any industry to bear particularly one working on the narrow margins and i say that without fear of contradiction that the farming industry is working on at the present time <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> will certainly be most welcome <e> <s> but i would ask the minister what gap remains before we have parity in the community <e> <s> this is quite an important point <e> <s> i would also ask if they intend to do anything to introduce some form of parity as regards the terms for borrowing money <e> <s> some recent programmes have shown some extraordinarily wonderful schemes for the farming community on the continent where farmers have been able to borrow money for as little as to per cent <e> <s> this is a gap which is highly significant in times like these <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister answer the question about the gap as regards the green pound <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it would be a reasonable assumption that the forecast of the white paper is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the increases and to endorse what the noble earl has said about the importance of the hill areas <e> <s> they are the source from which the final production of beef mutton and lamb reaches the consumer in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we welcome the amendment to the order and that every little will help the export trade <e> <s> can the minister quantify the amount that an exporter of a pedigree angus bull might receive as the refund in addition to the price as a pedigree bull <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise for intervening in the debate without having put down my name on the list of speakers but i have been very interested in this very important discussion and i should like to ask the minister to consider two points <e> <s> first can he tell us whether any research is taking place at present or rather whether research is being actively pursued into a test which would reveal the pest at an earlier date <e> <s> it appears to me that early diagnosis of the disease or of the presence of a mite must be extremely important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put one point to the minister <e> <s> how do the ministry the experts regard this disease <e> <s> do they regard it as the most serious threat to beekeeping and honey production in this country that we have seen for some time <e> <s> is it more serious than the standard diseases which already affect the hives <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try not to detain your lordships for too long but i should like to start as everyone does but in this case i really mean it by saying how grateful i am to the noble lord lord kaldor for introducing this debate <e> <s> the reason i am grateful is because i greatly enjoy his speeches <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree with them or understand them but i enjoy them for their mischievous quality <e> <s> the last time i heard the noble lord initiating a debate he started with an ingenious comparison of the conservative programme with the communist manifesto which he carried to extraordinary lengths and in a most enjoyable manner <e> <s> whether it was right or not i do not know <e> <s> on this occasion he proceeded to go backwards and to praise with his tongue firmly in both cheeks the enormous achievement of conservative governments of past times <e> <s> even to an ignoramus in these matters like me it appears that at that time the trouble was lack of spending but this time i rather agree with the government that our troubles come from spending which is to put it mildly perhaps a little overdone <e> <s> however after this school-masterly discourse i did not know how i would take to the noble lord lord cockfield but immediately i was reminded of my youth and the terrifying certainty <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give us an assurance that he appreciates the point of the question namely that the health of the cane sugar refining industry in this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that we accepted the terms on joining the community <e> <s> we accepted the fact that instead of paying probably million in deficiency payments we would pay it into the common market directly in levies and that for this we receive the benefits of the community in both political and economic terms and that our exports to europe have doubled in this time <e> <s> if you take the amount that we would have paid in deficiency payments and the amount that the public will collect in benefit it is not a bad buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will be very grateful to the noble lord lord clifford of chudleigh for enabling us to debate this matter which is vital to our national survival <e> <s> i must warn your lordships that i am going to bring down the average speaking time considerably and that i am not going to speak for very long <e> <s> i want to make only one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord clifford thought that might deal with the air defence of this country <e> <s> i must say that my experience of years ago in wellingtons and lancasters hardly qualifies me for speaking on this matter at the present day especially when down on the enormous list of speakers we have field marshals and generals with recent staff experience <e> <s> but i should like to say perhaps in slight disagreement with the noble lord that in our party and from these benches we have always placed our trust in nato in combination with our allies in the best and most economical use of our resources together with our alliesand that we are pleased not delighted perhaps but certainly pleased that members of nato have agreed to up their spending by a real per cent <e> <s> i think that is an important step and it is one which we may well need to take furtherbut there is no question or shadow of doubt in our minds at all but that the core of our defence must lie in our association with nato <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to congratulate the noble lord lord sandford and his committee on the very production of the report <e> <s> anyone and many of your lordships have who has sat on an eec scrutiny committee

all is a miracle and for producing a good one the noble lord and his committee deserve our congratulations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the only free gift a farmer ever gets from the government is that occasionally he gets the vat back before he pays the supplier of the fertiliser <e> <s> will the noble lord see that this excellent practice is not put a stop to <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be very grateful to the noble marquess for asking this unstarred question <e> <s> he covered the ground extraordinarily well in exactly minutes <e> <s> i particularly liked the shape of the noble marquesss unstarred question <e> <s> he asked her majestys government what is their policy in regard to the closing of small village schools <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness finally sits down would she tell us whether the school at which they took the pictures and where everyone signed the petition is still open <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor agree that the real reason for the lack of gazumping in scotland is the general integrity virtue honesty and superiority of the scots <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not take so long <e> <s> i hope other noble lords will not either <e> <s> i will be down having said what i have to say within nine minutes otherwise your lordships may shoot me <e> <s> everybody has praised the noble lord lord byers my leader on these benches for his speech but i wish to complain bitterly about that part of it in which with immense and succinct brainpower he summed up the situation of small businesses put in a word of praise and some excellent criticism and then said having said all that there was to saybut of course my noble friend lord mackie will fill this out <e> <s> that is the privilege of leaders from which we all suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is a matter of government policy and principle to secure the consent of all interested parties before they legislate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by apologising <e> <s> i had no idea that so many noble lords would speak on this important report but i am glad to see that they are to do so <e> <s> it is possible that because i have to leave at pm to catch the pm train to scotland in order to see to the practical matters pertaining to the planting of potatoes and the selling of cattle i shall not be present at the end of the debate for which i apologise <e> <s> i hereby declare a great personal interest in this report and in the proposals of the commission <e> <s> i was very glad to hear our chairman assure the house of the sweetness and light which existed in his committee <e> <s> personally i have found several members extremely offensive about farmers they seem to think that every farmer should be totally devoid of any excess fat that he should spend his time working extraordinarily hard chewing the straw and getting to bed early in order to produce more food cheaply for the industrialists and the great merchants of this country and i mention no names whatever <e> <s> we came to a certain unanimity and aided <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i know the answer <e> <s> they are not produced in this country they are produced in the rest of the community <e> <s> in this country we produce just about half and we import some sugar from the community or tons and we take per cent <e> <s> of the lom quota in this country because it is traditional and we have the refineries at the ports to refine it <e> <s> nevertheless we have to think in community terms <e> <s> the noble lord will forgive me if i say that he is perhaps being a little parochial in these matters <e> <s> we have to think in community terms <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that if our government looked after our hill farmers as well as the french government look after theirs she would be a very rich lady <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble minister is not pretending that there is no connection between the competition for money for balance of payments reasons and high interest rates <e> <s> surely many countries are forced to put up their interest rates because other countries have done so in order to compete for the money moving about the world <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what will be the cost of the dog licence taking into account inflation which his important friends are fighting so hard to beat <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister to clarify a point on agricultural prices <e> <s> as i understand the statement the other members of the community wanted the prices to be up by between and per cent <e> <s> and this appeared to be unacceptable to the government although in fact with inflation this leads to a lowering in return to farmers in the community and particularly in this country <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether this was the sticking point or would the government have accepted a rise of or per cent if they could have got a reasonable reduction in our budgetary contribution <e> <s> finally may i support my noble friend lord gladwyn and say that it is perfectly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the order which goes some way towards allowing the industry to solve its problems <e> <s> certainly they needed the extra powers and i congratulate the government on acting so swiftly on the selborne report <e> <s> i do not want to appear ungracious but really the industry is facing a great many problems and i think the government must not rely solely on this order and the setting up of the authority for apples and pears they have got to do a great deal more i think to alleviate the unfair competition from the golden delicious apple from france <e> <s> there are a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect what i said was that the government would have to see or try to see that we competed on fair terms <e> <s> i was not asking for a restriction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock has really said practically all there is to say about this subject <e> <s> he is certainly voicing the feelings of the people of scotland <e> <s> i would lean rather more heavily on the government because i can understand very well the bbcs problem <e> <s> they do not get a special

fees charged in various countries <e> <s> as at present on colour television for example the united kingdom licence fee is switzerland sweden denmark belgium austria <e> <s> these figures are repeated in other licence figures <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that farmers have enough difficulty at the moment without a further set of regulations <e> <s> they have to live work and earn their living in the countryside which is more than many of the people concerned with the present proposals have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank my noble friend lord foot for proposing the motion and for doing so in such a way as to give it its full worth <e> <s> i believe it to be true to say that the opening speech did much to vindicate this house and the quality of it is part of the argument which we use when we try to defend this noble house <e> <s> i am sure that the speech in reply will be equally good and of such a high level as to make all of us in your lordships house think <e> <s> i am also grateful to my noble friend who is surely the best of all the feet for proposing the motion in such a way as not to take away the whole of my little piece which is to comment on proportional representation <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood and the noble lord lord monson for opposing pr because there is nothing worse than following a speaker who has already made ones case <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches welcome the bill which is a practical step to improve the finances of the white fish authority <e> <s> that body has a tremendous amount of work to do if its to he of any value in rescuing the fishing industry from the appallingly low state into which it has sunk <e> <s> i will not go into the reasons for that in view of the fact that in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord peart if he would agree that it is very important not only that regulations are laid down about quotas to preserve the mackerel catch which is what i think he was referring to but that they should be enforced <e> <s> half the fishermens complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that agri <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what the governments policy will be on u-turns <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this we have promised to increase our defence spending along with the other nations of the west by a real per cent <e> <s> is part of this per cent <e> <s> committed to trident <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the <e>", "<cs> the noble lord did not mention any dates of that kind <e> <s> he was simply saying that the cessation of building during the first world war led to most of the trouble <e>", "<cs> do i understand the noble lord lord ross to be right and that a person can serve his three years in the houses of any authority in the british isles <e>", "<cs> this is an enormously important question in scotland today particularly as we need some mobility of labour <e> <s> nobody wants to buy a house in fort william at the present time because we have just had a failed industry there <e> <s> on the other hand people want to buy houses in say shetland and areas around aberdeen where prices are high and there are jobs <e> <s> it is therefore important that housing authorities should be in a position to do something useful with the money they receive <e> <s> the cost of new housing is high and i doubt for example whether authorities in the region of aberdeen would be justified in giving the large discounts that are being proposed <e> <s> i can see the argument for giving a discount on the sale of a house but the figures proposed in the bill are in my view far too large <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble earl for a moment <e> <s> how will that point apply in the case of aberdeen which we keep mentioning <e> <s> surely people presently occupying houses there will be buying them and certainly they do not want to move out of aberdeen <e> <s> it seems to me that in aberdeen it is necessary to provide more houses because the population is growing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene as reference was made to me <e> <s> if i may make a point it is very difficult to get a specific industry to move to areas like fort william <e> <s> my noble friend lord thurso and i have specific knowledge of trying to set up industry in an area remote from other industry remote from the services and remote from the customers <e> <s> it is enormously difficult to do and although we have tried hard and we have been successful in a number of areas there is really much more need for people to move to the areas where there is a great need for employment than there is a willingness among employers to move to areas like fort william <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me to intervene i have heard that there are certain elements of local housing where the cost of maintenance exceeds the return from the houses <e> <s> i know for example of an instance in liverpool where it costs to mend a washer on a tap <e> <s> surely he is carrying his argument a little too far in that owners of houses maintain them rather more competently and cheaply than do local authorities <e>", "<cs> having listened to the ministers explanation i would press a further point on him <e> <s> he and i both come from the agricultural east coast of scotland <e> <s> in angus one of the great features which has made the tied house system work has been the fact that the old angus county council built small houses particularly for retired farm workers and they laid down a system of points so that they could get those houses <e> <s> so there were farmworkers who were entirely happy with the tied house system which saved them a great deal of money during their lifetime <e> <s> the system also saved the country and the county council a lot of money <e> <s> farmworkers were happy because they knew that there were small houses available for retired people <e> <s> this is a very important point in regard to the agricultural industry <e>", "<cs> i will tell the noble earl <e> <s> it was he who told me the difference <e> <s> he said with regard to amendment no <e> <s> that the secretary of state had no statutory authority and therefore it lay entirely in the hands of local authorities <e>", "<cs> i too am very disappointed <e> <s> i shall not return to the centre of glasgow but i will return to this point of course i could have adduced arguments about rural scotland and indeed my noble friend lord thurso has just done so but the point that i was trying to make is that all over scotland rural and urban there are different sets of circumstances which cannot be covered by a blanket resolution which in fact is what the government are putting forward <e> <s> hundreds of bills which have become law in this country contain a clause which says that in case anything else goes wrong at all the secretary of state has power to put it right <e> <s> that is a well-known device and i think in this case it is such a complicated measure with so many different combinations of circumstances in rural and urban areas that we were merely asking the government not to accept our particular amendment which i am sure is appallingly drafted and is quite dreadful but at least to give us an assurance that they would look at it <e> <s> they are not going to do that apparently they are going to retain this curious socialist attitude that they must stick to the theory <e> <s> we shall not press the amendment but we reserve the right to bring up this matter at a later date <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should merely like to say that the noble lord lord ross of marnock appears to have a point in the first part of the amendment <e> <s> i trust that the minister will be able to explain <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what is to be done with the old charing cross hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords what are they going to do with it <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee will be very impressed by the amount of time that the government ministers and their advisers have spent with wet towels round their heads considering practically every point that has been raised in opposition to the bill <e> <s> however because the government have spent a great deal of time does not mean that they have necessarily arrived at the right answer <e> <s> we are entitled to query it and to raise it again and indeed to do our own wet towel-thinking about these matters <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the explanation <e> <s> the reason that i might have mentioned that i did not think this was sufficient is that it stipulates that the order may be made provided that within the said rural area more than one-third of the number of dwelling-houses have been sold <e>", "<cs> in this case i am against the noble lord lord ross in that i do understand that even sheriffs great men though they are like to know the opinion of parliament and what parliament intended and i <e>", "<cs> could we have a more positive statement <e>", "<cs> in view of the ministers example of the widow may i ask whether his embraces hers where it says any predecessor of his as tenant <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether a local authority could apply any profit to reducing rates <e> <s> i am not sure that a great many people in the centre of scotland and in glasgow particularly would not prefer to pay a little more for their houses and have jobs and it is a fact that the higher rates in certain areas of scotland have kept industry out of that area <e> <s> so if profit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble earls instruction <e> <s> the raspberries are not quite ripe at the moment in our part of the world so at the present time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that if the three-year period applied to the house in which he was living it might be more reasonable but i think that we detected a certain amount of sympathy during the committee stage for saying that three years for the whole of the period wherever it may be spent or under whatever circumstances was far too short <e> <s> i think that five years is a very sensible compromise and a reasonable period which i would like to support <e>", "<cs> in this case my lords for reasons of practicality i cannot support the amendment <e> <s> i say that for the simple reason that when you come to an open market valuation you have a chance of arriving at a logical outcome whereas when you come to valuing with a tenant the position is entirely different <e> <s> in the old days you made a -year purchase but today that would be quite ludicrous and with the movement in the value of money and the movement of interest rates the only practical way to value a house is to take the open market value <e> <s> in that event i believe a valuer has a good chance of arriving at a fair figure <e> <s> the question of the amounts of discount we shall discuss next but meanwhile i could not agree that it would be better to value on the basis of value including tenant and therefore i believe the discount system is more practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that here it is a question of tuning <e> <s> i have accepted the principle of discounts but really in scotland we are a fairly canny lot and to be offered a house after three years as a tenant not of that house at a per cent <e> <s> discount is a fairly appealing bargain and i would have thought that that was enough <e> <s> i accept the argument that if a tenant has been a tenant for a number of years in a house then he deserves to buy it at a further discount <e> <s> i think he has been a burden but that is mostly because of the incompetence of the local authorities in the maintenance of houses <e> <s> he has certainly in most cases paid plenty of rent <e> <s> so i accept that a long-time tenant has a right to a further discount <e>", "<cs> my lords to which amendment is the noble lord speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to plead with the noble earl to open his noble heart and for very practical reasons to accept this amendment <e> <s> the atomics as they are affectionately known have a very valuable population who have come to scotland to work at highly skilled jobs <e> <s> they are a great asset to thurso and it would be foolish of us thinking in terms of the skill of the scottish population not to make it as attractive as possible for them to stay in scotland if they leave dounreay or retire <e> <s> the point is that there is an extremely valuable population in scotland <e> <s> it would he very foolish not to accord them the same rights as people who work for the forestry commission and the other bodies in that long list <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be able to concede this point and make himself extremely popular <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree wholly with my noble friend in this case lord ross of marnock <e> <s> this is the most important amendment and i cannot understand why a conservative government should be so doctrinaire about the selling of houses built specially for old people <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it is a fact that the turnover there is inevitable as the houses are much sought after <e> <s> the arguments which the noble earl lord mansfield has adduced previously for selling houses cannot possibly apply in the case of retired people living in a specially built house <e> <s> if they had been going to buy a house they would have bought it long before if they had <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves the question of the drafting and he has obviously looked into the matter can he say whether a clause could be drafted which would make the matter watertight so that only the houses which we all know are intended for old people could be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and as he has been anxious to reassure both my friends and myself i believe that clause does not quite cover the case in that there also appears to be some doubt there when it says <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case also that if one allows an undesirable tenant to purchase a house one reduces the value of the houses round about because one certainly will not be able to sell them <e>", "<cs> my lords i would draw the ministers attention to an amendment which said <e>", "<cs> my lords before discussing the order i should like to associate myself and these benches with the good wishes to be sent to lord ferrers for a speedy resolution to his troubles <e> <s> when i came to look at this order first of all i said well it is all right <e> <s> it is the government trying to save money <e> <s> it appealed to my scottish heart <e> <s> i said of course people will beef a bit but why should not farmers take the responsibility <e> <s> they can read as <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say on what grounds the unions vetoed this proposal <e>", "<cs> why <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that the profit might be more usefully employed by manufacturing industry than by the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that answer is almost as unsatisfactory as his answer of last week <e> <s> would he not agree that this proposal combines both service to the public and the efficiency of operation of the post office and that therefore the government should have an attitude towards the kind of lack of co-operation which we see in this case in the post office union <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that the government have no attitude on this kind of thing because he cannot rely on monetary policy to solve problems in the nationalised industries which are damaging to the public and to their own efficiency <e> <s> surely the noble lord must agree that the government should at least state where they stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house is very grateful to the noble lord lord irving of dartford and i must congratulate him on his speech <e> <s> i have never heard the facts so well assembled and so well presented and it occurred to me that the minister would do well to give in right away <e> <s> that was followed by excellent speeches all round and i am afraid that i shall now lower the tone of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords surely in the case of a monopoly such as the gas board we can control demand at will <e> <s> the noble lord has just said that there is a waiting list but we can fulfil the waiting list or leave them waiting <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell the house whether it is true that in conditions approaching parity most staff studies say that the use of chemical warfare is unprofitable <e>", "<cs> no my lords chemical <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the noble lord lord ross of marnock in this very important amendment <e> <s> i am sorry if i repeat some of the remarks he made but the assurance given to my right honourable friend david steel in the house of commons was categorical when the leader of the house said <e>", "<cs> the leader of the house another cabinet minister said on the housing bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to be fair to the minister <e> <s> i understood him to say that smallness is not included in the category of exceptions and that he does not accept either the english category which says that it is the practice of the landlord to let it only for occupation by such persons <e> <s> i want to be fair <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could add to the argument <e> <s> i think that this is very relevant to the intentions of the government as expressed in another place and to the understanding put upon them by many members of this house who are extremely concerned <e> <s> in fact the relevant section in the english act with which it was intended to bring the scottish bill into line mentions disabled people as well <e> <s> this is a matter which concerns many people in the house <e> <s> it appears to me that if there is a precedent

my lords i know that the minister the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to remind the noble earl when he talks about genuine elderly persons that he accepted an amendment from the noble lord lord ross of marnock saying that that meant persons of pensionable age <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the new clause moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> it is a growing industry and a valuable one with considerable export potential and it should be treated in the same way as many other aspects of <e>", "<cs> my lords does not this evident justice highlight the need for some kind of incomes policy which has been thought out <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that the cost of million for the extra tax on fuel oil is as nothing compared to the extra cost of interest rates borne by industry in this country as compared with our competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ross of marnock has covered the ground in his usual able manner <e> <s> i have a few questions to ask along the same lines but first i wish to reinforce them more from the strict practical viewpoint of the sheepkeepers and farmers who are not exactly wild with joy now having looked forward to this rgimes implementation with a great deal of hope <e> <s> they are now rather doubtful about the whole thing and as lord ross said they are worried lest the open-ended premium will come under attack <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is aware of course that this question applies all over the country and applies in particular in scotland and to the textile areas of angus where the most go-ahead firms have suffered perhaps most severely in the case of polypropylene <e> <s> is the noble viscount able to expand his answer on the dealings with the united states <e> <s> because it is grossly unfair that the feed stock in the united states costs about half of what it costs here and our most progressive firms are suffering extremely severely from this fact <e> <s> in fact polymer polypropylene from the united states is selling at about a tonne whereas the most efficient firms here are producing at only <e> <s> can the noble viscount tell us something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to many good speeches and to many economists <e> <s> i must say that the two speeches i enjoyed most were the two maiden speeches which i thought were quite excellent and which showed the catholic nature of your lordships house in that only here could one hear maiden speeches from the high priests of both god and mammon in one day <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister in his first reply blamed the decline on the high interest rates and industry is blaming its decline on the high rates <e> <s> can the minister tell us what good the high interest rates are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords if my arithmetic is correct the saving of million is a saving of less than per cent <e> <s> on the total cost of quangos <e> <s> if that is so would the noble lord agree that surely too much fuss is being made about the savings and perhaps many of the quangos are suffering from being called quangos and are in fact very useful bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for making the statement and express the hope that the calculations have been more accurate than some of the calculations that this government have made over the money supply and one or two other things <e> <s> we accept that if we are going to get real wealth back into the economy government spending has to be cut and the government are trying to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad the noble lord lord polwarth did speak because he made a most courageous statement <e> <s> i think the house should be very grateful to a minister for coming back and giving the facts as to what has happened and recanting on a decision something that politicians hardly ever do <e> <s> i should very much like to express my gratitude to the noble earl lord cromartie for bringing this matter forward <e> <s> this is the sort of practical and intelligent thing he is constantly doing <e> <s> i know that he is extremely intelligent because we agree on several points <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord people are talking about five years experience <e> <s> surely it is true that reorganisation took place seven years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this is purely the result of eec policy and that the surpluses are needed in order to ensure our supply <e> <s> is it not a fact that this is part of the cap that it is a cheaper way of supporting farming and that in fact the sale to the russians is a sale to the customer offering the best price for the surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the bell telephone system in the unites states allows every tom dick and harry to interfere with their installations <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be agreed that the present electoral system has great advantages for the two major parties <e> <s> would the minister not agree that electoral reform might benefit the country a great deal more <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it appears to show a certain logic an increase in the money supply <e> <s> if inflation has come down per cent <e> <s> then the money supply has gone up far beyond the governments target <e>", "<cs> i must put in a personal plea to say that the amendment is slightly illogical <e> <s> i say to the noble lord lord houghton that although people may go about shooting each other with shotguns in sowerby in the parish of kirriemuir and the glens of angus they rarely do so and they treat their guns as they treat their sport with a great deal of respect <e> <s> the amendment gives an hour at night and in the morning but as anyone who has ever flighted duck knows it can be too dark half an hour after sunset <e> <s> certainly in the morning it is very often too dark to shoot properly but not to recognise birds <e> <s> one can nearly always recognise the birds <e>", "<cs> i did not say that the inhabitants of kirriemuir or anywhere else were breaking the law at night <e> <s> what i said was that it was equally bad <e> <s> you could wound more birds half an hour after sunset on certain nights than you could shooting in the full moon <e> <s> i never admitted in any form that the inhabitants of kirriemuir shot in the full moon <e> <s> i merely pointed out the obvious point that more harm and more cruelty could be caused by shooting in bad light under an hour or so after sunset or before sunrise <e>", "<cs> may i make a point on other methods of preventing damage to crops <e> <s> it is absolutely basic to the whole argument <e> <s> other methods only scare the pests whatever they are on to other peoples ground <e> <s> you really do not solve any problems by putting up bangers scare fences balloons and so on for agriculture as a whole <e> <s> you may have a plague of wood pigeons <e> <s> at the end of the day there is only one real cure and that is to reduce the numbers <e> <s> if you are successful in scaring them off by keeping your neighbours awake with bangers and so on all you do is divert them to some other crop <e>", "<cs> i would say first that the government took away the cartridge subsidy because they were too mean to continue it not because there was any real evidence that shooting did not reduce the numbers <e> <s> secondly the noble lord reveals remarkable ignorance of agriculture if he says that you can scare the geese off the winter wheat and on to grass because grass is quite as important a crop as winter wheat <e> <s> i can take him to areas where geese have eaten out the centre of the field and the crop for sileage around the edges where the geese did not go was twice what it was in the centre <e> <s> so that with enormous respect i do not think his examples are very good <e>", "<cs> i can give the noble lord an example that relates to geese <e> <s> if you shoot at geese openly with shotguns and show yourself you scare them off and you get one or two of them <e> <s> but if they are shot in a field with a rifle and left there without knowing what hit them it is a most effective method of getting the geese not to return to that field <e> <s> this method has been tried by many people <e> <s> you may say that the conventional method is to try to scare them off but what i have suggested is the most effective method i know of stopping geese coming back to a particular area <e>", "<cs> with respect what size are we talking about <e> <s> if there is the nest of a protected species in a acre field of silage or of corn then surely it is totally impractical for the farmer to take precautions as regards the whole of that field which is an economic operation <e>", "<cs> what we can all agree can go out from this committee is that any employer who allows his gamekeeper to take the blame for something he is conniving at is a fellow whom we would deplore and would condemn at all times <e> <s> if he enters into collusion with his gamekeeper it is very difficult to catch both of them at it <e> <s> there are some practical difficulties about it but in this committee all of us i think agree that anybody who does it deserves our contempt <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister taken up with the commission and with our friends in europe the necessity to speed up the procedure <e>", "<cs> i was explaining exactly what i meant and going into some detail because of the need to do so <e> <s> what action are the government taking to do something to speed up the procedure from which able and energetic people are suffering and have suffered for some time <e>", "<cs> while agreeing with everything that the noble lord lord melchett has said about the undesirability of poisoning practically any animal and particularly it is true that there is a misuse of strychnine for moles i should like to point out that in our part of scotland and in scotland as a whole the use of poison carefully placed in a mole run is now practically the only method of mole control that we have <e> <s> we cannot get people to trap them any more that has gone <e> <s> this is an important agricultural process <e> <s> i do not know whether better control of the issue of the poison can be devised but that it is essential for the control of moles there is no doubt whatsoever under present circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the statement just repeated by the minister is unbelievably apt to the debate that we are now having <e> <s> i am glad to see that the company do not maintain that it is labour relations or productivity that has caused them to close down the plant <e> <s> it is an important point and one that the minister should stress because a tremendous amount of work will now have to be done to replace this appalling loss of jobs and worse than the appalling loss of jobs the loss of an industry which had been lost to scotland for some years and which at the time was greeted as bringing scotland at least back into the automobile age <e> <s> i hope that the minister will be able to give us now some more specific news of what he is going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the noble lords permission perhaps i might say that mr benn may have been advocating those policies at that time but the whole point of the lib-lab pact was that he was not able to carry them out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather amazed at some of the speeches we have heard particularly the ones from the front benches and more particularly if i may say so the one from the front bench of the labour party <e> <s> it is quite extraordinary to me that the noble lord lord glenamara with all his experience can make a speech like that in view of the present torment the party is in and the total lack it has shown of any coherent policy whatever <e> <s> i must say the speech of the noble lord from the other side was not quite so euphoric perhaps the cares of government have made him much more realistic <e> <s> but both of them appear to me to neglect the whole point of david steels declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the conservative party is wholly at one that no fudging and compromising goes on in the production of the manifesto of the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say why it takes so long to get the figures for the students registering on st november <e> <s> it seems ludicrous that they are not available <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that the biggest help that the government could give to small businesses would be to reduce the bank rate so that they could borrow money at a decent figure <e> <s> may we expect this in the course of the spinning of government policy which now appears to be taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are government agencies which actually give loans at lower rates of interest to small businesses <e>", "<cs> this has been a fascinating debate my lords and the noble lords lord sherfield and lord dulverton deserve the gratitude of the house for initiating this discussion <e> <s> speaking personally i should have preferred to see the two debates split in two the extremely valuable report so ably introduced deserved a debate of its own not that justice has not been done to it <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that the government wanted to fog the issue a little and therefore welcomed mixing the report with which nobody could disagree and the second debate although it was introduced by the noble lord lord dulverton in able and unmistakable terms <e> <s> perhaps the government thought that in that respect they were not on such a good wicket and therefore welcomed having the two debates together <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that half the trouble arises from the fact that the rating system is now so unjust and so inequitable that we need a totally new system of collecting local taxes so that democracy can be shown to be working and that the people who pay for it have some control over what goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please tell us which question he is answering <e> <s> i understand that the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood was called <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that it is very important for this house to know whether there are sufficient supplies of blue blood available <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking both personally and on behalf of noble lords on these benches i can welcome the intent and the purpose of the bill <e> <s> clearly it follows the english bill quite closely and it ought to have taken into account experiences in england <e> <s> i would go farther than the minister of state and say that perhaps the protection was needed long ago even before the climate of opinion among women changed regarding acceptance of violence <e> <s> in days gone by the only protection that a woman indeed a girl had against violence in the home was where she had parents who were sufficiently wealthy to have enough room to take her back into their home without her having to endure worse conditions than she endured with a violent husband <e> <s> i think it right and proper indeed essential that scots law should come into line on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to make it clear that i accepted completely the necessary change in the laws of property and that my legal friend who is a scot was pointing out that it makes a great change and this he was doing for my benefit and that we are accepting completely that it is right and proper that the laws of property change to the extent where there is violence in the home <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will be extremely grateful to the noble lord lord orr-ewing for introducing this debate and will furthermore be extremely grateful for the knowledge and work that he has put into his subject and the <e>", "<cs> i think the government will have to do something about this clause <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross said violence is at the core of the matter and if the clause is left as it is then it is possible that a husband and certainly in the history of matrimonial strife and violence it has been known that a husband can coerce his wife into doing practically anything under threat of violence could threaten his wife <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear what the minister has to say about this but i am certain that he must do something <e> <s> i do not think the clause can stay as it is <e> <s> we appear to be discussing amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> that perhaps would take much of the fear out of the situation and would give a wife time to think <e> <s> i shall be most interested to hear what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> will it follow that if the non-applicant spouse cannot be found the proceedings will go ahead in any case <e>", "<cs> i must say that for the first time i disagree <e> <s> i must declare an interest because i am a farmer and in this case i can see incredible difficulties arising <e> <s> it would place many farmers in an intolerable position if the house of a stockman was taken up by his wife <e> <s> there must be other solutions <e> <s> what i said applies also in the case of agricultural holdings <e> <s> if a farmer in a let farm was excluded from the house it would make the running of the farm extremely difficult <e> <s> i think that other solutions need to be found in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has asked a question which many people including a large number of lifelong tories have been asking <e> <s> i think it extraordinary that the government do not appear to understand what goes on in the country and i shall briefly underline what the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> the countryside today this applies particularly the further north one goes and especially to the countryside from where i come is wholly dependent on the motor car <e> <s> every man on my farm has a car <e> <s> although it costs a lot to run their cars they must do so because there is very little public transport making the car essential <e> <s> indeed the whole life of the countryside revolves around the motor car <e> <s> they cannot go to the village shop any more and buy goods at a reasonable price they must go to the supermarkets which are situated some distance away before they can get food and other goods at the same price as their industrial counterparts <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord gisborough for introducing this debate at this time because i think it is useful for the minister to have the support of this house in the battles ahead <e> <s> i hate to disagree with the noble lord lord peart but i think it is a very good time to have the debate because of that very fact and i trust it will influence the minister and support him in the very tough battle that he will have <e> <s> i am particularly glad to speak in this debate just before the maiden speech of my noble neighbour lord elphinstone who farms down the howe of strathmore from me <e> <s> it is excellent country and rather well farmed much better than my land is similarly i am sure that his speech will be very much better than mine and i look forward with enormous pleasure to hearing it <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am happy to tell the noble earl that i am not a dairy farmer <e> <s> i gave that up years ago because i was tired of pulling cows for years and i was determined to die a decent fellow fattening beef <e> <s> therefore i believe that we must back the minister very hard in his fight <e>", "<cs> my lords as this method would save the local authorities a great deal of money would not the minister encourage local authorities to offer a little discount to people who pay in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister really saying that the success of this issue depends on having a conservative government until <e> <s> is that what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the amount of help offered was million and that compares with something in the region of million being offered to help poland which is right and proper <e> <s> in view of the fact that chinas relations with the west are constantly improving would it not be right and proper for the government to push forward the suggested conference of donors under the auspices of the united nations in order to help china in her great difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to oppose the amendment moved by the noble lord and i certainly do not do it out of any feeling that the tied cottage is wholly sacrosanct though the fact that the farmworkers approved the retention of the tied house in scotland and did not want a change in the law seems to show that it is a system that suits them <e> <s> but really the noble lord lord ross cannot say that we can burden a dairy farmer for example with yet another risk in the case of a tied house for a stockman <e> <s> it is absolutely essential not only in dairy farming but in the case of a shepherd and very often in the case of a tractorman when no one else is available that he should keep possession of that house and it is not at the discretion of the court because already it takes the farmer some time to get possession and a great many farmers have suffered a great deal of inconvenience <e> <s> i do not think that in this case it would be logical to say that the hard-done-by wife if it was the wife would be entitled to stay in the house and he would have to leave it <e> <s> there are after all on many farms in scotland and in the country areas certainly tied houses which are empty because of the present law <e> <s> i do not think it would be difficult to find alternative accommodation <e>", "<cs> but not if the husband had to go and milk cows on that farm <e> <s> that makes it extremely difficult <e> <s> the caring for stock is a very important factor in farming it is a very important factor in humanitarian terms as can be seen from the concern expressed in this house for the treatment of stock <e> <s> i must say that i cannot support the noble lord lord ross in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the minister for his speech and for the valuable information and comments he has given us <e> <s> at this point i would like to apologise to him and to the house for the fact that i shall have to leave to catch the pm shuttle to edinburgh immediately after speaking <e> <s> i intend no discourtesy <e> <s> the time taken to consider the scottish matrimonial homes bill rather upset my calculations <e> <s> i want to speak on this motion because like the noble lord lord mottistone i was a member of the sub-committee <e> <s> i echo his remarks his gratitude to those who gave evidence to us and to our clerk and specialist advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords is what is meant by non-price factors quality and delivery <e>", "<cs> i support the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> this appears to be a sensible and harmless amendment <e> <s> i do not think the objections of the noble lord lord gisborough are valid <e> <s> it says in the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i also seek clarification on a point that was made by the minister <e> <s> i believe he said that in consideration of the sale of any forest which had a large number of amenities and was much used by the public then the commissioners and the minister certainly would not sell it but they might instead arrange a sale and lease-back <e> <s> did the minister actually say that there was an instruction to that effect because i do not see it in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure the minister does not mean that the government can settle their policies as they go along <e> <s> the government are guided by acts of parliament which go through the house <e> <s> while i do not agree with the amendment there are later amendments indicating that parliament lays down how the government will implement their policy <e> <s> it must be right for us to consider the limits that should be on the government in their actions <e> <s> that is the whole purpose of any act of parliament is it not <e>", "<cs> while i sympathise with the points made on both these amendments it appears to me that it might have a bad practical effect on the forestry commission in that if they bought a whole estate and parts of it were not suitable for forestry then they would not be able to realise realisable assets <e> <s> i wonder whether that is not a snag to this <e>", "<cs> the point i was making was that it appears to me that if this is inserted in the bill then they would not be able to dispose of such land <e>", "<cs> we from these benches should very much like to support the amendment <e> <s> what the noble lord lord dulverton said just now is very true that the government should be extraordinarily worried about the reaction of the private sector to the bill <e> <s> the open-ended nay sweeping powers that we have already discussed at some length are the really worrying factor <e> <s> another point which has not been mentioned today but which is of desperate importance is that of the confidence of the commission itself <e> <s> if the minister and the treasury in particular have these sweeping powers then no commission can feel that it really being trusted to carry out this very important part of government policy <e> <s> at any time in bad financial circumstances its work might be swept away and the fruits of that work might be enjoyed by some other person not by the nation for whom all the work has been done <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but that argument does not hold water <e> <s> inflation takes care of the lower interest rate and the inflation-rate effect on money is what trees overcome <e>", "<cs> i understood his commitment to my noble friend on the forest of dean was a definite one that he would go away and try to meet the wishes of the house <e> <s> i got the feeling that his commitment here was rather more qualified <e> <s> is that the case or not <e>", "<cs> i must say that members of the party near me are making fairly heavy weather of this question <e> <s> i do not know who they imagine will go rushing into the parts of scotland that i know to purchase land as a speculation at the present time and throw it about the market <e> <s> so i think that they were juggling with a disneyland somewhere <e> <s> i should have thought that we must make quite certain that the forestry commission has the power to choose the land sensibly and then sell it at the best possible price <e> <s> the commission should also have the power to avoid making a fool of itself <e> <s> if the commission sells land to someone who the following week resells it at a profit it will look extremely stupid <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me about something i did not say <e> <s> the section which unfortunately was missed dealt with the fears of the national trust in scotland and i presume it will come up again later <e> <s> the amendment the noble lord is talking about says <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer the minister has given is slightly sinister <e> <s> he has promised to look again at the situation which the amendment put down originally provided limiting the sales to the annual grant <e> <s> the situation might well arise if substantial and sensible sales are made that the commission might have a lot of money on its hands or a certain amount of money on its hands <e> <s> it would be fairly sensible i should have thought to leave the powers of investment so that they can get the interest that is going instead of putting it into the consolidated fund and then getting it back at a later date in the form of the annual grant <e> <s> therefore i am not altogether sure that the ministers reply was very satisfactory on this matter unless he assures me that this is not the intention <e>", "<cs> i presume that it has not been used for many years because the grant-in-aid has always been paid out in reasonable quantities as required <e> <s> it is only now that a policy of selling is going to start <e> <s> this is the very time when it might be most useful to the commission to have the interest instead of the consolidated fund <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the amity between the two front benches confirms all the suspicions of the sensible back-benchers in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not also a fact that the loss of markets in north america is the cause of a great deal of the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not want to go into any of the arguments but i should like to point out to the noble lord lord gisborough that the whole of the row and the reason for this amendment is interference by politicians in the affairs of the forestry commission <e> <s> never have i seen a bill which is so unpopular among knowledgeable supporters of the government <e> <s> it is extraordinary the amount of suspicion that has arisen <e> <s> the reason for this amendment is that people do not believe the government <e> <s> they think that they have put up the whole bill simply to flog off as much as they can and get some money in the kitty <e> <s> that is the truth of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because i think it means exactly what it says <e> <s> the suspicion in peoples minds is of course that the land will be sold irrationally and <e>", "<cs> my lords i briefly support this amendment <e> <s> i do so in a peculiar way <e> <s> nobody dislikes more than i do the hold-up to agricultural practice through the activities of many of the conservation bodies <e> <s> the conservation bodies have run away with themselves in many cases and many of their desires seem wholly impractical to the country people who have to make their living by the land and to the people who have to make their living from the trees <e> <s> nevertheless consultation by the minister is probably a good thing in that while the forestry commission may be wholly sympathetic and wholly in touch as the noble lord lord dulverton has said in this case as i keep reiterating this is really to quote the noble lord lord ross a treasury bill and they are looking for money <e> <s> therefore the minister should consult these bodies often as i do not sympathise with the state bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to back lord dulvertons own amendment on this <e> <s> i think he said you can drive a horse and cart through the next amendment and that is true <e> <s> he also said that ministers had laboured long before they produced it <e> <s> i think that the labour may have had as much regard to making it inoccuous as it had to getting the approval of the forestry industry <e> <s> i must say that when you say <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> it is true that our information is that the embassy now have close contact with these men and that their treatment is better <e> <s> would the minister not agree in view of the fact that other mercenaries of other countries have been released by negotiation and that these men have now been in prison for five years and not four years that her majestys government might use their improved relations with many african states to exact further pressure to try to get these young men released who certainly have now been sufficiently punished <e> <s> one can only despise the people who recruited them but they themselves surely do not deserve further punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may put a further supplementary question is it not time to open these negotiations in view of the fact that earlier mercenaries have been released and in view of the fact of the excellent relations that the noble lord the leader of this house has with neighbouring states and that perhaps a little more pressure could be exerted than is being exerted at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not forget in the middle of the subsequent arguments about my question that these unfortunate men are unlikely ever to be recruited again and they have been in prison now for five years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a large number of people from this house purchase these tickets <e> <s> will he tell us whether we are liable to prosecution because we do so <e>", "<cs> my lords we too thank the minister for repeating that statement <e> <s> we welcome the fact that the noble lord lord stodart is here and we wish to thank him and his committee for the work they did <e> <s> i shall not delay your lordships because a number of noble lords are waiting to address the house in the debate which is in progress <e> <s> i would only point out that we are really suffering from a cart-before-the-horse error committed by various governments of both sides in that they did not examine properly the question of devolution in scotland before they had the committees examining local government <e> <s> had we done that properly we might not now be in the mess we are in <e> <s> it is i suppose satisfactory that the government are only following the recommendations of the stodart committee and are backing away from any further reorganisation i imagine because they know that such a mess was made in the past that even though it might be sensible in the future to do something it might be better to let well alone <e>", "<cs> my lords my pleasant duty is first to congratulate the two maiden speakers <e> <s> the noble baroness delivered a splendid speech <e> <s> she did what is absolutely necessary in this house she spoke from her own experience and she spoke extremely well <e> <s> probably the highest compliment i could pay her is to say that she speaks as well as she looks and that will be a great advantage to her in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down the whole house has listened with enormous admiration to his speech and which he has done so much better than the opener <e> <s> will he now say whether he thinks we should withdraw from the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to say as a member of the committee that i have greatly enjoyed the work on it particularly in sitting under the chairmanship of the admirable and noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos <e> <s> i think he has given your lordships a very fair summing up of the views of the committee and i think he has put to the house a very necessary matter that is the basic objectives of the cap <e> <s> of course the basic objectives are that producers should get a fair living that consumers should get food at a reasonable price and that the food supply for the community should be assured <e> <s> i think that these are very fair objectives and the community has chosen to implement them really by a protective system of the control of imports and of help to the producers to produce food at a reasonable price <e>", "<cs> my lords as a matter of fact on our visit to brussels we were told not that the list was available but that the list was confidential <e> <s> surely the noble earl would agree that information in peace as in war is very vital <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble kinsman not because he is a kinsman but because he has brought a fresh proposal and a fresh look to the efforts which have been made in all parts of this house to make the government think again on this bill <e> <s> he was quite right when he said that the opposition was practically universal and as the noble lord lord ross of marnock said those of us who have considered the bill from the beginning are full of despair about making the government see the impracticality of expecting the forestry commission to continue its splendid work and it is said by all to be splendid work if the ground is constantly to be cut from under them as they go about their work <e> <s> indeed the noble lord gave several examples of exactly the sort of thing that people from all parts of this house who know about forestry have been citing during the passage of the bill through parliament <e>", "<cs> while we should not forget the harmful effects that publicity can have on the child nor should we forget the good effects publicity can have on education committees particularly those which are absolutely sure of their own virtue <e> <s> therefore publicity need not always be harmful <e> <s> on the contrary the fact of airing something in court often does more good for the future of other children than the actual decision <e> <s> indeed education is now so highly charged with political content that it appears to me that the sheriff in this case is a suitable person to hear the appeals <e>", "<cs> i think there is a valid point about record <e> <s> is there any reason why we should not use the word assessment <e> <s> we might simply use assessment of needs perhaps explaining it in subsection as to what exactly it means <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not a case where private money put into this established project will not be available for new enterprises which we so badly need <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that the government who were widely based and widely supported in the country might have a very good chance of getting the cooperation needed to work an incomes policy <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister of state whether he means psychologists and that sort of expert adviser <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this very practical amendment <e> <s> i must say that the government themselves must have a slight feeling of conscience because they endeavour to excuse the position by saying that the authority members will not outnumber the other members by more than one <e> <s> if i may a say so it is rather like the lassie who tried to excuse her illegitimate child to her parents by saying after all it is only a little one <e> <s> i really cannot see why the outnumbering by more than one should not simply be left out altogether <e> <s> one is enough to bias the committee and to put the committee into disrepute and i hope the minister will be able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question in clarification <e> <s> did i understand the noble earl to say in reply that because the parents had a right to appeal it was only right that the authority should have a majority of one on the initial appeal <e> <s> in other words the parents had the right of appeal to the sheriff but the authority did not and therefore it seemed to him logical that the authority on the first appeal should have a majority of one <e> <s> if so it surely is hardly fair that he should try to prejudice the first appeal because the parents have a right to the second <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether any of the large number of complaints came from the customers who bought the lenses <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was somewhat puzzled by this <e> <s> is it on the grounds that scotland has natural beauty but no englishman can see amenity <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> i think it requires an explanation and i too look forward to hearing it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not often that i disagree with the noble lord lord cledwyn and indeed i do not disagree too much with the other members of the committee <e> <s> i think we are a very nicely balanced committee <e> <s> we have every form of prejudice and self-interest within our ranks and up to now we have produced a fair balance and our reports have been acceptable to and always studied with great interest by the government and certainly by the commission <e> <s> i can happily commend the report to your lordships <e> <s> it is beautifully printed it is closely argued well written and has a beautiful blue cover <e> <s> the only thing is that i feel that the conclusions are wholly and absolutely wrong <e> <s> i feel so not because i am a farmer and wholly prejudiced but for a number of reasons which i shall try to make clear to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i think that the freedom of trade talked about in the treaty of rome is a freedom of trade within the community <e> <s> the basic concept of the cap and we must not forget it even if we dislike it is that the community has protection from outside <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has extraordinary courtesy in giving way <e> <s> he has slightly taken my argument the wrong way <e> <s> the single culture idea is of course very dangerous but in this case much more dangerous than cocoa and copra which we do not grow in this country <e> <s> the point that i was making was that this is a substitute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to keep interrupting but i am being attacked <e> <s> if the noble lord takes that view it is slightly illogical then that we simply do not take the levy off imported barley and bring a little competition into it that way <e> <s> what i object to is the total inconsistency of levying highly on imported barley but a substitute you let in at nought or per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords what i meant to say was that maize gluten with the increased manufacture in certain countries of what i understand is called gasahol might become an element which would be a danger to the community policy in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to regret the passing of the flops marketing board <e> <s> along with the noble lord lord donaldson i mean bishopston though somewhat more briefly perhaps i should like to say what an excellent thing it has been <e> <s> one can call the hops marketing board all kinds of names <e> <s> one can call it a cartel a monopoly or many other things but the fact is that it worked extraordinarily well <e> <s> your lordships got your beer laced with the right sort of hop the producers got a decent living and the brewers funnily enough could well afford the price that they had to pay for hops <e> <s> it was a most excellent arrangement in theory <e> <s> speaking as a liberal and bearing in mind the views of adam smith and such things i dare say i should disapprove of it but i am fairly sure that mr friedman and the other gurus of the tory party would think that it was absolutely appalling <e> <s> but the thing is that it worked extraordinarily well the brewers got their hops the people got their beer and the farmers got decently but not over rewarded <e> <s> this is a state of affairs which i trust and hope the noble earl lord ferrers will see continues with the new body <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether any arrangements have been made for a bunker for the noble lord lord jenkins of putney <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to be able to agree on this occasion with every word that my chairman has said about this commission directive <e> <s> it is one of those directives that will produce a little common sense in this country and we should fight very hard for it <e> <s> we heard a lot of evidence from a great many distinguished and practical people but at the end of the day what it boiled down to was that inspection could not detect the only serious killer which is salmonella bacteria and that no matter how fast or how slow the inspection it could not detect it <e> <s> it really depended on the common sense of the housewife in cooking the chicken properly which would kill the infection <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister must be disturbed by the fact that the managers of the pension funds prefer or appear to prefer to invest their money in foreign industry as against british industry <e> <s> surely this must be one of the most disturbing factors <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to say what he thinks is short run <e> <s> we are talking about a high level an enormous level of interest over two years or more than two years <e> <s> what does he think is short run <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it extremely difficult to make a second reading speech on this bill and i shall not disguise the fact that it is the kind of bill that a person like me dislikes terribly <e> <s> there is no broad sweep of policy on which one can elaborate or indeed put a profound principle <e> <s> one cannot criticise the noble lord lord stodart of leaston on his report and one cannot like my noble friend lord evans of claughton go into the electoral system <e> <s> it is a beastly bill which is dealing with the needs of the ordinary person which arises from a practical working party and on which even the noble lord lord ross was bound to commend the government for producing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would very much like to welcome the setting up of the scottish seed potato development council <e> <s> it is probably overdue <e> <s> the history of the promotion of scottish seed potatoes is interesting <e> <s> as the minister said we produce the best seed potatoes <e> <s> the justification for this statement is that there has been an enormous amount of propaganda in the farming papers against scottish seed for as long as i can remember <e> <s> the northern irish came into the picture at the start of the war and afterwards with an organisation which had the distinct advantage of inspection at the ports <e> <s> they had a government organisation which was able to give an after-sales service <e> <s> we did not have this in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the noble lord lord ross has covered practically every point necessary and probably some unnecessary ones as well but it is always easy to follow him <e> <s> i would simply repeat what he has said i should like to know whether the new body the independent body the trust will have access to grants and will have facilities to keep developing the harbour <e> <s> a harbour must be an ongoing concern <e> <s> if it is not developing it is probably going back as have so many of our harbours <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that perhaps a fall in interest rates might have as much beneficial effect as the fall in the value of the pound has had <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to give us the equivalent figures for perhaps or the year prior to that <e>", "<cs> surely any person who is challenged by someone in plain clothes is entitled to ask that person to produce his authority to challenge <e>", "<cs> i tend to agree in this case with the minister that limitation should not be by the licensing authority <e> <s> there is at present in the rural districts of scotland a tremendous expansion of the use of taxis <e> <s> the need for licensing and the need for control of the vehicles and of the type of driver is i think very strong <e> <s> on the other hand it is quite extraordinary sometimes how long it takes to improve a vital service and how many mistakes and how much danger to the public there can be if it is a matter of complaint to public authority <e> <s> i have seen bad vehicles drivers who have terrified me and everyone else in the area <e> <s> i am not sure whether they were licensed or not but i think that there is little doubt that the quickest way that the public can cure this is by the business of selecting another operator if there is one available <e> <s> it takes too long for the licensing authority to correct the dangers and abuses which can certainly occur in taxi services in rural areas <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will permit me to interrupt him <e> <s> he has read out a list of very distinguished gentlemen serving on the committee but every single one was a bureaucrat of some sort who thinks he knows best <e> <s> there are not many members of the public represented on the committee <e>", "<cs> i want the noble lord to realise that there are other methods of control <e> <s> it may be far better for the taxi drivers to give up if there are too many of them than simply to rely on the local authority providing them with a living <e> <s> the local authority might in fact license far more taxis than are necessary <e> <s> i am saying that even these distinguished gentlemen whose minds work exactly like that of the noble lord lord ross might not be as good as the general public in determining how many taxis there should be <e>", "<cs> in view of that assurance and of the attitude of the government i beg to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i will not move amendment <e> <s> no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble baroness lady elliot we must welcome this bill and i must repeat the words of commendation of the noble lord lord ross and also his great praise for the work that has been done by the scottish special housing association over very many years <e> <s> i have in the past criticised the quality and beauty of some of their schemes but taken on the whole there is no question that the scottish people generally are greatly benefited by the scottish special housing association <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord please answer the question i asked about how economies are going to be effected which will keep down the subsidies to the present level <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the points which needs to be brought out in the debate on second reading is how this money is going to be saved <e> <s> if subsidies are not going to rise money will have to be saved somewhere <e> <s> if however the noble lord does not know the answer of course he may write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for not putting down my name on the list of speakers but i was doubtful whether i could get away from a committee meeting <e> <s> unfortunately i got away but i shall not detain your lordships for long <e> <s> i want to support the noble earl in this matter which i think is of great importance because it involves such an obvious injustice <e> <s> i was in bomber command and i suppose that this situation applies to the members of bomber command who were taken prisoner <e> <s> i must say that i agree with my noble friend who spoke earlier about the difficulty of trying to cover every point without first hearing the ministers views <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount clarify a point <e> <s> i think he said that in the case of the raf the sum of was kept in suspense and that after payments were made there was something like left <e> <s> what payments were made <e> <s> were these payments back to individual officers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say from what level that increase started <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to say what is being done about the marketing of the fish <e> <s> i understand from fishermen that the costs are too high and the prices too low <e> <s> the minister of agriculture is always talking about marketing and farming <e> <s> may we be told how much of this money is being devoted to marketing fish <e>", "<cs> i did not speak on this clause <e> <s> i thought it perfectly reasonable to issue licences and i was staying off the following clauses <e> <s> would the noble earl the minister tell me is an itinerant metal dealer to have exactly the same licence as the pukka metal dealer <e> <s> i know metal dealers who have machines that cost in their yards and run very big businesses <e> <s> is the itinerant chap the tinker going round the farms under exactly the same conditions as these fellows who are in big business <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord stodart of leaston <e> <s> i cannot see any of the gentlemen who i know who buy metal from the farms being able to carry out this procedure and i certainly cannot see them being willing to carry it out <e> <s> i must say that as regards the keeping of receipts for two years it would be an interesting exercise to see what they would do if they ran short of paper for any purpose whatever <e>", "<cs> i want to be quite serious about this <e> <s> the type of person who goes round and does this performs a valuable function and he does lift metal which is much needed throughout the country <e> <s> but if we impose this type of book-keeping requirement on that sort of person he will not do it <e> <s> i think that it is very valuable that there should be a record of licensed scrap dealers <e> <s> but to ask them to keep records for two years seems to me to open them to prosecution and a fine of for something that such a person is constitutionally incapable of doing <e> <s> they have carried on this trade for a long time and they are useful members of society <e> <s> to open them to a fine of for something that they really could not do even if they tried is in my view quite wrong <e>", "<cs> i did not realise the can of worms that we would uncover but that is the purpose of debate one uncovers a whole lot of factors which have not been considered <e> <s> my noble friend and i were concerned with the safety aspect in a great many village schools in the country areas <e> <s> when the minister is considering these matters will he also take into account my noble friends thoughts on local organisations which may or may not be termed as having an educational background <e> <s> certainly young farmers could be termed as having an educational purpose not in all their activities but taken in the main <e> <s> with these remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before we move on may i simply say that i am very glad to have the assurance from the minister <e> <s> as he rightly stated it is a cause of concern to the salvation army that their premises are not always regarded as a church and of course the use of music by the salvation army is probably very much greater than in an ordinary church <e> <s> but as long as the noble earl recognises that the citadel is a very good church then i believe the salvation army will be satisfied that justice has been done <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> restraining the natural functions of dogs is already in the bill <e> <s> you have to restrain the natural functions on footpaths and the areas adjoining <e> <s> but in making that point i am happy to accept the noble lords assurance that he will look at it and i am sure that it will be much for the benefit of the younger citizens of scotland <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i would agree that is a much more reasonable age than seven <e>", "<cs> it could be a mother <e>", "<cs> in this case i must disagree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock because if no worse occurs to be drunk in charge of a firearm is not as bad as being drunk in charge of a child <e> <s> as there are penalties for being dangerous thereafter i rather agree with the minister in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there will be any restriction on foreigners buying the per cent <e> <s> of the shares <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that what he has said means that the agricultural community will have to wait for the settlement of the whole of the problem before they know what the prices will be for the produce in the next year <e> <s> may i ask whether the very sensible commission plan for a super-levy on surplus milk has now been dropped or whether there is any possibility of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by asking the house and the minister to forgive me for not waiting until the end of the debate <e> <s> i have a long-standing engagement of some importance to myself in default of which i would be letting people down so i must ask the forgiveness of the house for not staying until the end <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that in fact the development of the western isles as a whole is enormously important to both crofters and lobster fishermen and could he give us some information as to the progress of the eec scheme to develop that whole area <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> ab <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister what is the present position and is there a great deal of unreasonably withheld consent in the case of common ownership <e> <s> it appears to me that very often perfectly reasonable repairs can be held up because one owner wishes to be awkward and simply to be awkward which is a characteristic of some of our fellow countrymen <e> <s> also is there somewhere else in the bill provision for compensation for damage to property as people go through or work outside part of a building belonging to someone else <e> <s> there is a great deal in the amendment of the noble lord lord ross but i can see the other side where a man may be held up in doing good improvements for many months or years by the unreasonable attitude of one of the other co-owners <e>", "<cs> i trust the noble earl will do nothing of the sort <e> <s> this is exactly the sort of thing that my noble friend was talking about changing cowgate to some beastly name like riverside drive or riverside avenue <e> <s> the phrase think fit is a splendid and peremptory phrase and it should stay <e>", "<cs> i should like the minister to go further and say whether he means that the council can dispose of the waste as they see fit <e> <s> can they put it into a river that flows through their district and let the waste go down to the next district <e> <s> are they not subject to the laws of the land regarding pollution <e> <s> this is a curious phrase and not in the same context as the one i used before <e> <s> i cannot believe that there are not laws that govern the conduct of a district authority regarding the disposal of waste <e>", "<cs> i support the spit it behind the amendment wholly and completely <e> <s> nothing can be more infuriating than for ratepayers in a burgh town or district to see the propaganda of the opposing parties carried on local council vehicles <e> <s> i do not know whether it is covered by another regulation or whether the amendment is too wide but certainly the sentiments are wholly and completely correct <e>", "<cs> i believe we should leave in civic government and i hope that the minister will stand totally firm <e> <s> it has a fine roman sound about it whereas local administration sounds terrible if i may say so and even the mover is not satisfied with it the noble lord felt that something better could be found <e> <s> so please leave civic government because i believe it is a fine-sounding name <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is extremely grateful to the noble baroness for raising this subject <e> <s> she always raises relevant matters and always speaks about them with great commonsense <e> <s> i want to deny the rumour that the large attendance of scottish peers is due to fear <e> <s> it is entirely due to the respect and liking for both the noble baroness and her subject <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that in addition to meeting the general expenses administrative expenses and so on they should perhaps have a little profit as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for taking the line that he has <e> <s> i am sure that six months will be much more acceptable to some of the scrap metal dealers itinerant and otherwise whom i have come across <e> <s> however i should think that the enforcement of this will also have its difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord ross has moved an amendment which is extremely relevant to the present situation <e> <s> i do not know whether the amendment itself is the right one to deal with the situation <e> <s> but i do know that certainly there does need to be some form of local expression for the tremendous distaste which is felt by very many people in many districts for this particular form of activity <e> <s> i would very much like to hear the governments view of the noble lords amenmdent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the amendments which cover the points <e> <s> the first one i made last time was about the use of schools for concerts and country areas and other things which may need licensing <e> <s> i must say that head <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i should explain that what concerned me was that i have seen schools in rural areas being used for dances and so on where people were packed to the doors and that is the expression that i used so that nobody could go in or out <e> <s> it was most unsafe and i thought that some expression of concern was needed as to the suitability of some of the educational establishments being used for these purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his reply will give some pleasure to the universities but is he also aware that a feeling per-tains among the universities giving excellent technical scientific courses that the government prefer to save money and indeed the policy of the ugc reinforces this view by diverting students into polytechnics and will he give the house an assurance that the government fully appreciate the wider educational scope available to students who are successful in getting into universities to take technical and scientific degrees <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister advise the cigarette industry that they are wasting their money by advertising <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone moved the motion in a shorter time than he thought <e> <s> like many people outside agriculture he missed the fact he missed several facts but he missed this one in particular that the clock did not change so he actually moved it in about three minutes less than the time he thought he would take <e> <s> however one expects farmers to be sharper than other people at noticing such matters <e> <s> i wish at the outset to declare an interest which is a total strong and wholly subjective interest <e> <s> nothing i say will be fair <e> <s> it will be directed wholly towards the farming industry because i regard that as the most important industry in the world one which is in sad straits in many places <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not gaelic it is an entirely different accent <e> <s> every accent that your lordships have heard from scotland has been that of the lowland scot <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to interrupt him would he suggest that the people of poland are better off than the people of this country <e> <s> would he not think that the people of poland might prefer to have surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not negate his own argument by allowing half-service for war years pre-training entry <e> <s> surely if you do that the noble baronesss argument applies <e> <s> they did not waste but lost those very valuable years just as much as people who interrupted their university teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer but is the reason not a little unjust <e> <s> does he not agree that if british people have paid the money they deserve to get the same pension wherever they are living <e> <s> surely it is a little unjust for the government to collect this money which is what they are doing simply because these people live abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out that my question did not refer to rich tax exiles but in fact to a number of people living in india and doing good works there <e> <s> in no way are they depriving this country of any tax they are in fact living in need of the increases which they do not get <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that privatisation is more important than competence and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that self-criticism is quite a healthy sign <e> <s> might it not apply to the government in some cases <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that that answer illustrates the need for self-criticism instead of self-praise <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it is important and i should like to congratulate his right honourable friend on what he has achieved <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> rise in farm prices i can assure the house and i am declaring an interest is very much needed by the farming community all over the community <e> <s> this is evidenced as it has been many times by the enormous amount of money that the industry owes to the banks <e> <s> this continues to rise <e> <s> this is probably the best evidence that they are not as people usually say of farmers howling for the moon

satisfactory <e> <s> it is going over the points <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earl heard about the lady who was watching a troop of boy scouts going past and said its extraordinary <e> <s> theyre all out of step but my johnnie <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start with an apology to the house in that i foolishly mistimed the start of this debate and i may have to leave before the end in which case i shall read what the minister says with enormous attention in the morning <e> <s> however first i should like to say how grateful we should be to the noble lord lord rhodes for initiating this debate which he has done with his usual skill leaving the terms so wide that we can talk about anything <e> <s> i would like also to express my personal great gratitude to him for taking me to china three times <e> <s> i am not quite sure why he did so but i think it was because i was an object of great amusement when we went to places and little girls who were very neat and tidy would look at this figure and suddenly politely cover their mouths with their hands and giggle quietly calling on others to look at this curious british specimen who had been brought over there by the noble lord lord rhodes <e>", "<cs> my lords even without my kilt they considered me extremely impressive <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords however my gratitude to the noble lord lord rhodes is really very deep because china as it did to all of us made an enormous impression upon me <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a slightly simpler question to the minister which he may understand better <e> <s> do we spend as much money on the promotion of agricultural products as the french do <e>", "<cs> my lords we too would like to express thanks to the noble viscount for repeating the statement and to express our admiration for and gratitude to our forces <e> <s> our deepest sympathy goes to the relatives of those who have been lost or injured in this action <e> <s> i would like to ask the noble viscount the minister because he said that there were no harriers onboard atlantic conveyor if in fact our air dominance is going to increase and be kept up <e> <s> i think that this would be very useful and very essential to the operation <e> <s> we too would like to know what progress could be made or might be made towards an eventual long-term solution to put the whole world at peace and which would justify this brave and so far competent action <e>", "<cs> my lords coming back to the question of unemployment would the minister not agree that the highlands and islands development board despite some failures has done an enormous amount to promote employment and to keep people in the highlands <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be happy to realise that i know nothing like as much about government in local government as the noble lord lord ross and i do not propose to go into detail perhaps mainly because i know not nearly enough about it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord houghton in the last debate gave a lead when he said that this house is indulgent to noble lords who want to talk about things that are not in the bill <e> <s> looking at this bill it is no doubt very useful from part i onwards and will do useful things as proposed by the stodart report <e> <s> but when you look at the measures taken in part i it makes you think that there is something seriously wrong with the whole system of local government in scotland and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would agree with my point that there are a large number of electors who are not ratepayers and a large number of ratepayers who are not electors <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank the noble lord lord soames for initiating this debate <e> <s> it was noticeable that when the statement was made it was only my noble friend lord gladwyn and i who queried the governments attitude <e> <s> as a result of todays debate one can see that all noble lords who have spoken perhaps with the exception of the front bench of the labour party are very worried about what has caused this extraordinary situation <e> <s> i hope that ministers are examining the governments attitude and their reputation very seriously <e> <s> it is extraordinary that during the past years this convention it is only a convention has never been broken until now <e> <s> therefore great britain should examine very carefully why our partners who have been so supportive of us in so many other ways should suddenly break a convention of years standing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister think that the interest on even at the present rate would pay the best available man <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that a previous answer by the minister indicated that there is a deficit of million in manufacturing exports when you take away oil is this question not quite urgent enough to be included in the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if you multiply the quarters exports by four which i understand you can do you come to a deficit of approximately million <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the minister not agree that this matter could be dealt with in a number of ways for example by insisting on a very much larger number of nominations without actually putting up the amount of money to such a degree that major parties might be embarrassed <e> <s> it is a serious question and the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood highlighted the fact that one candidate actually changed his name <e> <s> i do believe that government ought to be seriously considering this <e>", "<cs> before the statement i think we were discussing the general principle underlying clauses to <e> <s> do not think i can do more than say that we as a party are in something of a dilemma on the point because both arguments have something in them <e> <s> it is certainly true to say that if the ratepayers were the electorate as a whole and there were not the immense anomalies which exist it would be quite wrong for the government to try to interfere with the electorate and their elected representatives if they wanted to raise the rates <e> <s> but the position is so extraordinary today that i believe the government case has something in it <e> <s> the people who vote are often not the people who pay the rates and many of the people who pay the rates certainly have no voice at all in local government <e> <s> there are a number of anomalies <e> <s> that is all i wish to say <e> <s> i shall await with interest the ministers arguments <e>", "<cs> those were my sentiments precisely <e>", "<cs> i think it would be very valuable if the minister would clear up this point <e> <s> a number of councils are worried about the delineation of the powers for industrial promotion between the region and the district and it would be very helpful if the minister would clear it up <e>", "<cs> i should like to back up what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i too have had representations from particularly a theatre i am associated with at pitlochry <e> <s> i should like to say first of all that they were grateful to the government for inserting clause which makes it clear that although the districts are to be responsible and will have rate support grant the regions may contribute <e> <s> in some cases they are afraid i suppose in the case of the pitlochry theatre which is not situated in a large city they may be more so that the districts might not be as willing or as broadminded as the regions have been <e>", "<cs> not as much a town as some others although it is extremely nice <e> <s> but we are talking about size not quality <e> <s> i think they have a certain anxiety <e> <s> i think that despite the new clause the minister could allay their fears by making it clear that he would expect the regions when they could to contribute and to encourage the districts to do so <e>", "<cs> on behalf of my noble friend i should like to say and i think that he was going to say this that we are very grateful for that assurance <e> <s> i am glad that the minister is going to examine the matter <e> <s> but i must make a point about farm buildings <e> <s> surely it is a little hard to pay expensive insurance against a burst which is the fault of the water authority <e> <s> surely the water authority if they are liable for damage done to farmland should be liable in the unlikely event of their damaging farm buildings <e> <s> surely the same should apply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister making it clear to the house that the government would in fact like to see china removed from the lists and that the only thing that prevents this is the attitude of the other signatories to that agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the bulk of tourists <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much hours per tonne of steel produced have improved under the present rgime and how they compare with germany and japan for example <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this is part of a much wider problem and that if the government could persuade the eec to adopt sensible policies such as the super levy on production of excess milk then much of the problems of new zealand would be helped as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret amendment no <e> <s> because the matter could have been left to competition <e> <s> i cannot see that a person can start up a business and destroy a good taxi service he starts up only if there is a need <e> <s> i shall not oppose it but i regret that the government have given way on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the government for moving the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will not encourage working stock persons to drive cattle over recreational areas as there will he even more trouble from fouling than from the working dogs <e> <s> nevertheless i think these are useful amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my gratitude to the government on behalf of the salvation army and particularly to the minister for making it quite clear on the record that he is referring to the salvation army and similar organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest as the legislation is now sensible that we get on with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply which implies as i expected a feeling of a state of uncertainty about olive oil <e> <s> while i do not know of many olive growers in anglesey or sussex or even inverness-shire it is very important to this country in view of the contribution and the surplus which might occur <e> <s> have her majestys government any plans which might simplify the problems in front of us <e> <s> for example in italy i understand twice as much money is paid out in a production subsidy as is paid in a sales subsidy which indicates quite a gap <e> <s> perhaps it indicates that the same view of love of the state and adherence to its rules does not apply there as might apply in some northern climes <e> <s> have the government any simpler plans for supporting this quite important industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister personally count the olive trees <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister press for a quick count of the olive trees which matter i understand has been hanging fire for some years <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not be prepared to say that the government really mean to stick to the figure <e> <s> i am a director of dundee university and i know about the trauma that they have gone through in arranging a per cent <e> <s> cut over three years <e> <s> every department has taken part and they have succeeded in achieving immense cuts <e> <s> if the noble lord is to stand there <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a question <e> <s> if the minister is to stand there and say that there are contingencies that might alter downwards the money available that would be a blow to the confidence of the universities which are following the governments plan <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could have an answer to my question <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is quite wrong <e> <s> i said does he really mean to stand there and say that he cannot even say that he will try to keep the money up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord melchett put his case with vigour and a certain amount of passion <e> <s> he was wise enough to say that he does not want the western isles to be turned into a norfolk or east anglia and that he wants to see the development programme go forward <e> <s> i say at the outset quite unashamedly that as a farmer i am on the side of the farmers and crofters and that while the birds are important the people in the western isles are much more important <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that the fact that the ministry of defence has taken the land for years gives us all great hope <e>", "<cs> my lords with some political reluctance i must admit that the statement is wholly satisfactory and that the government are to be congratulated <e> <s> as the noble earl said it is a highly significant statement <e> <s> the most significant point is that should approval not be forthcoming by denmark we and the other eight governments are prepared to take national steps <e> <s> i hope that the government will stand by this agreement <e> <s> much as i love the danes there is no doubt that the greater than sufficiency of their industrial fishing has been more responsible for the decline of fish stocks in the north sea than any other single factor <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement <e> <s> from this mornings press it appeared that some further concessions might be made to the danes <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> it is only a simple question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that if we are going to get armament reduction and agreement we need the soviet union to have a sense of some security and that while we oppose their ambitions we recognise that in the case of their own territories liberalisation must come from within and not from without <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for repeating the statement i agree with the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos that it is very disturbing <e> <s> i thought that we would all back the simple principle that because deep seabed mining is an area of such advanced technology it is only open to the industrialised nations and that an international seabed authority should distribute the benefits among the poor countries instead of the present position where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer <e> <s> i hope that the government are not departing from that principle <e> <s> the statement is grossly inadequate <e> <s> i hope that the government will tell us why they are so proceeding <e> <s> i sincerely hope that they will tell us that they are not acting out of the purely selfish reasons which it appears the international mining groups are pressuring the united states to adopt <e>", "<cs> my lords this subject is not my particular field but it is a subject on which every thinking person has considerable views and considerable fears <e> <s> the bill brings forward a liberal outlook and brings forward more safeguards against the fears that everyone has and which we read about from time to time of someone who has been confined for years and should have been released many years earlier <e> <s> the bill is certainly an advance in this direction <e> <s> in scotland the appeal to the sheriff every <e>", "<cs> my lords will the nine governments if there is a failure of denmark to agree to the fishing agreement remain determined to implement national measures which will bring an agreement into being <e>", "<cs> my lords does this not give us a great opportunity because if the noble lord lord hatch of lusby knows teachers who can instruct senior school children in methods of international problem solving this is a marvellous discovery and can he perhaps apply it to the leaders of the world who have great difficulty in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble earl for repeating the statement <e> <s> i would strongly support the noble lord lord cledwyn in asking the government to ensure that our present standards are kept in any agreement made <e> <s> there was a very interesting article in the paper this morning on the spread of foot and mouth disease in estonia and byelorussia and vets have inoculated million animals in an endeavour to contain the spread of foot and mouth in that area <e> <s> one of the great advantages that we have in being an island is that we have been able to keep up our regulations and our slaughter policy has proved enormously beneficial and cheap <e> <s> i sincerely hope the government will stand by what they say in the statement and a further assurance will be welcome <e> <s> i do not want to say anything about the fresh meat agreement <e> <s> i trust again that the health of our livestock and livestock industry will be the main consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that anyone who accepts a government subsidy may be directed to sell the property <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree entirely with the ministers basic attitude is it not a fact that we are losing the propaganda war <e> <s> if we make announcements at the wrong time and the russians are being much more skilful at propaganda perhaps we should think a little more about the effect of announcements such as for example that about the dense pack at a time when a great many people who are foolish in their final answer in my view are very worried by the whole thing <e> <s> in other words does the minister not think that our propaganda posture could be improved <e>", "<cs> i normally agree entirely with my noble kinsman my lords but on this occasion i must disagree i think we should stand absolutely firm on the measures proposed and agreed by the other nine nations <e> <s> i must remind the house that the danes by their industrial and fishing policy are responsible for more of the depletions of stocks in the north sea than any other single nation <e> <s> furthermore the shetland fishermen are very restive about the shetland box and the concessions that have already been made there and in my view all the concessions that should have been made have been made <e> <s> it is up to the danish government to be sensible and for their committees to follow the advice of their government and i hope and trust that our government will stand totally firm on the very large concessions that have already been made which affect very largely

nights as he has i would have been rather glad that some agreement had been concluded <e> <s> the main point which must be made is that at least we have an agreement and something on which to build

eec <e> <s> now we will have better control of our coastal waters <e> <s> this is all very much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a very important point which the noble lord lord john-mackie put that is where is the tonnes of mackerel to come from <e> <s> the statement says that it will not come from western waters but i understand from the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to the noble earl lord kinnoull for introducing this debate <e> <s> the fact is that you cannot go two yards in this house without tripping over either a landowner or a farmer or both <e> <s> but fishermen are a little scarce <e> <s> fishing is a very important industry and we are very grateful to the noble earl for raising this matter <e> <s> my connection with fishing is precisely that of many people in that i have fought and represented a constituency in which fishing is a major occupation <e> <s> in the main they are the seine netters whom the noble lord lord campbell of croy described and also the crofter fishermen <e> <s> of course their delight is to take the member of parliament or candidate out in a boat on a fishing trip invite him down below and then see whether they can make him sick with a mixture of sweet tea tobacco smoke and excessive heat <e> <s> but that is all part of the training of a good politician and very good for one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister able to tell us what control and check there is on industrial fishing which i understand will be allowed in the north of scotland box <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues perhaps for the record he will tell us where he gets the figure of billion assistance to industry in one year <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been an interesting debate and noble lords have run fairly true to form <e> <s> the minister said that the government are doing jolly well and noble lords behind him have said that of course the government are doing very well <e> <s> we have had the wisdom of the ministry rather than the wisdom of the minister but that is his job and that is what he is paid for <e> <s> that is right and proper <e> <s> nevertheless many useful things have been said <e> <s> i spoke at some length on chemicals and the rash use thereof <e> <s> i was of course accused by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley of donning my smock and running to the misty romantic past <e> <s> however that might be a little better than donning ones space suit and shooting into the unknown future without taking the precaution of checking where one is going <e>", "<cs> my lords a humble apology is called for and freely given <e> <s> i was at a meeting <e> <s> the best information i could get not from the whips but from the doorkeepers was that this debate could not possibly be taken before seven oclock <e> <s> i realise now that the oracles can be wrong <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept my humble apologies <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that my noble kinsman has moved the motion far better than i should have done <e> <s> nevertheless <e> <s> i should like to make one or two comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise once again with great humility to accept any reproofs which noble lords may care to heap upon me and to thank my noble kinsman once again for assuming the burden of introducing this report <e> <s> it has been an interesting discussion and i must again apoligise to the noble baroness lady elles that we did not research our facts and witnesses properly <e> <s> certainly if we had known that she was in fact a producer we would have rushed her to the witness stand because obviously she has a very practical knowledge of the whole process quite apart from her political knowledge as a member of the european parliament and a vice-president <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that scotland was recently invaded by very large numbers of welshmen to the total delight of the inhabitants and has the violence something to do perhaps with the shape of the ball <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much encouraged by the way in which the noble lord lord mottistone introduced the report <e> <s> it might sometimes be thought on the committee that we are in slight opposition to each other <e> <s> he was good enough to declare his interest in various alliances and of course i must declare that i have an interest in another sort of alliance as well as having an interest in farming being a farmer <e> <s> on the committee the interests of the farmers and indeed of the other members are in the long term <e> <s> the noble lord and the minister both brought out the fact that the common agricultural policy has worked really extraordinarily well if you take the three main planks of the treaty <e> <s> these were first to provide a stable supply of food which of course is the first duty of any government or any alliance secondly to provide a reasonable price to the consumer thirdly to see that the competent members of the farming community were rewarded in approximately the same way as the people in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords in counting up to that figure of million did the noble lord lord oram count in the families of the million as well <e>", "<cs> well my lords farmers and agricultural workers have babies as well <e> <s> did the noble lord count them <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to prolong the noble lords speech but before he sits down would he not perhaps admit as several noble lords have said that there is a real decrease in farmers incomes and that the consumer is suffering more the depredations of the manufacturer and retailer than from the farmers he is attacking so effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how much of this amount is in food aid <e> <s> can he give the governments view on the expert opinion which is beginning to be widely held that in many cases food aid has been harmful in destroying local agriculture and indeed local culture <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with my noble kinsman that we must look at this carefully <e> <s> but if spanish boats have taken the trouble to register as british boats and employ people who i understand

create a lawyers paradise <e> <s> the noble earl lord ferrers talked about per cent <e> <s> of the crew but i do not think he said that they must be british <e> <s> i believe he said that they must be citizens of the community <e> <s> this raises a lot of other questions <e> <s> what about community boats for example in waters within the -mile limit <e> <s> are they to be allowed to fish there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that explanation <e> <s> does this mean that if a pukka british vessel exported fish to spain it would pay a tariff or it would not be allowed in <e> <s> in other words do the spanish authorities make an exception and in fact they know there is a fiddle and let in these fish free of quota levy and duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to keep bothering the noble minister but why then do the present regulations say that the captain and one other must be british <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord know of any case where the prioprietary version is superior to the generic version <e>", "<cs> my lords the government say in the statement that their policy is to support selected students and countries <e> <s> the government cannot moan about being criticised <e> <s> anyone who has gone about the world knows the enormous <e>", "<cs> my lords it says in the statement that the governments policy is to give aid to selected students and selected countries <e> <s> it appears to me entirely reasonable that i should ask whether a certain country from the commonwealth is included <e>", "<cs> from these benches my lords i too welcome the order and hope that it goes speedily into execution <e> <s> the industry is paying for the whole cost of the scheme and it says a lot for the industry that in very bad times it has agreed to do that <e> <s> aujeszkys disease is enormously dangerous and our experience with foot and mouth and other diseases has been that the slaughter policy works and can preserve the health of the herd <e> <s> i too should like the minister to say whether he has any idea of the total amount of money which might be involved in compensating the herds to which he referred how long it will take to raise sufficient money to enable compensation to be paid and when he expects the levy to be lowered <e> <s> in other words can he give us any idea of how he expects the money side of this to go in this essential eradication scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that the consequential loss will not come from the levy <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome the order <e> <s> i think it is awful that the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones is not in his place to welcome this order because the last time we spoke about coxs orange pippins in this house he was absolutely lyrical about the pippin and that must have done a great deal of good in the country <e> <s> i hope he will take an early opportunity to repeat his marvellous comments on the pippin and do some more good <e>", "<cs> my lords might not the greatest help to small businesses be to stimulate the economy out of the trough in which it finds itself <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we too should like to welcome the repeating of the statement by the noble minister and to welcome also the implementation of these reports <e> <s> it is a fact that in scotland we have perhaps relied too much on our ancient reputation in higher education and perhaps we may have fallen behind a bit <e> <s> certainly it is absolutely scandalous to see the numbers of young people who leave school without any certificate whatever <e>",

noble earl aware that many potato producers in scotland have been taking as low as a tonne for their potatoes that the governments low fall-back price is just over and that this has not been realised <e> <s> is he also aware that the potato marketing board has spent a great deal of money in its efforts to hold the price at a reasonable level and that it would appear that the government have refused to give it any more to produce the sort of buying programme which would have held the price at a reasonable level <e> <s> are the government going to continue in this policy <e> <s> will they back the potato marketing board and the money they have already spent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the working of a guarantee which involves a very large number of producers in a loss of money should be looked at so that it may be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble lord lord ross of marnock detailing his part in the changes which have come about <e> <s> but we have got it wrong so often that i am glad that at least this new bill is based on some form of agreement <e> <s> whatever good intentions the labour party had in they produced a curious situation <e>

are human beings and they deserve the same consideration as other people <e> <s> the landlords were done down right left and centre by the legislation and many tenants grew extremely rich <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the long time that has elapsed and particularly in view of the success of the americans in securing the release of their nationals from angola can the minister tell me whether our representative there knew of the american efforts whether he co-operated with them and whether we are willing to do a deal <e> <s> the minister spoke of high level efforts but with respect they do not appear to have been very successful <e> <s> i should like to know whether we are making real efforts and efforts which may incur doing a deal of some sort <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support this bill <e> <s> i do not intend to speak for long because the noble lord lord ross of marnock has covered the field with his usual competence <e> <s> the bill like many of the other things with which he is concerned is a very sensible and necessary measure and i am sure that we are all very grateful to him and to the members of the other place who brought it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords if farmers continue to grow the large crops which they do when will the money actually run out

this matter an important part of his duties <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness whether the foreign office knew of the american negotiations with the angolan government for the release of american prisoners and if the foreign office knew whether any attempt was made to get in on the act and to associate ourselves and our own prisoners with this release <e> <s> in view of the fact that the horse trading of the americans and indeed of the soviet government has succeeded in freeing their nationals from the angolan prisons will our new ambassador have power to negotiate and in fact to horse trade or are we going to continue only to plead <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that there is no official money available to help the prisoners and that what the embassy does is to pass on private contributions <e> <s> can she perhaps assure the house that the ambassador will have the power to horse trade if necessary to get the prisoners out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that rather unhelpful reply <e> <s> can he perhaps tell me why these citizens who have paid their contributions consistently throughout their working lives are denied in this way <e> <s> is there any reason for it other than simply saving money in regard to one section of the community as against another section <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago i was trying to borrow what was then a great deal of money from a banker to pay for a large tract of upland scotland that i had bought <e> <s> i

time i realised that bankers have hearts <e> <s> the second time in years is today <e> <s> the noble lord lord seebohm with great practicality put the case on a subject which he obviously knows well

believe will help to solve some part of the problem rather more quickly if i may say so than the anger which the noble lord lord oram thought was necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down without wishing to upset him further may i inform him and ask for his comment on the fact that the sort of aid that he has been talking about of a temporary character even on basics like wheat has been ruining the economies of the said countries without them paying the extra price for food <e> <s> that has been the subject of all the literature that has been produced in recent years showing the failure of the sort of food aid the noble lord has talked about <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question <e> <s> if as we are told the belgrano was sunk for military reasons and to ensure the safety of our ships could the noble baroness tell us why the escorting destroyers which were the more dangerous of the small fleet because they carried the exocets were not sunk instead of the big ship which was rather old-fashioned and armed only with heavy guns <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement which reveals what one can only call a frightful mess <e> <s> should first like to ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by congratulating the minister on his new job and on the way in which he has obviously worked hard to familiarise himself with the problems <e> <s> i should also like to thank him and his department for

lord mountgarrett and others <e> <s> it is that tenants are much more willing to settle under the system now for a rent which they may think is out of the way or too much because the open market rent is held open <e> <s> it can be interpreted as the rent that has just been paid for the only farm to come into the market for the past years <e> <s> that is why so many rent reviews are settled <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> it is a little too simple to stand the test <e> <s> one of the things that produced the open market formula was the fact that previously the plain instruction to an arbiter to arbitrate was not producing a fair result from the landlords side <e> <s> inevitably if one gives no instructions what happens is that the arbiter simply says as is so often done in wage negotiations to the great disadvantage of this country as a whole that he will try to fix something in between <e> <s> one is then running to and fro to reach a compromise which may be entirely and completely wrong and will depend on the landlord going low and the tenant going high <e>", "<cs> i feel that a number of things have been said that i might comment on <e> <s> one is that it is perfectly right and proper that there should be differences both in principle and practice between scotland and england <e> <s> we went to great trouble to put the bill through for devolution in scotland and there is a great desire for the scots to remain scots and for many of their laws and practices to continue as they have been before and they can do it without injuring the unity of the united kingdom in any way <e> <s> indeed diversity need not be a bad thing <e>", "<cs> i see the noble lord lord forbes nodded his head <e>", "<cs> i think we are getting into another curious argument here but i believe the government have done the right thing in consulting and indeed in going to great lengths to make two parties agree <e> <s> i think that is a proper function of government and they have done well in this case <e>", "<cs> i think that there are grave dangers in the case put forward by the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> i would like to oppose this amendment for exactly the same reasons as i opposed the amendment of the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> there are too many superlatives <e> <s> indeed a thoroughly competent occupier is a little difficult to define <e> <s> i do not know the difference between a competent and a thoroughly competent chap <e> <s> i know a number of competent people but i know very few thoroughly competent people <e> <s> they are the type of people who do a great deal of harm to everyone by their thorough competence <e> <s> if we could achieve a level of competence it would be quite sufficient <e> <s> again i would use the arguments which i put forward previously <e> <s> it really is a doctrine of perfection to say <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister say what will happen to the landlord <e> <s> surely the landlord if he were to take a lesser rent would be entitled to some compensation as well <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the amendment <e> <s> if i may say so with the utmost respect it seems to show that the noble viscount lord mountgarret has no real appreciation whatsoever of the difficulties that face the government and all of us in framing this legislation <e> <s> he takes one point that of making more land available for rent and says that if we do what he suggests we shall make more land available forrent <e> <s> if you made every viscount a duke and if he let more land or if you gave him a subsidy of for every acre he let of course more land would be let <e> <s> but the whole point about the bill is that we are taking into consideration the appreciable difficulties the social situation and the economic situation which more practical people with <e>", "<cs> this is a very interesting amendment and we have been promised a complete and interesting reply <e> <s> i cannot understand myself all the time being driven to the defence of the government <e>", "<cs> my time will come no doubt <e> <s> in the meantime i must say that my noble friend lord walston put the point rather well when he said that one must have some scarcity otherwise one would never get any rent at all <e> <s> it is a question of defining what is a normal scarcity involving people who want to tackle a reasonable problem of paying a decent rent and making a worthwhile living and the kind of scarcity which drives people to compete for farms to a ridiculous extent for all kinds of other reasons <e>", "<cs> may i for once assist the noble earl lord caithness <e> <s> it is possible that a man might want to stay in a farm when he could quite happily in a period of surplus move at a lower rent to another farm <e> <s> in that case it would be quite reasonable for the landlord if the man felt that he could pay the rent and wanted to stay there to go to arbitration and say that he should pay rather more <e> <s> i must say that the noble earl lord caithness has a point here <e> <s> i can see cases where both arguments might apply <e> <s> in the other case nobody need make an offer for a farm if he does not want to stay there <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley but in justice we should produce a new clause which says that anyone who offers key money should have that taken into account positively in favour of the landlord when he asks for a rent review <e>", "<cs> that was the point the noble lord <e> <s> lord northfield was making <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord belstead would like to add to his trouble by considering that <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the amendment brings a kind of justice to people occupying adjacent land who offer exaggerated rents and keep it out of the hands of people who want to start to farm <e> <s> the amendment ensures that they will pay dearly for paying an exaggerated rent because the land is next door to them <e> <s> in that case i would support the amendment because it does what i would like it to do it makes more land available for other people <e>", "<cs> we are all agreed are we not that his next door neighbour should not pay the price for that mans greed <e>", "<cs> i should like to say once again that the government have done rather well in clause <e> <s> they have agreed to look at some of the suggestions brought forward but they have not agreed to look at them all i was happy to see that the noble lord did not promise to look at specific suggestions of the noble viscount lord dilhorne in which he raised the great success of commercial building in this country which has resulted as far as i can see in the most expensive hotel bedrooms in the world in london and a vast government programme of building factories and a number of other features of state interference with the private system which do not appear to me to constitute an ideal world <e> <s> i was glad to see that the minister did not promise to look sympathetically on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm or deny that the retail price index as a whole has risen by more than the price of food <e>", "<cs> as i understand the amendment if i understand it it would appear from the noble lords speech that what they want to do is to give the nfu time to think again in case the wicked government do them down on clause <e> <s> this may be an admirable sentiment but i do not think it is very sensible because the nfu and the cla were thinking for two years or more <e> <s> i agree that if land is going to be let and more land is going to be available for incomers to farming it will matter just as much to the sons or daughters of tenants <e> <s> and then i think that this is a sensible compromise <e> <s> i must say that to move it from one generation to two generations which the noble lord i think acknowledged was second best would be very foolish <e> <s> therefore i think that we would oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> for once i find myself in some agreement with my noble kinsman <e> <s> i also have a certain sympathy for the arguments used by the noble earl lord radnor <e> <s> it is true that there will be certain anomalies but i think that what the industry needs is some stability <e> <s> we at last have a bill that has some chance of standing <e> <s> progress can be made from here instead of the reversals that we have had since the war with legislation being passed by one government and reversed by the next <e> <s> no industry can go ahead on that basis <e> <s> i am afraid that the noble earls amendment is not a proper amendment at all it is a completely wrecking amendment although it is the job of the government to say this <e> <s> it destroys the whole purpose of the bill <e> <s> although i have sympathy with some of his arguments from these benches we shall oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that although this amendment has a great deal to commend it the objection is the same as to the <e>", "<cs> i was fascinated by the noble lords instruction to the opposition to rethink their fiscal policy towards the landlord-tenant system <e> <s> does that mean that the government are rethinking their fiscal policy <e>", "<cs> there is a slight rift in the alliance <e> <s> i have viewed with grave suspicion some of the people who have supported this amendment <e> <s> it needs to be approached with extreme caution <e> <s> it is a little hard to put into a tenancy agreement a covenant relating to the protection of the landscape the protection of wildlife and archaeological features <e> <s> one can say to a hardworking farmer you must not cut down trees <e> <s> you must not plough up this site <e> <s> but according to this one might direct him to divert his energies and instead of trying to make a living to conserve the wildlife round the place and forget about the vulgar business of farming and producing food <e> <s> this bristles with difficulties i agree <e>", "<cs> i should like to support if not the amendment what the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> i started by saying that we were dissatisfied with our amendment <e> <s> that has been proven by every speaker who has commented on it <e> <s> however the matter has been ventilated <e> <s> everyone agrees that it is a problem and the sort of thing that we need to look at <e> <s> we ourselves are most unhappy about compulsory retirement by notice to quit and so on <e> <s> as it has been ventilated <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i rise to give notice of my intention to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> in so doing i should like first to apologise to the president of the royal institution of chartered surveyors because during my second reading speech i meant that for this function they were the worst people in the world <e> <s> it went down in <e>", "<cs> the minister has fought hard and well <e> <s> he is able and persuasive but really i do not think that he has made the case for the government and i do think that he really made our case when he said that these four men in the ministry were experienced they knew the people they knew the different parts of the country and the selection of an arbitrator to suit both the landlord and the tenant to he fair was a job calling for great skill <e> <s> that great skill lies in the ministry where these four people have been working at it for years <e> <s> there is no doubt that the expert opinion on all sides of this committee does think that the expertise and the standing of the ministry should remain to make this bill a workable one <e> <s> so with great regret i must maintain my opposition to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate and a great number of points of view have been expressed about a great number of subjects particularly the fitting of myself and the noble earl into the new railway carriages <e> <s> i found them very comfortable except that when you try to put down the blasted tray which is supposed to hold your tea it will not come over yourself at all <e> <s> the old design and the facilities provided in the older carriages were extraordinarily useful and much more comfortable <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholly concur with that <e> <s> but i too must welcome the bill if only because it has led to an expression of a great number of very useful opinions in this house <e> <s> it gives us a chance to stress the tremendous importance of tourism not only to scotland but to the whole country at the present time when our manufacturing exports have fallen away to such an extent that if we did not have the oil that we are at present exporting we would be one of the poorest countries not only in europe but in the developed world <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister will allow me can he clarify one point <e> <s> did i understand him to say that out of the british tourist authoritys spending abroad million could be attributed to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene can the noble lord tell us how the bta calculate the million spent in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the ministers reply to the noble lord lord ross of marnock why was it that the governors of jordanhill were exempt from the secretary of states ruling that properties of this substantial character had to be sold through estate agents <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble earl on an excellent and very necessary report <e> <s> it is curious that we have just had a debate on the falkland islands which is a very exotic subject but i think that in practical terms this report is perhaps more important than the debate just concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that part of the trouble is that many of the original countries in the community do not regard us as being wholehearted community members and that it is the failure to overcome this which has been one of our greatest mistakes or failures <e> <s> really we are in the position of the scots mother it is a story with which the noble viscount will be familiar who was watching a squad of recruits drilling <e> <s> she said isnt it awful <e> <s> they are all out of step but our jock <e> <s> i think that we sometimes adopt an attitude which puts up the backs of our partners in europe despite the strong and sensible case that we have <e>", "<cs> we

to support my noble friend <e> <s> i think that the details of the scheme have been put over in a practical way and i believe that the objections to it have been dealt with <e> <s> however i look forward with great interest to hearing what new objections the noble lord the minister is to raise <e>", "<cs> i too will try to be short <e> <s> i think that the general intention of the clause might be worthy of some support but the clause itself is unjust and unworkable and therefore we oppose it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the question of the release of the british mercenaries who have been held so long in prison in angola has been linked with the settlement in namibia will the noble baroness be kind enough to tell the house what efforts are being made to secure the release of these unfortunate men <e>", "<cs> my lords there is another party the noble lord must understand these matters <e> <s> but he is so accustomed to ignoring my party that he leaps to his feet <e> <s> i too for some extraordinary reason am expected to welcome the fact that the noble lord has repeated this rather disastrous statement and in conformity with the rules of the house of course i do so <e> <s> but it is a quite extraordinary statement <e> <s> it begins at this point i echo the words of the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove by saying that the secretary of state has completed his consultations about the rate support grant settlement <e> <s> would the noble lord clarify whether this is an agreed settlement or whether it has been imposed upon scottish local authorities <e> <s> i strongly suspect that it is an imposition <e> <s> i object strongly to the hypocrisy perhaps i ought not to use that word and should say instead the device of saying for example <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will allow me can he tell the house whether the cuts they made were in the main on capital expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the supplementary question put by my noble friend lord taylor was perfectly in line with the question on the order paper because it says quite distinctly <e>", "<cs> we on these benches think that it is perhaps not as strong a point as some which come later but equally we think the government might as well have given way on this matter <e> <s> with that strong position that we have taken up i will say no more <e>", "<cs> i must say that the ministers explanation rather highlights what the noble lord lord carmichael said that now we want to oversee the secretary of state as well and instruct him to consult the british tourist authority <e> <s> surely to goodness the secretary of state knows his duty without its being laid down exactly to him <e> <s> i must say that the argument to the effect that we have to dovetail every single thing and gain the consent of both bodies does look a little thin when you consider that the scottish tourist board are going to be spending and they are hardly likely to throw it away and duplicate something that was already being done by the british tourist authority <e> <s> i must say that it appears to me excessive but it is not again a tremendous point <e> <s> however i think that the minister could well remove these lines and improve the bill and perhaps show a little more trust in the tourist authorities in scotland and in the secretary of state for scotland instead of hedging them in with every possible definition <e>", "<cs> my lords coming back to my noble friends point does not the noble baroness accept that if the government fix all spending and force the local authorities so to do there will be no incentive for the ratepayers and the electors in a district to get rid of their authority or its members <e>", "<cs> may i proceed to be helpful too <e> <s> what this amendment by my noble and learned friend does is highlight the position of the scottish tourist board and the amount of difficulties which hedge it around <e> <s> perhaps i may take a practical example <e> <s> the situation that i envisage happening very easily is that the scottish tourist board will find out that in the programme which they may or may not have had from the british tourist authority an <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to delay proceedings but i think the minister misunderstood the point that i was making <e> <s> my point was very simple that if the secretary of state had a statutory duty to consult the british tourist authority and it was in direct dispute with the scottish tourist authority there was nothing like an authority of that sort for delaying its answer to the consultations until it was too late for the point at issue <e> <s> therefore the secretary of state should be able if necessary to ignore that which he could do by taking advice from his noble friend and putting in the word may instead of shall <e>", "<cs> the minister is quite right about this amendment <e> <s> i dare say i was totally out of order in going back on a previous amendment to show him the error of his ways in a previous discussion <e>", "<cs> i should like to urge the minister to accept this amendment <e> <s> it would make some sense of the whole bill <e> <s> up to now it is a small thing the to be used somewhat grudgingly as allowed by the secretary of state and approved by the british tourist authority <e> <s> but it is only sensible to give scotland and the scottish tourist board a proper say a significant say in the million which the british tourist authority is spending overseas <e> <s> to do that they need the powers given in this amendment <e> <s> it makes it into a real bill which gives the scottish tourist board some real say overseas without <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard correctly that the cost is about million in total will the minister agree that per cent <e> <s> is a very large percentage for administration <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm or deny that he himself is a primate <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister clarify his answer to the first part of the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that a non-obligatory expenditure might well be a very wise investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should very much like to congratulate the maiden speaker a curious tone for noble lords who have spent years in the other place but i greatly enjoyed his speech and look forward to hearing him many times again <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the panacea of getting the finance ministers to sit in on the negotiations might result in exactly the same outcome because certain countries gain financially from a rise in prices and others do not <e> <s> the finance ministers in my view would take much the same view as the agricultural ministers according to which country they came from <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i can see the sense of the amendment of the noble lord lord northfield and what he is trying to do is obviously to stop the chap who has a hunk of land who bids a high rent for every other little bit round about and averages it out with his own holding and thereby prevents many other people from getting land <e> <s> the objective is perfectly sensible but as i see the amendment it would apply to the whole of the present holding <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley said it would not stop the owner-occupier from bidding in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to point out to my noble kinsman that the noble earl lord onslow is in a different place at the moment although perhaps not in a different position <e> <s> i do think we have rather got to the stage of angels dancing on the points of pins <e> <s> really the instructions are sufficiently clear to the arbitrator that he has now got to take into account the scarcity value and whether it is appreciable- substantial or excessive is in fact in his own mind <e> <s> even the noble lords amendment says which he considers excessive <e> <s> obviously we depend enormously on the arbitrator himself and on his understanding <e> <s> i think the general tenor of the word appreciable is satisfactory and i must say that i think we are here trying to define too much how the arbitrator ought to use his judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i nearly cried over the references to wasted time <e> <s> my noble kinsman is i think making too much of the governments intentions <e> <s> i agree with what they have done in the bill hut as i said on second reading it is only a small step forward <e> <s> i give the government at least credit for trying to take an agreed step forward <e> <s> they have not used retrospective legislation to produce further examples of the see-saw achieved by the two ruling parties since the end of the war <e> <s> those parties must take the responsibility for the mess that now exists <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be simpler for the foreign office when they want a document to copy it thereby leaving the record in its proper place in the public record office <e>", "<cs> my lords while deploring the ministers reply to the present question may i ask whether she would accept my congratulations and i am sure those of the whole house on the release of the british mercenaries held for so long in angola <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister say whether the morale and patriotism of the very important staff at cheltenham have been improved by the way in which this settlement was imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches can back the idea of the ownership and sale of houses to tenants with perhaps more fervour than can those who sit on the benches of the labour party <e> <s> however the government have an extraordinary facility for upsetting those who are sympathetic to their ideas by producing extraordinary legislation <e> <s> when we dealt with the tenants rights etc <e> <s> scotland bill which we are now amending all sorts of practical objections were raised not only by the labour party but by those in local authorities up and down the land who support the government but for extraordinarily doctrinaire reasons the government paid no attention to them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether or not the figures that he has given are adjusted to take account of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord gets up will he take another question <e> <s> will he comment on the point that i was trying to make but obviously did not make very clearly <e> <s> if orkney has problems about teachers houses cannot this apply to other rural authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for what i too think is an important statement and a very great step forward in bringing sanity into the operation of the cap because the way that we have avoided taking steps or the council of ministers have avoided taking the necessary steps has brought the whole concept to the verge of breakdown and it is a policy which has resulted in very great benefits to the balance of payments in this country and to the security of food supplies in europe <e> <s> what has been wrong up till now has been that politically the council of ministers have never had the courage to take the necessary steps to make the policy work <e> <s> i myself would much rather have seen a straight cut in price which would have been simpler to operate and might have been fairer but this is a really savage and i am afraid necessary step if we are to stop the whole thing breaking down <e> <s> for that reason i welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to start by paying tribute to our chairman the noble lord lord plowden <e> <s> i have been much entertained and delighted by the way that he has handled the bucolic section of his committee <e> <s> i am sure too that the noble lord has been much entertained by the behaviour of these strange animals which in his past career he may not have encountered <e>", "<cs> i must say that on second reading the noble lord lord gray expressed satisfaction at the rate houses had been sold and he told us that the number of applications which were being received each month he deemed to be satisfactory <e> <s> in this case i must agree with the noble lord lord ross that if it is satisfactory why on earth is the minister reducing the qualifying period <e> <s> it is true of course that the most desirable houses are being sold <e> <s> if someone is allocated a new house they can buy it in two years <e> <s> i think the three-year period is plenty <e> <s> quite frankly <e> <s> i do not understand the rush to add further attractions in order to improve a situation which has been described as satisfactory <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again but i think that the minister spoke to another proposed change which is to raise the discount available to per cent <e> <s> i also find this inexplicable <e> <s> i agree that it is a very good thing to encourage people to buy their own houses and their council houses but we should not throw them away and throw them away to a certain section of the community only <e> <s> i come back to my old plea for the farm worker <e> <s> the farm worker provides his own accommodation during his working life by his labour on the land but he has no right to buy that house a council house or any other house at a discount of percent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> why then should we deprive local authorities of the money that they should be using to provide retirement houses for these farm workers who have worked all their lives to provide their own accommodation <e>", "<cs> as i understood the ministers argument as regards the debate on the last amendment he said to me first that any house which had a secure tenant in it and which was in private hands would have a discount if it was sold the difference being that the private landlord is not bound to sell it he can wait and see whether he can secure the whole value for his property when the tenant dies or moves out <e> <s> the second point which the minister made and which i thought was quite a good one was that if by greater discount one could sell more houses one could then use that money to build houses like for example my pet houses namely houses for retired farm workers <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord gray can clarify a point <e> <s> he used the phrase if a tenant has been a good tenant <e> <s> does that mean that a -year tenant who has not been a good tenant does not get the discount <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may define it in this way a good tenant will get the discount and deserve it but a bad tenant will not deserve the discount but will nevertheless get it <e>", "<cs> i am terribly sorry but i did a calculation and asked for a comment upon how many more houses needed to be sold to justify the drop of million in receipts <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will accept the logic of using this power to include non-state tenants of tied houses <e> <s> there seems to be no logic at all in confining this immense privilege to people who already have the advantage of a state subsidy as against people who do not have the advantage of a state subsidy <e> <s> will the minister confirm or deny that this might possibly be included in the powers or the thoughts of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i very strongly support this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock has marshalled the arguments extremely well <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat the case for keeping these houses but i do hope that the minister is not going to produce the argument which was produced to me on the original bill that it was a great shame that these poor old people did not have the same rights as others to buy their houses <e> <s> that is arrant poppycock if i may say so <e> <s> obviously old and retired peoples houses will be bought only for the commercial advantage of the family or of someone else who will provide the money <e> <s> that is the only possible scenario in which old people will buy a house specifically let by the housing authority to old people <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister would answer this question <e> <s> am i right in assuming that the county of angus for example it is a district now built specially for retired people two-apartment houses and that these houses may now be sold in spite of the fact that they have built them specially for retired people <e> <s> i accept that if they are adapted for some special circumstance they can be exempted from sale but in my estimation there are many houses built by the local council in angus which in fact were built for old people and which can now be sold <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the minister explain <e> <s> if the council may buy it back do they buy it back at the new price or at the open market price or if they buy it back at a prearranged price what is the point of making a condition of pre-emption <e> <s> it is surely far more logical simply to keep the stock for the great need there is for it <e>", "<cs> in my original remarks i have described that argument in a very rude way <e>", "<cs> i rise to make another plea to the minister to support this very reasonable amendment <e> <s> we are after all dealing with rural areas and in the rural areas there are enormously sensible councils <e> <s> surely the minister must know that he is not dealing with recalcitrant militants in the big cities he is dealing with the type of people he knows and understands some of whom might even support the tory party <e>", "<cs> i ask your lordships to forgive me once more but rural areas are different and they are different for this reason <e> <s> since the advent of the motor car people who have good jobs in towns often wish to live in the country and they buy their house in the country and they motor to work <e> <s> further-more with rising prosperity or prosperity was rising until recently people have wanted a house in the country as a second home <e> <s> we have illustrations of this and of the trouble it has caused in the highlands and in wales <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one small point <e> <s> on an act that was passed in i do not think that the experience to date is enough to go on <e> <s> that is not an argument that i could accept in looking at this matter <e>", "<cs> i agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of some of the legislation which the government have produced in this case i must disagree with the noble lords on the opposition front bench <e> <s> i should like to see the sort of mess they will make of it when the regulations are produced before committing the government to producing a scheme <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for his explanation which is of course reassuring <e> <s> i do think that my noble friend has something in that a few extra words might make it absolutely clear that the rights are not affected <e> <s> one might have to wait a very long time for a landlord to pay the money that is owed to a tenant and in the meantime he could be taking advantage of the common law requirement <e>", "<cs> i must say in reply to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that i wholly agree with him <e> <s> however at the present moment my stomach is beginning to tell me that at the present time the use of words in this committee is what i most want to cut down on <e> <s> at this point i should like to withdraw the amendment although we may bring it forward again later <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the explanation which was given in the ministers usual kind and pleasant manner but i must say that i am not really convinced that this is not an exceptional case <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock put forward the fact that the regulations will have a very much greater effect on far more people than will the main object of the bill <e> <s> clause does not give a tremendous description of what is proposed in the way of regulations it cannot give a tremendous description <e> <s> for us to go through the clause knowing that we may not see or debate the regulations that are to affect so many people makes me disinclined to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be reasonable for the noble lord to say whether or not the <e>", "<cs> my lords we should very much like to welcome the reply to the private notice

from the financial questions asked by the noble lord lord bruce of donington a number of other questions arise <e>", "<cs> may i point out that there are no counties in scotland <e> <s> there are

deplorable about these facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that there is not a great deal i can say after that concise and true exposition of the facts but i should like to say something about the myth that one man can really represent a euro-constituency <e> <s> i fought the north east scotland constituency at the last election and was greatly helped by the fact that it is heavily populated by my relations throughout the length and breadth of the constituency <e> <s> even so i found it quite impossible to run a normal campaign and to keep in touch with people <e> <s> i came to the conclusion that there is no question but that we would have had a fairer and a better choice for the electors if we had the whole of scotland as one constituency with proportional representation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down does he appreciate how <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord did say that the documents were still to be issued <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i find the lord advocates reply deeply unsatisfactory <e> <s> the important point appears to me that street <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment as i have supported similar efforts to make the government see sense before <e> <s> the noble lord was kind enough to write to me when i asked how many more houses would have to be sold to make up the same money i think the reply was that another houses would make up the difference in cash caused by the bigger discounts <e> <s> i think quite frankly for purely practical reasons that the government will not get their other houses <e> <s> the people who will buy their houses are the better off the more sensible the more saving and the more longheaded of the tenants and if they will not buy at per cent <e> <s> nothing will make them buy at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for selling council houses <e> <s> i am not for selling them at less than could be obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me whether my memory is correct in recalling that the governments supposition was that another houses a year would be sold because of the extra discount <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i have been very impressed by the reply that the noble lord has given in one respect he has given a clear indication that regarding the smaller houses the one or two-bedroomed houses if they have fittings in the bathroom such as grab rails and so on that are meant for elderly people then they are clearly designated as houses for a special purpose for old people <e> <s> this is an extremely valuable tip or hint to the local authorities and i think it is a very valuable concession for the government to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that this is an absolutely splendid amendment <e> <s> i wish that i had thought of it myself because it really puts the onus purely on the secretary of state <e> <s> if all that we have heard from the noble lord the minister is correct about how it would be so much better for people to own their own houses how good it would be for the country how much money it would save and how much more pride people would have then he <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one comment <e> <s> i still fail to understand the logic of giving large discounts to people who have in one way or another been provided with houses by the government <e> <s> the minister has said that in fact the rent does not cover and never has covered both the capital and running costs and therefore the balance of advantage lies in the council selling a house at whatever price <e> <s> it seems to me to be illogical <e> <s> i repeat i cannot understand the logic of allowing large discounts to people who for years have been causing the government to let houses at a loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord grimond who is extremely familiar with the affairs of the islands and who cannot be here due to a prior engagement would also like to support it <e> <s> the amendment would indeed short-circuit a great many troubles and the sheriff with his local knowledge is obviously a sensible person to handle any appeals <e> <s> the island councils certainly appear to be a little unhappy with an appeal to the secretary of state and would much rather it was dealt with by the sheriff <e> <s> common sense also appears to support this <e> <s> i am sure that the minister must look favourably on this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness expand on the reply to my noble friend lord grimond <e> <s> at what point would the government propose to consult the people of hong kong after they have made the agreement or before <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness answer the question put by my noble friend lord avebury <e> <s> it is very important that the overheads are taken into account when the costing is being done but if the overheads cannot be saved then surely a wrong decision could be taken <e>",

question on the order paper <e> <s> does the assistance include the all-important question of seed corn in drought areas <e> <s> the important thing appears to be to keep agriculture going in difficult circumstances <e> <s> even if you are giving food to relieve famine you still need to keep agriculture going <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment strongly <e> <s> the government are introducing this rather ludicrous bill a patching up of a bad system <e> <s> it is a system they condemned in their manifesto and which they intended to put right <e> <s> instead of that they have abandoned the search for alternatives <e> <s> they are patching up a system that they themselves think is totally unsatisfactory and in so doing they are introducing curbs on local government and

given by my noble friend lord grimond who said that a local income tax could be investigated <e> <s> this was a hint <e> <s> it really is not good enough for ministers to say to the house we have considered everything enormously carefully and anything the government have considered is bound to be right <e> <s> that is not debate <e> <s> he should really give the arguments <e>", "<cs> i must say that this is an extremely sensible amendment <e> <s> i cannot see how the other place can judge a whole batch of authorities which misbehave without being able to judge whether one has misbehaved

have a very energetic and busy small business federation with whom i have been in touch and that will be much encouraged too by the ministers sympathetic attitude <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that we can find a method which will not lay too much of a burden on other people <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for the reply and i shall study what he has said to see whether the derogation procedure covers the situation i hope it does <e> <s> in the meantime i shall withdraw the amendment and have a look at what the minister has said and the effects thereof <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may come into this private argument <e> <s> when the government have made an order which as it says in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i understand that <e> <s> but if

"<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the most endangered species in the less-favoured areas are the sheep farmers <e> <s> without these grants there would be no population and then the area would not be nearly as attractive as it is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister having said that there has been an improvement even from a low base can he tell us what proportion of the capacity of the building industry is being used at the present time and how many unemployed workers there are in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment yet again <e> <s> unless the new clause is accepted the whole case of the government regarding interfering with local government falls to the ground <e> <s> if they do not do anything about the rating system

whole question has irritated annoyed and perturbed people all over scotland including people in the tory party <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lords reasoning <e> <s> is he basically saying we have examined the situation and our examination is therefore better than that of other peoples <e> <s> we have given up the struggle and now we have this bill giving central control of any misdeeds of local government <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that that is the final answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord ross of marnock in this amendment <e> <s> what it means is that the accused are given no right of individual reply <e> <s> we know that the scottish office will be dealing with them but they should have a right of appeal to the secretary of state <e>

this is the core of the bill <e> <s> this is rate capping and this in my view is the destruction of local government as a valid force in scotland <e> <s> the government might have said this is a temporary measure because there are rogue authorities in scotland in relation to whom we cannot find a method of making local democracy work quickly so we have this temporary measure <e> <s> but they have not said that <e> <s> they have said we have examined with enormous care all the alternatives and there is no alternative but central government control <e> <s> for that reason i must vote for this amendment to leave out clause <e> <s> we are well aware of its wrecking capacity but that is what we want to do <e> <s> we want to wreck this bill which is going to wreck local government and which already has had the opposite effect from what the tory party had <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to ask the minister particularly whether he meant what he said when he said that the loss of revenue would be replaced by rate support grant <e> <s> i obviously have a particular interest in an affirmative reply <e> <s> with regard to the general stimulus of the economy it is not always a good thing to give rate relief on empty property <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he explain whether the contractors principle has been applied in the case of the bowling green

may raise the question of the noble baronesss bowling club <e> <s> will the noble lord the minister tell me whether her bowling club may now appeal against a contractors valuation on the basis of

today transferring the responsibility for payment to other sections to wit empty industrial premises as i quoted before reed beds and then moorings and various others <e> <s> but in this case we stick to the great principle <e> <s> i must say that it is not at all logical <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say how channels sit <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that most major airlines are back in profit and have greatly improved their results will the noble lord say by how much british airways has outperformed other major airlines in the same field <e>", "<cs> my lords for the record would the minister care to put right the statement of his noble friend and his corroboration thereof in that in fact the unwieldy conglomerate was created under private enterprise <e> <s> i well remember the statement made by the managing director of bmc when they took over rover <e> <s> he said the advantages of scale would overcome everyone else <e> <s> would the minister not agree that that was a correct statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e> <s> i am highly gratified that the government have this immense concern for the owners of moorings buoys and other rare objects <e> <s> it is wholly in line with their attitude throughout this bill <e> <s> they are also extremely concerned about reed beds <e> <s> i understand that the popularity rating of the government among the owners of reed beds and moorings has now risen to an extent which is unprecedented since they started doing public opinion polls <e> <s> i understand that they are highly gratified and that this will be quoted in the european elections as an example of the popularity of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been concerned with small matters though not terribly small as the noble baroness raises a real point <e> <s> we have been talking about the method of valuation and so on but on the question that the bill do now pass it is relevant to say that the government have been enormously disappointing not only to the opposition but to their own supporters because there is a real problem in local government <e> <s> it is and has been exemplified by many of the labour councils in the west and elsewhere who have driven rates to a point where they have scared away business and they have also raised the art of manipulating the grants for the benefit of a section to a fine art <e> <s> obviously local government in scotland and elsewhere has fallen into disrepute <e> <s> it has gone away from its base of responsibility to the people it has gone away from the base of getting the best people to stand because they will have real things to do and local councillors have become the agents of central government <e> <s> the whole matter has been politicised and local government in scotland has deteriorated in the last years <e> <s> some good things have been done but on the whole it has deteriorated <e> <s> the conservative party saw this

fell asleep <e> <s> i cannot claim to have a precise knowledge of every word and i am indeed sorry for the minister who has obviously studied long into the night and his pale looks come from the studies that he has had to undertake <e> <s> one always has a great wish to be nice to the noble lord the minister because even if he is cutting your throat he is always nice to you <e> <s> i shall endeavour to curb my feelings of being too nice to him but we have had a quite extraordinary succession of i shall not say mistakes but failures to get a sensible policy into europe generally or into the council of ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to repeat some of the points that my noble kinsman has made because both these reports are enormously valuable <e> <s> the report of the committee of the noble lord lord greenhill is particularly valuable in that it draws the teeth from some of the rather ridiculous statements made by bodies who have a small particular interest and who push it to the absolute limit without a great deal of knowledge of what they are talking about except from their own very narrow view <e> <s> also the report of the noble lord lord greenhill has raised the debate above the level of farmer-bashing which is becoming extraordinarily popular and which has given rise to lots of good stories combined with irish ones <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what these huge losses of moorland amount to <e> <s> how many acres does this amount to in proportion to the area of moorland in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he could tell me what the orkney farmer is going to do if he is not allowed to improve his grazing <e> <s> the importation of grain is very expensive and he is hit hard <e> <s> so is it more important to preserve the moorland in orkney than to preserve the farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in this <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that the long-term monitoring research at rothamsted might he the subject of development in this new co-operation which is taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl answer the first question which i think was are the national coal board asked to take into account the nations losses when they are looking at the economic viability of a pit <e> <s> that i think was the original question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister sure that he was the right person to take this question <e> <s> perhaps it should have been taken by the ministry of ag <e> <s> and fish <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for his reply may i tell him that the community i am taking as an example is that of glen prosen in the county of angus where people are clubbing together to spend more than on providing colour tv in their homes which is absolutely necessary if people want to stay in the glen <e> <s> not only do they have to pay that money but the first advice the bbc gave them was on where to purchase their colour licences for <e> <s> to add insult to injury the home office charged them more than for a transmitting licence <e>",

practical way of providing the necessary service <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us the difference in cost between exporting grain immediately and putting in and out of intervention <e> <s> i understand that it is very significant <e>", "<cs> my lords in coming to the end of this debate it is remarkable that all round the house there is a great deal of agreement that the bill is very necessary and there is even agreement between the arch-conservationists and the arch-farmers on certain points which is useful <e> <s> i mention <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister takes too much credit for the intentions of his right honourable friend may i point out and this point has been so rightly and properly drawn attention to by my noble friend lord grimond that the intention to help the sons of those with poorer incomes to go to university has not been carried out by his right honourable friend <e> <s> he has in fact cut the student grants by a percentage in real terms this year <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it appears to be very sensible <e> <s> i hope that the minister will accept it and will not produce the argument that perhaps there will be some other body responsible for paying damages because other bodies can very quickly run out of money particularly in the case of disasters of the scale that we have seen recently <e> <s> in a case of what might well be a national disaster there is no question but that the government as a whole and the public as a whole should bear the damage suffered by the people in the same area <e>", "<cs> is the word land mentioned in the schedule as covering inland water <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister following upon the previous discussion whether either of the ministers refers to any minister <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not mean the opposite that either of the ministers means any minister <e>", "<cs> let me assure the noble earl lord ferrers that this is the preamble to the code which has protected him to his evident good health for the past years or so <e>", "<cs> i must thank the minister and those other noble lords who have spoken in support of the principle <e> <s> i took the wording from the previous code <e> <s> obviously it may not fit in parliamentary terms and may not please parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> i am delighted with the ministers assurances and i look forward to seeing what is produced <e> <s> i can assure him that i am feeling so well about this that i can agree that all they say about him is true <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for the second time i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> during the debate on one of the select committee reports i said that obviously the answer was to set up an environmental department within the ministry of agriculture which would stress this importance <e> <s> i think that the minister said that the conflict between the two had been largely resolved and it must be right that there is one executive department applying the actual regulations and laying down the regulations with the statutory components and indeed the content agreed by the environmental section within that ministry <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is of course my noble friend lord walston who has his name down as supporting it <e> <s> it is absolutely vital that the government have the power to prohibit export <e> <s> although there are other amendments down later about the regulations and about the labelling that we would like to see at this stage i think it is essential that the government say that they wish to take the power to prohibit exports <e>", "<cs> i should like to say since i have been referred to that the cow is not nearly so dangerous an animal as some of the chemicals that are sold to the third world <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl say whether there is anything to prevent the government taking the power to make a regulation <e> <s> one can envisage a lot of cases where it could be used <e> <s> you can envisage corrupt and ruthless firms who would put on all the labelling they wished and still export very dangerous chemicals to corrupt third world countries <e> <s> surely it can do no harm to take the power to make a <e>", "<cs> why does the noble lord object to the perfectly simple exercise of putting in the word export so that he can take the powers if he is required under international obligations so to do <e>", "<cs> may i add my voice to this <e> <s> that was my intention that it should be left for us to study the very helpful statement made by the minister and perhaps we can come back to the detail <e> <s> i know that many noble lords have very strong views on this question <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for not briefing him properly but both of us were probably telling the truth <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> leads straight to amendment no <e> <s> which obviously it would be convenient for the committee to discuss <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene in this debate i think the minister has obviously got the sense of what the chamber feels with regard to aerial spraying <e> <s> i should like to say that of course in our amendment we did not mention every eventuality i hate to think what he would have said to me if we had done so <e> <s> but one of the purposes of course was to probe the governments attitude and i must say i am somewhat encouraged because i think it is absolutely necessary for any future development of aerial spraying that the government tighten up the regulations and rules and do away with the resentment the very real and proper resentment felt by the public <e>", "<cs> does that mean that the minister will accept the amendment in a different form <e>", "<cs> i was interested in the procedure <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister could say if <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord the minister make clear to me what he means by that <e> <s> does he mean that before a farmer can innovate anything it must be on the label and approved and tested by the company or the commercial concern that produced it <e> <s> that seems to me to be sensible <e> <s> however if that is the case it rather does away with innovation <e>", "<cs> we cover that by saying <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not even encouraged it <e> <s> it is all very well to say that some people have been trained to a degree but there are many more farm workers and small farmers and large farmers who do not know nearly enough about the dangers of mixing spraying quantities and everything else <e> <s> as for the argument of the noble earl that by all means let us train them but do not let us give them any certificates i suppose he would like to go back in time and not even license commercial air pilots <e> <s> if you followed the noble earls argument to its logical conclusion you would not license anyone you would simply say that if they are trained that is all right <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to say that in about years everyone will have been trained but that might be a little too long <e> <s> i still consider that the reply is rather unsatisfactory but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one thing that has worried me far more than the use in agriculture although our methods are improving is the totally unrestricted use which may be made of pesticides in gardens all over the country <e> <s> they are much more likely to be over-used there by people who get sore backs from weeding than they are in agriculture <e> <s> i do not know the answer to how this is going to be controlled <e> <s> certainly one can insist and indeed there are regulations that everything is labelled and all the dangers are pointed out <e> <s> the ministers thoughts on this will be extremely interesting and i have no doubt that his accumulated wisdom will provide an answer to what i regard as this highly dangerous situation of the unrestricted use in gardens <e>", "<cs> this has been a very good debate and i have listened to the arguments put forward for the other excellent amendments that have been tabled <e> <s> however i must say that i come back to the view that our very simple amendment on publication is eventually the one which must be adopted <e> <s> several noble lords cited commercial pirates in various parts of the world and indeed in specific parts of the world <e> <s> but if a nation or a company is sophisticated enough to produce the pesticides and the chemicals about which we are talking then as soon as a successfully tested pesticide gets clearance if there is any information available at all they will surely be in a position very soon to manufacture that pesticide <e>", "<cs> i accept the logic of the first argument but not of the second <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley put the case in a way which makes it almost impossible for the minister to refuse <e>", "<cs> i must say that if a chemical is being persistently misused something ought to be done about it <e> <s> but i do not think that it should be dealt with by the single action of either the ministers or for it appears to me that it would require consultation <e> <s> i feel that the amendment is too widely drawn because too many people can act without the approval of others <e>", "<cs> i shall speak severely to my advisers about the out-of-dateness of the matter of the regulations <e> <s> in the spirit of the matter i do not see what is to prevent the government from saying that when the code of conduct comes in they will make a regulation applying the code of conduct <e> <s> however i am glad to hear that the minister is keen on a code of conduct is actively engaged in promoting it within fao and i look forward to its coming out <e> <s> i shall consider his reply and see whether we should do something on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it might be appropriate at this point to question why if we have to enforce this part of the act it would not be suitable at times to appoint representatives from the local authority who are in fact responsible for public health in many cases and who know the ground <e> <s> i question why they would not perhaps be more suitable than representatives appointed by the ministry in certain cases <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord the minister would care to refer back to his reply to the previous amendment and tell us why this cannot be so under this amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall try again <e> <s> i want to know from the minister why it is unsuitable for a representative of the local authority to be appointed <e> <s> it appears to us that the local authority has a responsibility for public health and knows the ground <e> <s> in many cases it might be quite suitable for the local authority to authorise a person to enforce the act <e>", "<cs> but it is not for the local authority to appoint them they have to be authorised by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are horses for courses <e> <s> is he further aware that the whole house realises that mr macgregor when dealing with reasonable people with the good of the industry and their members at heart did a lot of practical good in steel but that in a political situation he is wholly at a loss and the government made a grave mistake in

lord paget of northampton <e> <s> does the noble lord know of a single private issue which immediately doubled after the sale <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the minister to say in reply to a previous question that some of the billion would be put on deposit and that some would be set against borrowing <e> <s> can he tell us the proportions <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say that i am extremely grateful for the support of my noble friends and kinsman but at least it appeared that they accepted the principle and the minister in his usual way has been extremely helpful in stressing the need for insurance <e> <s> may i ask him to consider the logic of the broad case that i made <e> <s> i fully accept the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister and agree with him that the words drawn up by the draftsmen do fulfil the purpose we had in mind <e> <s> they will obviously serve as a very straightforward guide to those people who have to draft the regulations so that the regulations apply strictly for the purpose involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> in view of the dangers arising from the misuse of chemicals the amendment appears to be sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords i have my name down as supporting this amendment <e> <s> at the previous stage of the bill i moved an amendment to control aerial spraying <e> <s> there is nothing printed in the bill at the moment to reassure the public about aerial spraying <e> <s> i have had far more complaints about aerial spraying than about anything else <e> <s> it is the most difficult aspect of relations with the public that i have come up against in a long period of spraying crops <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should very much like to welcome the ministers attitude on this very important question of the availability of information <e> <s> it certainly is a tremendous step forward and one which will be welcomed in a great many circles <e> <s> i should like to ask a couple of technical questions <e> <s> is it not a fact that any product which is used here will almost certainly be used in the united states <e> <s> there information with regard to the tests is available on

points on the composition of the committee so i shall not put them <e> <s> i shall content myself with welcoming this excellent step on the part of the ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like briefly to support the amendment if what it means is that the basis of the committee would in fact be broadened and it would not consist solidly of scientific boffins <e> <s> it would be a great help if we could have on it an environmentalist a farmer and an engineer because the whole subject is not simply a question of the formulae or anything else it is the whole field of the expansion of techniques to suit the whole of the industry and the environment <e> <s> if that is what the noble lord means to do i shall support him <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like very much to welcome the governments attitude in this matter <e> <s> i should like to back up the question of the noble baroness lady nicol what constitutes an international agreement <e> <s> do we have wholly to agree and sign on the dotted line that this is an agreement or will a resolution passed with us agreeing with some points constitute an international agreement <e> <s> i think that this is quite an important point and i should like the ministers reply to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i was in agreement until the noble lord gave his example <e> <s> i personally do not desire to grow a great deal of wild flowers in a pasture <e> <s> normally i sow a pasture in order to provide food for animals <e> <s> in that case i do not look on the wild flowers with a tremendous amount of respect <e> <s> the buttercup is not my favourite food for cows or any other beast <e> <s> while i do not deny that the noble lord has a perfect right to grow every form of wild flower i grow grass for cattle and/or sheep to eat <e> <s> if i want a certain number of herbs it is very sensible to sow herbs in the strip <e> <s> however i would not say that the noble lords example would encourage me to vote for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my senior kinsman has to sit down <e> <s> is not the answer that the most popular tax among farmers which could be raised would be the tax on dogs which has been static for what appears to be centuries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the german deutschmark has been performing relatively better in the rise of the dollar and yet their interest rates are way below ours <e> <s> is this not significant and should the government not be considering what the west germans are doing which we are not doing when they manage to hold interest rates down to a reasonable figure for their industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have followed the arguments and i must say that i appreciate the point of the noble baroness that local authorities play an enormous part in fact the major part in initiating the investigations or the complaints which can arise <e> <s> throughout the consideration of the bill the minister has stressed that he appreciates the part that local government must play and he has stressed today the inevitability of the minister listening to any local authority or any other source that comes forward <e> <s> but we are in this case dealing with a major national emergency and with powers not normally given to a local authority <e> <s> while i accept the importance of local government in any emergency i think that the minister has made his case for rejecting the amendment <e> <s> i feel that he is probably right in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the minister with his usual thoroughness and courtesy has in writing given various reasons for the provision and he has done so again in this house <e> <s> as i understand it the argument against the amendment is that if a mistake is made it is possible to sue the government <e> <s> if the alleged polluter is not the polluter he can sue the government but suing the government takes a great deal of money and is extraordinarily difficult <e> <s> i understand that it requires a minimum of before one can start <e> <s> that is surely most unjust <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask for clarification on his first point <e> <s> did i understand him to say that if an emergency order was made then automatically the person who is alleged to be polluting would be liable <e> <s> that appears to me to be very curious and unjust if the emergency order was subsequently found to be unnecessary <e> <s> however did the minister actually say that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise a question on that <e> <s> if it was a mistake the polluter could not possibly be responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has raised an interesting point <e> <s> it occurs to me to point out that the noble lord the minister perhaps does not have the same belief in the permanence of this government as does the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not particularly want to support the amendment but i should like to ask the minister to think again about this <e> <s> perhaps this might be an appropriate time to discuss the wider question of insurance as well unless the minister would like me to put it off until we discuss the question whether the clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i would simply say that the whole thing needs looking at <e> <s> it is all very well to say that you can insure against loss of profits but it is extremely expensive and extremely complicated as a lot of us know from personal experience <e> <s> if it is not a straightforward case the insurance companies take a tremendous time to look into it <e> <s> there are enough expenses in farming without piling on a whole lot of extra ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that this covers the ability of the minister not only to specify what residues may be left but also if it is found to be necessary to specify what quantities may be applied and to what acreage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too very strongly support these amendments which are enormously important <e> <s> i am sure that the minister far from going away to think about them must find it in his heart simply to accept them because they produce that essential thing a committee which is not simply a tool of the minister but is also a genuine adviser of the minister <e> <s> it not only speaks when it is spoken to but it speaks when concerned or when looking forward in ways which ministers sometimes do not <e> <s> i also think that the composition of the committee is enormously important and must include all the proper aspects of pesticides the environment farming and engineering <e> <s> all these groups must work together to reduce the dangers as the bill is designed to do <e>", "<cs> then my lords we can assume that this time the committee will be able to advise that if it is desired to restrict the amount of residue it might be sensible to restrict the number of applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support the spirit of this amendment and very much admire the complete picture which has been given by the noble baroness in moving it <e> <s> we have talked about this matter before and i have been heartened by the ministers pledge that the government will fulfil all international obligations <e> <s> however that may take rather a long time <e> <s> in my view this country could well take the lead on many occasions <e> <s> the noble lord has said that they have the powers to do so but that again obviously they do not wish to write particular powers into the bill <e> <s> however it would be nice to hear him repeat his pledge that international obligations will be fulfilled <e> <s> it would be even nicer to hear him say that we might take the lead in setting an example to other exporting countries as suggested by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not nearly my bedtime yet so i could give some considerable length to my intervention <e> <s> however out of consideration to your lordships i shall keep it short <e> <s> but i think that what we have done in this bill is to recognise that this is a matter of total concern <e> <s> it is not a party matter and the undoubted blessings brought by the discovery of new chemicals and new pesticides of all sorts bring with them enormous dangers <e> <s> time and again we have seen in the history of the world new discoveries which turn out to have distinct disadvantages when they are pushed too far <e> <s> in this modern world one of the things we must do is to use the knowledge that we have to investigate the ultimate destination of the residues which we put into the soil into animals and into everything else <e> <s> there is a widespread concern among many people around the country backed by figures from responsible charities in the third world <e> <s> they may or may not be accurate but they must be an indication as my noble kinsman has said of the dangers as well as the blessings that can flow from the use of chemicals <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl take account of what the noble baroness behind me has said that these students have not only to run their business end of the catering of the union <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement which is a long and very important one <e> <s> it covers two very important areas <e> <s> milk is certainly extremely important to us <e> <s> wine is certainly important to the community and is one of the products which is very much in surplus and very expensive to support <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate what threshold price is envisaged for compulsory distillation <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the controversy can the noble lord say what advice he is receiving from our high commissions and embassies abroad <e> <s> are they satisfied that the service is being kept up to the standard we require <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord please answer my question <e> <s> are the embassies and high commissions not constantly making representations on this matter <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate <e> <s> i must say that when we hear about the boltons chelsea and so on i think that the minister needs to consider whether offences committed or smart moves made by operators in chelsea and elsewhere should really affect the farmers of wales scotland and other places who are moving at a much slower pace and who are certainly not trying to do down the government in a smart move instead of carrying out developments <e> <s> i think that the trend of these amendments and particularly of amendment no <e> <s> although it mentions residential land argues that the government need to look with great care at all the amendments and indeed at the original bill to see that they do not produce a whole set of circumstances throughout agriculture in particular which would be quite unnecessary and very dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord brabazon of tara too young to remember that the colour red has not always had a political connotation <e> <s> indeed when i was young the colour red on the map represented the british empire <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the earlier less friendly question from his noble friend the noble lord lord orr-ewing can the minister say whether they are sticking to the per cent <e> <s> british orders as promised in the previous debate <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not time that consumers had some protection against consumer protection <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the fact that the most effective method of using the fund is to train and to support training in ancillary devices in agriculture such as irrigation because by following such a course far more will be achieved in the long term than by any form of food aid <e> <s> of course i am not talking about famine aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> i apologise to the house for the fact that perhaps a comma or two is missing but the meaning is perfectly clear <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that although the ministers answer indicates that a certain amount of time will be allowed it will be hardly enough for the scottish agriculture advisory service for example to replace about per cent <e> <s> of its expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will be able to give the house an assurance that the government do not regard these cuts as being necessary or possible now because of the very success which farming in combination with research has had in producing food and indeed surpluses <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that answer and see no necessity to put the many nasty supplementaries i have prepared <e> <s> it is very good news indeed and i thank the noble lord again for his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now somewhat confused <e> <s> as i understood the ministers reply part of the million is now in line with england being funded through the university grants committee to the engineering departments of the scottish universities which produce much sought after graduates <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble lord lord parry was not in full voice <e> <s> i hate to think what he would have done if he had been <e> <s> however he mentioned a vital area on which i was going to touch <e> <s> for part of this debate i should like to go back to originals <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow was the first speaker to raise this <e> <s> i am referring to the fact that the revolution in the production of food in the western world and in certain parts of the developing world is quite astonishing <e> <s> we now can grow the food we need on a very much smaller area than previously <e> <s> the nfu has recognised this and the government have recognised it <e> <s> all the political parties are now producing papers on what we are going to do with the land and what we are going to do in the new situation <e> <s> this new situation was quite obvious to sub-committee d of the ec scrutiny committee seven or eight years ago but apparently was missed by practically everybody else in the countryside <e> <s> we have come to a position where we really cannot stop the surpluses without some price disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not accuse the wholesalers and retailers of making inordinate profits i accused them of having inordinate costs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord comment at the same time on the value of the assistance to the hill ewe and the hill cow <e> <s> has the value in real terms not gone down greatly in the last ten years <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister care to put the figure of million spent on sponsorship of sport against the cost to our hospital service of treating patients <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord ross of marnock i should like to welcome the reading of the statement by the noble lord the minister and to welcome the million <e> <s> like the noble lord lord ross too i have one or two statements to make on the way this has been done <e> <s> i must say i was really rather pleased with the government when they produced the new figures for the assessed rentals <e> <s> i have never seen such indignation among long-time tory party members in the town of forfar <e> <s> it was absolutely delightful <e> <s> they spoke to me in warm terms <e> <s> i thought that in the long term this would do a great deal of good <e> <s> far from the secretary of state having a tremendous amount of foresight he was absolutely shocked by the reaction <e> <s> to pretend that million is being given to help the domestic rate grant in view of the enormous cuts in the block grant as the noble lord lord ross has already said is really if i may use a vulgar phrase coming it a bit <e>", "<cs> my lords lord parry deserves great credit for initiating this debate but he deserves greater credit for the way in which he has expounded the case <e> <s> figures are not normally very amusing but he has battered the front bench with very effective figures one after another all proving an excellent case <e> <s> he diverged a little towards the end when he started to speak about wales but as i shall talk particularly about scotland perhaps he had a right to spend a few minutes so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that scotland did not get its fair share of overseas business and that it must attract such business <e> <s> i did not say that we did not get a fair share of government money <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us whether the government are making any extra money available for research into this important and dangerous disease <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain his appalling phrase that is not a fact at this moment in time <e> <s> does it mean that when agreement is reached germany will in fact be in that position <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the prospect of all sorts of pests coming in by air makes it very much more difficult <e> <s> and is he satisfied that there are enough health inspectors at airports to deal with the conditions resulting from the speed of air travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house and to the noble lord lord stanley for the fact that i was sitting in my room writing and failed to notice the important change of business until this moment but i should like to welcome the bill very warmly because i think it is extremely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that sympathetic reply <e> <s> would she not agree that given the present climate of world opinion and the help being given to ethiopia it is time to renew these appeals and also to ask our allies to do so <e> <s> is it not also a fact that those detained have been charged with no offence apart from being members of the former royal family <e> <s> is it not also a fact that of them are confined in one room <e> <s> among the many problems that exist in the world is it not the case that they deserve our sympathy and our efforts especially as a number of them were educated in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her interest and her sympathetic action <e> <s> perhaps i may urge her to follow the line suggested by my noble friend lord avebury except to confine it to the single objective of getting these unfortunate people released <e>", "<cs> my lords as a supplementary to that answer may i ask the noble minister who decides whether they can be used in that manner <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may on behalf of my leader and chief whip say that i understood that the government chief whip said that one of the necessary things for consultation was to be paid <e> <s> on their behalf i would say that they would be glad to accept this qualification <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to rise to speak after such a self-evident guru but i shall do my best to be fairly practical without perhaps assuming the mantle of greatness that has so obviously fallen upon the noble viscount who has just spoken <e> <s> the fact is that this has been a very interesting debate in which a great number of practical points have been made <e> <s> the debate has also revealed a large degree of agreement on all sides of the house together with a large number of doubts about the conduct of particular things two especially <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to contradict my noble neighbour who knows a great deal about running bus services in angus but it is a little difficult to see how the service can be improved under the bill without enormous expense to the local authority <e> <s> services have been going down and the number of customers has been going down but at least a service has been maintained <e> <s> if under the bill a small operator has a go and he is subsidised he is bound to put in an enormous figure for contingencies if he knows that anyone else can have a go as well perhaps at the best times when he may make a little money <e> <s> i think that total deregulation will make it much more difficult <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister whether concerning norfolk and hereford after competition and tendering had reduced the subsidy thereafter those who were successful in tendering were subject to open competition <e>", "<cs> were they subject to open competition <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies perhaps i may thank the minister for his customarily courteous and generous admission of his mistake <e> <s> may i ask him whether this does not prove in fact that the taking of tenders for subsidised routes is what has saved the money not the open competiton because in effect the county council introduced regulation <e>", "<cs> i must say that talking about miles as being local appears to me to be terribly suburban <e> <s> thirty miles is a mere spit in many parts of scotland and i really think we should consider the country instead of this wholly suburban attitude which appears to have affected the government today <e>", "<cs> the answer is that the noble lord really must believe in private enterprise <e> <s> if there are people to be picked up in the villages in between of course the operator will stop there <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> this argument has been used time and again in this bill <e> <s> i am surprised that the minister will not accept it <e>", "<cs> if i may continue my argument surely once an operator has tendered for the subsidised service everything extra which he can pick up or which can be insisted on by the authority which is putting out the tender would cover the points made <e>", "<cs> my lord i should like first of all to congratulate the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe and others on their successful negotiations with the government to retain a scottish entity <e> <s> the noble lord detailed the position he was in and from a not very strong position his negotiating skills and persuasion have done a very good job with the bill as <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many tractors were imported in the same period <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl because i think it would be helpful to know if the advice given by the treasury counsel is fully cognizant of scots law <e> <s> is there a scottish lawyer <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> the arguments which we heard earlier make it all the more necessary for the house carefully to consider insisting on this amendment <e> <s> we have heard as i understand it and if i am wrong perhaps the lord advocate can correct me that the opinion on who owns the bank which the government obtained after was founded on the <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual my noble kinsman has said much of what i should like to have said for myself <e> <s> i too thank the minister for many of the sentiments he produced when introducing these two orders <e> <s> however what all this shows is that the government along with many other people do not really know what to do <e> <s> if one studies the grants all that has been done is to save money <e> <s> one looks first at the consultative document and sees there a list of items for which national or ec grant can be paid <e> <s> there is a very short list of the former but a very long list of the ec grants <e> <s> this means that the government are reluctant followers of the cap in this matter and that they are in the main doing only what they have to do <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord really mean to tell the house that it is a great opportunity for a young farmer starting to farm in the hills to get grants for environmental projects <e> <s> does he really think that spending such a grant will help the young farmer to have a prosperous future <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinsman has said much that i was going to say and for that i thank him <e> <s> i could not believe when i accepted a late invitation to dinner and said i shall come at that i should not be able to see the end of the debate <e> <s> with the time of night being what it is i apologise to the house but i assure noble lords that i shall read tomorrow what they say and with much greater interest than listening to them today while waiting for my dinner <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness in a position to tell the house how much money has been made available for extra research and to whom it has been made available <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise because i did not have my name on the list of speakers earlier but i feel that we ought to back up my noble friend and the noble baroness who so ably introduced the question because it is of immense importance to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but in the way he is putting it it sounds extraordinary <e> <s> is he saying that the government held a joint review of steel-making with the british steel corporation and that they put forward no view on gartcosh leaving that entirely to the british steel corporation <e> <s> does the noble earl mean that they did not say to the british steel corporation this has enormous implications for employment and everything else <e> <s> is the noble earl trying to tell me that they protested or did not protest or they had nothing to do with it <e> <s> if that is the case then it is a sore dereliction of their duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl again but how is closing the alphasteel mill and then transferring their equipment to somewhere else in wales and closing down gartcosh going to help with the surplus capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords as a layman i should like to ask whether or not the servicemen concerned had a right to be tried at the old bailey by jury or who it was who insisted that they not be tried by court martial <e> <s> was the matter dealt with in that way so that they could have the full benefit of british justice or was it dealt with in that way because a court martial cannot pass severe enough sentences <e> <s> there is concern about the cost of the trial <e> <s> i would be very interested to know why this course was adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to follow my noble kinsman <e> <s> i should like to hear the comments of the noble baroness on the internal divisions in the salmon fishing industry

said we would <e> <s> how much more is the loss than the limits set by all the countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i too will begin by congratulating the noble lord lord mellish on a typical speech <e> <s> it was practical not modest but very much to the point <e> <s> i am certain that we will hear very much more from him <e> <s> i liked his speech <e> <s> the broad grins on the faces of noble lords on the front bench opposite showed that they were paying particular attention to the noble lords praise for private enterprise <e> <s> we on these benches shared in their appreciation of those remarks but i must point out that the noble lord lord mellish was praising co operation between the government and private enterprise in a mixed economy <e> <s> the government may slowly be learning a lesson <e> <s> i noticed that the noble lord lord young is to give an extra few million pounds to the tourist industry to prime the pump which is something he steadfastly refused to do when asked by me in a debate some time ago <e> <s> perhaps the government are improving goodness knows they have plenty of room for improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he totally misunderstood my noble friend lord winstanley when he replied that people should clean their rear lights <e> <s> what he raised was the fact that the rear lights are often so bright particularly in wet conditions that

"<cs> my lords the minister must admit that the whole question has been reopened <e> <s> i said on a previous occasion that it was morally wrong that the investors should be handed the assets of the depositors <e> <s> that view has now been upheld by law <e> <s> what better advice does the minister want than the testing of the law in the courts <e> <s> surely that is the ultimate advice <e> <s> i remember the amused smiles and the patronising grins when i asked whether scottish advice had been taken and was told that i must understand that the treasury had the best possible advice <e> <s> i

practical steps the british government are taking to see that the money given is properly spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating the statement though i cannot say that it is a statement of immense significance bearing in mind the terrific problems that face us in the cap <e> <s> nonetheless it tackles one or two important points <e>", "<cs> my lords does the last paragraph of the statement mean that the council has accepted the proposal by a majority view <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord must share the view of his former colleague that is not enough to live on <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell us whether the cash offer or the prospects from the american side was the deciding factor <e>", "<cs> my lords as the government are paying attention to the cbi will they now pay attention to the very strong demand to reduce the rate of interest which is one of the worst factors in holding back manufacturing employment and exports <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the noble baroness aright that the agreement signed with great flourish simply means that united kingdom companies may tender for work and that the united states will then examine those tenders <e> <s> or does it mean that the united states has an obligation to accept such tenders <e> <s> in other words does the agreement mean anything at all other than that united kingdom companies may tender <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house too long <e> <s> many arguments have been put at fair length to the government and i think that the very able minister on the front bench opposite should sit up and take notice because although no one from the back benches of the conservative party has thought fit to speak on this important subject four extremely influential members of the committee and the chairman are members of the ministers party and are seized as i am sure he is of the importance of this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord

<s> do they also notify the ones who have lost their job in that fortnight <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood the minister he said that because of commercial secrecy he could not disclose who the bidders were for this important public asset <e> <s> is it not in the public interest that this information should be disclosed <e> <s> is he at least prepared to say that any consortium bidding is a wholly british consortium and that there is no foreign interest involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i too thank the minister for repeating the statement which is most welcome and with which of course we all fully agree <e> <s> i was fortunate enough to be a member of the international team of observers at the election <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> as i was by the courage of the national institute for fair elections led by a business man in manila whose life had been threatened and by the courage of many people throughout the philippines who were opposing not like we are in this country merely by words but by their lives the rgime that has just been ended <e> <s> they deserve positive support <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether he considers that the so-called leaders of the unionist parties are leading or are following extreme elements in their parties <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not extraordinary that in spite of all the steps that the minister has so triumphantly delineated the country continues to decline in the export of manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords as with the universities i shall cut my speech according to the time allocated to me <e> <s> my excuse for getting up to speak is not that i am an academic i can assure my noble friend but i held the ancient office of rector in one of the newer universities in scotland the university of dundee <e> <s> as most people will know scotland has a much longer record of wider education than england which i understand for years had only two universities whose names i have forgotten <e> <s> in scotland we now have eight universities and i think that they should remain as universities <e> <s> they should be independent centres <e> <s> they may have to go cap in hand to a ugc committee but whenever one gets <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was not that we should go to the scottish office <e> <s> the scottish office was going to fund the central institutions <e> <s> but i wanted a separate university grants committee for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood from the noble lords previous answer that per cent <e> <s> of the public are using the post code in addressing their letters <e> <s> he said that about centres had mechanical sorting equipment <e> <s> for what percentage of the letters so addressed by the public is the mechanism used <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the money that goes into private forestry does so for one reason only that is the tax advantages offered <e> <s> if the noble lord wants production in the country and money to go into productive industry then it is a great foolishness to sell large tracts of land for large sums of money which are therefore frozen and cannot go into productive industry <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to answer my question <e> <s> would not the million received have been better invested in manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that despite the extreme views expressed on both sides the government think that we have far too many nuclear weapons on both sides and that a serious effort will be made to reduce them and that that would be in the interests of peace <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start with an apology to the house in that i may have to leave before the minister gets up to reply <e> <s> the reason for that is that i organise my affairs according to the order paper and i accepted an invitation to dine <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what he is going to do with carrickfergus castle <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister tell us which description he accepts that of his noble friend of pouring money into an unsuccessful business or his description of the sixth successive year of advance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord soames could tell the house when general motors was made aware of these objections <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that we were unique in europe in having a scheme to provide training for school leavers <e> <s> will he tell the house how many countries in europe have as high a percentage of unemployment as we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply and i am glad to hear that efforts are continuing <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the ladies concerned seven of whom are grand-daughters of the emperor and who never held any political post whatever have been imprisoned for years <e> <s> is the noble baroness further aware that they have to sleep on a damp floor with mattresses only and that at various times their health has suffered severely <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell me when the last representations about the prisoners were made by this government to the ethiopian government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble baroness but can she perhaps respond to my suggestion that we might enlist the help of our eec partners <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he saying that the labour group if they take power in the region next time would reconsider their attitude <e> <s> i understood that they had given a firm commitment that they would not proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful quite honestly that i was able to say that i could not serve on the committee <e> <s> for the days that were spent the whole house should be grateful to the members who sat on the committee and also to the members of the previous committee which also sat for a great deal of time and which visited edinburgh <e> <s> i would not be certain but i understand the committee also sat there <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am a bit <e> <s> it appears to me that the technical evidence in this case was on the side of the promoters <e> <s> it is true that the national trust for scotland and the cockburn association are highly caring <e> <s> they also have deep feelings and a great deal of knowledge but the burden of the evidence has been for the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much the electricity is costing french industry <e> <s> are the french selling electricity to us at a lower price <e> <s> in other words are they dumping electricity here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has called upon me to respond to his quite extraordinary appeal <e> <s> the alliance of course are all for open government <e> <s> the fact is that if we respond to his amendment it means that forever and ever we must await a fresh appeal to the electorate before anything is done <e> <s> the fact is that the three alliance members who are not committed to this to start with have examined this matter with enormous care <e> <s> i do not think that on any single measure more parliamentary time in committee has been spent for many years on examining this <e> <s> they have gone through it with a fine toothcomb for days in both houses committees of examination and i cannot remember how many days they have spent perhaps even more than on the initial measure <e> <s> if we are to await every succeeding election to give the electorate a chance to reverse the decision it appears to me to be absolutely and completely ludicrous <e> <s> i have re-examined the position with the said donald corrie only yesterday and his fellow alliance counsellors <e> <s> they have again produced evidence to me and i am absolutely certain that the decision of this house was correct in the light of the evidence examined and re-examined and i have no hesitation in saying that the correct democratic course is to reject this amendment which i really cannot understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been up and down <e>", "<cs> my lords after many attempts may i put a point to the noble viscount who is a most reasonable and wise man <e> <s> colonel gaddafi heads a small insignificant state and his whole power to cause trouble arises because he is enormously rich with surplus money obtained through his oil wealth <e> <s> this country and the countries of europe are much to blame for this action because we refused the presidents call for economic sanctions <e> <s> in fact the ability of colonel gaddafi to cause trouble springs from his surplus wealth which he uses in this way <e> <s> therefore should not this country and the european nations reconsider their rather greedy response and agree to all-out economic sanctions in order to dry up the source of the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down but i shall not detain the house for long <e> <s> i should like the minister to give us a little more information <e> <s> we have had excellent suggestions put by the noble countess lady mar and agreed with by the noble lord lord gisborough that what we should be doing is trying to put forestry into the hands of the smaller people on the land the people who live there and work on it <e> <s> this is the sort of thing that has been talked about not only in his country but other countries as well <e> <s> certainly we are going to have land to spare <e>", "<cs> my lords following as usual my noble kinsman i find he has said much of what i was going to say including pinching my crack about yew trees that i would have put rather better <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> i must say however that it is all too late <e> <s> the minister has done well in regard to a freeze in common support prices <e> <s> but we are are up against a curious and difficult situation <e> <s> if there had been a freeze five years ago with the farmers of the continent clearly told what we were going to do and what prices were going to be we would not be in the mess that we are today <e> <s> however it is still better late than never <e>", "<cs> as we are discussing the two amendments together i should like to say something about the situation on the first amendment when talking about the second <e> <s> i must say that the minister should be thinking seriously about the governments attitude because people are talking about their experience and their feelings <e> <s> i do not think that anyone is really talking in political terms <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which is certainly in line with similar amendments to which i gave support in the bill <e> <s> again i should like to stress a point regarding the rural areas <e> <s> one of the things that makes a rural area work is the provision of retirement houses for old people <e> <s> certainly in angus the old county council had a very enlightened policy and said simply that if a farm worker had worked all his days for his own house and never cost the community a penny he was entitled to a retirement house <e> <s> they built a lot of retirement houses and those houses are now available for sale <e> <s> in my view it is quite wrong because there is an enormous temptation in a rural area <e> <s> normally the occupants have sons or daughters who are well-off and working in some other area <e> <s> the chance to buy a cheap house for them to use as a holiday home is one which has no good social purpose but which is very nice for the family themselves <e> <s> for that reason alone i think that the minister should accept the modifications to the specifications as to what should be exempt as set out in the amendment <e> <s> although the minister is talking about defence or some other subject with the noble lord i trust and hope that he will understand that my standing here talking is in support of the amendment and will do something about it <e>", "<cs> i accept much of what the minister says but if there are objections to the sale of houses from the local authorities or the landlords whoever they are and one-third are upheld that is a fair number <e> <s> but if that was the case in a rural area it would be fairly serious <e> <s> it would be interesting to have a break-down of the figures if that were possible <e>", "<cs> as i understood the noble lord on the opposition front bench it was not the plainness that he was complaining about it was the logic <e> <s> his argument was perfectly plain to me that if you knocked per cent <e> <s> off flats because they were not selling very well then if you had flats that were selling very well there was no need to knock off the per cent <e> <s> as a simple horse dealer that appears to me to be sensible <e>", "<cs> my heart too bleeds for these poor people who cannot buy their houses like the ministers it has bled frequently tonight <e> <s> but many of these amendments are about the per cent <e> <s> less on flats <e> <s> we are talking in some cases about the feelings of housing associations which have built up such properties and which know they are extremely attractive <e> <s> they may have to dispose of them at per cent <e> <s> less than the price of a house although some of the flats particularly the older stone-built ones when done up are more attractive <e> <s> i think the minister should look at this and at least consider the feelings of the people who do the voluntary work in these housing associations <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee for very long <e> <s> i appreciated the ministers arguments that any new charitable organisation would <e>", "<cs> i shall take the opportunity to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a very late hour far too late an hour to be discussing this extremely important set of amendments but it will be very interesting to hear what the minister has to say <e> <s> we can perhaps get some good sense out of him perhaps even a concession or an acceptance though that might be too much to hope for <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carmichael said these are very important amendments and they have aroused a great deal of heat <e> <s> one can see the situation quite clearly where a person works for a community association and these we reckon have done most good in run-down areas <e> <s> even the remotest relative is not able to apply for a house in spite of the stringent regulations which can be enforced to see that there is no jiggery-pokery <e> <s> this is too much <e> <s> i feel that if it goes through it will do enormous harm to a great many associations <e> <s> if voluntary workers are penalised for doing the work they are doing obviously they will not remain voluntary workers for very long <e> <s> i await with interest what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept his noble friends dictum that the government have a responsibility for monitoring the post office <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us how much money and how many staff are being saved by splitting the mail into two categories <e>", "<cs> my lords does the reply by the minister mean that he rejects all international commodity agreements which are aimed at protecting large numbers of primary producers against excessive movements in the market <e> <s> is it not a fact that the international tin agreement failed because the market was not followed and the prices were kept too high <e> <s> that depressed prices far below what they would have been if the agreement had been managed in a manner appropriate to the market <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is so confident about the agreement with the chinese and so confident that these people will be treated properly when hong kong passes to the chinese government why will he not give those people who went there because it was british who have done extremely well and who are rich and able a fall-back position of a british passport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister then say where these british overseas citizens will be welcome <e> <s> in which countries will they be welcome to live if an unsatisfactory situation develops <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can tell us how the level of <e>", "<cs> my lords when i saw that speakers were on the list to speak my heart sank but i have listened to nearly all of them apart from a short break for lubrication and i have enjoyed and been much impressed by what has been said <e> <s> the debate has shown a real and genuine concern for the whole of the countryside and for the environment in which most of us live and has not been concerned with our personal financial position <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us whether the total amount of aid equals the total amount of loss to the development countries through the fall in commodity prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i must thank the noble lord for his reply but really does he not think that when there is a question a week on the post office and its service to the community or nearly a question a week he may pull me up on that the government might press them to improve the service <e> <s> on my particular question is he aware that our local supermarkets in scotland are able to guess and to know from experience when there will be a crowd and to engage extra people at the check-outs <e> <s> as part of his duty can he not tell the post office to do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is a great deal more to be said about this except that i hope the minister has had second thoughts <e> <s> the case has been put from all parts of the house and put very reasonably <e> <s> we are talking about houses and not about a tremendous amount <e> <s> we are not breaching any principle <e> <s> in fact we are making the principle sounder by providing for exceptions <e> <s> all reasonable people will realise that there are exceptions to every rule and i am sure that the government are much more reasonable than they were a few days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he tell me how a smaller association with one permanent employee can cut its overheads if half of its houses are sold <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also remind the minister that his indignation at our seeking to deprive people of this advantage is really somewhat synthetic as all we are doing is proposing exceptions to the rule <e> <s> the government themselves have already allowed exceptions in the case of the charitable associations and many others where for example there is a contract to live in a house <e> <s> all these are exceptions <e> <s> we are not abrogating the principle but only making sensible exceptions <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and perhaps i may say frankly that i accept that amendment no <e> <s> is probably slightly better than amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but there are arguments on both sides and i think that the prohibition is far too strict <e> <s> it does not apply in the case of local councils that own houses so why should it apply to housing associations <e> <s> i do not really know <e> <s> if anything the committee of a local housing association will be infinitely stricter in examining the claims of relatives than the people employed by a large council <e> <s> the committee will know more about them and i should say that in nearly every case an application will be scrutinised much more closely if it is from a relation of an employee or of a committee member than if there is no such connection <e> <s> that is normally the way it works with a voluntary association <e>", "<cs> i am extremely disappointed in the minister <e> <s> i shall not mince my words <e> <s> it is scandalous when the evidence is clear and following the feeling expressed in the house that he should not promise to consider the arguments and to bring forward an amendment that is technically correct <e> <s> here we have a case in which a local authority has already gone to the house of lords and has taken advantage to appeal when it is obvious to everyone in the house that there is gross overcrowding and that the accommodation is grossly unfit for a family to live in <e> <s> for the minister to say that he wants to test it further shows an insensitivity that i did not think him capable of <e> <s> i shall certainly withdraw the amendment <e> <s> there will i trust be two amendments put forward at third reading <e> <s> certainly there will be one from myself and my noble friends on this side <e> <s> i hope and trust that the government will also have the good sense to put one forward <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the logic of this amendment is inescapable <e> <s> nobody really can foresee the future so far and so clearly as to say that there will not arise a cast-iron case for a charity to deal with a hundred different kinds of needs in housing <e> <s> certainly no charity could possibly embark on their schemes if they knew that these houses would be bought under this act by the tenants after a certain time <e> <s> i think the logic is there <e> <s> the government have given way and when i say they have given way i mean that they have very sensibly taken it up to <e> <s> the charity can be examined with great care and i think it is absolutely logical that you cannot prevent a charity from doing good in the future in the housing field <e>", "<cs> my lords the explanation is a little like the curates egg good in parts <e> <s> i think the minister has had enough of a bashing so i will consider his reply and in the meantime beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister used the phrase reduce its debt with regard to where the profits were going <e> <s> can he tell me to whom this debt is owed and what proportion of the profits go towards this as against capital development <e>", "<cs> my lords does it borrow from the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness for repeating the statement <e> <s> there is not a great deal that one can get out of the second half because it consists mostly of a list of chats which have been had without any conclusion being reached <e> <s> but matters look ominous when it appears that the commission has outlined its plans for a supplementary budget which i assume arises from the surpluses and the disposal of them against american competition bringing down the price <e> <s> perhaps the minister would care to say something about the problems of a new round of gatt talks <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an extremely important debate and the house is fortunate that the noble baroness was lucky in the ballot <e> <s> she has introduced the debate with her usual great competence and the amount of work that she obviously does on these occasions and the excellent way in which she presents it to your lordships house always make me a little ashamed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord expect to get any other advice from a merchant bank other than that privatisation is possible <e> <s> to ask it to give any other form of advice is rather like asking a cow to lay eggs <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house whether the aid which has risen by per cent <e> <s> in the case of the voluntary agencies has resulted in a rise in the gnp of the countries concerned or has it been entirely negatived by the fall in commodity prices <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not accept that any decision by the university grants committee to recommend the closing of universities must solely spring from the cutting of the supply of money by the government and that the ultimate responsibility is the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with his noble friends statement that there is production of wheat and barley which nobody wants <e> <s> is that not an extraordinary exaggeration of the situation <e> <s> can the minister say what percentage of the wheat and barley is unwanted and what this country will do without the percentage which is wanted <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a serious fascinating and informed debate <e> <s> although i have been in hong kong several times that has nothing to do with my views on the matter before us <e> <s> we have heard from probably the two greatest experts in this country on hong kong in the noble lords lord kadoorie and lord maclehose <e> <s> it is significant that neither of them displayed an entirely simple faith in the validity of an agreement backed by law in the case of hong kong <e> <s> the noble lord lord saint brides spoke of planning for the worst <e> <s> perhaps the views of the people of hong kong should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> it is interesting that the noble lord said that it is an opportunity for discussion <e> <s> what he has done is to reject the suggestion wholly and completely <e> <s> to say that the new board must decide for itself and that he has no doubt it will be sensible is to go against all the experience we have had of centralised boards so far if there is no statutory obligation on them to cater for the regions <e> <s> they can of course put up some form of front and centralise even more behind that <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord has treated this in a rather cavalier way <e> <s> he has said that it is up to the new privatised boards to decide for themselves what they will do <e>", "<cs> my lords while i of course welcome the presence of nato forces and americans in this country surely there is a set-off in the money that our forces spend doing a similar job in germany <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl care to expand on his answer to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord assure the house that he will accept the advice of his advisory committee whether it puts the index up or down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the traditional salmon netting round the coast of scotland is under sufficient regulation and that to talk of ending salmon netting there would be a severe blow to the many communities which derive considerable income from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the full explanation he has given us in his letter and in his speech <e> <s> i am glad to see they are tidying up the bill so that it leaves this house in a workable form <e> <s> to me this is a very good sign because if they were going to remove it forthwith they might not have bothered so i am full of hope <e> <s> i think that the amendment limiting the number to is a substantial one i suppose in a way and i can see the force of it <e> <s> any small association if it is going to stay small has its reasons <e> <s> if it is going to grow then it comes into the common position with the other associations <e> <s> i think there are a lot of arguments for fixing a point and leaving it at that <e> <s> that then leaves it to the associations themselves to decide what they are going to do <e> <s> i can see the force of moving in and out of the no-selling area <e> <s> i thank him again for tidying this up <e> <s> i trust that it has the meaning that i have put upon it though he has explained that that is not necessarily so <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not take up much time as the arguments have all been put <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael said one thing which i think is terribly true <e> <s> more and more evidence is coming forward to show that the position is upsetting a great many committees <e> <s> these people are committed because of some personal experience in nearly every case <e> <s> it is grossly unfair that they should be put in a position different from councillors who let many more houses and are not subjected to this restraint <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a fascinating debate <e> <s> i am disappointed that the noble lord the minister did not say that he would look at the matter in another place <e> <s> he has reiterated that the government will monitor what goes on <e> <s> that is not good enough <e> <s> not that i suggest the noble lord means it in this way but monitoring is often a device for doing nothing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord melchett exactly what he means <e> <s> i am all for promoting enjoyment of the countryside but i would have thought that the advice i would get would be where to site car parks when people come to look at the daffodils that i have planted by the roadside through my farm <e> <s> but they would not i imagine give me advice as to how i should advertise that the daffodils were there <e> <s> that would be someody elses duty <e> <s> the advice that adas would give would be how to site the car parks or how to point visitors to the high chairs to see the deer that we have about us <e>", "<cs> i try to practise a mixture of farming <e> <s> certainly i would not burn the straw and regard people who do as evil and i also keep fattened cattle and that sort of thing <e> <s> i think there is rightly a tremendous interest in organic food <e> <s> a lot of the food that we eat is rather dull and certain ways of producing it make it taste better <e> <s> however because there is a big demand for it i should have thought that it would be right and proper for the government to do some research if only to expose what is phoney and to praise what is genuine <e> <s> there is a big demand and people do think in this way <e> <s> the more accidents that occur and the more people become frightened of nuclear power the more they want to go back to nature <e> <s> i think that the government ought to undertake at least to see that the claims can be backed up and are correct in this case <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord cares to look at the records for the north of scotland college he will find that aberdeenshire was farmed in precisely that way for years before the war <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my tuppenceworth <e> <s> i have nothing new to say <e> <s> my noble kinsman for once was talking complete common sense <e> <s> the noble lord lord buxton was eloquent and exposed how ludicrous is the double charge or no-charge charge and the glorious opportunity that this will afford hirers of bluetits for the afternoon <e> <s> the whole idea is quite ludicrous <e> <s> it would be funny if it were not so serious <e> <s> the fact is that the colleges in scotland are suffering a severe drain of very good people <e> <s> some are going out of farming altogether and others are going to commercial firms <e> <s> the commercial firms will be employed by those who do not need them the good farmers on the good farms <e> <s> those who really need them but who cannot afford to pay will not have an advisory service <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us how the services are paid for in denmark and holland <e> <s> is it by contribution or by individual charges for advice <e>", "<cs> i thought that we had discussed this part of the amendment before but there are reasons why the minister might look at it again <e> <s> at the present moment the cereal growers are being polled and they cannot quite understand why they should pay for a food from britain campaign which does not directly affect them <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the majority of those polled will accede to the request <e> <s> they realise that the value of marketing food applies to everyone <e> <s> the cereals that they grow will ultimately be eaten whether they have gone through a pig or some other animal and the campaign will ultimately benefit them <e>", "<cs> there is one curious aspect to this amendment <e> <s> at present the private consultants are competing against a completely free service and doing it apparently very well <e> <s> it appears to be unnecessary to take care of them in the charges if they can compete against the free service <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord confirm that it is not that they will have to pay for information but for the literature <e> <s> i think that is what the noble lord said <e> <s> in other words they will pay the cost of the printing <e>", "<cs> it is a little illogical to say that these charges are to be made because they benefit the farmer <e> <s> surely all the public health regulations are made for the public and not for the farmer at all <e> <s> they are for the protection of the public and therefore it appears more logical that the public should pay <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that perhaps cutting colonel gaddafis cash surplus might be the most effective way of combating terrorism <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has consistently drawn attention to the responsibility of the ugc does she agree that by applying that formula which has resulted in about a per cent <e> <s> cut which is the figure that i have in the allocation to birkbeck college the ugc has made it impossible for it to survive and has passed a death sentence on that worthy college <e> <s> does she agree that perhaps it has made a mistake <e>", "<cs> i was originally very attracted by the thought of simple arbitration <e> <s> i must be a little kinder to the noble lord lord middleton than his noble friends are <e> <s> he has done a tremendous amount of work on this and basically the idea is infinitely preferable to the pages or is it <e> <s> of amendments between the two countries which are difficult to understand though like the curates egg i understand them in part <e>", "<cs> would not the noble lord admit that there must be something curious in that people are willing to pay quite large sums for a quota if they can transfer it <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i cannot take part in the nice chit-chat between former ministers of another place but i should like the minister to explain to me a little further what it is that this amendment achieves <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment would give a percentage advantage to a tenant of poorer ground who had done well by reason of suitable cows good manuring good feeding of concentrates and so on <e> <s> it gives an advantage which i suppose is well worth having if he exceeds the standard figure of litres per hectare which figure can in fact be reduced further if an arbiter says that the land is worth that much less <e> <s> if i have that half right perhaps the minister will give me a nod and i see that he is giving me a nod <e>", "<cs> the calculation appears to be nice and simple and even i can make it <e> <s> the fraction is over plus which is a third <e> <s> the tenant would get one-third and the landlord two-thirds <e> <s> the tenant might regard that as unfair <e> <s> when the tenant goes out the landlord can sell his two-thirds and he can add to his value twice what the tenant gets <e> <s> the tenant would regard that as unfair <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> in the governments amendment paragraph states <e>", "<cs> this is a little complicated but if i can understand it most people should be able to do so <e> <s> the government have brought forward their own extremely complicated amendment which we have just passed that will cause just as much trouble for valuers and arbitrators as that proposed by the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> it is reasonable having failed to get an agreed simple measure that efforts should be made to produce an amendment to bring what we feel to be justice to one party or another <e> <s> this is quite simply what the noble lord lord stanley is trying to do <e> <s> he is trying to up the proportion which goes to the tenant <e>", "<cs> this weeping over the incoming tenant is a little inaccurate to put it mildly <e> <s> to think that the landlord will not extract his full share of the quota value by way of rent or in some other way is absolute nonsense <e> <s> the hard-pressed landlord and we have heard them today will of course do that but the tenant does not need to pay it <e> <s> if he does not want to go into dairying if it is too expensive he will go into something else <e> <s> the argument that we must be fair to the incoming tenant has nothing to do with justice for the tenant who is going out <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister can answer a few questions for me on this matter <e> <s> how is the rental value to be calculated <e> <s> is it to be at the cost of overdraft at the present time on the initial cost of the buildings <e> <s> is it on a valuation of the buildings if he has put up the buildings <e> <s> how is it to be done <e> <s> is depreciation to be taken into account <e> <s> if he can explain that to me i shall be most grateful <e>", "<cs> but how do you calculate the tenants bit <e> <s> i asked whether you calculated it on what he would pay on overdraft interest <e> <s> there does not appear to me to be a method of calculating the value of old buildings which have been put up years previously by the tenant <e> <s> it is a very difficult matter and one on which we need some guidance <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to bother the minister but does he mean that perhaps you would get an arbitrator or arbiter to assess the value of the buildings <e> <s> is it the annual value at which we are looking <e>", "<cs> a step backwards so far as this amendment is concerned <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold up the committee but really we are going back to further complications <e> <s> it was my impression that this amendment and the previous one meant practically the same thing as the amendment of the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> i think i recall that the minister said that the tenant would be compensated for the skilful feeding of concentrates over and above the standard <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord lord stodart of leaston that it is a pity that we should have had the debate entirely on the english half followed by a short speech by the minister on the differences which will be beautifully set out as the scottish office is very good at that between the systems of crofting land tenure and so on <e> <s> i think we can trust the scottish office to do that well enough <e>", "<cs> i should like that too <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord telling me that if buildings have been put up at a cost of and they are years old and are therefore written down the tenants fraction will not improve by one iota because of the buildings although they may be valued today at <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has just completely contradicted what he said before that it will be based on the written-down value <e> <s> but that is sensible i thank him very much <e>", "<cs> my noble kinsman has lived for too long in england <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment but not in quite the same terms as the noble lordlord sandford who seems to think that agriculture is not and has not been the mainstay of the countryside <e> <s> i disagree strongly with that proposition but i agree strongly with the amendment <e> <s> if the government are serious then of course they must take powers to do this in order to support the further extension of agricultural business from the production to the manufacture or the treating of agricultural <e>", "<cs> the ministers argument is particularly weak <e> <s> it is extraordinary that he should put it <e> <s> if the minister thinks that it is desirable and he does not have the money he will not of course do it <e> <s> he could well take it out <e> <s> it is a silly word <e> <s> the minister knows surely that it is a wholly objective decision anyhow <e> <s> the word could come out without any trouble at all <e>", "<cs> the minister will be pleased to hear that i understand him perfectly and agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that what is necessary is that the public should believe what the government say <e> <s> the noble lord used the word reassurance <e> <s> will he give an assurance that instead of trying to reassure the public the government will tell the truth so that the public will know when to be alarmed and when to do something instead of disbelieving the government as so often is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that whatever arrangements they have these transgress the trade descriptions act <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord sainsbury raised a point which the minister has not answered <e> <s> will he say how the per cent <e> <s> which he says is only per cent <e> <s> compares with other industries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how much of this welcome contraction is due to a reduction in the burning of coal <e> <s> can he also say how our measures compare with those of the federal republic of west germany in the number of regulations with regard to the reduction of the sulpur content <e>", "<cs> my lords do our measures to control pollution through smoke go as far those in the federal republic of west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is an extremely disturbing statement what we have found out is that the chernobyl accident has caused more radioactive trouble than did all the years of air testing which we experienced before the cessation of the majority of air tests <e> <s> it is satisfactory that the ministry are doing their best and that they are going to compensate individual farmers but have they got enough people to monitor quickly this sort of thing <e> <s> it appears to me to have been a long time after the rain had fallen before they were able to come up with this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords if i could come back on my question i think the minister may have misunderstood me <e> <s> the accident occurred in late april and the rain brought the pollution over here on nd and rd may <e> <s> we are now having an order put down <e> <s> obviously the government were caught completely by surprise <e> <s> what i intended to ask was this how quickly in the future will the responsible authorities know that a high and dangerous level of radioactive rain has fallen on an area <e> <s> i think that is the important point <e> <s> you can then put an order on at once and monitor the sheep and lambs concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us how successful the campaign has been in reducing total consumption <e> <s> does she have the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords why should not the government pay interest on money they are withholding on a discretionary grant <e>", "<cs> my lords what i mean is this <e> <s> why simply because the payment is discretionary should the government withhold interest from someone they are keeping waiting for money <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how many englishmen there are in the scots guards <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say that when you give someone a power it is not long before he thinks that it is his duty <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are speaking to both amendments i rise to support amendment no <e> <s> but that is no disrespect to the minister and his amendment <e> <s> we are speaking about adas in england but the position is illustrated by the scottish colleges <e> <s> i should like to say with all the seriousness i can muster that any assurance is probably too late <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has been interesting and objections have been put forward to our scheme <e> <s> the minister who is always fair and very thorough has pointed out that there will be difficulties arising from this amendment <e> <s> i accept that that may well be so <e> <s> but let us not beat about the bush <e> <s> what we are doing here is looking at a principle which has been accepted as a principle by the government that we split this uncalled-for bonus between the landlord and the tenant <e> <s> that is accepted <e> <s> we are looking for a starting point <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that in this case the noble earl lord de la warr whom i admire greatly is missing the point just a little <e> <s> it is all very well but if clause is abolished the people who have the quotas now are left with them <e> <s> in spite of what the noble lord lord northbourne said of course the quotas have a value and it is a positive value which has been proven <e> <s> the noble earl has quoted case after case and of that i have no doubt whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard this amendment with the deepest suspicion <e> <s> i really cannot understand what it has to do with hectares of land <e> <s> i note the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment and the idea behind it <e> <s> we are now at the stage when the government have won the day with regard to the appalling complexity of this appalling bill and the appalling circumstances of having to accept quotas <e> <s> we are now at a stage where they have rejected the noble lord lord middleton they have rejected the noble earl lord de la warr and they have rejected me much more naturally i may say <e> <s> we are now stuck with this appalling bill <e> <s> what we must do now is to look at the fairness of it <e> <s> all right we had a great deal of self-interest displayed on all sides and we have rejected / <e> <s> we must look at this in the light of the figures i produced in an earlier amendment and see what it is going to do to the harmony of our industry <e> <s> it is for this reason that we must look at the detail and that is what we are doing of this complex and awful bill <e> <s> but we are stuck with it we have to improve it and i think this would be an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is eminently sensible <e> <s> i shall be astonished if the minister manages to make a case against it <e> <s> it is natural justice where an agreement of which he does not know has been made concerning a mans land that both parties should be responsible for informing him <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he explain the great difficulty <e> <s> does he mean that the tenant would have several landlords <e> <s> i should have thought it perfectly simple if you know the tenant to find the landlord <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the swan population is rising as a result of the measure or is it still falling <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount say why the release of staff from i suppose office duties results only in police for other duties <e>", "<cs> my lords as an anti-fouling paint must automatically be bad for the marine life that it is meant to keep off the bottom of boats is there one that can be applied which does the job and is not bad for other marine life <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that he is spending enough on trunk road crossing places <e> <s> on a double track trunk road in the county of angus a number of people have been killed and there have been far too many accidents involving people crossing the double track because there is not enough space <e> <s> does he not think that perhaps more roundabouts are indicated for these crossing places on trunk roads <e> <s> i am not talking about motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us which are the other factors which enable the chancellor to ignore the extraordinary variation in this rate <e>", "<cs> i think the point that has been brought up is an extremely important one not for many of the reasons so far adduced on the other side of the committee though they are also good reasons but because the law is completely out of date <e>", "<cs> does the noble and learned lord mean that if a procession of caravans approaches and enters a field the farmer has to get a civil injunction to get it out and there should be no criminal law which enables him to stop it <e> <s> how long would that procedure take if for example a convoy of vehicles entered a field of wheat <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate as a scotsman to say anything to the noble and learned lord on this matter <e> <s> did i understand him to say however that while he had had several dignified protests from distinguished people there had been no riot and therefore that he could ignore what had been said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am simply wondering whether the scottish minister thought that one-fifth of per cent <e> <s> was enough of a difference for all these hundreds of miles further north <e>", "<cs> my lords a great deal of ingenuity has been employed in playing with the figures <e> <s> i accept that you might have a case where the tenant gets the lot <e> <s> he cannot of course get per cent <e> <s> the noble lord lord middleton would without doubt agree with me that you cannot get that amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with all that my noble kinsman has said <e> <s> i do not know whether either minister read the article in the financial times this morning by that distinguished and experienced agricultural journalist and practical farmer john cherington <e> <s> he used a most significant phrase <e> <s> he spoke about consulting the remnants of the advisory service <e> <s> that is a throw-away line <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the success of raising money for food from britain will the minister reconsider the method of financing the advisory service and perhaps put it on a levy basis <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether this is a conservative council <e>", "<cs> does that mean that everyone who has a cottage and lets it occasionally is in business <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the way in which to keep down the rumours and to allay anxiety is to provide immediate and full information about any incidents minor or otherwise that occur <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give us some instances where the private breeders and there are plenty in this country have come near the record of the plant breeding institute in the production of new wheats new potatoes and other plants <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether if the plant breeding institute is sold to a chemical firm which is one of the possibilities he thinks that they will be absolutely impartial in the selection of disease-free wheats or perhaps whether they might be biased in favour of those which respond to chemicals <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that all the aid she has mentioned is in the form of grant and none is in the form of loans which seem to be wholly counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that with the decline in the labour force in agriculture and the need to take land out of agriculture there will have to be a change in the attitude of local planning authorities towards people who want to live and work in the countryside <e> <s> are the government doing anything about this in order that we can maintain the population of the countryside which is really the most important attribute that it has <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are as keen as they say they are on houses to rent will the minister say why they are forcing the scottish housing associations against their will to sell their houses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although he said new technology should be encouraged by other means there is nothing more infuriating and nothing that will hold back development more than high rating of new projects by pioneers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the examination for parole includes a medical examination of the patients mental state <e> <s> it appears that this man was not a criminal but rather a sick man <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that many of the customers of the scottish libraries may not want to read these english newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the processors in the food industry are a great deal more able to bear any liability than the poor primary producer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his reply <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lord is showing sufficient concern over this matter <e> <s> it is very disturbing indeed that with one breakdown or one overloading of a computer programme we had a stoppage of flights certainly from scotland <e> <s> the noble lord did not answer my question as to how many flights were cancelled or delayed <e> <s> this has immense implications <e> <s> surely there must be a backup system <e> <s> furthermore it has implications for our defence <e> <s> if one computer breakdown can result in this sort of delay surely the government must take that very seriously and look into all forms of backup and indeed a reorganisation of the whole affair <e>", "<cs> my lords would the situation have been quite so easy if the breakdown had occurred when the heavy overnight traffic was coming in an hour earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that to burn straw is a thoroughly bad farming practice and that farmers who use the monoculture method would have no disease problems if they returned to the system of rotation of crops <e>", "<cs> my lords if the object is to catch the fraudsters the noble lords questionnaire will be quite useless <e> <s> that is because the fraudsters are extremely good at it and they will romp through the questionnaire with a smile on their face whereas the innocent and the inadequate who are generally worried about it will fill it in with great foreboding <e> <s> but the noble lord will not catch one single fraudster with the questionnaire <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness confirm that mrs currie is going to be put in charge of this programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and he deserves great credit for his achievements in the past because he was certainly the gynaecologist who delivered the board and gave birth to it <e> <s> however <e> <s> i think i can claim that the scottish liberal party was in at the conception which is normally the better part of the procedure <e> <s> i remember also that we had published very good booklets and had done a great deal of work <e> <s> the most the labour party could do at that time before the election was to rush out a little sheet of black and white paper copying our vital statistics <e> <s> however we were very glad of it and very grateful to mr ross as he then was for delivering the baby which we happily thought we had conceived <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on the admirable way in which he gave that appalling answer <e> <s> may i say in the light of the previous question that the antics which have been seen all around in trying to pay off this debt are quite extraordinary and most undignified <e> <s> there was the appeal to a japanese philanthropist and all sorts of other manoeuvres <e> <s> however everyone appreciates i am coming to it <e> <s> does the minister realise that it is quite obvious to the ordinary citizen that the failure of the government and the prime minister to convince our commonwealth partners that we dislike apartheid was the main reason for the departure from the games of so many countries which did such enormous harm <e> <s> surely the government must accept responsibility for that <e> <s> does he agree that they should pay at least a part of the debt <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not feel happier if the government had contributed even a little <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what the informal responses have been <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord bonham-carter on his maiden speech and i assure him that his next speech will be followed with immense interest if not with the same amount of acquiescence <e>", "<cs> my lords i see <e> <s> the reform of the cap is enormously important and i know that obviously the government play only a part although it is a very important part particularly during our presidency in the reform which is so badly needed <e> <s> if the advice of the ec committee of this house had been followed seven years ago then it is possible that a gradual policy might have worked <e> <s> however we are now in an incredible situation <e> <s> perhaps i may give a

brian gardner it could rise by another billion per annum <e> <s> there is an urgent need to do something <e> <s> even if vat goes up from to per cent <e> <s> of our contribution it still will not be enough to handle the increase in surpluses which we have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord define a small shareholder and as he has the figures can he give us a figure for the number of small shareholders and then tell us what proportion of the total number of shares they own and whether that proportion has risen since <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness care to say what alternative measures assuming that the government disapprove of apartheid they think the world and the british government should take apart from sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although the regulations in this country make for a greater degree of safety than elsewhere an accident anywhere can affect this country and has done <e> <s> does he agree therefore that the international agency should have powers of inspection and of specification <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether she has considered paying an attendance allowance to the pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us what standards of verification the government would require before we can take this very desirable step of banning tests <e>", "<cs> my lords returning to the western isles does the minister not agree that a far lower proportion of the population of the western isles is housed by local authorities than is the case in brent haringey and other such places <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that there is a great difference between food aid and famine aid and that food aid wrongly applied can destroy agriculture and the social structure in many of the countries to which it may be sent <e>", "<cs> my lords did i understand the noble lord to say that the result of this tremendous efficiency and success was to be a billion deficit in

explanation <e> <s> i did not properly follow the answer given to the noble lord lord carmichael when he brought up the point of properties changing use <e> <s> i know of a beautiful house in angus that was turned into a hen house <e> <s> it is true <e> <s> it was filled with battery hens <e> <s> certainly that was a change of use <e> <s> if it is to be put to a certain amount of expense the local authority obviously will not in view of the general shortage of money particularly under the present government keep a register for its own edification <e>", "<cs> i am speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> other members of the committee may speak to other amendments <e> <s> i think we all accept the grouping <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for being approximately seconds late for a start that was seconds early <e>", "<cs> i also need clarification <e> <s> it appears to me that this would open up the road to further great difficulties for the assessor and would lead to extraordinary occasions of people ringing up the <e>", "<cs> with that assurance and in the glorious knowledge that the minister is reasonable i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that sounds very good news from the minister <e> <s> do i understand him correctly to say that if a local authority gives a club relief from rating the government will make that up in their general grant to the council <e> <s> is that the subject of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to hold up my colleague but i think that the noble lord lord morton of shuna said an important thing here on which the government would do well to ponder <e> <s> he said that we should look at it from the point of view of revenue received which brings us back to the point that we have been pushing all along that if one bases it on profits one can be fair but if one bases it solely on rating the premises because they have a licence one can get into all kinds of anomalies <e> <s> if one bases it on the revenue received or the profit one can tax it fairly <e> <s> that is a point that the government should look at <e>", "<cs> i do not think the minister needs to think again at all this puts it absolutely perfectly <e> <s> if the noble lord lord burton has given his house to the national trust and if he lives in it he should pay the community charge <e> <s> it is perfectly simple <e> <s> the house itself and the national trust should be exempt from paying rates <e> <s> i presume that at the moment he lives in it and the national trust pays the rates <e> <s> it is much fairer that he should pay the community charge <e> <s> it is a very good amendment it is clear and concise <e> <s> it does what we all want namely to exempt the national trust from paying rates <e> <s> the noble lord should accept it <e>", "<cs> the invitation to leave out subsection is so wide as to mean practically anything <e> <s> we put down the amendment to give the minister a chance to explain what will happen in the case of caravans which may be occupied during the summer but may for many reasons situation and so on be totally unfit for occupation during the winter <e> <s> if they are rated as domestic subjects tremendous problems of trying to assess who is going to pay the community charge are raised <e> <s> it is another case of the great value of assessing local taxation on the income raised <e> <s> if a caravan site has a good many caravans that are used in the summer then it is a commercial subject and it could be rated quite happily by means of local taxation of the profit made <e> <s> like the noble lord lord carmichael i shall be interested to hear what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> with that assurance given to the noble lord lord carmichael i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i look forward to hearing from the minister on this <e> <s> it really is a little too much simply to say that certain things shall apply subject to such modification as he shall think of <e> <s> that appears to me to be wholly and completely illogical and to carry prescription a little too far <e> <s> we await with interest to see whether or not the minister is a reasonable man <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will be able to reassure us that this makes it quite clear that those people who provide their own water and sewerage will not have to pay these rates <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may well be jealous of the crofters around him <e> <s> however he must realise that the minister has something to answer on this in that all the regulations and laws on abatements of rates were laid down for extremely good reasons <e> <s> even if there are amendments down later on the marshalled list i doubt whether the minister will undertake to consider them sympathetically at this stage <e> <s> but the government have something to answer for sweeping away in this bill a whole lot of abatements of rates and help for people in straitened circumstances <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should answer the noble lord before the minister speaks <e> <s> it is true that there will be delay but if the government are anxious to bring in the bill then they can speed up the process considerably <e> <s> it works both ways <e> <s> the association of scottish chambers of commerce another body says quite straightforwardly <e>", "<cs> the government originally said that they wanted after the bill was in operation to delay the putting into practice of the community charge by three years and they have just brought that forward <e> <s> perhaps they could bring forward the revaluations at the same speed <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments of the minister <e> <s> he is absolutely right in saying that if this amendment were passed it would put the government on the spot <e> <s> they need to do something about it <e> <s> they already have certain rate-capping powers to stop local authorities going wild altogether <e> <s> it would be up to the government if we are left with an illogical position to put it right <e> <s> the whole trend of the ministers argument that we are moving towards harmonising valuation makes me think that we should vote on this amendment <e> <s> it is extremely important <e> <s> the high valuations the ridiculous valuations in scotland are a matter of great concern to both the business community and the domestic community <e> <s> i think that we should test the feeling of the committee <e>", "<cs> i shall save the time of the committee the minister need not look so pale <e>", "<cs> is it appropriate for me to raise the question of consultation with <e>", "<cs> they are not my fears <e> <s> they are the fears of the cbi <e> <s> it quoted strathclyde which it said had announced unofficially the rate about which a decision had been taken by the caucus but not by the council and the consultations thereafter were purely formal <e> <s> but no doubt the cbi will read the ministers assurance and feel better <e>", "<cs> i understood the minister to say that these would be lumped together in a single order but now he says that there would be different orders <e> <s> can he clarify that <e>", "<cs> as our amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with these amendments i should like to say that it is very unjust to take the retail price index when it is not the main cost <e> <s> i simply repeat that argument <e> <s> while industry and non-domestic ratepayers deserve a maximum of protection that should not be based on the retail price index <e> <s> if the minister can come forward with a better solution i should like to hear it <e> <s> however it seems totally unjust to base the measure in that way when the majority of <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> all history has shown that the conservative government have consistently tried to keep the rise in production costs particularly wages in line with inflation <e> <s> however they have failed and the rise in wages and salaries has always been above inflation <e> <s> automatically one can expect that in the future there will be increased costs above the rpi on the local authorities <e> <s> it is now perfectly all right since the noble lord has said quite clearly in answer to the noble earl lord perth that the government will bear this increase in the form of an increased rate support grant <e> <s> i thank him very much for that concession <e>", "<cs> surely the minister must admit that it will be a poll tax because a number of people will prefer not to register to avoid the community tax <e> <s> that would turn it into a poll tax <e> <s> i have no doubt that a number of people will infinitely prefer to remain anonymous outwith the system and off the electoral register which would make the charge a poll tax <e>", "<cs> i must defend myself against the noble lord lord ross of marnock who may have been co-operating happily up till now when he inferred that i did not understand that a poll meant a headage <e> <s> everyone knows that a black poll cow is an aberdeen angus cow and that poll means without horns <e> <s> that is another interpretation <e> <s> it is perfectly true that the way in which the government are going about it and the way in which it will operate makes it perfectly possible for people to think that it is a poll tax in this respect that if one does not want to pay one cannot get a vote <e> <s> there is no doubt about that <e> <s> therefore people will be quite right to misunderstand the meaning of the word because if one does not wish to pay the tax one can avoid it by not being on the electoral register <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord morton of shuna has put his finger on the point <e> <s> but he has been a little unkind since i think the minister was giving a hostage to fortune when he said that it would be taken into account <e> <s> i know that one can vary it very greatly but i think that if it is to be taken into account it should be put into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the british arrangements in the isle of man allow a relaxation of standards <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister for clarification <e> <s> as i understand the grouping we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> to and <e> <s> is the discussion on all those amendments taking place under the amendment of the noble earl lord perth <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> widens the definition of student to others under full-time training and amendment no <e> <s> adds these people to the exceptions from the community charge <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> which rests on the arguments so ably advanced by the noble lord lord kirkhill on the responsibility put on people staying in these establishments because it puts no accountability on them whatever <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene and make the point in answer that of course i agree that my amendment would be a nightmare for the assessor and the registration officer <e> <s> but the bill is transferring the nightmare to the poor lodging-house keeper <e> <s> i am against the concept of course but i was <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us an example of this sort of person which would help to clear my mind <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the minister that he could get the colonel to make a collective charge on his troops who are required to live in scotland <e>", "<cs> it is more logical to call it a property charge <e> <s> i do not mind one way or the other i suppose <e> <s> however it would be highly illogical and certainly would not meet the great question of accountability unless the government were to reintroduce a second vote for a second house in which case i suppose there would be some logic in it <e> <s> otherwise it is simply a straightforward property tax much reduced i must say in many cases and not a community charge at all <e>", "<cs> i feel we are due an explanation and some examples from the minister <e> <s> perhaps he could tell me because i am a little puzzled what will happen to people who own time shares in houses <e> <s> considerably more might be collected if the residents had to pay a standard community charge for each fortnight which they owned <e> <s> they are considered to be proprietors <e> <s> i would be very interested to hear what the noble lord has to say about them <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will clarify a point <e> <s> i thought that the remarks of his noble friends related to taking more than three months to repair a house <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna was referring to trying to sell a house when the owners had to move away in order to look for another job and because the house was not sold the owner became liable to the charge after three months <e> <s> that is the point that the committee is trying to get over to the minister <e>", "<cs> can the minister deal with the poor devil who has to move from aberdeen and cannot sell his house in a three-month period <e> <s> would prescription apply in that case if he could not sell it for nine months which must be quite common <e>", "<cs> if he cannot sell the house although he is paying for two houses is down in the south of england and has a job there after three months apparently it becomes a second home and there is a community charge upon it <e> <s> that appears to some of the ministers noble friends and to me unfair <e>", "<cs> this has been an extraordinarily good debate <e> <s> the minister has been extremely reasonable <e> <s> he has been convinced of the correctness of many of the points made <e> <s> a man of his intelligence could not have failed to be so convinced <e> <s> however i must oppose the clause as a whole for a very simple reason <e> <s> all round this chamber people have said at second reading and at other times that they would be better off themselves with the community charge <e> <s> today one of my noble friends told me that with a house in london and a house in the country when this bill applies to england he will be a great deal better off by several thousand pounds <e>", "<cs> in that case i shall rise <e> <s> i shall speak to the group mentioned by my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i shall not repeat it <e> <s> i would not object to this tax if it were called a tax <e> <s> it is a sales tax <e> <s> i am sorry to pain the minister but it is extraordinarily annoying to call it a community charge <e> <s> it is probably true that transient people passing through an area taking advantage of services should pay tax but this is a straight sales tax levied on boarding-house keepers and others who have transient people staying with them and from whom they make a living <e> <s> it has nothing to do with accountability which is the bills great central theme <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord clear my mind <e> <s> does he mean that there will be a fixed charge on the establishment based on the capacity of the establishment or that he would calculate on the numbers there <e> <s> i have not been sure on this point <e>", "<cs> in this case i have a certain sympathy with the minister <e> <s> if the floater or drifter goes along and does not have his little bit of paper he <e>", "<cs> i am sure that this is right <e> <s> oscar wilde as members of the committee will know said that a woman who would reveal her age would reveal anything <e>", "<cs> i thought that it was only horses that one identified by their teeth <e> <s> it is ludicrous to think that people should be identified by their age <e> <s> one can have three john macdonalds in the same village all of the same age <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord ross of marnock has a point here <e>", "<cs> i gather from the result of my probe that it will either be in documentary form or on the computer <e> <s> i trust that people will know how to extract the information from the computer <e> <s> i presume it will be in documentary form when the printout is produced <e> <s> with that comment i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will study the point <e> <s> the very fact that the wording is included in the bill will encourage the registration officer not to consult the person involved <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross has said it may mean a back-payment of an enormous amount of money and i think that the word not should come out and it should be an obligation to consult the person before an amendment is made which may seriously affect him <e> <s> i trust that the minister will consider the matter seriously <e>", "<cs> there are other aspects of the holy trinity which we want to discuss on the amendment down in my name <e> <s> i refer to the question of the voter trying to keep himself off the register to avoid paying the personal community charge <e> <s> it must <e>", "<cs> that raises unpleasant factors in our society <e> <s> the assessor or whatever one may call him has three jobs and obviously has access to information <e> <s> i think it is clear that some people will try to avoid the charge and from that arises the question of people passing information in other words people informing on neighbours who they think are getting away with not paying the charge <e>", "<cs> i think that the government have tried to cover it <e> <s> however the unease in my mind arises from the phrase that the minister just used more intensive registration procedures <e> <s> it is that which brings fear into the minds of many people <e> <s> however i shall study what the minister said and come back on report <e>", "<cs> the next amendment makes much the same point <e> <s> it appears that with the possibility of imposing a fine of and then for a second offence it is putting too much on the registration officer to be able to designate someone who is neither an owner nor a tenant for months <e> <s> it is very difficult to see who is going to designate the responsible person <e> <s> it gives the registration officer far too great a power <e> <s> it would be most unfortunate for a student in a house which is occupied by students to be designated and made the responsible person <e> <s> what disturbs people is that the registration officer can make someone responsible who is neither the owner nor a responsible tenant <e> <s> perhaps in such a case the house <e>", "<cs> it may help the noble earl if i quote line on the same page which states <e>", "<cs> it appears that this subject has been well ventilated <e> <s> the difficulties appear to be legion <e> <s> i think that the minister should look at the matter again <e> <s> it must be grossly unfair that a county official can designate someone in a flat to take the responsibility <e> <s> that is not the way one normally chooses leaders <e> <s> it is a different matter altogether to have the initial designation of a tenant for months <e> <s> i know that there is an appeal and that is something <e> <s> however it is enormously clumsy to choose someone and force that person to go to appeal <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will look again at this matter <e>", "<cs> it is quite obvious that the format of the bill is wrong <e> <s> principles have been breached as is agreed on all sides of the committee <e> <s> i suppose that we might lose sight of the principle because a bad principle can lead to a bad format and the confusion caused by this bill could easily achieve that <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the governments actions are based on what the authority in east lothian and the lothians is doing this year under the present system and that they give no credit at all to the new accountability <e> <s> to use the arguments of the present day about the future appears to me to be confusing <e> <s> there is a difference in principle between the two matters <e> <s> for the government to put in the <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord is saying is that a fairer approach would be the invidious one of assessing personal income and allowing people a rebate which entails the dreaded means test <e> <s> a means test can be useful but that was not the case i was putting <e> <s> i must say to the noble baroness from the lands of angus that the crofts of the shetlands the crofts of the western isles and the crofts of argyll a county of some importance to the conservative party are very different from the size of the farms in the glens of angus and certainly from those in the borders of scotland where the holdings in the hills are infinitely bigger than the crofts in the highlands crofting counties <e> <s> they are a special category and have been so considered for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i failed to follow the argument put forward by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> his last remark revealed the flaw <e> <s> the people of scotland do not regard the bill as a benefit <e> <s> we believe that they are right <e> <s> all the evidence taken in polls and by people asking questions shows that neither the local authorities nor the people of scotland think that the bill is anything but bad <e> <s> the amendment seeks to put that to the test with the majority of the people in england and wales <e> <s> we do not see why they should not suffer along with scotland <e> <s> instead of having the bill imposed on scotland alone why did not the government try it out on the whole of the people of britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to reinforce this argument and hope that the minister will accept it <e> <s> it is perfectly straightforward <e> <s> if he is secretary of state and he is ready he can proceed with it <e> <s> if a member of some other party is secretary of state that person may wish to postpone implementation for somewhat longer <e> <s> however the amendment is perfectly reasonable and it is a safeguard that the minister should accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i also return to the amendment <e> <s> i should first reassure the noble viscount that people who pay income tax already reveal their income to the inland revenue so there is no difficulty about that at all <e> <s> there is enormous difficulty about assessing who will pay the community charges reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> there will certainly need to be a tremendous amount of probing <e>", "<cs> my lords the layfield report studied this point in some detail and came to a conclusion different from that of the noble lord who is entitled to his conclusions as well <e> <s> looking at it from outside it appears to me that the layfield argument is stronger <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to do that <e> <s> what does the noble lord think i am on my feet for <e> <s> he must understand these matters <e> <s> i am here to put that to the government and to find out what they will say about it <e> <s> i shall tell the house exactly what the paper says <e> <s> it says with great good sense that what is wrong with local government taxation under the present system is that it concentrates all payment on one source <e> <s> the property tax is the one that carries all local government money-raising on its back <e> <s> it says that that is what is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord would agree that whatever discussions took place within the caucus of the tory party in parliamentary government these matters should be discussed openly in parliament <e> <s> i must say that up until now no attempt has been made in parliament at least in this house to discuss the ideas put forward in the paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not detain the house but i should like to support this sensible move <e> <s> i think that the minister should support it <e> <s> he has gone back to the idea of a poll tax <e> <s> if he would like to go back to the domesday book he will find that even then records were kept <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down perhaps i may ask a simple question <e> <s> has he any suggestions to make which would overcome the undoubted difficulty in which the trust would be placed by many of the subjects <e> <s> i can think of one in particular which is the laidhay museum in caithness where the croft house is fitted up as he said and classed as a museum <e> <s> what remission of rates or rating can it hope for <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask for clarification <e> <s> as i understand it non-residential parts of national trust and other properties will now be subject to non-domestic rates with no remission of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask him whether if paragraph b is left as it is that would enable him if he were sympathetic to the national trust to prescribe national trust properties which he felt were deserving of aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for troubling the minister <e> <s> perhaps he can tell us what would happen if a husband and i understand that the husband is responsible as the head of the house six months through the period beats up his wife and she leaves but he is responsible for her community charge during the six months that she had been with him <e> <s> she then moves into a hostel and stays there for two months and a collective charge a collective sum is recovered from her by the hostel <e> <s> then for a further four months she has a refuge a home to which she removes her children <e> <s> surely that will give rise to unbelievable complexities <e> <s> the husband as head of the house is responsible for the personal charge while she is with him <e> <s> she is then in a hostel for two months and a collective charge is made <e> <s> she then moves into a home of her own with her children <e> <s> it will he enormously difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness tell us how many scientists have departed this country in the last year <e> <s> also would she not try to agree that the reason they depart is not their personal incomes but the fact that programmes in which they are vitally interested are being cut <e> <s> is it not the case that without an automatic rise these programmes must be cut <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness answer the question on the numbers who have left this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness can then tell us what benefits flow back to this country from the united states from the drain of scientific workers <e>", "<cs> my lords while we welcome the news that the noble lord has given obviously it is very gratifying to know that the number of shareholders is rising can he say how we compare with our competitors and friends in the united states and west germany in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is the answer he should have given in the first place instead of trying to pretend that the government fully support these proposals <e> <s> they have a perfect right to criticise proposals which they consider are extravagant but the minister has no right to pretend that that is not what they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the best argument put forward by the noble lord lord ross was the simple one that every single charge and increased charge will be piled on to the community charge or personal poll tax <e> <s> the fundamental objection that we have and that the tory reform group has was the piling on of every single item on to the personal charge <e> <s> our other main objection that the poor pay more and the rich pay less will be compounded as time goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should say that it is a spurious <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble skilful and knowledgeable lord lord henderson of brompton for setting down the fact that the amendment is within the scope of matters which the house should discuss <e> <s> i think that with common sense backed up by precedent the house must discuss matters arising from a bill which will result in a good deal of hardship to a considerable number of people <e> <s> i think the noble lord said that per cent <e> <s> live in tied houses certainly a very large number of the more skilful men do <e> <s> it appears to me extraordinary that a tax concession is allowed because a man has the disadvantage of living in a tied house on one system of tax but that such a concession on another system cannot be allowed <e> <s> that does not appear to me to be logical but then much of what the inland revenue does is not logical <e>", "<cs> my lords we must all be very grateful to the minister for thinking again and for reducing the charge on overseas students <e> <s> i thought that he was perhaps less than gracious when he said that the concerns to which he was reacting were only expressed from the cross-benches and by his noble friends <e> <s> i remind him that we on this side of the house were deeply concerned as well <e> <s> indeed we offered our advice <e> <s> but we must concede the form that advice can <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether i heard him aright and that the categories i mentioned other than full-time students at recognised colleges could apply for exemption and for the lower rate of poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an entirely new facet of the whole student question and one which we should certainly require to examine very carefully before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister perhaps thinking of some property developer who may come into an area and find it useful to inspect the register to see what sort of people he was coping with <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like the discussion to finish merely on the point of where the provisions should be without saying that in committee i pointed out the illogicality of the schedule itself in that as i understand it the whole point of the bill is to get rid of rates and put in a system which will restore responsibility to local authorities <e> <s> we have the whole bill for that and then there is this important point of principle that the government have contingency plans in case the bill does not work <e> <s> contingency planning is probably right because the bill is such a mess that it will not work <e> <s> i wanted to point out that many of the points contained in the schedule are objectionable in themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords why <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the minister that the government have a year of their time to run <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never seen a noble lord more definitely sit down than did the noble lord lord morton of shuna with the phrase that he used <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord turns to that point i think he said that paying the minimum contribution of per cent <e> <s> for people on income support would have no effect on their overall disposable income <e> <s> is that what he said <e>", "<cs> i shall forgive the noble lord but i shall not give way <e> <s> there will be an opportunity later on <e> <s> in bringing forward the amendment i think that it is enormously important that the government should do something about the matter <e> <s> it is all very well to say that there will be individual chances to apply for rebates <e> <s> but this is an extraordinary burden when there is a simple answer and the simple answer is to give the same sort of remission that the crofting counties had before <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord grimond has encapsulated the whole case <e> <s> the minister of course does not look with sympathy on the study carried out by the highland regional council but nevertheless he cannot gainsay the facts <e> <s> the fact is that one is taking money out of an area which is still one of the poorest in britain and one which successive governments have tried to help for that reason and because of its importance for the preservation of a way of life and of a countryside which is valuable to the whole of the rest of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as is usual the noble lord lord middleton has said all that i was going to say said it rather better and illustrated it enormously well <e> <s> but i think i must follow along the same line <e> <s> what has happened in the commission this year which is what we are reporting on is that it has begun to think about how it will tackle first of all the money probem financing the cap and it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that the government can do nothing about persistent pools of unemployment <e> <s> is not that contradicted by the experience of the highlands and islands development board and other government-sponsored bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i received a number of very touching letters after the last occasion this matter was discussed in the house which included cheques from pensioners who remembered with great gratitude what lord dowding had done for them years ago <e> <s> in view of the feeling expressed and the ministers own very co-operative attitude will he not approach his right honourable friend in order to make an exception at least to maintain the statue if the erection is paid for by public subscription <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the whole thing is becoming a farce <e> <s> would he care to tell me why the government have taken out writs for contempt of court against three centre-view newspapers the <e>", "<cs> my lords the speech of the noble lord lord renton has fallen short of his normal logic <e> <s> this amendment is the most helpful to the government that the noble lord lord ross of marnock has ever proposed <e> <s> there is no shadow of doubt that this is an appalling bill <e> <s> even the prime minister has taken to calling it a poll tax <e> <s> that must on her part represent a certain retreat from the glorious community charge which we have been assured is a splendid thing which the people of scotland are <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the amendments were worked off the bill as it was amended at committee stage and not on report <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that some very severe measures to contain agricultural spending have been proposed by the commission <e> <s> i understand that some of them have been accepted <e> <s> it is very difficult for us to judge whether the prime minister is absolutely right in what she says and that the other foolish profligate fellows who are throwing about their citizens money are wrong without knowing which of these agricultural measures have been taken <e> <s> if they are proposing to make some of the cuts certainly that will save a great deal of money <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that another record crop for

encourage the industry through the stiff times which are bound to come with the expansion of production <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can tell us what is the situation in scotland

statement <e> <s> it is extraordinary that the issue arose because the headmaster of the school referred to paisley grammar school was told that the regulations that might save his school were to be

matter causing enormous concern in the house and throughout the country <e> <s> i hope the minister will be able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been better for the noble lord to have given that answer straight away instead of trying to make a play on words as to whether or not it was uranium that was imported <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has rightly said that the rise in imports was due to manufacturing raw materials and so on as well as to consumer goods <e> <s> is he able to give us a breakdown between consumer goods and raw materials <e>", "<cs> my lords following the noble earls question does the minister not agree that a reduction in the landing charges at prestwick for example may make a terrific difference to the willingness of airlines to fly to scottish and northern provincial airports <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may put a supplementary question does the minister not agree that the government have an interest in the social problems in the south-east and that it may well be their responsibility to help with the airport charges in the north in order to relieve those social problems <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the minister on making this appalling tax appear almost credible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate to us any connection between the decline in the public sector borrowing requirement and the rise in the deficit of the balance of payments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the government have frequently stated that the period of economic restraint is over and that we are now in a period of unbounded prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords in an earlier answer the noble lord made or implied some criticism of the programmes <e> <s> perhaps he will give us some idea of what the criticisms are <e>", "<cs> my lords the questions have taken a distinctly political turn <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord a completely unbiased question <e> <s> he belongs to a government

what is the desirable figure of unemployment in this country today <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have agreed that they will make a cash injection of million into the rover group to pay off the banks <e> <s> on the next page of the statement the noble lord refers to the elimination of the varley-marshall assurances <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the noble lord lord morton of shuna in his criticism of the governments actions and the way they have ignored custom and regulation <e> <s> i think that everything that he has said is true <e> <s> however i should like the noble and learned lord when he comes to reply to consider the circumstances of the case which i think differ from the interpretation of them which has been given by the noble lord lord

whether he will tell me in plain language whether the decision the real reason for laying the regulations was simply that his right honourable friend the secretary of state disagreed with the decision he thought the authority was going to take <e> <s> in other words he simply did not trust the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that ray of hope <e> <s> does he mean that the extension to dundee will also mean an extension to the country areas which are important <e> <s> does he appreciate that at the moment the scottish countryside is suffering from all the classic evils of a private monopoly to the extent that charges are being imposed where none was imposed before <e> <s> for example an extra is being charged to transfer a telephone which is already in place

other european countries in putting pressure on the ethiopian government <e> <s> the question of human rights is very important in all our affairs <e> <s> at a time when ethiopia is getting a great deal of help surely it is right to increase the pressure <e> <s> the noble lord will know that the royal family including the ladies of that family many of them educated here have been confined in a smallish room for about years sleeping on the floor on mattresses which have to be backed by frequently-changed cardboard because of the damp <e> <s> surely the maximum pressure should be applied <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that in the farm woodland scheme and any scheme for planting whether conifers or not the farmers own labour and that of his men will be taken into account as a proper expense when considering the grants <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may say that an assured tenancy is a misnomer <e> <s> what is meant is very short tenancies <e> <s> however the two amendments give some assurances to the tenant and i hope that the minister will regard them favourably <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the explanation is a good one but i will look at this again and consult further <e> <s> it is true that there are occasions such as when people go on holiday and wish to let their house but on the other hand the period allows opportunities for an unscrupulous landlord to take advantage of it in a far more long-term way by a series of short tenancies <e> <s> i should like to look at this again but in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister would clarify the point put by the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment would simply ensure the succession for the period of the assured tenancy <e> <s> that is an old principle of scots law <e> <s> if that is so it appears to be perfectly reasonable <e>", "<cs> i understand that a district authority could ask for a parish to be designated <e> <s> that was not my understanding previously and i am grateful to the minister for pointing that out <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether he has any figures for numbers of houses sold in particular areas which have gone as holiday homes or been taken up as retirement homes which is just as important <e> <s> those figures would be very useful in considering certain areas <e>", "<cs> the minister not only appears reasonable he often is reasonable <e> <s> with those assurances and the knowledge that we can come back to the matter i shall look at it again <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of the amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble lord <e> <s> the code of practice offers protection not only for the tenants it is certainly a protection for the landlord <e> <s> as the noble lord lord morton implied scottish homes could take a dislike to bald-headed landlords and that would be a disaster <e> <s> it is necessary to lay down some code of practice <e> <s> the minister may not agree with everything that the noble lord said but the principle must be right because at the end of this clause the bill states quite clearly <e>", "<cs> on the same point will the minister tell me whether i am right <e> <s> in his explanation he said that the tenants would be protected by the contracts between scottish homes and the landlord <e> <s> if that is the case obviously the minister or someone is laying down criteria for the contracts to be drawn up <e> <s> it therefore strengthens the case for guidelines that will be known to both parties <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the bill provides that <e>", "<cs> looking at this i find that it could be interpreted in two ways <e> <s> is the minister saying that if the valuer is to take into account that the applicant would carry out the necessary repairs that would put the price up <e> <s> or would it put it down <e> <s> this could be interpreted both ways <e> <s> the district valuer is to have regard to the price which the property will realise when sold on the open market on the assumption that the landlord carries out the repairs that would put the price up <e> <s> is that what it means that the district valuer will put the price up because repairs have been carried out <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that district valuers are infinitely more competent than her majestys judges who are subject to appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords would her majestys government have asked for those assurances if they had not been voluntarily given <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether the secretary of state will be against uses other than for sports <e>", "<cs> my lords i

wish to say to my noble neighbour lady carnegy that as i remember the universities wish to remain within the orbit of the university grants committee <e> <s> that was because they did not want in any way to come under the scottish office that was their objection <e> <s> they certainly had no objection to a separate university grants committee for scotland <e> <s> they would have accepted that

experiences <e> <s> is the minister aware that there is a general feeling that the civilians who are employed under the supervision of a police officer to clamp cars are either on a bonus or on quota

that those must be dealt with <e> <s> the amendment will allow them to deal with the many more exceptions that will surely come up <e> <s> it is a commentary on the bill that major amendments have been brought forward at this time <e> <s> in this case although normally i would object strongly it seems sensible for the government to be able to prescribe certain categories which they will undoubtedly have missed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put a different point <e> <s> do not think the thrust of the amendment is concentrating on the year <e> <s> the previous amendment did that <e> <s> the thrust of the amendment is why are trainee nurses not regarded as being in full-time education when other students are so regarded <e> <s> that is the essential matter <e> <s> we are very short of nurses and they are being treated as though they were well paid people receiving part-time training whereas the thrust of the government thinking according to the latest announcement of the minister of health <e> <s> is that more nurses are going to do more technical work and be more highly trained <e> <s> that does not appear to me to be logical <e> <s> i hope that the minister will address himself to the long-term effect <e>", "<cs> will the minister address himself to the point of which the government make much that is their belief in market forces <e> <s> there is a shortage of student nurses <e> <s> it is surely logical to exempt them from an extra charge <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain how it improves our competitiveness for swiss firms to take over our best firms in preparation for when firms in this country are not allowed to merge for that new era <e>", "<cs> my lords may i explain to the noble lord that in this country our policy is that if too big a share of the market is to be taken by a merger it will be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> that is the case with chocolate manufacturing firms in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the question of his noble friend lord campbell of croy was totally unnecessary and that competition will resolve everything <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the view that scotland consists of a large area which on sunday is riotous with trading and everything else going on is entirely mistaken <e> <s> is he also aware that there are many communities in scotland which prefer a peaceful sunday to making a profit <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to say that i thought the noble lord lord carmichael said it all and did the right thing when he suggested that the onus of consideration of this situation of two sisters or a devoted daughter who may have been there for a long time should be thrown at a sympathetic minister who is doing rather well in listening to the opposition <e> <s> i believe that is right and i am content to leave the matter to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for producing what he says is a better amendment <e> <s> i am sure that he is right <e> <s> it is an <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be impressed as i was by the arguments put forward by a lawyer against feeding his own profession more money <e> <s> we are dealing with a serious point <e> <s> a tribunal is not expensive and it has been pointed out that we shall have underworked tribunals <e> <s> they do not require specialist knowledge <e> <s> both landlord and tenant are protected by an ultimate right of appeal to the sheriffs court <e> <s> surely the minister must take the matter away and look at it again <e> <s> all the evidence produced from this side of the house contradicts his answer which does not appear to make the case against the amendment at any point <e> <s> perhaps the minister will give me an assurance that he will do that <e>", "<cs> my lords with those multiple assurances i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i reserve the right to return to the matter at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with the minister that a government does great harm if they produce legislation which makes it impossible for a private landlord to let a room or makes it impossible or very difficult for him to get rid of a tenant <e> <s> however in this case we are talking about households two households not three students <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dare add anything to what the noble lord lord morton has said <e> <s> he has put the case absolutely clearly <e> <s> i merely say that i support the amendment on grounds of the principle that the minority must be protected <e> <s> in this case the minority is put at grave risk by a vote of the simple majority <e> <s> it is against assurances given by the government that i trust and hope that the minister will be able to give a satisfactory reply to this enormously serious point <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the minister with great interest and understanding <e> <s> i am glad that he understands the problem <e> <s> certainly the terms that he has laid down will do a great deal to alleviate the problem in rural areas <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true that the government do not have a heart <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the use to which the building has been put is the minister aware that it would be a forward looking act for the government to change the use <e> <s> preserving the building is as nothing compared to preserving it as a theatre <e> <s> it is what goes on in a building that is important and not the preservation of the fabric <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that on the whole the scheme is very good <e> <s> the danger must be the possibility of ghetto housing where people do not wish to buy a house in an area which is undesirable but will accept a grant to move out <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the bill because in spite of the law societys present powers there still exist hundreds of stories of incompetence by solicitors <e> <s> they appear to go unpunished and certainly there is no redress for the client <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister taken on board the point put by his noble friend lord orr-ewing namely that there is a tremendous difference in nuisance value between landing at under power and taking off at full power <e> <s> that makes relevant the point put to him by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the increase in co <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking the minister for his response to a point which i raised on our last debate <e> <s> it concerned resident landlords and the fear that they might turn <e>", "<cs> my lords i concur with my noble kinsman <e> <s> when i think about pesticides i remember the remark of the duke of wellington about his troops that he did not know what they did to the enemy but my god they terrify me <e> <s> that is true of the pesticides we use and i believe that the regulations are necessary the review every two years is certainly also necessary <e> <s> we commend the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual i follow my noble kinsman knowing that large parts of what i was going to say will already have been said by him <e> <s> however i believe that this is a very important measure not in itself but in what it is trying to do <e> <s> there is the most enormous interest in it <e> <s> we have all received literature from the royal society for the protection of birds the council for the preservation of rural england and the consumers association all of whom are experts on what should be done to improve the countryside from their particular angle <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl knew when he was young where to go to find wild flowers and pastures which had been down for generations <e> <s> however we have interfered so much <e>", "<cs> my lords without ruling out the use of nuclear power have the government properly costed the expense of closing down nuclear power stations when they come to the end of their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords the question refers to tidying up <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what steps he is taking to improve efficiency and labour relations so that the public may receive the service it used to have <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister like to tell the house whether any of the many bodies consulted have expressed sympathy with the governments plans <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he said that the government relied largely on voluntary effort to contain the threat facing mankind <e> <s> surely that is entirely contrary to common sense <e> <s> moreover without government effort those people who wish to grow richer such as those in the east and elsewhere will continue to pollute <e> <s> therefore voluntary effort cannot cope with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me where it is <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support this amendment but we do not wish to delay any good news which may be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> i think the minister should accept this amendment because not only will it remind the boards as a whole of their essential duties but it will also remind the parents of their duty under the law to ensure that their children are properly educated <e> <s> if the minister agrees in principle and believes that the amendment is superfluous it might still be very useful to have it in the bill <e> <s> i believe that he should consider including it <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the ministers explanation and as usual he puts a good case but i do not see that it obviates the need for the amendment <e> <s> we are not seeking to establish that once there has been a ballot there should be no school board for ever more <e> <s> i see that the minister is frowning as though he does not understand me but it appears to me to be quite logical that such a position might well arise from not wishing to have a school board <e>", "<cs> is it not possible that the disadvantages might also become apparent to the parents <e>", "<cs> i speak to amendment no <e> <s> which is in my name and that of my noble friend <e> <s> i should like to put the practical point of view to the minister because those of us who have had experience in democratically run political parties i cannot speak for the conservative party know what a group

which erodes that is probably a good thing <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall adopt one of these amendments because there is little doubt that the present

<e> <s> there is a strong case for resigning to both bodies but there is no case for resigning to only one or the other <e> <s> that way lies confusion <e> <s> if one had to resign to both bodies there would be no confusion and that way one would know where one stood <e> <s> i strongly support the amendment and i am sure that the minister is about to accept it <e>", "<cs> i must say that i am rather against the amendment <e> <s> i prefer the bill as it stands in that if one has the regional member he is there because he is of the region and not because of his party <e> <s> if it is policy that one wishes to talk about <e> <s> surely the professionals will put over the policy which is the policy of the education committee to the school board where they are entitled to speak but not to vote <e> <s> as it stands it appears to me that that is probably better than having a political input into the advisers of the school board <e> <s> therefore on balance i am against it <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord has raised a very important point <e> <s> i am not sure that this amendment is the right way to solve the problem <e> <s> i shall listen to what the minister says with great interest as i always do <e> <s> it is a very curious situation that the head teacher has a school board and his responsibilities are to the people who pay him and to his contract <e> <s> he must act towards the school board with a certain amount of responsibility otherwise there is no point in having a school board <e> <s> it would merely be a source of friction <e>", "<cs> i must say that the ministers arguments all seem to lead to drawing lots in the matter <e> <s> he downgraded the decisions of the school board as against the local authority and then said that if the chairman or vice-chairman did not wish to cast his vote he could draw lots <e> <s> in that case there seems to be nothing against accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister could give us his experience of standing orders <e> <s> standing orders laid down are often very much better than standing orders produced by bodies when they are left on their own <e> <s> i have seen some extraordinary standing orders which give an absolute incitement to people to cause trouble <e> <s> with all our combined experience i should have thought the minister would have been delighted to put this in the bill <e>", "<cs> i think this is sensible <e> <s> i hope that the minister will look at it because it simply ensures that no sloppy school board will take decisions without them being recorded and known <e> <s> i am sure that this is desirable <e>", "<cs> i certainly approve of the employment of people who are professional and competent as clerks <e> <s> however i do not know whether a clerk should be a kind of multiple clerk employed by an education authority who goes to <e>", "<cs> the amendments should appeal to the tory heart personal responsibility poll tax indeed all their philosophy has been in this direction <e> <s> here they are putting up people to spend money and education can spend more money than practically anything else yet they are relieving those elected persons of any responsibility for the money spent <e> <s> it is extraordinary <e> <s> it is most unlike the minister not to comply reasonably with the longterm aims of the party thank goodness that he does not <e> <s> in this case i am sure that he will agree it is only logical that if people are to be responsible they should be responsible for any wrong spending that they make <e> <s> therefore i am sure that the minister cannot resist the amendments <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put a point to the minister <e> <s> it is obvious that the third parties are protected by the bill as it stands because the school board is acting as the agent of the authority <e> <s> therefore whether the school board is bust or not the third parties are protected in that they are acting as agents <e> <s> however the minister has brushed over the question of responsibility of the board <e> <s> he is talking in terms of future delegation <e> <s> suppose that in the future much larger spending powers are given to the board and the board acts in good faith but <e>", "<cs> this is an enormously important amendment <e> <s> i pay tribute to the minister and the scottish office for the way in which they have approached the whole problem of stepping up local responsibility <e> <s> they have approached it with caution and without regard to doctrinaire attitudes <e> <s> for that we are all extremely grateful <e> <s> however we have touched on this earlier <e> <s> the clause states that the headmaster shall make proposals and then goes on to state that he <e>", "<cs> i think that is unlikely <e> <s> i am satisfied that the minister regards the matter with extreme seriousness <e> <s> however i should like him to confirm that the education authority has the power to step in and purchase necessary equipment which might not be only books but computers and other modern educational devices <e> <s> i stress this important <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one point <e> <s> regardless of what the generally accurate and intellectual <e>", "<cs> despite the fact that the minister has rejected my good advice it is clear that he has good intentions <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl tell me whether the bill at present provides that the school board may use the moneys raised if the school is successful in letting the school premises in order to buy equipment in addition to the allocation <e> <s> for example could the moneys be used for computers for educational purposes <e>", "<cs> i must admit that i consider the original subsection has greater attractions <e> <s> it states i believe that a school board can fix an occasional days holiday for a school for local reasons <e> <s> but i must also admit that the amendment makes sense because of the provision of services to schools such as school meals <e>", "<cs> this amendment is enormously important while being extremely cautious about how we handle our education system <e>", "<cs> with great regret i must disagree with the noble lord lord carmichael regarding the amendment <e> <s> there is no point in delegating a matter and then saying that one must have a prior approval <e>", "<cs> my lords will the tests which the government are authorising also look at the long-term effects on the cattle <e> <s> as the noble earl knows you do not get anything for nothing <e> <s> the effect of injecting an animal to put it way beyond its genetic ability is bound to have side effects <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister and the ministry are considering a fairly long-term experiment otherwise it could produce very serious results in the production of our beef cattle let alone anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister thinks that bovine animals are predictable perhaps he should try taking a friesian bull as a pet <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that raw data means uncooked <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the large number of people who become unemployed because unemployment lifted off like a rocket as he said after the government came into power was a result of small and growing firms being faced with enormous interest charges that recession hit those people who were part of the lifeblood of a growing and energetic industry and that those who survived were mainly the larger firms which were not so competent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> i deplore the eis going on strike for a day <e> <s> however surely she is not suggesting that the rest of the school board apart from parents will consist of eis members <e> <s> they will be co-opted members and people appointed from the local authority <e> <s> they will form only a part <e> <s> not all teachers are members of the eis <e> <s> the eis through the teachers will not have a majority on the school board <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the minister with my usual enormous respect but i do not think he has made the case <e> <s> i am not putting the views of the eis <e> <s> he seems like the noble baroness lady carnegy to have brought the eis in as the main exponent of this viewpoint that we are putting forward <e> <s> but i am putting forward my own views just as sincerely as he is <e>", "<cs> my lords i too approve of the ministers amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put a further point <e> <s> let us suppose that the contract has run out and several local schools have found persons with outstanding cooking ability whether male or female and who require little money for the pleasure of providing school meals <e> <s> let us suppose this applies to three or four schools in the area <e> <s> it might make it much less economic for the authority to provide the school meals for the rest of the area <e> <s> this is a point that needs to be looked at <e> <s> it might be a sound point for refusing delegation if it is going to put up the price of providing school meals in the rest of the area <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am the owner of a diesel motor car and i understand that diesel is not so harmful to the atmosphere as other fuels may i ask the minister whether he would consider reducing the price of diesel <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that british industrys competitors have a tremendous advantage in that they pay reasonable interest rates <e> <s> have there not been many calls from the cbi conference for the government to tackle overspending in another way <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing a report published some time ago which has been overtaken by events <e> <s> however it is a very good time to discuss it because we are seeing the effects of the measures proposed and taken <e> <s>

that objective being to bring the surpluses under control <e> <s> without doubt we have had some success <e> <s> ten years ago subcommittee d said that we had to have a restrictive price policy that we had to give warnings to farmers and that forward planning was needed <e> <s> unfortunately nothing happened <e> <s> the council kept putting up prices for political reasons <e> <s> nothing was done

she means by taken in isolation <e> <s> does she mean that the price will be smaller when the other factors are taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her answer <e> <s> is she aware that it is possible to take the set-aside on a whole farm and thereafter to plant that land <e> <s> is the minister also aware of the story that wealthy forestry groups have been buying up land in aberdeenshire for this purpose <e> <s> the minister is surely aware that if whole farms which are not on the best agricultural land are planted with forestry that would make a desert of large areas <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be prepared to refuse permission on environmental grounds to set aside whole farms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the reason the french drink so much wine is that their water is so bad <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that only one noble lord is supposed to congratulate a maiden speaker but i cannot resist saying to the noble lord lord alexander that i greatly enjoyed his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible that the amount of gazumping in england may be due to some defect in the english character <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply which i rather expected <e> <s> is he aware that there is a great deal of concern in a great many industrial and financial circles on this question and that

reason for continuing the differential between beer and wine and whisky <e> <s> is there any differential left between the taxation of whisky and brandy in france <e>", "<cs> my lords since the quotas were announced has there been a rise in the price of haddock and other fish <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister fully appreciated the point made by the noble lord lord annan that those people have got on their bikes in a really big way and are exactly the kind of people the conservative party wants to encourage <e>", "<cs> my lords the record of my party in this has been consistent since before the first world war and when we talk about devolution to scotland we mean a scottish parliament with people elected to run the affairs of scotland within the framework of the united kingdom <e> <s> one can call it a federal system or anything else but that is what we mean when we talk about devolution <e> <s> we mean a scottish parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me

town children to visit farms to see how they operate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us as an indication of the necessity or otherwise for more pay how the brain drain is proceeding how

school being a centre of excellence it has the largest amount of commissioned research million worth of any veterinary school in the united kingdom <e> <s> all the evidence points to the fact that the development of glasgow would be of infinitely more value and probably cheaper than the development of a joint school at edinburgh <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the noble lord lord annan is not correct in assuming that i wanted to concentrate the two scottish schools in glasgow <e> <s> is he further aware that if one puts two good schools together the result will not necessarily be as good as the original two <e>", "<cs> my lords was the answer to the last serious question correct when the minister said that eight cases of wild deer with the disease had been discovered in

standard is sewage pollution <e> <s> will he say what is the main cause <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the question of the noble lord lord gallacher if her majestys government believe that research and development is still needed in agriculture does the minister not believe that it is the governments duty to produce a scheme which would cover all the small businesses <e> <s> in other words does she agree that there should be not a voluntary scheme but a levy which only the government can impose so that that necessary research can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course attacking the policy of the ec <e> <s> but when he says that prices are double world prices can he tell me of one area in the world where the farmers are making a great deal of money out of that <e>",

when it listed the remedies so confidently and i am sure that it is right <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if the united nations were asked to keep the peace sufficient forces should

united nations we must do so with money and forces <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect does the minister not agree that while the united nations forces are there to oversee the plan <e>", "<cs> my

the money saved on near-market research <e> <s> she said that it would be applied in the governments rd programme <e> <s> i presume that she meant in the governments agricultural rd programme <e>",

<s> however i can assure the noble lord that i have read the three documents with a great feeling of satisfaction that something is now being done <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister be a little more honest and instead of referring to agricultural adjustment say that there is an agricultural depression <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to farmers preferring high interest rates to inflation <e> <s> is she aware that we now have both <e>", "<cs> my lords i am satisfied that the house heard but i shall repeat the question <e> <s> farming now suffers from both very high interest rates and a high rate of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves that point do i understand that the secretary of state will have no power to overrule a school which wants to introduce an academic selectivity test in an area <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add my protest about a bill of this importance being dealt with at the back end of the session on a friday <e> <s> i suspect that the minister agrees but it would be too much to ask him to say so <e> <s> it is an important bill but it is difficult to see the necessity for it <e> <s> one can see the reason one cannot

minister tell us which these schools are <e> <s> is one of them paisley grammar school <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes perhaps he can clear up one point <e> <s> i believe he said that there would be no change in the position of a rector taking a chair in an ancient university <e> <s> however in schedule there is a change <e> <s> meetings of the university court will be presided over by a chairman who will be elected instead of the rector being entitled to take the chair <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for answering my question <e> <s> as i understand that he has now been transferred to other spheres i should like to thank him for giving very detailed and very good answers in the past in his defence capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware

of state went <e>", "<cs> i too support this amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> it is an important amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will act in his wise role and proceed to walk before he runs and take account of the fact that per cent <e> <s> of the eligible schools have failed to establish a school board <e> <s> that figure may be subject to correction but it will not be corrected by much <e>", "<cs> it is illogical for the minister to say that he believes in devolution when the secretary of state has an absolute power of veto <e>", "<cs> is there any real reason why the list should not be available <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand <e> <s> one is not saying whether a parent is a single parent or whether the child is illegitimate <e> <s> one is merely giving a list <e> <s> i find it difficult to understand what harm can be done <e>", "<cs> i beg the minister to consider the amendment favourably if only because to hear a lawyer talking about reasonable expenses is a good thing <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not understand what i mean <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly not do that <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord clarify the figure <e> <s> did i understand him to say that the secretary of state for england had turned down applications which showed per cent <e> <s> in favour of grant maintained status <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for my careless drafting <e>", "<cs> i should just like to clarify one point <e> <s> is the minister saying that provided a school publishes its prospectus and it is approved it could exclude a certain geographical area previously served by that school <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to explain my anxiety <e> <s> by a simple majority of approval a group might exclude in a racist manner a racially unacceptable area or perhaps in a rather snobbish manner a poor area containing children considered not suitable for association with their own children <e> <s> it is a point of concern in certain country areas where there is little choice of school or only an expensive alternative provided by the authority <e>", "<cs> i wish to endorse the importance of this amendment <e> <s> there was an example in our own area of a good academic school in the main town <e> <s> it had a good academic record but it had a band of vandals in the school who were totally neglected <e> <s> the school was in favour of the academics with the result that the vandals became very bad citizens indeed <e> <s> five miles away in the country there was a very good secondary modern school with a good headmaster <e> <s> exactly the same type of boys were studying there with great care <e> <s> they were well behaved and good citizens <e> <s> it is important that a school is not allowed to concentrate on one area of education to the exclusion of a minority of pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that because of differences of longitude and latitude the noble baroness may be quite right when she says that scandinavian countries are satisfied with the change in time <e> <s> however in scotland with its different longitude the impact would be considerable especially in the north of scotland and would cause great dissatisfaction <e>", "<cs> surely the obvious answer is for such a teacher to be employed by the local education authority because the authority has an interest in servicing that school and the other schools <e> <s> if a self-governing school employs a teacher it has only a financial incentive to go to the other schools but no duty <e> <s> it appears to me that the first alternative is the proper one because peripatetic teachers are always employed by the education authority <e>", "<cs> i want to reinforce the noble baronesss point about the increased cost of administering the schools remaining under the local authority <e> <s> when one removes half the schools it is bound to be more expensive to administer the rest <e> <s> it is an important point <e>", "<cs> will the minister reassure me on one point <e> <s> he said that costs for the self-governing school would be apportioned according to overheads <e> <s> that is satisfactory for the self-governing school <e> <s> i hope and trust that along <e>", "<cs> i too wish to congratulate my noble neighbour on his maiden speech and to say how nice it is to hear the robust tones of angus supplementing the rather lusher pastures of the borders <e> <s> it is a great joy and delight to hear the noble earl and i am sure that we shall hear him again on many occasions with the same enjoyment <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the ministers reply to the noble baroness lady carnegy appeared to encompass amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> a vital and essential part of scottish education is that there is no academic selection in an area of a local authority school <e> <s> there are specialist schools in the area but to have a self-governing school introducing academic selection would cut across everything that has been said in the discussion <e> <s> the minister must be able to agree with the purpose of the amendment so enabling us to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i would like to stress the importance of taking into account particularly in rural areas the views of the primary schools grouped round the secondary or comprehensive schools in the main towns <e> <s> obviously it is of great importance to the parents of children in primary schools what will happen to the school where their children will go for their further education <e> <s> i await with interest the ministers reply <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may contradict the noble baroness slightly <e> <s> it is all very well for the pupils in friockheim who have a geographical choice which is much wider than the pupils in cortachy <e> <s> if the nature of websters seminary in kirriemuir changes then their choice is not limited but constrained by the geography and they would have a long way to travel in order to attend the school of their choice <e>", "<cs> will the minister give examples of when he may allow a school board to retain part of the money <e> <s> is he talking about improvements to the school or a new department <e>", "<cs> my name is also linked to the amendment <e> <s> it is entirely logical if the wishes of the parents are to be the motivating factor in the setting up of a self-governing school that the wishes of the parents should also be the motivating factor in the return to local authority control <e> <s> we have all seen instances of a good idea being spoilt by extremely bad management to the extent that the process has gone so far that it can hardly be put right <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a very full reply which we shall need to consider <e> <s> i am surprised that he did not again produce his argument about the majority of parents on the board but i am grateful to him for not doing so <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lords argument and to the noble baronesss exposition of what happens in tayside but the weakness of the case for having half the governors from some employers organisation is that it appears to brand the further education college as a place which is purely for professional and trade training and has no wider aspect than training people for life <e> <s> that should not be so <e> <s> if the minister accepted the figures of a third and a quarter i have been trying to work out what is left and it appears to leave only five-twelfths of places for a wider variety of governor from various places such as trade unions all sorts of useful people could be co-opted and put on the board <e> <s> obviously one would still have the largest number of employers <e> <s> i feel that one-third and one-quarter are not bad figures <e> <s> i believe that half gives the appearance of weighting the whole thing in favour of trade and professional training only <e>", "<cs> i think the crux of this whole amendment is that we do not want the spectre of the -plus raised again in the minds of children and parents to inhibit the learning process <e> <s> one <e>", "<cs> i am a little doubtful about the amendment in that it narrows the field more than somewhat <e> <s> if it referred to an establishment which gave a child more chance of an education it might be more useful <e> <s> to say an establishment <e>", "<cs> this is a very sensible amendment in that in the favoured district of angus the <e>", "<cs> i am in the same position as the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> however the point to make on what the noble baroness said is that in that case the secretary of state played a very important part and it was on appeal to him that the lady in question became the head teacher <e> <s> for that we must bless the provisions which give the secretary of state power to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say what proportion of couriers are caught <e> <s> it is all very well to warn them but they will be stopped only if they are caught when coming through <e> <s> when one sees people going through the green section it appears to be a low risk <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister made an estimate of their chances of success <e> <s> does a drug courier say to himself i have only one chance in of being caught <e> <s> has any such estimate been made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this problem is widespread even in <e>", "<cs> my lords is any work being done on a more long term scheme for better use of the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like the minister to look very closely at the amendment <e> <s> the example given by the noble baroness lady carnegy in our last debate was fairly typical of what happens in a number of schools <e> <s> the educational standing of a number of denominational schools in scotland is low <e> <s> the teacher in question wanted her children to have a better education <e> <s> i believe that a situation in which a religious body can question the fitness of a man whom it has previously accepted for promotion for example a physics teacher does not make sense and would not be for the good of the catholic community in terms of <e>", "<cs> my lords during the course of the bill and the preparations for it the minister and his right honourable colleagues were congratulated on the fact that they managed to hold the units together in scotland in the north of scotland it was the hydro board and in the south the electricity board for privatisation thereby causing the least possible disturbance to industry <e> <s> while we did not agree with what they were doing it seemed an extremely good point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall concentrate mainly on agriculture because after hearing the speech made by the noble lord lord mcintosh i feel deeply depressed about the environment <e> <s> however i agree with practically everything that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord whether the government will consider sympathetically making up the shortfall caused by the decision of the ec on hlcas <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the good work which it is acknowledged is done by the select committee is the minister satisfied that enough time is allowed for those committees to study the commissions proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain how the top pay award committee operates if it does not have any information regarding salaries in industry as against those in the public service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that instead of disclosing his figures later when forced to do so it would have been much more respectful to the house and better for his reputation if he had produced them at the start <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give us the reasons behind that extraordinary change of front <e> <s> in the old days i and many others paid the rates of employees living in tied cottages <e> <s> why should there be a sudden change <e> <s> why should we not be enabled to pay the poll tax in exactly the same way <e> <s> there must be some reason for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that our partners especially the danes who are very competent at industrial fishing are sticking to the by-limits of per cent <e> <s> or are they in fact sticking to the agreement made some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount care to answer the inference in the question of the noble lord lord hatch that the transport of waste and of the finished product is dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to back up my noble kinsman in practically everything that he has said <e> <s> although he has expanded fully on the foolishness of the opening sentence i should like to say that it is quite extraordinary that it should appear in a document of this kind <e> <s> i have farmed in the howes o muir for years <e> <s> i started there as a tenant of the grandfather of the noble earl sitting on the front bench <e> <s> he will know the quality of that land <e> <s> it throws a little doubt on the validity of many sections of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he expand on his statement that the north of scotland college will continue to exist and that the professor appointed by the university and the principal of the college will work together to run the college <e> <s> does that mean that there will be no competition for students because i believe that that is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that we are talking about the year to come that is and not about how well the fishermen did in the past <e> <s> does he further agree that in many cases the fishermens greatest expenditure is paying for boats which they were encouraged to buy through grants for large sums of money <e> <s> if the year is as bad as is feared is there not a case for the government assisting by placing a moratorium on repayments for expensive boats <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the average pay in the ambulance service <e> <s> how does it compare with the average industrial wage <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government believe that the present rate of extraction of rare hardwoods and their use can be sustained by a policy of the growing nations <e> <s> is it not a fact that the present rate must deplete the stock of timber <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was a member of the committee and i greatly enjoyed the proceedings <e> <s> i learned a great deal

believe that negotiations would be effective while this kind of thing continues <e> <s> will the noble lord ask his right honourable friend the prime minister to use her influence in that direction

that the polluter must pay <e> <s> that is true but in this case we are talking about an area which has been frozen because of a danger to health <e> <s> it then turns out that the farm for example

speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lord falkland <e> <s> i was on the sub-committee that considered this matter <e> <s> the report of that committee was debated the other night <e> <s> all fears that i had about radioactive dangers to the public have been totally laid to rest <e> <s> at the same time the experts at our own scientific institute said that not

we totally accepted that irradiation would not produce any radioactivity effects but we were entirely unsure of the effects on food and we thought there should be much more research on the effects

that the government will actively assist with cash <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment for slightly different reasons <e> <s> my reasons are purely practical <e> <s> it is an enormously complicated and expensive process which is highly emotive <e> <s> we do not really know exactly what regulations will emerge in europe <e> <s> we cannot afford to be out of step because if we produce a regulation which we have to withdraw at the end of the day that will be very expensive and will not help the cause of irradiation if there is such a cause <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the meteorological office is totally incompetent when compared to a jewish forecaster who lived over years ago who was able to advise the pharaoh that there would be seven good years followed by seven bad ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord russell in his efforts to make the government think again perhaps again is the wrong word <e> <s> the crux of the matter appears to me to be how we are to attract more people into going to university in order to make the nation better and richer <e> <s> we are not succeeding in this nor in taking the reservoir of clever working class children the last reservoir we have into the universities <e> <s> the reason for this is that they are not motivated to go to university because they see their brothers and sisters earning money without the sweat of study and hard work <e> <s> they see people at university extraordinarily hard up and in what they regard as a poorer position than people who go to work immediately after school <e>", "<cs> my lords despite turkeys far from perfect record on the treatment of the kurdish people can the minister confirm that turkey has been under a particularly heavy burden in the form of refugees from the greater inhumanities of iraq <e> <s> can he say what our government have done regarding financial help in order to ease the position and make the turks give better treatment to those very unfortunate refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to appear ungrateful to the minister <e> <s> however does he think that is enough for the many thousands of refugees who have poured in <e> <s> a sum of will hardly re-roof this palace <e> <s> does he consider that sum to be generous <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the privatised board which will succeed the hydro board will have an obligation to provide electricity supplies to people in the highlands where the obligation is more social than economic <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it that the answer is no that they will not supply to remote areas whether or not it is deemed economic <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only to contradict the assumption that

disastrous family is taken care of by the previous amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that politicians are also sensitive people <e> <s> during the period of the labour government many politicians on their side were deeply suspicious of the bbc <e> <s> is the noble viscount further aware that the present unpopularity of the government is much more due to their own

noble friend <e> <s> the anxieties of the scottish case are quite clear but there is a general principle touched on by many noble lords that the harder one works and the longer one trains then the

the milkmaid as i believe it is important <e> <s> the tec in the town will surely not be interested in providing training for a milkmaid <e> <s> surely it would come out of its budget if it were to

budget of the particular tec <e>", "<cs> taking up the point of my noble friend lord grimond could the minister confirm that if you accept the position of president of some charitable body which all of us are asked to do you are definitely responsible if some of the agents below you make off with the dough <e> <s> in other words if you accept the position of president you have to see that you do your job as president <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this enormous bunch of amendments or the general intention behind them put forward by the noble and learned lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> from the laymans point of view i support these amendments because if the government wish to create a narrow band of inferior lawyers as appears to be the case and call them conveyancers or executors surely one must give the public the same protection as they enjoy as regards to solicitors <e> <s> when we come to the debate on clause stand part i shall question the need for the whole provision <e> <s> if the government are determined to produce this new body of people in <e>", "<cs> if the body is to be worth while and is to consist of responsible people the government will be quite safe in loaning it

contract for a house <e>", "<cs> they might think that but they do not think it as much as they think they are being taken to the cleaners by the high interest rates <e>", "<cs> i should like to join

questions and is the perfect target for such sales talk <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment which bears my name <e> <s> it is quite obvious from the concern expressed by all kinds of people about the effects of the measure particularly on rural practices that the government must monitor what is going on <e> <s> otherwise we may find that instead of increasing competition and having a better service the provision could lead to a total deterioration of legal services for ordinary people in rural scotland <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord the lord advocate advocating that a

connection <e> <s> i say that because the consideration is not in respect of what the man does it is in respect of his personal qualities <e> <s> i support the amendment for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very interesting debate <e> <s> i will not congratulate the noble lord lord stanley on introducing it but i will congratulate the government on having the courage to turn him loose on a subject as important as this <e> <s> for me it has been extremely frustrating because first of all my noble kinsman told the story i was going to tell about my father i cannot say our

if so how much does he expect it to rise before it starts to fall <e>", "<cs> i hope that in his reply the minister will be able to give some reasons and for example give the number of marriages which can be saved by conciliation after a year <e> <s> if there is no conciliation after a year it is unlikely that further efforts will be successful <e> <s> after all the break-up of a marriage is itself a terrific decision <e> <s> if there is no conciliation within a year i should like to see figures showing the success rate before agreeing with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed in the

primitive form of debt collection <e> <s> but we are all agreed in the sensible political parties in scotland such as the liberal democrats and sections of the labour party that the illegality which

virtues in the amendment <e> <s> the scottish consumer council which put it to me has written to me saying that not surprisingly the drafting of the noble and learned lords clause is much better than

of health for a house which was thereafter found to be full of dry rot <e> <s> i should have thought that that was the very first thing that a surveyor should look for <e> <s> now that the matter has been put right by this clause it only remains for me to thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for tabling this much superior clause <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that quite simply if the society acts in bad faith it can be liable but if it is incompetent it is not liable <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord expand on his figure of billion <e> <s> it would be useful if he could tell the house approximately how much of that figure is due to native industry for example the whisky industry and how much is due to incoming foreign investment <e>", "<cs> my lords we appear to be talking about the next amendment which i feel is the relevant amendment <e> <s> i think it is quite reasonable to lend to banks and other wealthy institutions to enable them to get a start <e> <s> they should be given loans at a proper rate of interest such as the rates of interest that they charge farmers in this country <e> <s> that would be quite reasonable <e> <s> however the government are wholly inconsistent in wanting to give banks money while taking money from farmers in order to fund essential research <e> <s> it is wholly inconsistent and i suggest that we move to the next amendment so that the house can decide the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it might also make it reasonably possible <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my very pleasant duty to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of lichfield on an outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> it springs from his distinguished and varied career in the church his connections in uganda and his connection with education in various forms <e> <s> obviously he will apply his wide experience of humanity and christianity to our benefit in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill deals with resumption of tenanted land in the agricultural sector <e> <s> it was introduced into another place by my honourable friend mr alex carlile and amended with the co-operation of the ministry and the support of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all speakers who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i also thank the minister for wishing the bill a fair wind <e> <s> i should like to spend half an hour discussing the whole issue but as the minister is busy and i am hungry i shall confine myself to saying that this is a sensible little bill <e> <s> the trouble with security of tenure arises when it turns into stagnation <e> <s> to a large degree security of tenure is still necessary for <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government sympathetic to the general sentiment behind the question <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the impression that he has given is that the government are not sympathetic to the sentiment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house how he knows that only one-third of the dogs in northern ireland are licensed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that it has been a great privilege for a layman such as myself to watch the legal luminaries of scotland at work <e> <s> i have a very high opinion of them though obviously not as high as they have of themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords how many of the estimated million people have votes in canada <e> <s> does the minister think it right that they should be able to vote in two places if they have votes in canada <e>", "<cs> my lords if an overseas resident takes that option does it preclude him from voting in a general election here <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak against the amendment <e> <s> i have listened to the constitutional arguments with a little amusement as distinguished speaker after distinguished speaker has stated that because it was not a government motion and the whips were not on the vote in another place could be disregarded here <e> <s> it is a contradiction in terms to state that where the elected representatives vote according to their own conscience for their constituents that that is a lesser occasion than when they vote according to the whips <e> <s> that argument does not hold water <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble neighbour on this bill <e> <s> it is very practical and useful <e> <s> however i regret the passing of an era because the term days used to mean a great deal in scotland <e> <s> on th may and th november farmers moved round the farms <e> <s> it was not bad for the single farmers <e> <s> they gained a lot of experience and took stories of the meanness of farmers around the whole area in a very happy way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords should there not be an interval of some kind before a minister takes a position <e> <s> although he may be of great value to the industry does it not look very bad if within a month or two a minister joins a private firm which he has privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i do not see why the minister should not support it <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael has covered the ground extremely thoroughly <e> <s> there are areas such as the angus glens which i know well where the lack of social development inhibits any other form of development <e> <s> we all know what that means <e> <s> it involves the schools the church transport and so on <e> <s> services such as the mail bus <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has mentioned an important point <e> <s> surely the sda has already had a social remit in the urban situation <e> <s> no one can say that the immense transformation brought about in the fortunes of the west glasgow <e>", "<cs> i share the distaste of the noble lord lord carmichael for large boards <e> <s> the secretary of state appears to be able to appoint whoever he wants on to the boards so i shall be interested to hear what the minister says <e>", "<cs> these are important amendments <e> <s> i should like to be assured that highlands and islands enterprise as a whole will have an overall function and that matters will not depend entirely upon the local boards <e> <s> in the highlands i understand that there are about boards <e> <s> to ensure that all those boards are free of local prejudice and suspicion is difficult <e> <s> some board members may not desire a development which might cut across their own businesses <e> <s> it is essential that highlands and islands enterprise and scottish enterprise retain their overall strategic role <e> <s> i should be interested in what the minister has to say <e> <s> he must know that the more we can bring the local population behind us the more we can do but the overall direction of the strategy must come from the centre <e>", "<cs> i dare say that it will <e> <s> it looks as though the district council will have far fewer houses of its own to allocate <e> <s> it is for that reason that shelter has put forward the suggestion that it should handle the list of needed housing and allocate the homes owned by different landlords to the homeless <e> <s> i think it is a straightforward matter <e> <s> i know that there are snags and that there may be some overlapping <e> <s> however this amendment fulfils a need <e>", "<cs> the minister has underlined the need for consultation and also how usefully the district councils and the corporations have worked together <e> <s> the development corporations will disappear and this amendment is to provide a system which is as good as the one that previously operated <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> by then the housing stock will be widely spread <e> <s> the minister gave very significant figures namely one in three houses for the district councils and one in five for the development corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords do i detect in the noble lords reply any similarity in the governments attitude to ward joining the erm and their attitude to the easter act of <e>", "<cs> i hate to step in before the distinguished noble lords behind me but on behalf of the liberal party i wish to welcome the conversion of my noble neighbour lady carnegy <e>", "<cs> listening to the debate so far it is quite obvious that the committee is of the opinion that nature conservancy and the <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the minister on his splendid speech <e> <s> to conclude by saying that three great departments of state have produced a consultation document sums the matter up <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what is being done with the very large surplus of offal that is being built up throughout the country in slaughterhouses <e> <s> have the government plans for the disposal of the surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the house and perhaps his noble friend who asked the question expected a rather more stirring endorsement from him of the european idea <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i do not understand why the noble lord lord gray of contin made the comments he did <e> <s> there is no question of diluting any powers of the highlands board <e> <s> it is rather a matter of a slight extension of those powers <e> <s> i do not believe that anything will be taken away from the noble lord in his fastness up there near inverness <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the speech of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> some of what he says is right but we do not live in a pure world <e> <s> the world is complex <e> <s> all sorts of things occur and none of us is blameless <e> <s> one thing is certain saddam hussein does not give a damn for the ideals of justice the united nations or anything else <e> <s> the only thing that he respects is power <e> <s> the united states mixed up though she might be provided that power and has given us the chance to do something about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the chief whip this question is it in order to make speeches from a sitting position <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that if farm animals foul the road it is the farmers responsibility to clean up the roads and so i do not know why dog owners should be any different <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment and suggest that it might be extended to other things which are affixed to windscreens by people wearing yellow hats <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the wages councils normally apply in industries where there are low wages but wage inflation comes from the industries which pay high wages <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government agree with the criticism that the standard of tabloid journalism in this country is deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this series of amendments because if farmers and landowners are to have regard for the countryside and to improve the environment they need to have the money to do it <e> <s> as the noble baroness will know the income from agriculture is shrinking fast <e> <s> without income they cannot possibly take care of the countryside in the way expected of them by the people living in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the government for their help in tidying up these amendments <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear the implications arising from their help <e> <s> i trust and hope that they will accept this amendment which has universal backing throughout the country <e> <s> their help is appreciated and will assist the swift passage of the bill through the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that he has information that the government have accepted this provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak <e> <s> however i must take up one point raised by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i do not believe that doctors should make laws <e> <s> the laws must be made by parliament <e> <s> certainly we must take their views into account because their profession is a competent and a caring one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is easy to reduce an overdraft if one disposes of the collateral <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in scotland the wood pigeon is a big pest but magpies cannot get a living <e> <s> the wood pigeon does enormous damage all the year round <e> <s> wood pigeons can clean out a field of oilseed rape in two nights <e> <s> does she agree that if this order is not amended the government along with the commission will be stigmatised in most rural areas and constituencies as stark raving mad <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the debate will show a certain unanimity among the speakers who are asking the questions <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord kirkhill on putting down the question <e> <s> he is a colleague of mine from the parliamentary assembly and while i have been thinking about putting down the question he has done so and has given us the opportunity to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the removal of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords an enormous number of red herrings are being dragged across the bill by the dogs <e> <s> every single clause that we have discussed costs money <e> <s> we are not saying how the scheme should be implemented we are sending it back to the commons who will decide <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noticed that even in our party chief whips become a little authoritarian <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a good job that i do not stand any higher <e> <s> the commons have clearly demonstrated that this is a point which they would like to reconsider <e> <s> a majority of three with the payroll vote off means a majority in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by complaining to the leader of the house and the usual channels about the format of our debates on the queens speech <e> <s> i think that they might split the subjects up a little better <e> <s> i know that transport has much to do with pollution but the two do not really go together <e> <s> the noble lord lord brabazon made an excellent speech full of technical points about what will be done <e> <s> it is ridiculous that the poor chap has then to listen to the remainder of the debate and for the noble baroness lady blatch to reply on a different subject <e> <s> that does not appear logical <e> <s> it should not be beyond the wit of the usual channels perhaps to split the subject into two <e> <s> we could then hear from ministers who know something about the subject <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness lady blatch is enormously knowledgeable <e> <s> she is learning fast on agriculture from me i understand <e> <s> the noble baroness lady trumpington is listening throughout the debate looking nearly interested <e> <s> if the subject were split she could reply on agriculture - a subject about which she knows a great deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it would be right to do that <e> <s> however i hope that i shall receive a hear hear that europe has a right to feed herself and to export a sensible proportion <e> <s> there would obviously be a carry-over in bad times because we shall have bad years as well as good <e> <s> the common agricultural policy is in a mess because for years the council of agriculture ministers for political reasons did not listen to the proposals of the commission <e> <s> it allowed prices and production to rise to an extent which has led us into the present surplus position and the enormous expense from which we suffer today in europe and in this country because of the large amount spent mostly on export subsidies to remove the surpluses and to dump them on the world market <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in the debate as a member of the committee which was chaired by the noble lord lord middleton <e> <s> he is an admirable chairman <e> <s> he has a wide knowledge and a kindly way of putting one down <e> <s> he has all the necessary characteristics except that he is too kind a man <e> <s> when the whips came to him and said that they wanted to lump two reports together one from the church and one from the committee he said yes of course <e> <s> he would not be nasty enough to tell the whips where they should go <e> <s> however that would not apply to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not expect to be back in this country in time to speak in the debate <e> <s> in fact the job has been much better done by my noble friend lord grimond <e> <s> however now i am here i cannot resist saying something <e> <s> the debate has ranged in various directions <e> <s> the noble lord lord pearson has given a very full explanation <e> <s> i suggest that he should fill it out by writing to the noble baroness so that she can understand what goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that in the days of the pharaohs the boom and bust was caused by the weather and not by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount ensure that after the new charge is introduced when one gives the girl with the computer more information than she gives when she fails to turn up a number there is a girl in the background with a set of directories who can look up the number <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness any evidence that these animals wish to enter the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the figures that the noble earl has given as regards the increased funds available and the increase in the number of officers recruited and the avowed intention of the government to combat crime they have stated this in all their manifestos is it not clear that the present system has completely failed and that perhaps the time has come for a royal commission to investigate the whole question of the police and crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for initiating the debate <e> <s> i thank him particularly for taking less than his allotted time for his speech <e> <s> he and the noble earl lord selkirk were two of the few speakers who did so <e> <s> i wish to echo the remarks of the noble earl lord selkirk on the royal air force when he said that it was a particularly good place to study members of the commonwealth during the war <e> <s> i served in bomber command during the war and every crew that i flew with contained a member of the commonwealth <e> <s> i remember with great affection and joy their vigour in flying and afterwards in the various <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say
