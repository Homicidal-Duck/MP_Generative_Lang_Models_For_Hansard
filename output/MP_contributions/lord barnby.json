["<cs> my lords in view of what has been asked may i inquire <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord noel-baker has given us an impressive example of his capacity for memorising things and i am sure that we all admired his speech <e> <s> as for myself this debate on the gracious speech has given us great pleasure and has been a cause of jubilation on this side of the house <e> <s> i seize the opportunity of the small courtesies provided by the gracious speech to express my admiration for the performance of the mover and seconder and for the elegance and matter of their speeches which was indeed thought provoking <e> <s> they hold out great promise for the future <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow in his scarlet uniform gave added glamour to the scene <e> <s> i hope that he will maintain the true conservatism that we expect <e> <s> we certainly had it in his grandfather who as the chairman of committees in this house invariably wore a frock coat when on duty <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is giving us a generous array of figures about cubans <e> <s> is he in a position to say what is the estimated number of cubans in somalia <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand that the scale of intended reduction in foreign aid by the united states of america exceeds greatly the figure which has just been stated as the intention of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the secretary of state whether it is not true that britain is being put in a difficult position by her continuing membership of the committee of five that the united nations leans to swapo that swapo is directed by russia and is in receipt of marxist sources of finance weaponry and training and therefore shuns the ballot box and continues terrorism and delay <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a british subject and we are having a british discussion about british territory <e> <s> the foreign secretary has already made that very clear to us <e> <s> responsibility involves leadership <e> <s> i am puzzled about why it is necessary to defer so much to the opinions of other countries regarding a british subject <e> <s> that point has already been stressed by other speakers <e> <s> appeasement is a nasty word <e> <s> the modern term dtente is equally unpleasant although naturally this government do not wish to attract that tag <e>", "<cs> my lords i would bracket the two <e> <s> i certainly do not admire the rapidity with which the government recognised ghana after another bloody revolution but i do not think i am wrong in saying that ghana did shoot some of the heads of state <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend lord boyd of merton has asked that because i believe we are attaching too much importance to the fear about nigeria <e> <s> i believe that britain can stand against any boycotts or wrongful approach <e> <s> i criticise the fear trade should not be subject to ideologies of any kind but success should be the result of competence and of the three qualities i have just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so happy to find myself following my noble friend lord rochdale because i have such a great admiration for him <e> <s> it is certainly proper that in a textile debate like this he should participate because he <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood him correctly i think the noble lord the foreign secretary referred to arrangements with regard to the transfer of ownership of land <e> <s> can he give an assurance that equal consideration will be given to the question of pensions to those legally entitled to them in rhodesia <e> <s> secondly as he referred to a period during which apparently the direction of affairs is to lie with britain is it to be understood that the present <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend fully aware of the degree to which the very efficient wool textile industry is now being oppressed by imports and that it is causing great unemployment and distress <e> <s> in his second supplementary reply he put emphasis on the quotas <e> <s> does he understand that apart from quotas the main pressure comes from politically-priced products from eastern countries <e> <s> also is he aware that the result of the pricing of oil in the states enables yarns and other materials to come into this country <e> <s> will my noble friend alert himself to the extent to which unemployment has increased <e> <s> as has just been mentioned by a noble lord opposite <e> <s> in the last two years the way in which the high register of employment in the wool textile industry has fallen is distressing <e>", "<cs> my lords as the statement included information that legislation is to be promptly introduced with the hope of a rapid passage through parliament and in view of the recollection of the experience of the pearce commission and the misfortunes which that brought about does the foreign secretary feel that he is in a position to indicate that after the passage of the legislation there will be a clear understanding that a maximum time will be set before the elections are completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel happy that i find myself following the noble lord lord stewart of fulham because <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement which my noble friend has just made and congratulate him on its detail <e> <s> it is a fairly balanced solution to what undoubtedly is a complicated question <e> <s> over the past years in this house we have had many discussions on immigration <e> <s> at times the discussion has centred on the matters which the noble lord lord avebury so often raises and which have been effectively dealt with in the statement <e> <s> but over the years there have certainly been anxieties on this side of the house and i think on the cross-benches about the whole question of immigration <e> <s> admittedly it is a very sensitive matter which has habitually raised great emotions <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to bear in mind and to reassure his right honourable friend the home <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say with regard to his first answer to the noble baroness in which he referred to the specific countries <e>", "<cs> my lords while expressing my apologies to the noble baroness for too early an intrusion i ask leave to put the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those victims whose questions on rd december have been shot down may i ask the noble lord the leader of the house please to indicate whether if noble lords put down questions for written answer they will receive an answer in a fairly short time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl a question arising out of my noble friends original question and the noble earls first reply <e> <s> would it be wrong to assume that if the government were to provide the encouragement requested by my noble friend it would result with existing installations of machinery in a larger proportion of bran of a higher quality being available in this country than that which arises from the imported wheat and the existing machinery employed in producing it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether the troops are in uganda at the request of the united nations or of whom <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister say who is paying for the tanzanian troops in uganda in view of the fact that we have been giving substantial sums of aid to tanzania <e>", "<cs> my lords may welcome back the foreign secretary from his latest effective journey to the middle east <e> <s> in view of the fact that russian-sponsored swapo is regarded by the united nations as the true representative of the people of south-west africa is it not confusing or perhaps even regrettable that we continue to have a representative on the committee of five appointed by the united nations which appears contemporaneously to put us into direct <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the tons of maize which was recently reported to have been given has yet been received by <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not attempt to follow the noble baronesss eloquent and passionate defence of what inevitably arise from any legislation those difficult cases to which we have all given our attention at different times because the motion before us refers particularly to rules and not to legislation <e> <s> we all admire the consistent defence of the noble lord lord avebury the mover of this motion who is always quick to jump to the support of any case which he considers is entitled to compassion <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will give way <e> <s> he has referred a good deal to my remarks but of course there is just this difference between himself and myself i emphasized that my belief was strong in the purity of the british race and the british race originally did not include a mulatto content <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the supplementary question which the noble lord answered may i therefore ask him with regard to the position in zimbabwe what is the position of the two as reported in the press fully formed and foreign-trained units in zimbabwe <e> <s> is it right to understand that until they have been withdrawn there will be no further aid from britain to zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords since the assumption of the assignment by dr viljoen is it not to be understood that contrary to the precedent in rhodesia there has been from among the external hostile ranks of south west africans of course from swapo members supported by russia and also by the united nations a steady drift back of swapo intellectuals if they can be so called into south west africa where their presence now is likely to increase the chance of intimidation as and when the expected elections take place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a second supplementary question on this matter which is so important to the whole of southern africa <e> <s> with regard to the vast demilitarised zone proposed on both sides of the frontier with angola may i ask whether it is to be <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister made some promise of a further statement <e> <s> can he be sure that in it there will be reference to the proportion of those apprehended who are non-white <e> <s> further from the fact that in the area under consideration it is understood there is a very substantial population coming from the west indies will he ask his right honourable friend to give further consideration to the proposal that has been made that there should be established a substantial fund which would permit voluntary repatriation in view of the fact that there is likely to be a great deal of unemployment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether from the sums that he reported as being made available or from any other source adequate provision for pensions has been made on a scale which has been suggested as equitable by the bodies concerned with the civil service and others in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend remember that when the accession is complete extreme pressure is likely to come from the portuguese textile industries which should receive the same kind of careful administrative supervision that it is intended to apply to other eec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it does not seem that the sum which we have contributed is a not insignificant increase on the previous year <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he is in a position to state what is the amount by which the soviet union are in arrears with their contribution and how many other members of the united nations are also in arrears with their contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords since it appears that the contribution of the soviet union is more in arrears than it was last year and there are a greater number of other delinquents would it be right to assume that by reason of these big arrears of contributions the contributions of those who do pay up such as great britain must necessarily be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply indicating the activities of the united nations for which i am grateful to the minister would it not seem in matters such as the mischievous resolutions based on ideological grounds and the support of the fictional status of an organisation such as the palestinian organisation that it would help members of the united nations if there was a better lead by the representative of the united kingdom towards achieving more in the way of preventing if possible the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the adverse balance of payments the very high deficit on the budget and the current high rate of bank lending all make the suggested corrections of the misfortunes to which the noble lord has referred untimely and that they would be best corrected by higher production and lower or moderate wage agreements <e> <s> is he also in a position to state what proportion of the total national budget is eaten up by two points unemployment pay and the amount paid on the national debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this since eritrea is under the guidance of communist influence and somalia is slanted to the west would it not be advantageousin view of the present exercises of the united states of america in that area to safeguard oil suppliesthat military aid should be given to somalia <e> <s> may i also ask the noble lord this would not the fact that million refugees from russian pressure are in somalia mean that compassion aside expediency and self-interest would justify a greater amount of support than the promised and in view of the self-interest and expediency there would be more dividend from that than from much other of the million aid distributed by us annually in other directions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper and with your lordships indulgence to add that it was of course put down before the publication last week of the figures for the first quarter of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask whether allowing for the understatement of the overstayers and the illegal entrants it would appear from the figures that he has quoted that the total inflow has apparently been at the rate of nearly per annum <e> <s> is the minister aware that in terms of immigration this figure is very distasteful to a very large part of the community and is not in accord with the intentions of the government announced earlier in the year <e> <s> will the minister ask his right honourable friend whether he will consider a review of the question of provision of larger funds for voluntary repatriation particularly in view of both the present state of unemployment and the incidents at bristol <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that dilution of the british race by too large an inflow of non-whites is not in accordance with the feeling of the majority of british subjects in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that probably a large proportion of the voters in this country deplore governmental interference in competitive recreation or sport anywhere <e> <s> is he further aware that in the republic vast numbers of non-whites as well as whites enjoy watching and indeed playing rugby football which is there regarded as an illustration of national prowess <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be brief but it is a fact that this debate offers an opportunity to refer to three countries the second of which was the subject of the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon who has just sat down <e> <s> i admire the eloquence with which he put forward that case and in the few words which i shall subsequently add to the second item i fear i cannot approach the eloquence we have just heard <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original question is it not a fact that all these incursions by south african troops into angola have been provoked by acts of violence from north of the border <e> <s> while having great respect and admiration for the noble lord who asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether any credibility can <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for your lordships indulgence because of my partly worn-out hearing and because of the breakdown in the electrical arrangements which have no doubt denied your lordships the possibility of hearing me properly <e> <s> as i expected therefore i could not hear the totality of the ministers reply i say that without reflection on the obvious clarity with which he must have dealt with the matter <e> <s> i suspect that while he could not agree with my amendment he was courteous enough to explain in not a little detail the reasons why <e> <s> i must therefore postpone my impatience until i have read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask for your lordships indulgence because in spite of the clarity of enunciation of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and owing to my partly worn-out hearing and the breakdown of the amplification arrangements i probably failed to hear in totality the reply which the noble and learned lord was good enough to give <e> <s> i was a very humble officer and member of allenbys british army which liberated the whole of palestine from the occupation of the turks <e> <s> is it not possible that the governments massive influence could be used to ensure that before participation by the plo there should be renunciation of terrorism and its demand for the total elimination of the state of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend to indicate this would seem to be germane to the original question whether the commision for racial equality is also subject to the process of slimming and if so what is the annual cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer is disappointing <e> <s> may i ask him to consider a review of what he said in his answer as regards the time when further action will be taken <e> <s> in view of the monstrous power of these large motor-cycles which is inimical to public safety can he amplify his reply by saying how many prosecutions of motor-cyclists have occurred in the last period for which statistics are available <e> <s> can he also say how many motor-cyclists have been killed and how many members of the public also have been killed in motor-cycle accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it would have made any difference if my question had referred to authority instead of representative since he used it in his reply <e> <s> secondly would it not seem from that that the government did not adequately dissociate themselves from the position of the united nations resolutions <e> <s> may i also ask him whether it is to be understood that the full diplomatic recognition of angola by the united states is dependent on the total removal of all cuban troops <e> <s> and can he give any indication as to when we might expect the contemplated elections in south west africa to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say in more detail in what way the dissociation from the united nations resolution actually occurred <e> <s> also can he give replies to my second and third supplementaries <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the very comprehensive work carried out by the confederation of british industries with regard to all its member firms which have subsidiaries in the republic merits a high tribute <e> <s> is it not a fact that british firms of all alien firms which have subsidiaries in the republic have done more about raising wages than have firms in any other country <e> <s> furthermore is the minister aware that the business notes of barclays bank which must be authoritative show that over the past years the advance in wages for blacks has been continuous on the basis of nearly per cent <e> <s> per annum whereas that for whites has been only per cent <e> <s> per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel privileged to follow the noble lord lord lever of manchester who is a prominent economist whose talent for fluency we so admire and whose contributions are habitually of great service to the policies of the party of which he is a member <e> <s> most speakers have addressed themselves to a fairly wide review of the philosophies and practicalities of economic policy with a contribution of statistics <e> <s> i propose to confine myself to a similar subject <e> <s> however before i do so even though he is not in his seat i should like to apologise to the noble lord the minister of state for leaving the house before he makes his winding-up speech <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be right to understand that all these incursions referred to in the question emanate from provocation from the other side <e> <s> is it not right to assume that the economy of mozambique is largely dependent for its functioning on the rolling stock and the harbour equipment of maputo provided by the republic of south africa <e> <s> also do not the earnings of the citizens of the republic of mozambique who find work in south africa where conditions are more attractive than in their own country contribute to the possibility of a continuation of the proper functioning of the mozambique economy <e> <s> lastly is it not right to assume that we are still giving assistance to that marxist state <e> <s> if that were desisted in we should have more to give in other directions <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that impartiality is the essence of the exercise and that while the united nations are now funding swapo and have resolved that swapo alone is the authentic voice of the people of south-west africa progress must necessarily be slow and difficult for all those participating and particularly for the republic of south africa <e> <s> secondly can he comment on the reports in the press that arms for swapo are of russian origin <e> <s> are they paid for by the united nations or are they given freely to swapo by russia <e>", "<cs> my lords in her remarks the noble baroness lady birk mentioned unemployment <e> <s> since unemployment has been of such importance in the recent history of the port of liverpool will the minister ease the anxiety that exists in the minds of many and which is expressed in press reports that there still remain in the port of liverpool a considerable number of dockers who are not required for work but who still receive full pay <e> <s> what are their numbers and for how lone will this situation continue <e>", "<cs> my lords while aid has been given in respect of refugees from somalia whose problem is very serious would not the minister feel that in view of our long-standing responsibilities for somalia a larger amount of aid for the refugees from there would be more justified than aid which has been given in many other directions <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that the figure which he has just quoted regrettable as it is of empty houses indicates how relatively little the current recession has as yet bitten into the economy by comparison with the official figure for of over empty houses in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that at a moment when there appears to be considerable discussion as to the relative merits of trading with nigeria as against south africa the fact is that in the total trade with nigeria was considerably less than that with the republic of south africa <e> <s> it was only last year that the total trade with nigeria was million as against million with the republic of south africa <e> <s> but the economies of both are equally important and probably the prospect of trade with the south african republic is more encouraging to exporters because they get better paid <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that on this question of research there seems to be an encouragement to private industry but there are many of us in this house who have been associated with research organisations and difficulty will develop should we put too much on to encouragement of private firms to withdraw support from the research organisations <e> <s> withdrawing support from long-established research organisations could mean that there is a danger that there will be less effective research remembering that the research associations distribute so widely the results of their activities <e>", "<cs> my lords in following the noble lord lord irving i should like to record how much i appreciate having had the advantage of listening to the interesting statistics and historical information that he gave us <e> <s> next i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord mansfield on the way in which he combined adequacy and clarity with admirable brevity in presenting the conditions of this bill <e> <s> in the course of his remarks he gave a catalogue of six points which were particulary recommended in the bill <e> <s> for my part i was interested in no <e> <s> which is the point which justifies my own intervention <e> <s> it is with regard to common land <e> <s> there are many cross references necessarily to the act of as is inevitable and there were also necessary references this afternoon to the countryside bill <e> <s> section of the act is amended by the bill but there seems to be no amendment to section <e> <s> there has been liberal indulgence this afternoon by other speakers taking a wide view of the question of forestry rather than strictly concentrating on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister comment on the difference between this country and the united states <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the united states is much more advanced in paying wages otherwise than in cash and therefore in avoiding robberies than is the united kingdom <e> <s> what relationship does this bear to female emancipation in the united states compared with the backwardness of this country <e> <s> whereas we in this chamber are graced by the presence of many fellow members who are ladies in the states there is none in the senate or at least only one from the state of maine <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether that is to be interpreted as meaning that there is not to be any reduction in overseas aid as a whole in line with the need for contraction in every direction <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the united states have by reason of reports of widespread abuse reduced their contributions of overseas aid and that these desires for overseas aid are frequently due to bad relations with contiguous states or improper internal financial arrangement which result in forfeiting the support of the world bank <e>", "<cs> my lords although the ministers first reply to the question was quite clear can he say whether definite instructions have been given to our representative at the united nations that there should be vehement denunciation of this attempt to stop champions in various kinds of recreation moving from one country to another to their own disappointment and to the disappointment of an enormous number of people in other countries who want to admire their achievements <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister in a position to say that the united nations has eased negotiations by revising its resolution that swapo is the sole authoritative voice for all the black african parties in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not to be understood that the democratic turnhalle alliance has yet been granted a hearing by the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise stimulated by the intervention of my noble friend because i urge that there be the most careful consideration given to the development of the proposal and particularly to the largesse given by the opposition <e> <s> as a member of the first electricity board which was charged with the standardisation of frequency of the country i know that we then proceeded to urge the transfer of generating stations from coal to oil <e> <s> one can see what a tremendous and tragic mistake that was <e> <s> so in this case i urge the most careful consideration of high expenditure on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i came into this house this afternoon feeling that the bill was unsatisfactory and could benefit from redrafting <e> <s> i felt it was a minefield of words capable of double interpretation which constitutes a bad bill <e> <s> however after the brilliant catalogue of shortcomings and causes for perplexity about the bill given us by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones i am still more satisfied that it is going to need as has been urged in other directions very considerable discussion and amendment in the course of its passage through the house <e> <s> one point that i want to make particularly is that it seems to emphasise that environment is all-important and heredity unimportant <e> <s> perhaps the faults whatever they may be arise from the shortcomings and ill-judgment of previous bills in and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord does me the compliment of castigating me possibly quite rightly i must accept the inability to reply <e> <s> i must wait until i read <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining in the distress at the damage and injury that have been caused and looking beyond the current discussions and remedies at the root of the trouble i should like to make a suggestion to the minister but may i first with the indulgence of the house explain that i believe there is in this country very strong anxiety about the insufficiency of the reduction of the inflow of ethnic groups other than british <e> <s> my lords for the last or years perhaps in this house i have supported those who have felt very strongly on this matter and who have had concern for what may happen as a result of too large a proportion of other ethnic groups in our country <e> <s> i was brought up in the victorian era when the very presence of a policeman commanded respect and order and at a time whenpatriotismwas a noble word and developed the most respect for britain in the counsels of the world <e> <s> that is what i wanted to say by way of preamble <e>", "<cs> to explain why it seems that these riots which have taken place recently do not contain people who have any respect for britain the police or the monarchy and what it stands for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for that reason that i now urge the minister that he requests his right honourable friend to give consideration to the establishment of a generous fund to encourage voluntary repatriation so lessening the pressure on the services in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the ministers first answer may i ask him to discuss with the secretary of state the possibility that even at the taxpayers expense more publicity should be given to the sentences imposed for rioting associating with that publicity details of the length of time that habitually occurs between the committal of an offence and the sentence being imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment which i thought was put forward with great reasonableness by the mover <e> <s> without going into any details on this point it seems to me that the question of seat belts had wide discussion in previous stages of the bill <e> <s> i refrained from participation though i followed as closely as i could the reasonings put forward <e> <s> but it seems not improper that in this connection there should be reference also to the general question of seat belts and it is on that that i have reservations <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend the minister not agree that there is in the country a very large body of opinion which holds that in the past administrations permitted too large an inflow of people into this country particularly following the illegal entry and the over-staying of permits that there had been <e> <s> would not any further encouragement to a already too large flow into this country only add to the cost and misery of unemployment in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that it is extremely dangerous talk to suggest that there should be any reduction in the reserves <e> <s> with the indulgence of the house may i recall that when i was in another place i was a member of the committee which recommended the setting up of this whole export credit scheme and it certainly would not have been the view of those who recommended this scheme that any such wrong talk should develop and that the reserves should be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the urgings for consideration being given to poland may i ask the minister whether it is to be understood with regard to these external debts which are under discussion and negotiation that any portion of them carries a guarantee for what it is worth by russia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that answer appears inconclusive <e> <s> is it not similarly the case that swapo is in unchallenged receipt of russian support in its aim to develop disruption against the republic of south africa <e> <s> can it really be rewarding to britain to support the bogus statehood represented by these two marxist-funded organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords since it is the repeated policy of her majestys government to aim at negotiation rather than violence and since both these organisations appear dedicated to violence rather than negotiation is it not regrettable that they are both in receipt of support from marxist sources <e>"]
