["<cs> my lords may i thank very much all noble lords who have taken part in the debate on the motion which i moved earlier today <e> <s> i only wish that i could have heard all the learned and stimulating contributions from my noble friends behind me before i had to sit down to try to compose my own contribution <e> <s> may i also thank the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> if that was the performance of a greenhorn <e> <s> i dread to think what he will be like when he has had a little more experience <e> <s> i also thank the noble earl lord gowrie who sat and listened to much of the debate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord might give way <e> <s> he has not given way yet to anybody in his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords unless the noble lord gives way he will not know what i am going to ask him <e> <s> it is extraordinary to make that sort of allegation and not be prepared to support it in any way whatsoever <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord might reconsider giving at least some indication so that those of us who are particularly interested in the examples given can verify them <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kaldor has not spoken for too long because he has left me in the happy position of not having to say some of the things i should have said and of saying several things which i should not have thought of saying about the debate so far <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord rochester who said early in the debate that we have been discussing this kind of subject fairly frequently in recent weeks <e> <s> i have a feeling that the noble earl lord gowrie must be particularly conscious of that <e> <s> i am not sure whether this is the fourth or fifth debate of this kind which he has summed up in the last few weeks <e> <s> i shall be interested to see whether he can think of something new to say and during my brief remarks i shall try to stimulate him into covering some new fields <e> <s> it may be that the fact that we have been discussing this subject rather regularly recently was what led my noble friend lord peart to complain when he rose to speak that the speeches that he had heard did not contain anything very new <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree but i hope the noble lord would agree in turn that it is a lot easier to retrain people and make them competent in engineering if for example they have learned some mathematics some physics and possibly some chemistry at school <e> <s> it is there before one even starts to get people trained or retrained that the cuts which the government have introduced will do the damage <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl and i would agree that we should like to see those scientific subjects retained <e> <s> there may be some other things which if there have got to be cuts the noble earl would say should go first but the fact of the matter is that what is going to happen as is all too often the case is that it will be last in first out <e> <s> where science and contact with local industry have just been introduced into schools inevitably at some extra costs they will be the things which will be lost <e>", "<cs> yes my lords of course there should be a limit <e> <s> that was accepted and quite clearly stated on a number of occasions by the government of which i was a member <e> <s> the noble lord knows that perfectly well <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kaldor said although i do not think the noble lord was present there are some other countries with as high a level of public sector expenditure as this country and many of them are more successful than we are <e>", "<cs> well my lords the noble lord did not indicate disagreement when he nodded to me so i am afraid that like everything else the front bench opposite have got it back to front again <e>", "<cs> my lords i invariably agree with everything that my noble friend says particularly when i am not likely to understand it until i have read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble viscount for repeating this statement and also thank him very much for telling us about the opportunity which we will have to debate the matter at greater length next week <e> <s> no doubt the noble viscount is as pleased as noble lords in all parts of the house that his right honourable friend the secretary of state for industrys u turn yesterday has given us an opportunity to hear this statement and indeed gives the minister responsible for what little is left of regional aid policy to announce the gutting of his responsibilities in person <e> <s> the statement is a long and complicated one particularly the written answer which unfortunately only arrived in the library in your lordships house while the noble viscount was on his feet <e> <s> i have no doubt that everyone will want to study it with care <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble viscount he has now avoided answering a simple and direct question twice having made the statement <e> <s> my noble friend asked him and i ask him if an estimate was made of the numbers of jobs that will be lost as a result of this package of measures what figure was given to the noble viscount by his advisers <e> <s> he has told us that his advisers gave him a figure <e> <s> would he kindly tell the house what figure was given <e>", "<cs> what figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement in his capacity as a minister at the department of industry <e> <s> but i hope he will forgive me for saying that it does not seem to us on this side of the house that the statement is based on any industrial considerations whatsoever nor clearly is it based on any desire to see both parts of our mixed economy public and private successful <e> <s> indeed it seems to be based on the politics of envy <e> <s> as soon as any part of the public sector appears to be being successful it will be flogged off to the private sector to private interests normally at the maximum dis-benefit to the public <e> <s> it is clear that that is what the bulk of the statement is aimed to achieve <e> <s> the public will take the risk and private interests will get the benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is unable to say what the substantial reduction in the nebs expenditure will be as apparently he is would he agree with me that it is to say the least extremely irresponsible for the government to come to parliament and make statements about substantial reductions in expenditure when apparently they have not even begun to work out what kind of reductions and what scale of reductions they are speaking of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount very much for his clear explanation of the seven changes which this order introduces and to welcome very much the fact that we have moved on from some rather controversial exchanges across the floor of the house on various statements which the noble viscount has had to make in recent days to a scheme on which there is a very large measure of agreement in fact total agreement on both sides <e> <s> for my part i welcome the various changes which the government are making and which the noble viscount has explained to us while at the same time regretting the necessity as i am sure the government and the noble viscount do for a scheme of this kind and the generally gloomy prospects which continue to face shipbuilding throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i regret to have to say to the noble viscount that he has been able only to come to your lordships house and make a statement of extreme vagueness <e> <s> the only likely effect will be to create further grave uncertainty this time in two major and extremely important sectors of the british economy <e> <s> if i give just one example the statement says incredibly that the government will retain about half of the shareholdings in british aerospace <e> <s> the noble viscount knows very well that the crucial question is whether the government will retain over half or under half <e> <s> to say about half seems to me to be an extraordinary statement <e> <s> perhaps the noble viscount will tell us what effect he expects that that vagueness will have on the ability of british aerospace to sell these shares and hopefully raise money for the desperately needed future investment in this industry which it is clear that the government do not intend to provide <e> <s> as i think the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is not able to answer all the questions my noble friend put to him in particular about the views of those working in the industry the noble viscount may be finding it a little embarrassing to continually get up and not answer a series of questions asked by my noble friends may i take him back to one question which i asked him which he did not answer that is whether british aerospaces management have expressed any views on the effect that this statement will have on the capacity of the british aerospace industry to take part in the manufacture of future generations of civil aircraft <e> <s> may i put just one other point to the noble viscount <e> <s> he suggested that it was nationalisation which had caused the uncertainty in the aerospace industry <e> <s> the noble viscount may not remember but in the arguments we had in your lordships house on the nationalisation of british aerospace the government of the day and i on behalf of the government constantly put forward the view that there was a good industrial argument for rationalising the industry which is what we did in that bill <e> <s> would the noble viscount not agree that the government have fully accepted that and that no uncertainty was caused by it because they are leaving british aerospace intact while flogging off the profitable parts of it in conditions which will lead to the greatest public loss <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i should like to thank the noble viscount for repeating another depressing and gloomy statement on a major sector of british industry <e> <s> once again as i think has been the case with a number of statements which the noble viscount has made it has in fact been possible to find out rather more about the governments policy and decisions by reading the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for giving us the detailed information that he has in following up the statement <e> <s> i should like to make two quick points <e> <s> first on subsidies the noble viscount acknowledged that when i referred to our competitors and the level of subsidies which they give the countries i mentioned were not in the eec in the case of spain not yet in the eec <e> <s> but in his answer to my point he concentrated almost exclusively if not exclusively on the position within the eec <e> <s> in talking about the lack of information or the difficulty of obtaining <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to those of all the other noble lords who have spoken to the noble duke on his maiden speech <e> <s> the difficulty with speaking so late in the debate is that there is really nothing left to say in congratulating a maiden speaker so i shall not attempt to do so <e> <s> something that he said struck a chord in my own mind when he talked about downgrading local hospitals which as he may know is something with which i had some concern when i was a minister in northern ireland <e> <s> he suggested that it would be a good idea to get the opinion of local medical experts to get a consensus from them on the desirability or otherwise of taking certain action at a particular hospital <e> <s> all i can suggest to him is that if he can find two medical experts anywhere in northern ireland who are prepared to agree on any medical <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that there has been some feeling in northern ireland that to some extent the report has been shelved <e> <s> despite the very satisfactory number of copies of the report which have been circulated will the noble lord go a little further than he did in his original answer and say whether the government consider the present arrangements for managing schools in northern ireland to be satisfactory or whether when they have heard everybodys comments they would like to make some changes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the cuts in public expenditure and the effect on local authorities which these are already having one local authority has apparently decided to stop having any nursery school places at all will greatly increase the number of mothers who feel that they need to use illegal and inadequate facilities such as those referred to in this question <e> <s> what plans do the government have to deal with the crisis which they are themselves responsible for creating <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning tax evasion could the noble lord tell us how much public money is recovered per member of staff engaged on this work and how that compares with the amount of public money recovered by each member of staff engaged on work against social security abuses <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming as i am sure all noble lords do the action that the government have taken may i ask whether the noble lord would agree that the list of readily recognisable parts and derivatives which he mentioned was drawn up very largely with the help of the voluntary bodies in this country <e> <s> will the government now take note of the widespread concern of the voluntary bodies that the customs are not giving the priority in this country that they should to controlling the import of parts of endangered species <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that while the developed countries and this country in particular do not give a sufficient priority to controlling such imports it is a little unfair to point the finger at developing countries such as kenya and say that they ought to take further steps to control illegal trade <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the voluntary bodies have been saying to his department the department of the environment for many years that the customs in this country have not been giving the priority to controlling this illegal trade that they should <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i was not suggesting that the department of the environment were showing anything less than extreme enthusiasm for implementing these international controls <e> <s> i welcome the lead which this country has taken in the negotiations over international conventions <e> <s> however in view of the widespread concern about the problems of the rhinoceros i wonder whether the noble lord would agree to look again at the priority which the customs and excise give to controlling the import of endangered species and their products <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl remind us how this countrys number of days lost in industrial disputes in and compared with those lost in other western european countries in view of the statistics given for last year by the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am conscious that given the late hour it falls to me to set a good example in brevity to back-bench speakers <e> <s> i will do my best to do so <e> <s> following on what the noble lord lord hampton has said i am conscious also given the subject that we are debating and the time at which we <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that both farmers and those interested in the wildlife and amenity aspects of the countryside are united in agreeing that what the noble lord has described as streamlined and simplified procedures will damage farming amenity and wildlife interests <e> <s> will he give the house an assurance that as this is a consultative document and i am glad that he has stressed that the government will consult with voluntary organisations concerned with wildlife and amenity aspects in the countryside before coming to any decisions on the proposed changes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a contribution from the noble baroness from the point of view of a social worker and from two noble lords who have spoken the legal point of view <e> <s> i should like very briefly to add my voice from the point of view of somebody who was responsible for the department of health and social services in northern ireland for two and a half years <e> <s> in that period i certainly became very much aware of the sense of injustice the sense of frustration and the sense of bewilderment that many parents who had had their children taken away from them and placed in care felt because of the lack of legal representation to which my noble friend has drawn attention in this question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord if he is leaving that point <e> <s> he spoke of an appreciable burden on the legal aid fund <e> <s> would he care to quantify that more clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with others in thanking my noble friend lord ritchie-calder for initiating this debate <e> <s> i am not sure how convenient or inconvenient the timing has actually proved to be <e> <s> however we shall at least have the opportunity to hear from the minister some fairly up-to-date information and had the debate taken place a few days earlier i have the feeling that we would have received a more frustrating reply at the end of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but if he is leaving the question of whales and sperm whale oil i hope he will accept that for a number of years now the americans have had a complete ban on the importation of sperm whale oil and effective substitutes for all the uses to which that oil was put have been found by companies in the united states and so that excuse <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that for many people living in the local authorities that he is attacking including lambeth and other london boroughs the actions that those local authorities are taking represent the one bright spot in a sea of gloom and destruction being wreaked by the government on social services and other services of the working people <e> <s> it is absolutely disgraceful for him to say that these local authorities are giving local government a bad name when they are doing quite the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the noble lord that the government were taking a positive line so far as whaling is concerned at last weeks conference at brighton would he agree that in fact last week saw a series of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply which i am sure will be warmly welcomed by everybody in this country who wishes to see whales survive for the future <e> <s> but may just press the noble lord a little further and ask him whether he will ensure that this countrys commissioner at next years international whaling commission mr packer and the non-governmental organisations in this country concerned with these issues can start discussions earlier than they were able to this year and will he also ensure that the british government take steps to put some pressure on governments like canada south africa and others who last week played such a major part in continuing to ensure the extinction of the whales <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the noble earl has suggested that we should debate the first four orders and my prayer against one order which otherwise would not have been subject to debate because it was subject only to a negative resolution procedure in one block which i am sure will be for the convenience of the house <e> <s> i hope <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am not sure that he was able to be present in the chamber when i was speaking <e> <s> obviously what he has said affects in particular the prayer that i have put down on the order paper <e> <s> i wonder whether he can confirm that these orders as i have suggested amount to another precedent that your lordships house does not normally consider controversial subordinate legislation in advance of another place <e> <s> that is a practice which is unlike the rather novel practice which the noble lord the leader has put forward that the house does not divide against orders which in my brief experience it frequently has <e> <s> but the regular practice is that we do not consider controversial orders before another place and these orders break that precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made a very interesting point <e> <s> if farmers are in fact able having got advice from adas to have some guarantee which is what the noble earl seems to be saying that they would at the end of the day get the grant what on earth difference does introducing these orders make <e> <s> if the noble earl is saying that farmers will be able to get prior approval and no staff savings would result from these orders the government had better drop them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble earl for that reply and <e>", "<cs> my lords even though the proposals in the strutt report may be of a non-statutory nature may ask the minister if he is aware that the proposed wildlife and countryside bill will contain proposals according to the information paper which will be designed to safeguard wildlife habitats <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of the urgency of introducing legislation to provide that protection given the nature conservancy councils estimate that per cent <e> <s> of sites of special scientific interest are being lost each year so that therefore given that the bill has already been delayed one year per cent <e> <s> of irreplaceable wildlife habitat in this country has already been lost <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side are grateful to the noble lord lord bellwin for his comprehensive introduction to what is a major and quite complicated piece of legislation and we certainly welcome the bill as a major opportunity to legislate on a wide range of important issues that affect the countryside and wildlife <e> <s> we also look forward to the two maiden speakers the bill has attracted <e>", "<cs> my lords before that goes on the record i hope that the noble viscount will allow me to say that the rook is a seriously declining species in this country and people should be discouraged from thinning out rookeries in the way he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> he has made <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that if i may say so is slightly different <e> <s> i do not want to prolong the debate at this hour <e> <s> it is slightly different because a tree preservation order is not the responsibility of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> the noble lord appeared to be suggesting that the nature conservancy council had been clearly in breach of its statutory duties by designating an area as a sssi without inspecting it <e> <s> i take it that he has now withdrawn that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made a very important new announcement and if he is now moving away from that point i wonder whether it can be made clear whether the intention would then be for the local authority to be able to contradict and find in the opposite sense to the inspector at the local public inquiry or would that decision be final <e>", "<cs> i also listened with great care to what the noble lord said in introducing the amendment and i had assumed that the intention behind the amendment was quite different <e> <s> if the noble earl is to write to his noble friend could he possibly copy the correspondence to us so that we may be a little more enlightened on the actual effect of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear what the noble lord lord renton said and while i agree that he has raised a quite major issue which would need careful scrutiny throughout the bill if it were accepted i rise to make an additional point which was due to be raised on later amendments that we have tabled to the maximum penalties in the clause where they are spelt out <e> <s> i notice in other recent acts of parliament that reference is made to the statutory maximum laid down in the criminal law act the year of which escapes me temporarily but no doubt other noble lords and particularly lord renton will know the act to which i am referring <e> <s> i understand that that has the enormous advantage that penalties are increased for a whole range of offences to keep pace with inflation and the changing value of money <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support the noble earl lord cranbrook <e> <s> as i understand the position perhaps this is what the noble earl was going to say when he stopped speaking and so i shall say it myself and he or the government can contradict me if i am wrong this proposal would cover the situation in which a number of birds would be placed where the mother bird and the young would leave the nest as soon as possible after the eggs have been hatched for fairly obvious reasons of safety <e> <s> this is true of common game birds many waders and other birds <e> <s> the phrase while in or near the nest would not i understand be appropriate for those species whereas the word dependent certainly would be <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earls amendment makes much more sense as he said it meets a situation in which many young birds will find themselves and i <e>", "<cs> it may not be disputed as the noble earl says in any of the eec directives but as the noble lord lord beaumont and my noble friend <e>", "<cs> now that the noble lord lord mackie has drawn attention to the fact that the law is being broken in that particular part of scotland i have no doubt that the authorities will follow up the matter very speedily <e> <s> i would not accept <e>", "<cs> i should like quickly to turn to the point made by the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard about the possibility of shooting things which it was illegal to shoot <e> <s> i understood the noble viscount to say that was not likely to happen because <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will have to study the list in <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but can he confirm that while the majority may have taken that view the advisory committee were quite seriously split in giving this advice to the government <e>", "<cs> if i may say so it is a little unfair of the noble lord to throw what happens in europe at me <e> <s> i am being consistent <e> <s> the committee decided on a previous amendment that it did not wish to follow the rest of europe <e> <s> i am simply taking a lead from the committee <e> <s> the noble lord was the one who insisted that we should not do what the rest of europe does and despite the fact that there is at least one other country in europe where sunday shooting is not permitted i thought that i and not the noble lord was the one who was in tune with the general feeling of the committee as regards this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make the point to the noble viscount that there are a half a million bird watchers in the united kingdom men women and children <e> <s> i daresay that some of them are working men but under this government most of them may be not working <e> <s> i was trying to achieve an equality between the rights and interests of those half a million people and the rights and interests of those who shoot <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the somewhat equivocal i am not sure whether support is the right word attitude adopted by the government <e> <s> i must say given how much we have heard from the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that it is a shame that he is not here to press scotlands case <e> <s> i am a little suprised that those who have been pressing for us to follow scotland in other respects have not followed me on these amendments <e> <s> i do not think that this is something that i would wish to divide the committee on at this stage but i should like to consider what has been said in the debate and come back to the matter at the report stage <e> <s> it seems to me that there really is a rather good case to be made out for what i am proposing and that it would be well worth including this sort of degree of consistency in the bill <e> <s> but for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that any of us are satisfied on this matter <e> <s> like my noble friend i can see what was the intention in drafting the clause but i hope that the government will agree to have another think about this question <e> <s> for one thing the advisory body will be made up of representatives of many different organisations and as we shall see when we discuss this point we shall have no guarantees as to who will and who will not be on the advisory body nor indeed will there be a guarantee that any particular organisations will be represented <e> <s> even if they are represented they might be represented by only one person among a great many people on the advisory body which might then come to a view with which that person and the voluntary movement as a whole disagree <e>", "<cs> but i think and i am subject to correction about this on the very occasion the noble lord mentions it was in fact the rspb which pressed for the minister to take this decision and i think i am right in saying that at least some of the other people consulted if not the ncc the advisory body but the noble earl speaking for the government may correct me on this were not in favour <e> <s> my recollection is that it was the rspb which successfully pressed the minister to take that action and that a number of other groups or organisations which were consulted were not in favour of it <e> <s> it seems to me that that occasion strengthens the argument from this side rather than weakens it <e>", "<cs> we may be getting into more of a tangle than this subsection justifies but the more i have listened to different contributions including that from the noble earl lord avon the more it has struck me that it might well be useful to make a slightly longer list as my noble friend was suggesting in his previous amendment and include representatives of people interested in the conservation of species but to give the secretary of state slightly more dis <e>", "<cs> these raise exactly the same points as the amendments which were moved earlier amendment no <e> <s> and some following <e> <s> we are entirely happy with the governments suggestions so long as <e>", "<cs> may i just make one point lo the noble duke about subsection because as i understand it and perhaps the noble lord lord sandys will be able to confirm this that subsection is redundant because clause provides the opportunity for local authorities owners and occupiers to object to this procedure and indeed it enables the secretary of state to call a local public inquiry <e> <s> more important perhaps than some of the other things in subsection it requires the secretary of state to consult with an advisory body which of course is very important as well <e> <s> so i think that the noble duke will find there are provisions elsewhere in the bill which cover subsection <e>", "<cs> i may be completely misunderstanding this clause <e> <s> but my noble friend corrected himself and the noble lord lord sandys does not appear to have accepted that correction <e> <s> he seems to be agreeing with the noble viscount lord thurso that this clause provides powers for the secretary of state to prevent somebody from changing the habitat from ploughing up something and so on <e> <s> but so far as i can see it does not <e> <s> it covers the killing and injuring of wild birds the taking and destroying of eggs and so on <e> <s> it is not a habitat protection clause <e> <s> i do not see where the noble lord is getting all this from about interfering with farming operations <e> <s> that is not in this clause <e> <s> as he himself pointed out that comes later in the bill <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is getting some advice maybe i could ask him another question which would give that advice a little more time in which to arrive <e> <s> it concerns the point at the end of amendment no <e> <s> which covers the existing bird sanctuaries which were brought into force by the protection of birds act <e> <s> it seemed to us when looking at the bill that there might be a question that those existing orders would not remain in force after the passing of the bill <e> <s> clearly that cannot be the governments intention <e> <s> i do not think there is any question of that <e> <s> it may be simply that i have misunderstood the provisions of the clause or that that is something which the government could take away and check on either now while advice is on its way or subsequently <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord it seems to me is misleading us if he says that we should look at clause <e> <s> clause deals with sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> although it is quite inadequate to the task it is nevertheless designed to prevent people from altering the habitat of particular areas <e> <s> the clause we are dealing with is nothing to do with that <e> <s> as i said before and i thought the noble lord then agreed with me the clause we are dealing with is to do with killing injuring and taking wild birds taking or destroying the eggs of such birds i am looking at the top of page of the bill and the disturbing of a wild bird while it is building a nest <e> <s> with great respect this has nothing to do with clause <e>", "<cs> i would simply like to say that i do not think the noble lord lord stanley is right in saying that it is always possible to find the owner of every piece of land <e> <s> indeed the one case where the nature conservancy council have used their powers of compulsory purchase which they have had since they were set up was where it was not possible to find the owner of a particular piece of land and it was necessary to go through the compulsory purchase procedure to settle the question of the title to the land and ownership <e> <s> so in fact there has been what is possibly rather a notorious case since some would have liked to see the nature conservancy council use those powers rather more frequently <e> <s> nevertheless there has been a very well known case which is directly relevant to this bill where it was not possible to find the owner of a piece of land and it was necessary in that case to use the compulsory purchase procedure to settle the question <e>", "<cs> at times we have seemed to be getting into rather a muddle on clause and i thought it would be useful to remind the committee of and to ask the government about a couple of questions concerning the powers which relate to the special protection areas the bird sanctuary areas <e> <s> the clause creates these areas of special protection but as i have already said it is important to remember that this special protection relates solely to the killing or taking of birds their nests or eggs and so on and not to the destruction of their habitats <e>", "<cs> yes that is certainly the assurance i was looking for <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving it <e>", "<cs> from my understanding of the matter i should like very strongly to support my noble friends amendment <e> <s> the objection to these few lines of the bill is twofold firstly that we are not talking about ringing we are talking about capturing birds to see whether they have rings on them and to examine the rings <e> <s> it seems to me that in practice that is only likely to happen in circumstances where people are ringing birds and therefore operating under licence <e> <s> in other words almost all retraps as i think they are known by the experts occur when somebody is catching birds to ring them either in a net or in a specially designed trap <e> <s> if they were catching birds to ring them they would be doing so under licence and they would of course be qualified licensed ringers <e> <s> in those circumstances some of the birds they catch usually very few would have rings on them they would catch the bird examine the ring take details and release the bird again <e> <s> that activity is covered already and you do not need this paragraph of the bill to do that <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend because i was mistaken <e> <s> in fact with art eye on the clock i was so busy wondering when i was going to get my supper that i was not looking at the bill carefully enough <e> <s> this paragraph is a great deal worse it seems to me than i had suggested <e> <s> ringing is of course a highly complicated and difficult activity <e> <s> my understanding is that a qualified ringer would need to catch about birds under very careful and expert supervision before being allowed to ring on his own <e> <s> it seems to me that this paragraph completely undermines that type of very careful and professional training of people and i would hope that the government would agree to its deletion <e>", "<cs> no but what has always been very difficult about enforcing this legislation is that at that stage one is then faced with the defence well it was bred in captivity <e> <s> i know that when we come on to ringing we are tightening up the position <e> <s> but it would be most unfortunate on the very rare occasions when somebody manages to catch an individual taking something actually at the nest or close to it for us to have provided unwittingly a rather good defence to that action <e> <s> for myself i am grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for the action that he has undertaken to take <e>", "<cs> i apologise for arriving just after the noble lord had said which amendments he was going to take together but as there are an awful lot on this particular point i wonder whether it would not be simpler to take the amendment which is down in the names of myself my noble friend and the noble lord lord beaumont after we have dealt with the substantive point with which the noble lord is dealing that is the re-drafting of this particular defence or let-out or however one wants to describe it because it seems to us that our amendment will apply whichever of the various options is selected <e> <s> it seems to me to be <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord has moved amendment no <e> <s> so he cannot avoid that <e> <s> i should have thought that nos <e> <s> and were relevant and the removal of the definition of livestock which i think is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> they i should have thought would come into this part <e> <s> then whether we decide on paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have managed to get some advice and i now realise that if amendment no <e> <s> is passed then amendment no will not be called so we need to debate amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am therefore very grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for suggesting it and i am happy to fall in with his suggestion <e> <s> i shall be happy to hear what he has to say before i make my own observations <e>", "<cs> may i first of all ask the noble lord lord sandys two questions about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as he said this follows the wording more or less and in parts of the eec directive article <e> <s> in particular the wording of paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes that is the case <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was designed to be attached to paragraph <e>", "<cs> that is extremely helpful <e> <s> where does that definition appear in the bill <e> <s> that is my only question <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to that intervention wood pigeons are a very bad example because they are not covered here <e> <s> secondly it has been shown by detailed research that all the shooting ever did was to reduce the number that died by starvation during the winter <e> <s> that is why many years ago the government removed the reduced price cartridges which were then available for shooting wood pigeons <e> <s> it had absolutely no effect on the total number of breeding wood pigeons in this country <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to what noble lords have said about my amendment <e> <s> it may be that the examples which i gave took us off at a slight tangent <e> <s> everyone has assumed that the problem of herons at fish farms and of geese on winter wheat would be dealt with under the licensing provisions <e> <s> i have not heard from noble lords who are unhappy about my amendment any examples of the kind of action they would need to take quickly where they would not have tried all other reasonable methods of preventing the damage before they killed a protected bird <e> <s> it would be fair to me to have a few examples to go on before i withdrew my amendment <e>", "<cs> that is a misunderstanding of the amendment <e> <s> that would quite clearly be legal under the terms of the amendment there would be no other effective means of preventing that damage <e> <s> there would be no question of going to anyone for permission <e> <s> it would be open to the authorised person immediately to shoot the gull in question <e> <s> my amendment would not alter that position one jot so that is not a very good example <e>", "<cs> that is not a very good example either because the crow is a pest species and is not so affected by this bill <e> <s> it is fair for me to ask noble lords to give me an example which affects my amendment before they ask me to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> for myself i am grateful for what the noble lord has said about the wording in amendment no <e> <s> and i should like to study what he has said and possibly take my own legal advice on his legal advice if i can get any before the report stage <e> <s> what he said was a substantial reassurance to me because up to that point i felt that i had not been given any examples of where my amendment would lead to problems <e> <s> for instance i am sorry to tell the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that there are not any geese in schedule <e> <s> the particular thing we are talking about applies only to the birds listed in schedule so his example was not a particularly good one <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble lord can explain why there is an or at the end of paragraph <e>", "<cs> in clause it is at the end of <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl looks at line on page and line he will see an or in both lines and there is even an or in line <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl should be a little more generous and accept my amendment <e> <s> if he wants to delete it at report stage he can do so <e>", "<cs> unfortunately it was deleted <e> <s> if the noble earl had been able to accept my amendment no <e> <s> he would have got an or <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it was unforeseen in drafting the amendment <e> <s> in fact that was the intention of the amendment if somebody cutting a hedge knew that there was a nest of a specially protected species in the hedgerow then he should not cut it in a way that destroyed that nest <e> <s> that seems to me to be perfectly reasonable <e> <s> we are talking about a very limited number of specially protected species in the same way as when we come later in the bill we are talking about a very limited number of protected animals and plants <e> <s> if someone knew that in a particular bank there happened to be a number of orchids which were protected under the act is the noble lord really saying to the committee that as long as when they ploughed particularly close to the bank and destroyed all those orchids it was simply incidental to the ploughing that was perfectly all right and none of us <e>", "<cs> again as the noble earl lord cranbrook has said one needs to look at schedule <e> <s> in my experience of growing lucern none of the birds listed there have ever come anywhere near the field to feed nest or do anything else in it <e> <s> i do not think it is all that likely <e> <s> i personally was very grateful for the suggestion that the noble lord lord sandys made <e> <s> i am certainly not wedded to unforseen indeed i think that it was the noble lord lord mackie or at least one noble lord from behind me somewhere who suggested that it would be difficult to take reasonable steps to avoid something which was unforeseen <e> <s> it seemed to be a rather telling point which i therefore did not respond to <e> <s> but i should be most grateful if we could adopt the suggestion made by the noble lord lord sandys <e> <s> for myself i would happily withdraw the amendment <e> <s> we could look at the particular wording of incidental and no doubt somebody could think of a much better alternative than unforeseen before we reach the report stage <e>", "<cs> we have had a very good and thorough debate on these two sets of amendments for which i am very grateful <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley suggested although i had not in my mind originally necessarily seen them as alternatives it is clear to me now that amendments nos <e> <s> and either one or the other could be moved into the bill <e> <s> however the noble lord lord sandys some time ago kindly offered to look at this matter before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> on that basis i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may lend my support very briefly to the noble lord <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be useful to consider this <e> <s> i take the point that it might be possible to define exactly or a little more precisely what sort of catapult one was talking about <e> <s> presumably a rubber band stretched between two fingers is not the sort of thing that the noble lord had in mind but something rather more substantial capable of firing metal pellets or whatever <e> <s> i would hope that <e>", "<cs> could the noble earl give us some advice about this as none of us have that act in front of us <e> <s> i understood him to say that this applies in the case of anybody who aids abets or encourages in other words this applies to anybody taking active steps in the commission of the offence <e> <s> for a landowner simply to say to his keeper get on with it and dont tell me what youre doing would not so far as i know bring the landowner within the compass of that provision and certainly has not led to any prosecutions since the magistrates courts act was passed in <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that the noble earl would tell me the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment if i may say so to the noble earl i thought that coming towards the end of our proceedings this evening the answer he gave was an extraordinarily unsatisfactory one <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite appalling when we all know and as the noble lord lord beaumont said everybody in your lordships house who lives in the countryside on all sides of the committee knows perfectly well that this goes on in a large number of areas and the bodies which are concerned with investigating and detecting these offences know for example that on some particular estates thankfully a minority but nevertheless on some there have been repeated instances of pole trapping and poisoning of very rare birds over a long period of time and it has not been possible under the magistrates courts act or any existing legislation to prosecute those who are actually responsible namely the landowner the employer <e> <s> there are many other acts of parliament which place absolute liability with no possibility of a defence of any sort on the employers for the actions of their servants and my noble friend mentioned a couple of those <e> <s> to my mind that is what the noble lord lord beaumont ought to be suggesting here but he is not <e>", "<cs> i can see that some limitation along the lines that the noble earl has suggested would be welcome to him and others who take his point of view <e> <s> it would be a pity if we lost the very useful provisions in parts of the bill because people were frightened about the degree to which they might be extended no matter how desirable or indeed undesirable one thought such extensions to be <e> <s> however the two mechanisms by which the noble earl and the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton have chosen to try to meet the point seem to me themselves to give rise to problems and i shall welcome hearing what the government have to say on this <e> <s> first it seems to me that the proposal in amendment no <e> <s> would rule out some of the provisions already in the bill <e> <s> the eec directive clearly contains some methods of killing which are banned on grounds other than those of conservation <e> <s> i think that it was clear from the first day of the committee that a number of noble lords shared views across the chamber on a number of methods of killing things which they thought should be outlawed by the bill for other than simply conservation reasons <e> <s> whether the reason might be that noble lords did not like themselves or their families being shot at with air guns or whether there were other reasons there were other factors which we wished as a whole to take into account and which it seems to me the amendment would simply rule out <e> <s> i think that the noble earl was also speaking to amendment no <e>", "<cs> i was wondering whether noble lords were going to speak at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> which it seemed to me had the same objective though i might be wrong about that <e> <s> i think i have said enough on amendment no <e> <s> and i look forward to hearing what the noble earl lord avon has to say <e>", "<cs> i nearly got on to this when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> again we on this side of the committee do not have any strong objection to the point which noble lords opposite are getting <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for that offer and will certainly withdraw the amendment on that basis <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend is right <e> <s> another answer to this would be for the government as we hope they will to accept our series of amendments which received widespread support on rationalising the close season for a number of species <e> <s> that would very satisfactorily deal with this matter <e> <s> then we could have a common date in this part of the bill <e> <s> this seems to me simply to support arguments which a number of noble lords on both sides of the committee put forward last week <e> <s> perhaps the government could also consider that matter when they consider as they promised to do a number of amendments on that aspect of the bill <e>", "<cs> given that paragraph <e>", "<cs> now that the noble lord lord beaumont has explained his amendments it seems to me that he has a good point <e> <s> as i understand it he is not removing the -hour period in clause <e>", "<cs> naturally we are grateful to the noble earl lord cranbrook for his somewhat qualified support <e> <s> i am not entirely clear that i agree with him that this is a uniquely british approach <e> <s> my understanding is that generally internationally in a number of different ways people have been pushing for the adoption of a reverse listing approach for example in the cities convention which deals with trade in endangered species <e> <s> the generally preferred approach it may not have been adopted generally yet but it <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the government in arguing as the noble earl has that this is a conservation bill and not a protection bill are really in extremely difficult waters <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the bill re-enacts the protection of birds acts and all we are trying to do by this amendment is to treat mammals amphibians and reptiles in exactly the same way as the government are proposing that birds should be treated <e> <s> for the noble earl to get up and be asked to say that this is not quite the approach that the government arc adopting in the bill seems to me if i may say so an argument somewhat of despair and the last resort because it seems to me more seriously that there really is not an intelligent and sensible argument against what is being proposed in this amendment which is logical and rational <e>", "<cs> i was misleading the committee <e> <s> deer as game would continue to be covered by separate acts <e> <s> i was making the point that to pretend that the existing approach to mammals is a simple one seems to me to be misleading <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out to my noble friend and to others who have spoken about the goldeneye and the scaup that the principle as i understand it that has been adopted in protecting birds and putting them on schedule is not that a bird which is capable of being confused with any other which is shot is not eligible for schedule because it seems to me that a number of other birds which are on schedule would not be there if that were the case <e> <s> noble lords will remember that when we discussed night shooting a great deal was made of a sportsmans ability to tell by the light of the moon the difference between various species of duck so i would not with respect have thought there was much of an argument against scaup and goldeneye on that ground particularly as i would have thought they were fairly easily recognisable in comparison with some other duck <e>", "<cs> may i make two further points to the noble earl lord avon <e> <s> first it seems to me that on a number of these species there was fairly widespread feeling that it was simply not right that they should be on a list of things that were shot <e> <s> much as we would all feel that there are plenty of nightingales it would not be particularly appropriate for them to be on a list of species to be shot <e> <s> the noble earl has very kindly said that points made on all sides will be taken into account and that sentiment which seemed to me to be fairly common among many noble lords who spoke could be considered <e>", "<cs> i should like if i may to raise one point on the question whether schedule shall stand part <e> <s> there is one bird which we have not dealt with but about which i must say i feel very strongly <e> <s> i think that i gave the noble earl lord avon some notice of this matter and i hoped that he might be able to give us a brief response so that i could consider whether to move an amendment at the next stage or not <e> <s> the concern which i have is for the sparrowhawk which as i understand it is being removed by the bill from the schedule where it used to be <e> <s> i have certainly had a number of representations from the scottish wildlife trust and from others emphasising that the sparrow-hawk is still first of all extremely rare and secondly much persecuted and wrongly so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful indeed to the noble earl for that response <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> the numbers which i have are compiled by reference to the county bird reports which give them a fairly reasonable base of accuracy <e> <s> the numbers were very small compared with some of the other species we have been considering <e>", "<cs> it is very helpful to have those figures from the noble earl <e> <s> i shall be able to compare them with my sources <e> <s> we agree at the bottom end of the range <e> <s> my figure at the bottom end is but it only goes up to <e> <s> obviously the noble earl knows more optimistic birdwatchers than i do <e> <s> upon the assurance that the government will have a look at this point and refer it to the advisory committee i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot help feeling that my noble friend may be making a little more of this than it warrants <e> <s> when somebody was going to shoot on somebody elses land i think the normal practice would be for the person allowing him to shoot in other words making him an authorised person to say go and shoot wood pigeon and if you see a crow or a jay you can have a shot at that but for heavens sake dont shoot at any hawks <e> <s> that would be fairly normal and i think it would meet the point that my noble friend is making <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl lord avon responds if he is going to do so i should like to say that it seems to me that the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton is being a little unfair on the minister <e> <s> after all we have had a number of other debates where there has been a fairly unanimous view that birds ought to be moved from one schedule to another or removed or added and we have taken a line on all of those that it is reasonable for the government to say that they would like to go away and consult the advisory committee who i think a lot of us may feel have taken a wrong decision on a number of different birds and who the noble lord lord mowbray obviously thinks have taken the wrong one on this <e> <s> it is clear from this side of the committee that we are not making any great argument about that <e> <s> we would not think the case is as strong as some other noble lords may think by any manner of means <e> <s> nevertheless there is no great dissention <e>", "<cs> may i say something to the noble lord about the barn owl <e> <s> as i understood it he said that there was no evidence to suggest that the large trade which he rightly says there is in barn owls is being supported by birds taken from the wild <e> <s> my understanding is that the bto the british trust ornithology ringers regularly find young barn owls in nests with rings on them which demonstrates that somebody has gone along to the nest and put a ring on a wild bred bird so that later he can go and take the bird put it in an aviary at home and sell it <e> <s> i would suggest that there is some considerable evidence at least in the case of that bird which is the one so far as i know in which there is the biggest trade that birds are illegally taken from the wild <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i disagree with the noble duke and with my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord lord sandys or whoever is going to respond will deal with the problems which i think it would give rise to so far as the eec directive is concerned <e> <s> my own feeling is that a number of these species in schedule part i could be killed in large numbers were there a commercial market for them and that would be undesirable <e> <s> more than that i think it would not he something welcomed by most wildfowlers <e> <s> there is a danger if some of these duck and geese and other species are shot or killed in very large numbers that it would bring the sport of wildfowling which is not about shooting huge numbers of duck and geese into disrepute and it would not reflect well on those who have this sport at heart <e> <s> that was one of the reasons why this sort of prohibition on the sale of certain species was first introduced <e> <s> my information is that it has worked very well since and i would hope that in this respect the government will leave the bill as drafted <e>", "<cs> probably not by the geese <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly and strongly to support the noble lord lord craigton in the purpose behind this amendment <e> <s> this is a desperately serious problem <e> <s> bats are not everybodys most popular animal but they deserve to be they do nothing but good for human beings in the insects which they consume and the occasional additional loft insulation which their droppings supply <e> <s> they are completely harmless and do not do anything to live up to the ridiculously bad image they have and they are suffering appallingly at the moment <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl can assure us after he has taken advice that to give this sort of treatment to the roof would be prohibited within the bill that would be a major advance <e> <s> my own inclination is to agree with the noble lord lord craigton that at the moment it is not covered and should be <e> <s> but it would not need very much to meet the point <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i think he has answered my point <e> <s> my example was not a relevant one but the only thing i could think of <e> <s> if he would let me know if my purpose is not met i would be very grateful otherwise i will assume that it is to save him writing unnecessary letters <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the intention behind lord gridleys amendment <e> <s> as he <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble earl was in the chamber at the time but although amendment no <e> <s> was quite complicated we did about amendments at once and fairly briefly too <e>", "<cs> the noble earl moved a very important and significant series of amendments <e> <s> the intention behind them is certainly one that we would welcome and strongly support <e> <s> the noble earl was kind enough to give some support to my noble friend and myself when we moved our amendment on reverse listing amendment no <e> <s> and a long series of other amendments <e> <s> having listened carefully to what the noble earl has to say we would prefer our approach <e> <s> it seems to us to have the enormous advantages of simplicity and of compatibility with the first part of the bill on the protection of birds <e>", "<cs> may i intervene briefly <e> <s> the noble earl called in aid what i had said but i should like everybody to be clear that my worry about an additional schedule was simply in relation to the advantages of reverse listing for mammals reptiles and amphibians which we proposed earlier and which seemed to me to solve many of the problems to which the noble earl was drawing our attention <e> <s> i was only saying that of the two options i preferred the one we had suggested but if that was not to find favour with the government and they have agreed to consider it then i would see the noble earls suggestion as second best but a great deal better than leaving the bill as it is <e> <s> i should not like anyone to have the impression that i was agreeing that the amendment should simply be withdrawn without any further consideration <e>", "<cs> i do not know because i am not aware of it having been in the chamber all day how much of this has been agreed between the usual channels but by tomorrow night we will have spent three days out of the five allocated to the committee stage <e> <s> many of us had been hoping that we would get six days <e> <s> the noble lord has now asked us to reach amendment no <e> <s> which is well over halfway through the bill and he is asking us to do it halfway through the time that i understood we were going to spend upon it <e> <s> so he may be asking us to do a little more than we can <e> <s> i think it is accepted that we on this side of the committee have done all we can to see that we go as quickly as we can <e> <s> i must say to the noble lord that it is very much up to his side of the committee to see how far we do get within what i hope will be a reasonable time to stop for all concerned on a bill in which many noble lords are very interested <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has access to far more competent scientific advice than i have and i hope that rather than encourage these totally unwarranted fears he might listen to the scientific advice which i am sure would tell him that this does not happen and that just like the noble earl people are believing something which is not true <e>", "<cs> i think it would be a mistake to delay the committee too long over this amendment <e> <s> as i say there are two further amendments and i would hope that the government might be able to accept one or other of them <e> <s> i quite agree with the noble earl that we would all hope that people would take action against a specially protected species only when it is necessary <e> <s> it might be that when we look at this matter between now and report stage it would be useful to see that sentiment which the noble earl expressed reflected in the words of the bill so that people looking at this would know that that is what parliament had intended <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> could i say that we on this side support both noble lords <e> <s> of the two options i think that the package as he described it of the noble lord lord craigton probably meets the fears which were mentioned by the noble lord lord gibson-watt and the noble lord lord home of the hirsel <e> <s> in other words if bats were causing anybody any discomfort or disquiet or if the numbers were getting too high under lord craigtons amendment one would contact the nature conservancy council for advice about how to overcome the problem or about how completely to exclude the bats <e> <s> that seems to me to be a very reasonable and full response to the problems which have been raised <e>", "<cs> may i remind my noble friend that the person who was attempting to get people to taste bat soup was arrested for obstruction <e> <s> i hope this will be a lesson to those who want to encourage this deplorable practice <e>", "<cs> i found what the noble earl lord ferrers had to say particularly in response to the amendment of the noble lord lord craigton extra-ordinarily unsatisfactory and i cannot believe that what he said was based on any official scientific advice because my understanding is that the ncc are regularly consulted by quite a large number of people who have problems with bats in their houses <e> <s> that gives rise to no difficulties at all <e> <s> they ask for advice and on the whole people take the advice <e> <s> occasionally they do not and in such a case those bats are killed and there is nothing more we can do about it <e>", "<cs> if i may respond briefly there really is no point in listing bats as a protected species in the bill unless the government mean what they say and it is quite clear that without something along the lines of the amendments either that i proposed or those proposed by the two noble lords opposite listing bats as a protected species is a simple sham a con trick <e> <s> the government do not actually intend to see them protected at all <e> <s> that is why these amendments are so important <e>", "<cs> but there would be if people kill something and claim that they were doing so to protect property which they should not protect <e> <s> i should like to pursue another point <e> <s> i listened carefully to what the noble earl said and it mirrored very much what the noble earl lord avon said when we looked at clause where before we amended it exactly the same wording appeared <e> <s> what the noble earl said just as the noble earl lord ferrers has said was that clause <e>", "<cs> the reason that there was a <e>", "<cs> we strongly support the amendment and i think that is clear <e> <s> as i see it the difficulty of dealing with this problem under clause apart from the enormous complications that that would lead to in the system of sites of special scientific interest whether an attic could be such a site we could i suppose discuss at enormous length is that the bill would list all bats so that all bats would he protected and clearly it would not be feasible to make all bat colonies sites of special scientific interest there would be far too many <e> <s> that is why i believe it is important to have something like the noble lord lord craigton is suggesting with the change from authority to consultation <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton would prefer consultation and we should be happy to see that change made <e>", "<cs> in debating an amendment to this clause earlier the noble earl lord onslow asked what fisheries meant <e> <s> because i was anxious to raise this point on the clause stand part particularly as we did not get an answer from the government earlier i will pursue the point now having given the government some notice of my intention to raise it at this stage <e> <s> i should like to know how wide the provision goes <e> <s> does it apply simply to fish in captivity to any fish in any river to part of the sea or what <e> <s> perhaps the minister will clear this up for us <e>", "<cs> i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but perhaps it would be simpler to stick with fish for the time being before moving on to game birds otherwise i shall get confused and the noble earl lord ferrers may find himself joining me in that confusion <e> <s> i simply wanted to thank the noble earl for what he said about the term fisheries <e> <s> it seems rather foolish if one could legitimately kill a protected bird or animal which was for example killing eels or pike which would be desirable certainly from the point of view of those interested in catching things like trout and salmon <e> <s> i cannot believe the exemption needs to go as wide as that and i am grateful the government will be considering the point <e>", "<cs> we had quite a long discussion of this on clause when we were considering the protection of birds and where exactly the same provision appears <e> <s> my recollection is that we all agreed that when game birds were birds being reared in other words pheasants in a release pen or on a rearing field were included in the word property <e> <s> however once it was wild a wild bird whether or not it was a game bird was not included <e> <s> but of course if a species of vermin comes along and attacks any of these things none of this applies anyhow because it applies only to specially protected things and i do not know that the chequered skipper the harbour porpoise or any of the other various things are all that likely to do enormous damage to the noble lords pheasants when they are at liberty <e>", "<cs> certainly i think it would be accepted that there has been some increase in numbers of the pine marten from a very low base indeed in scotland <e> <s> but it is possible in the schedule to limit protection to particular geographical areas <e> <s> the otter was protected in england and wales <e> <s> now that the pine marten is managing to spread to the lake district would the noble earl consider lord beaumonts information which the rest of us have not seen and which may well present a strong case for protection throughout great britain <e> <s> if that is not the case it would be worth considering whether protection might be given in england and wales and not in scotland <e> <s> that could be considered at the same time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord corrected himself <e> <s> that is the very point that i was going to raise <e> <s> poisoning is illegal and speaking as a farmer i deplore the noble lords suggestion that a farmer would break the law on the scale he is suggesting <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply briefly to some of the points which have been made <e> <s> the noble earl lord peel said that he did not see what relevance my statistics on the huge increases in the snaring of foxes had to the debate on whether snares should be banned or not <e> <s> i tried to make the point clear and i will briefly repeat it <e> <s> this huge increase in snaring has this impact on the debate today that inevitably this has led to a large number of snares being set by inexpert people and inevitably a large number of animals which were not intended to be caught in the snares have been caught often with appallingly cruel consequences resulting in long cruel agonising deaths <e> <s> the animals included badgers otters domestic animals deer caught by the leg and so on <e>", "<cs> so far as i know there is no evidence for that <e> <s> the report from which i am quoting was published on st january and the figures contained in it go up to last year and show quite the contrary trend <e>", "<cs> i would not deny that although i understand that maff themselves have adopted the use of a live trap which is a far better system for catching animals if you want to keep them alive <e>", "<cs> the debate on amendment no <e> <s> has really covered all the amendments because they all deal with exactly the same point <e> <s> i think that the argument in favour of introducing it would be twofold <e> <s> first the noble earl was asked earlier whether he could think of any examples of things causing damage and he said no but something might come along in the future which this applied to <e> <s> so it seems to me that even if none of us has come across this reprehensible practice i think we all agree that it is a reprehensible practice during our walks through the countryside that is not a sufficient argument against ensuring that legislation makes it impossible that it should happen <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and i was particularly heartened to hear his remarks about government moves to tighten up on the use of strychnine <e> <s> it seems that this problem has reached such serious proportions that unless we can find some way of tightening up on the illegal use of

the ground some of which had been crushed by stones but the majority of which had clearly been shot with air guns <e> <s> that is the sort of sport which we hope will be prohibited if we get the ban

similar amendment at no <e> <s> namely no <e> <s> <e> <s> i said then and i think what i said found some favour with noble lords opposite and possibly even with the noble earl lord avon that of the

to the governments consideration of the exact terms of the qualification because as lord avon said the wording needed looking at <e> <s> i would hope we would do the same here as we did previously in

move it as quickly as i can <e>", "<cs> i should like to respond to that and to some extent to the suggestion that it is not right in a bill which is already re-enacting and amending almost every piece of wildlife legislation that we have in this country that we should not do the same for one more act <e> <s> if i may say so it seems to be a strange suggestion <e> <s> on the reason for retaining the badgers act as i say i have great sympathy with what the noble earl lord onslow said it would be much simpler if we simply repealed it and had animal conservation issues covered by this bill <e> <s> the problem with that is twofold <e>", "<cs> i take my noble friends point <e> <s> that paragraph was put in in an effort to make the amendment as acceptable as possible <e> <s> i was trying not to be unreasonable and it seemed to me that the fact that somebody would have to go and ask for a licence would be sufficient protection for the badger <e> <s> in other words they would have to show that there was serious damage occurring to one of these things <e> <s> it seemed to me that without that sort of paragraph there would be i do not know about justifiable some opposition to the changes i was suggesting if the badger had total protection and there was no provision for killing a badger that was causing some damage <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend in my experience they do not cause any damage of this sort and that was the conclusion of the working party which looked at this matter and which had on it the representations of the nfu the cla the british field sports society and so on <e> <s> there is a fair degree of unanimity on this but it does not seem to me that that paragraph does any harm <e>", "<cs> the purpose of withdrawing the amendment and allowing the government to consider it was because that sort of provision clearly needs to be brought into line with clauses and <e> <s> that was why i had no intention of pressing the amendment at this stage <e> <s> i should have thought we needed the same sort of provision in all these clauses and while we may not agree on what that provision should be once it is settled it should be common throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i did not feel nearly as strongly about this particular amendment as i did about the previous one and i am myself inclined to agree with what the noble lord lord home has <e>", "<cs> the noble earl did not have the advantage which we on this side have of seeing the serried ranks of nodding heads behind him while my noble friend was speaking <e> <s> my feeling is that it might be better to put this into the bill and allow the government to amend it if they want to <e> <s> that seems to be in accord with the general feeling of the committee and it would allow the government to look at the drafting when we get to the report stage <e>", "<cs> i was assuming as the government wanted to take this amendment separately from my own amendments to the conservation of seals act that there was going to be a different attitude to it and i was disappointed to hear what the noble earl had to say <e> <s> i withdrew my amendments because they were <e>", "<cs> if i might help the noble lord a little i tried to answer the point because i know the argument against the amendment <e> <s> i do not think the case is quite so bad as the noble lord is making out <e> <s> there has recently been a campaign launched to reintroduce the beaver into this country <e> <s> it seems to me not likely knowing some of those who have been interested in this but in theory it is possible that somebody might take it into their heads that this was a very good idea and they would get hold of some beavers and say i am going to bring them into the country and release them <e> <s> they would not make any secret of it <e> <s> at the moment under the bill we would not be able to do anything about that until after the beavers had been imported <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> i do not think that the argument about cost is a good one if i may say so because as i understand it all live animals that are imported into this country would in any event be subject to such stringent checks <e> <s> i think for instance of birds which would be so checked because of the danger of importing various diseases involving domestic poultry and so on <e> <s> it would be necessary to check the kind of animals we are talking about non-native animals because of the provisions of the endangered species act <e> <s> we shall be coming on to that and the <e>", "<cs> i listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord avebury said and it did not seem to me that what he was proposing was what the bill is proposing <e> <s>

committing the offence <e> <s> but then under subsection so long as the offence is committed by somebody else you do not have to show due diligence or take all reasonable steps that provides a <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we ought to spend too long on this matter <e> <s> i find the interpretation by the noble lord lord avebury of the bill entirely acceptable <e> <s> i wonder whether to shorten the matter we could simply ask the government when <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this debate but bearing in mind the injunction of the noble lord the chief whip to us we have a number of amendments on clause which deal with the level of penalties so would it not be simpler to deal with this matter then <e>", "<cs> the government are talking more about the general principle than the particular species to which reference has been made and they are right to adopt that attitude <e> <s> the noble lord lord middleton spoke of the damage grey squirrels do to young trees and that must have been enough to remind us how important it is to be careful about the introduction of non-native species <e> <s> although the budgie and capercaillie may not appear to be enormous threats just now

very carefully to what the minister had t o say and they will have their arguments prepared <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton has said this is an amendment which is supported on all sides of the committee and indeed at second reading of this bill i think it is fair to say that this was the one omission from the bill above all others which received condemnation from all sides of the house <e> <s> i noticed one or two noble lords with their eyes on the clock when the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton was introducing this amendment <e> <s> i would simply say to them that had the government taken note of what was said to them at second reading the government would have been moving this amendment and not us and it would have been done a great deal more quickly <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble earl ought simply to brush this question away quite as easily as that <e> <s> it is not a substantive point and i do not want to press him <e> <s> but here we have a paper of only two and a half sides paragraphs <e> <s> i do not know how fast the noble earl types but even i could have managed to type this in an hour and a half <e> <s> why did it take from october to nd february to get it typed <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment and i should like strongly to support everything that the noble earl has said <e> <s> the act had this measure which proved extremely valuable and we have heard a lot during the course of the committee stage about the emphasis which the government place on the advice they receive from their scientific advisers <e> <s> it seems to me to be extremely detrimental to put it mildly that in this particular part of schedule they should be seeking to avoid going to their scientific advisers for advice and i hope that the government will accept the noble earls amendment <e>", "<cs> i should simply like to support the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> the only problem with that is that i am now not at all clear what the noble lord would have said about amendment no <e> <s> to which i do not think he has yet responded <e> <s> i wonder whether there is just a word or two that he could say yes or no or maybe which would let us know what was the governments attitude to the amendment which the noble earl so ably did not move <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but the amendment strikes at the question of prosecutions <e> <s> i hope the noble lord may be going on to tell us about the ever-increasing number of prosecutions but i doubt that he will be able to <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl whether he would accept that at the moment when there is absolutely no restriction on ports of entry the problem he has mentioned is much more likely to arise than if the amendment is accepted and there is some protection <e>", "<cs> i simply do not understand this <e> <s> it is exactly the point that was made by the noble earl lord onslow i did not understand it then and i do not understand it now <e> <s> if you give somebody a licence and specify a place and a time say london airport at oclock and the animal turns up at glasgow two days later in other words the wrong place is deliberately used at the wrong time does that not lead to exactly the same sort of problems as having a blanket designation of ports <e> <s> i cannot see any difference <e>", "<cs> but they will lose their licence if they do not go to a designated port of entry <e> <s> if there is a limited number of ports of entry which are designated of which heathrow might well be one and perhaps there would be one other if somebody takes live animals to any other port of entry they will lose whatever licence they might have had <e> <s> i simply do not see the difference <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord will he accept that the position of an endangered species going to a port which is not designated in future if the amendment is accepted as i hope it will be will be absolutely no different from the present position <e> <s> if somebody suspects that an animal is being illegally imported it can be seized and placed with a competent zoological garden just as happens now <e> <s> there will be absolutely no change <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord cannot expand on the difficulties that they have had in the united states perhaps he can confirm that they are maintaining the system of restricted ports of entry and not changing it back to the english system so that they are not doing what the noble lord is trying to do <e>", "<cs> i followed what the noble lord lord craigton had to say as best i could and it seemed to me that there was a great deal more in some of the points than the noble lord lord cullen has given him credit for <e> <s> for example if it is completely impossible to tell the difference between two species of ocelot and if the noble lord cannot do it if i cannot do it if the customs officers cannot do it and if no expert in this country can do it how can it be sensible to list one as being banned from trade and the other as not being banned from trade <e> <s> it simply makes the banning a mockery it is a nonsense there is absolutely no point in doing it <e> <s> it would be sensible to take that off appendix i but of course the noble lord and the government cannot do that because they would be in breach of the cites convention <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that they are saying all right we will obey the letter of the law but we will make darn sure that it does not work in practice by not listing something which is indistinguishable from the species that we are banning from trade <e> <s> that is just one narrow point of a number which the amendments of the noble lord lord craigton raise and to which the noble lord lord cullen did not even begin to respond <e>", "<cs> if that is to be the stance of her majestys government at the washington convention meeting in new delhi and of this country internationally on world conservation matters it is a deplorable state of affairs <e> <s> we were one of the first countries to ratify this convention <e> <s> originally we introduced legislation to ensure that we could control endangered species by using a section of the legislation left over from the second world war in order that we could be in the forefront of setting an example to the rest of the world <e>", "<cs> in order to save time may i say to the noble earl lord avon that i was extremely grateful for his response and for his commitment on behalf of the government to look at this <e> <s> i am sure that that will also satisfy the noble lord lord craigton <e>", "<cs> that emphasises the weakness of the point made by the noble earl lord avon that this would be a good case for general licences if we are to ensure that the landowners permission has been given that of necessity must mean that licences are specific <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord explain whether he is opposed to the ncc issuing any licences which is what i take from his words <e> <s> in that case is he objecting to clause <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble earl has not satisfied me <e> <s> i was delighted to hear his reiteration of the governments support for the eec directive and the fact that they will comply with it as indeed under international law they have to do <e> <s> he said that a licensing authority would not issue a licence if it was not required but the eec directive states that if there is no other satisfactory solution a licence should not be issued <e>", "<cs> that would be helpful because the noble earl will find that a number of words from article have been incorporated into the bill and by the nature of things it will arouse some suspicion if three or four words which look good from the conservationists point of view are left out of the bill when all the words which look bad about preventing damage to crops and so on are put in <e> <s> so it would be helpful if the government would look at the point again and i am grateful to the noble earl for saying that he will do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley and others have suggested that there is not much to worry about and that we all ought to trust each other <e> <s> of course we do but nevertheless having done that we are still concerned about the intentions of the government and others if this power to grant general licences is retained in the bill <e> <s> i think my noble friend dealt effectively with the one example which we have been given so far of the need for general licences the other example which the nfu have actually given their own members is that under the bill they are assured that there would be a general licence issued to everybody in south-east england to kill brent geese whenever they need to <e> <s> that has been published by the nfu and it is apparently an assurance which they have been given <e> <s> that is a general licence to cover all brent geese anywhere in southern england at any time they want to kill them <e> <s> that is an appalling state of affairs <e> <s> that is why there is some suspicion worry and doubt about this provision in the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl lord cranbrook is satisfied with that but it seems to me to be the exact opposite to the assurance he was seeking <e> <s> of course that is the problem <e> <s> if we have this particular form of words in the bill we are obviously going to use it and the examples given by the government all seem to me to be perfectly good places where a specific licence could be issued <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> i would not like the noble earl to read what i said but if he could read what his noble friend lord bellwin said at second reading and see if those sentiments could be incorporated into this clause in qualifying the word general i think that would go a long way to meeting the worries that have been expressed in this connection <e>", "<cs> i interrupt the noble lord to say that we are not talking about pests we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep jumping up and interrupting the noble lord but is he implying something which i find very worrying and an example of the lack of even-handedness if i may say so of the noble lords approach namely that the minister of agriculture will not consult the department of the environment or the nature conservancy council <e> <s> whoever does the consulting the same distance has to be travelled <e>", "<cs> no they are not <e>", "<cs> i think that it is a slightly different point to want to have the nature conservancy council as the licensing authority throughout the bill and simply to want to transfer the responsibility under two of the paragraphs in subsection from the ministry of agriculture to the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> it was an attempt to meet some of the noble earls objections to the earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> that is exactly why i moved this series of amendments which does not put any further burdens on the ncc but which asks the doe to do this having listened the maff on the one hand and the ncc or whatever advisory body it would be on the other <e>", "<cs> i am not sure the endangered species import and export act is the best analogy the minister could have drawn on because my information is that there has been an enormous amount of disquiet <e>", "<cs> i am delighted at that response and am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to see the government putting down this amendment and i warmly welcome it <e>", "<cs> i must say that i do not really understand the line the government are taking on this unless it is coming to them from the home office rather than from their scientific advisers because as i think it was the noble earl lord onslow said on an earlier day it is possible now to sell young peregrines for well over so the statutory maximum fine does not at the moment equal the monetary gain which somebody is likely to be able to achieve by stealing one of the rare species dealt with in this bill <e> <s> that is today and we all know from previous experience of the protection of birds act that the level of the monetary penalty got out of date very quickly <e> <s> indeed in another place my honourable friend mr hardy had to introduce a bill to bring the penalties in the protection of birds act up to date an absolutely ridiculous procedure and a waste of everybodys time in both houses except that it was a very important outcome <e> <s> nevertheless it is absurd it seems to me for us to get ourselves into that muddle again <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl knows the answer but as i remember it at least once if not on more occasions the ospreys there were put off the nest and either eggs or the young were stolen <e> <s> there is still a -hour watch on that nest as on many nests of rare birds in scotland north england and wales <e> <s> the monetary gain from stealing the young of a bird of prey is still very high <e> <s> that is why we support lord craigtons amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord milverton is not in his place i wonder if i may speak to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my understanding having taken advice is that it is in order for any noble lord to move <e>", "<cs> i take it from what the noble lord said at the beginning of his remarks that the words or other thing cover parts and derivatives of plants and animals animal skins and so on <e> <s> the noble lord is nodding and that is what i understood him to say <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if this amendment were put into the bill there would not be any question about it <e> <s> i simply do not know <e> <s> but if the offence was committed in the name of the company by the companys servants in some way then i suppose it might not be possible without this amendment unless the government can convince me that it would be possible to prosecute the individual concerned <e>", "<cs> the point i had in mind in restricting this to companies was that companies could escape liability by going into liquidation which of course would not be the case with a partnership <e> <s> the partners would be individually liable for the activities of the partnership <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sandys has already pointed out the other advantage of this amendment is that it is already in an act of parliament <e> <s> therefore it is properly drafted and i would think that it would be acceptable to most people <e> <s> i think it covers the main points which need to be covered <e> <s> we have the question of the liability of landowners for the activities of their servants in regard to which the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley moved an earlier amendment <e> <s> i think that really covers the other major point that needs covering <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord sandys for his commitment to propose a government amendment in the right place in the bill <e> <s> i am delighted we have scored another winner today <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have said this before but i do think it is worth reiterating <e> <s> as your lordships <e>", "<cs> it occurs to me that those who have as i do the interests of agriculture at heart are trying to have their cake and eat it <e> <s> we have already had the maff issuing licences endless exclusions both in emergency and under licence for agricultural operations and no obligation to consult the ncc in <e>", "<cs> my question was whether there are agricultural acts where the secretary of state for the environment and the minister of agriculture act jointly to appoint advisers to agricultural advisory bodies <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that in a wildlife bill there should be that provision the other way round <e> <s> i am simply asking for a bit of equity <e>", "<cs> that is marvellous <e> <s> perhaps i could put the record straight <e> <s> the endangered species import and export act was a marvellous act but from time to time its implementation by the department of the environment has not been all that we had hoped <e> <s> however i am sure that it is improving all the time <e>", "<cs> i had exactly the same worry as the noble lord lord craigton <e> <s> these advisory bodies are now going to be set up and serviced by the ncc <e> <s> the nature conservancy council produces an excellent annual report as the noble earl lord avon said but it is already fairly lengthy and has i do not know how many endless appendices at the back with a lot of technical and detailed stuff in them <e> <s> i cannot see how they can possibly include it in that unless it is going to be a great deal lengthier and more costly to produce detailed reports of all these advisory bodies activities and the advice that they have given <e> <s> the nccs annual report well produced a glossy report with a colour cover and high quality paper seems totally the wrong vehicle for it <e> <s> the sort of thing one would imagine these advisory committees producing would be a typewritten document which would simply be duplicated for those who are particularly interested and would contain details of the questions that have been referred to them and the advice they have given on those questions <e> <s> we are talking about a totally different vehicle <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl may look at that point again <e>", "<cs> i do not think we ought to spend too long on this because the hour is getting late and all of us want to make progress <e> <s> i do not think anybody is entirely happy with what the noble earl has said except possibly the officials who wrote the brief for him and i hope they will have been shamed into changing their advice before we reach the next stage of the bill <e> <s> there is not very much in this but there is a point that does require further attention <e> <s> if the <e>", "<cs> that sounded like an explicit assurance <e> <s> i should like to see it in black and white in <e>", "<cs> that question is not quite as important as the point that the noble earl lord cranbrook raised <e> <s> i should be interested to hear what the noble earl on the government front bench has to say to his noble friend after he has read his noble friends speech <e> <s> it would be very helpful for us to know whether we are talking about simply the question of the scientific authority for animals being reconstituted by the ncc or whether there are to be dramatic changes in membership involving the range of people on the body <e> <s> i do not expect an answer at the moment but i think that that was at least part of what the noble earl was getting at <e> <s> if the noble earl on the government front bench is to consider that i wonder whether he can let us know too of his deliberations <e>", "<cs> i am not happy <e> <s> it seems to me to reflect the double standards that run through this <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley pointed out we have a paragraph in the previous clause which says that the secretary of state may if he thinks fit consult people that he is already at liberty to consult <e> <s> it adds nothing <e> <s> we are quite happy to see that in the bill applying to the secretary of state <e> <s> when it comes to asking the ncc to consult the voluntary organisations all of a sudden we must trust them we must not put anything in the bill to tie their hands or even imply that they are not going to do this <e> <s> they may or may not do it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl members of the committee and the noble baroness who supported the amendment when it looked as if it might sink without trace <e> <s> the government have agreed to consider it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we will of course withdraw this amendment as well but i hope that the government and in particular the ncc will have a look at what my noble friend said about their attitude not very long ago when they seemed to be pressing not for something foreign to this country but for exactly what the noble lord lord craigton and we in this amendment with the noble lord lord beaumont have been pressing for ourselves <e> <s> in other words not so long ago the ncc seemed to be entirely with us <e> <s> they have now done a u-turn and i think it would be helpful to have an explanation <e> <s> i would suggest to all those who have taken an interest in this matter that it might be worthwhile our getting together and coming forward with a single amendment at report stage if we do not have any more satisfactory response from the ncc in the meantime which i am afraid we shall not have <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in view of the rather mixed reaction the amendment got from the noble lord lord stanley i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> the minister has said enough to illustrate the fear i expressed earlier that there is something in the way of double standards operating here <e> <s> in a bill concerned with the conservation and protection of wildlife we find a number of provisions which ensure that agriculture and forestry are given their proper place with all due consideration being given to those interests <e> <s> however in a measure concerned with forestry we are not allowed even the mildest hint that wildlife might be important and that those operating the forestry commission should take that factor into account <e>", "<cs> how is it defective <e>", "<cs> i do not think that this is a matter on which we should take up the time of the committee at this hour <e> <s> if the noble earl would be good enough to write to me about it i should be very grateful <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble earl what happens if the ptarmigan decides to spread and establish itself in northern england <e> <s> would that be allowed under the bill or not <e>", "<cs> may i very briefly raise a point about the definition of poultry in clause <e> <s> the definition reads that poultry means domestic fowls and among other things domestic ducks <e> <s> i just wondered whether the noble earl could at some point not now write to me and give me some assurance that there is no possibility of that definition being interpreted in the court so as to include for example normally wild species of duck which were kept in captivity and bred there or a normally wild british bird which was kept in captivity and bred there because they were thereby felt to be domestic whether domestic duck domestic fowl or what have you <e> <s> it is simply that if the court did interpret the word poultry in that way as a result of the definition in the clause it would provide a major loophole in the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i hope that it does not <e> <s> the noble earl may be able to reassure me straight away or if not in due course <e>", "<cs> the noble earl in a slip of the tongue which he corrected referred to the nature conservancy council as the nature conservative council <e> <s> i do not think that that is an unfair description as far as many of the voluntary organisations in this country are concerned <e> <s> they have tended to look upon the nature conservancy council as taking a very conservative line in these matters <e> <s> it has been cautious and it has in many areas taken enormous trouble most of the voluntary organisations would say far too much trouble to try to reach agreement with landowners over the designation of sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> often that procedure has led to those sites being destroyed while the negotiations were still going on <e> <s> that is in total contrast to what the noble viscount lord thurso had to say about his own experience <e> <s> in all the cases that i have heard of over the past few years the complete reverse has been the case the nature conservancy council has delayed designating sites while destruction has gone on under its nose in an attempt to reach a compromise or agreement <e>", "<cs> can the noble earl explain how the amendments create two tiers of sssi <e> <s> i understood lord craigton to say that his proposals affected all sssis in other words procedure for notifying change to the ncc applied to all <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble earl but does he not think it more likely that the treasury would take another line <e> <s> the last government pursued this with them vigorously <e> <s> if lord craigtons amendment is accepted and all owners of all sssis have to notify the ncc when they are going to make a change then the governments proposal which the noble earl has said would only affect or seems to me to give the treasury a perfect argument which they will exploit to the full for giving tax relief on that or only <e>", "<cs> i do not want to keep bobbing up and down <e> <s> i have a nasty feeling that the noble lord is confusing my amendment with lord craigtons amendment <e> <s> my amendment would stop people doing things straight away <e> <s> the amendments we are now discussing simply mean that the landowners would notify the ncc if they intended to do something <e> <s> then there would be an opportunity as the noble lord is saying for negotiation and discussion <e> <s> under the governments proposals there would not because the ncc would not know that these changes were taking place they would simply carry on except on the or selected sites <e>", "<cs> but that notice does not stop the landowner doing anything <e> <s> the noble lord needs to look at the set of amendments together <e> <s> it is a later amendment which says that if any of these operations in the first one are contemplated then the landowner should notify the ncc and discuss that with them <e>

say so the noble lord is misleading the committee <e> <s> that is not what this amendment does <e> <s> this amendment simply says that the ncc must notify the owner of operations about which the owner

clear about that if anyone is to suggest that the governments proposals in the bill are capable of extension because they are clearly not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord middleton accused me of not

with me that the local land charge would not apply to almost all sssis except the very few where these alternating powers or some other agreement were in force <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully and i am astonished at the inadequacy of the noble earls reply <e> <s> i cannot believe that i have understood it correctly <e> <s> he seems to be saying that we shall end with a position

special scientific interest <e> <s> if there is no notification we shall continue to be faced with figures as we have been in this debate of what happened in when we had per cent <e> <s> lost or damaged but we shall have no way of knowing what is going on at the moment except of course for the or sites where there will be notification provisions which i hope the noble lord lord middleton and i now agree upon <e> <s> those <e>", "<cs> i am not misunderstanding the noble earl interrupted me before i had finished <e> <s> as i understand it notification means the landowner or farmer notifying the ncc when he intends to do something which will damage or destroy the sssi <e> <s> that does not happen at the moment <e> <s> it will only happen under the bill on or or however many there may be sites <e> <s> that is what i mean by notification <e> <s> the noble earl is saying notification is the ncc telling owners they have an sssi and what is important about it <e> <s> thatis certainly helpful to the landowners <e> <s> it is of no help at all towards conserving the sssi unless owners simply say all right we will not destroy it <e> <s> there is no element even of ensuring that there might be negotiation about it <e> <s> unless landowners are required to notify the ncc that they are going to damage the site you do not have any assurance even that there will be voluntary negotiations <e> <s> at the end of the day you are still left with the designation order <e> <s> all that does is to ensure that landowners have to notify the ncc that they intend to damage or destroy the site <e> <s> the only thing the ncc can then do is to compulsorily purchase the site <e> <s> in other words the noble earls very mild sounding response has not changed at all the position as it

bill if it is not for the purpose of restricting this <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley of alderley went a long way towards confirming my fears by saying that this would allow these provisions to apply to the grade sssis in other words not to the rest which contradicted what his noble friend on the front bench said <e> <s> i must say that i prefer the interpretation of the amendment by the

noble earl <e> <s> we are making marvellous progress a little late in the day i am afraid for some of us and i look forward to seeing the governments amendment on that point <e>", "<cs> may i without urging my noble friend to press the amendment at this stage press the noble earl to go a little further <e> <s> i take his point about the possibility of delay particularly if the ncc is required to wait for written replies which do not come <e> <s> however would the minister address himself to the principle of the matter a little further <e>", "<cs> i am sure that if the nature conservancy council gave an assurance that such registers would be kept that would be an ideal solution and it would save us all some time <e>", "<cs> i must say that our initial feeling on this side of the committee was not to agree with the amendment set down in the names of the noble lord lord craigton and the noble lord lord beaumont because it seemed to us that it would cause a difficulty and would exclude some of the most important sites of special scientific interest that we have in this country <e> <s> but the governments extraordinarily unsatisfactory reply to the amendment moved earlier by the noble lord lord craigton has left me feeling that anything we can get from them we must take because theyclearly have absolutely no intention off their own bat unless your lordships can persuade them on report of doing anything to protect most of the sites of special scientific interest in this country <e> <s> we are therefore in the words of the nature conservancy councils chief scientist going to see large-scale extinction of british species by the end of this century <e> <s> that seems to me the sum result of what the government have said on clause so far large-scale extinction of british species <e>", "<cs> the noble earl puts a lot of stress on what the nature conservancy council could or could not do <e>", "<cs> i think the noble earl said it was whether or not they would be able to carry out the effect of the amendment and as i heard him from a sedentary position he added what they would like <e>", "<cs> but do we not all agree on both sides of the committee that this is not an offence for which it would be suitable to send people to prison <e> <s> the noble earl is quite right if the financial penalty is left at the level it is in the bill inevitably for an offence which involves more than one hectare where the financial gain will be well over the prosecuting authorities will have to proceed on indictment in an attempt to get a prison sentence which is what none of us wants <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl for that <e> <s> i dare say it is not drafted correctly <e> <s> i did not intend it to be mandatory <e> <s> i quite take lord burtons point <e> <s> i do think it is practical in more cases than one might initially think <e> <s> perhaps i could give two examples which the government might care to consider <e> <s> there was a case where a landowner who was about to be served with a tree preservation order on a woodland sent in the bulldozer to smash down the trees before the tree preservation order could arrive and succeeded in doing so <e> <s> the wood was reduced to a series of stumps a few feet high <e> <s> it was not even properly felled or anything like that <e> <s> there was an attempt to destroy it before it could be preserved <e> <s> in that case the secretary of state confirmed the tree preservation order because it was felt that the woodland that was left the flora and many of the animals insects and other things that were left even though all the trees were reduced to stumps were worth preserving and that the woodland would itself naturally regenerate <e> <s> it may be that it would take years to do so but it was still worth saving <e> <s> that is a case where some sort of reinstatement might be a suitable penalty <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble earl a question because i too had in mind something like a fire <e> <s> let us say that a heath which is subject to one of these orders catches fire and there are some buildings at one end <e> <s> it might be possible to set fire to a large part of the heath to form a firebreak to protect the buildings or it might be possible simply to cut a small track or to pump some water from somewhere <e> <s> i was hoping that the bill would make clear when it becomes an act that it was necessary to try to take any measures that one could which were reasonable and we are all <e>", "<cs> i take it that someone has to notify the ncc about what they have done and about the emergency <e> <s> what would the ncc do if it got notification that there was a terrible emergency that was going to engulf my walking stick so i burnt a firebreak three miles wide through the middle of this heathland in an emergency <e> <s> what would the ncc do then <e> <s> that is a gross exaggeration but i am not quite clear how far the existing wording covers that situation <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl could look at it although i do not think that it is a big point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question because we had a rather muddled debate on this before dinner at least i was muddled by it which was probably my fault <e> <s> does that mean that if clause of the bill when it becomes an act does not include provision for owners of sssis to notify the ncc automatically which is something that the government appeared to turn down earlier then all sssis cannot be a local land charge but if it did they would <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a great deal of advantage in all sssis being a local land charge <e> <s> none of us wants landowners or <e>", "<cs> but that does not meet my point <e>", "<cs> i accept that but with respect to the noble earl that was not the point which i was making <e> <s> let us assume that the ncc sends out all these notices and that next week sssis change hands that not even the ownerships change but that the farming tenancies change that new tenants take over that somebody dies and his son takes it over <e> <s> the ncc will not tell all those people it will not re-issue the notices because it will not know what has happened <e>", "<cs> in the absence of the noble duke the duke of atholl i should like to suggest to your <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain to us why once somebody has say ploughed up a piece of chalk grass downland and turned it over to wheat he would want to have a management agreement with the ncc <e> <s> this would seem to be the implication of his remarks <e>", "<cs> but that is exactly the position at the moment and we lost per cent <e> <s> of the sssis in this country last year and in some counties over per cent were damaged or destroyed <e> <s> people already have to give notice if they are going to damage or destroy an sssi and want to have a capital grant to do so <e> <s> the bill makes things worse not better <e>", "<cs> i echo what the noble lord lord winstanley said <e> <s> in particular the minister omitted to tell us that the nature conservancy councils scienctific advisers are not happy with the governments proposals in clause and do not believe they go far enough <e> <s> nor can i accept from the noble earl that the clause provides measures which will protect habitats <e> <s> it does not <e> <s> the only way to protect a bit of land under this clause if the landowner or farmer is determined to destroy it is through compulsory purchase and the noble lord lord chelwood has already told us how likely the ncc are on past experience to be able or to want to use that power <e> <s> that means that the clause does not provide any protection for habitats and that is why many of us think it is a sham <e> <s> however we hope the government and noble lords in all parts of the committee who are concerned about this will draft amendments between now and report which will substantially improve the clause <e> <s> if we cannot do that then at that stage the honest thing will be to leave it out <e>", "<cs> i am rather glad i have ruled it out and i am sure my noble friend lord houghton will be equally delighted <e> <s> what is to stop somebody coming along and saying i intended to convert this to arable and therefore you have to pay me for the loss of revenue <e>", "<cs> i am speaking as a practising farmer <e> <s> i was hoping that the noble earl would tell the practising farmers devious or not what to do about it <e> <s> i think i heard him say that he would look at it <e> <s> on that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> surely they must have considered it because the purposes of the amendment as i understood it was to make clear whether it was going to be county or district and to come down firmly on the side of counties <e> <s> i should have thought that that must have been the main point that everyone considered when deciding what attitude to adopt towards the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but i am confused about the procedure <e> <s> i understood the noble lord lord inglewood to move his amendment <e> <s> i thought that he said it was withdrawn rather than not moved <e> <s> he spoke for some time and i imagined that it had been moved in which case the amendment to the amendment should have been called <e> <s> that is why i want to clarify the situation <e> <s> we particularly wanted to talk to the amendment to the amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord lord inglewood can confirm whether he actually did not move the amendment or withdrew it after moving it <e>", "<cs> it may be that the government are going to accept amendment no <e> <s> za <e>", "<cs> i gave the noble earl notice some time ago that i was interested in having a little information about the steps which the nature conservancy council will expect the voluntary organisations and in particular the county naturalists trusts to take to ensure that their reserves are recognised as national nature reserves as the provisions of clause allows <e> <s> however it seems to me a rather detailed point and i wonder whether it would be helpful if the noble earl were to write to me about it rather than to have a discussion about it now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the chief whip and to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i only wish that the nature conservancy council still had sufficient funds to support the kind of wildlife projects to which the noble lord has drawn our attention <e> <s> i think it would be sensible <e>", "<cs> i am a little surprised to hear from the mouth of this government the suggestion that it is wrong to limit the scope and activities of public bodies <e> <s> when the noble lord said public bodies i think he meant quangos and i thought the government were quite keen on making sure that they were controlled fairly strictly <e> <s> apart from that it seems to me that the noble lord is not really responding to the amendments in the spirit in which they were moved and certainly not in the spirit of the international year of the disabled <e> <s> he said that the national park authorities were covered as they were made up of local authorities by the chronically sick and disabled act as i understood it <e>", "<cs> to noble lords opposite who may feel that just over half an hour is too long to debate what we feel on this side of the committee as the most important amendment we have put down to this bill i should like to make the point that for example we had some long debates last night on compensation terms on which i think at least for some of the amendments nobody on this side of the committee and indeed nobody except members on the government benches spoke <e> <s> i think that any disquiet is a little unfair to both my noble friends and noble lords on the liberal benches who wish to take part in what we see as a vitally important debate <e>", "<cs> i agree with everything the noble lord lord chelwood said <e>", "<cs> the minister may be in danger of prolonging the debate by trying to change something which his noble friend lord avon said yesterday <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton asked <e>", "<cs> i found that an incomprehensible reply and i hope that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley will at least have a look at it and come back to this matter at the next stage <e> <s> i certainly did not think that the reply remotely answered the point that the noble lord made <e>", "<cs> as amendment no <e> <s> will fall could i just say first of all that we welcome all these <e>", "<cs> once again as i think has been the case throughout the morning with the possible exception of the first amendment we are entirely in agreement with the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to make the point while the chief whip is here that it is really not going to do this committee a great deal of credit nor the house in general if we as we are all trying to do go through these amendments at great speed and we get answers and i am not speaking about my own amendments but about those of noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words from this side of the committee <e> <s> i found the noble earls reply quite extraordinary <e> <s> if this is the way that we are to proceed with this bill it will never get through your lordships house and will never become law <e> <s> this is a subject on which there has been absolute unanimity on all sides of the chamber from all parties from the cross-benches calling for such a provision in the bill <e> <s> clearly it has overwhelming support <e> <s> the government were given an opportunity on a previous occasion by the noble lord lord mowbray and <e>", "<cs> if i might interrupt the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness was mistaken in what she said <e> <s> no doubt she was not able to be here for the previous debate and has not yet had an opportunity to read it but if she had she would know that a group of civil servants representing all government departments have been considering this matter since that it has been under consultation for the year and a half that this bill has been under consultation that this consultative paper which my noble friend referred to appeared the day before your lordships were due to debate amendments on this subject and that unlike all the other consultative papers issued on this bill everybody had several months to reply to it <e> <s> all the other consultative papers were issued with replies asked for within a matter of weeks <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is leaving that point it might be simpler if we take them one at a time the noble lord would have reassured me and answered my point had he said something which i understood the government had already said to the ncc and if he had simply repeated but he did not that they looked upon the ncc as having an important part to play in communicating the views of nature conservationists generally to the government <e> <s> the noble lord it seemed to me carefully did not say that <e> <s> but if that is the case which i certainly understand the nccs position to be then what i want is the confirmation that the government also see it that way <e> <s> there is no criticism of the ncc in this but <e>", "<cs> although i must confess that in previous years i have said it myself from the government front bench <e> <s> i always wonder why when the government minister says that something happens at the moment they cannot therefore accept with a cheerful countenance an amendment which ensures that it will continue to happen <e> <s> but the noble lord obviously was not about to do that <e> <s> i should like to have a further thought about what he said about widening nature conservation to include wildlife and natural history <e> <s> it did not seem to me that he provided a very good answer to that part of the amendment <e> <s> i may wish to come back to that part at a later stage <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is leaving that point could he deal with the point i made about the forestry commission <e> <s> it seems to me that their actions in providing picnic places in leaving deciduous trees along the sides of woodlands and allowing parts of their woodlands to be used for nature trails picnic spots and so on has been enormously successful <e> <s> it has not detracted at all from their primary task but they have been allowed to spend some money on ensuring that those kinds of activities can take place <e> <s> i would have thought that my amendment would ensure that water authorities would be able to do the same thing and it would be equally valuable in the long run from their point of view <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord confirm that water authorities are able to spend money in that way <e> <s> because the experience seems to be that when water authorities propose new schemes and i agree with a reservoir but i think that is rather a different case which are major new drainage schemes for example they will occasionally include in the original proposals some figure for landscaping or amenity <e> <s> that always gets left out in the end because if money is spent in that way the proposal becomes not cost-effective <e> <s> this amendment by ensuring that they had a positive duty to spend money and that they were enabled positively to spend money in that way would overcome that problem <e>", "<cs> either i drafted the amendment wrongly or the noble lord misunderstood it <e> <s> my intention was that there should be one or two people on the water authority who were knowledgeable about these matters not that every single one should be <e> <s> i think i understood from the noble lords reply that he was assuming that i intended that everybody on a water authority should be an expert on nature conservation which i had not intended <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it does but i shall have to have another look at the water act because i thought that that section of the act listed a number of areas in which members would have expertise and this would be one of them <e> <s> it does not say all the members it just says <e>", "<cs> i had intended to replace encouraging a proper standard of behaviour which seems to me to have connotations which are a little old-fashioned to put it mildly my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge says governancy which is a better way of putting it than i could have thought up with telling people how to avoid damaging the areas which they visit <e> <s> that is what landowners and farmers are interested in <e> <s> they want people who visit the countryside to know how to avoid doing damage not to walk across growing crops not to leave gates open not to start fires <e> <s> it seemed to me to be a much more direct and precise way of putting it <e> <s> from the farmers and the landowners point of view they should be told how to avoid doing damage and from the visitors point of view they should be given information which seems to have a good deal of support about their rights <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may cut things short it does not seem to be a point upon which we should spend too much time <e> <s> there has been a great <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment as i tried to do earlier <e>", "<cs> it is my experience that a committee composed of civil servants never recommends something unless it has numerous precedents <e> <s> i am certain this does have numerous precedents <e> <s> also they do not recommend such a thing unless it is highly uncontroversial and not likely to upset anybody <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will find it is a good deal easier for the government to accept than he originally thought <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this clause deals with the interpretation of part ii and i hope that it will not be stretching your lordships patience too much if i say when we are looking at clause that it seems to me as a result of our deliberations in committee so far particularly on clauses and that it would really be a stronger bill if we did not have part ii in it at all and that would remove the need for the interpretation which is currently in clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that response <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl is aware that the remarks that we made both now and at the end of our debate on clause were not directed to him personally but rather through him to others both senior ministers in his department and possibly more importantly junior ministers in other government departments whose heavy hand i think we have felt on all sides of the committee rather more frequently than maybe we would have wished <e> <s> again on all sides of the committee we have been filled with nothing but admiration and gratitude for the way in which the noble earl has been kind enough to deal with the many amendments which have been tabled <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i was trying to follow that but i am not sure that i succeeded <e> <s> was he saying that when the definitive map needs to be amended a copy will be made with the amendment on it and that it will be that copy which will be used for evidential purposes and be available for inspection by the public <e> <s> presumably copies will then be amended as each amendment to the definitive map is made <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount withdraws his amendment may i ask the minister a question <e> <s> as i understand it the bill as drafted in other words as it has now amended the previous act would allow somebody to come forward and say that this particular right of way is not a right of way and they knew it was not <e> <s> and the local authority would be obliged to re-open the whole question <e> <s> there is no qualification as to the new evidence that must be produced <e> <s> it has not got to be as i believe it should be evidence which had been overlooked or misconstrued by the previous inquiry <e> <s> anybody could walk into wherever they have to walk into say the local authority office and say that there arc rights of way on the map which do not exist and then new inquiries must take place <e>", "<cs> but <e>", "<cs> i hear the noble lord lord avebury suggesting that it might be possible for the governments consideration to be completed by report stage and i hope that that will be the case <e> <s> if not i have a feeling that the support on all sides of the house is so strong for this amendment that it would be worth while tabling it and pressing it if we needed to do so <e> <s> but the noble lord has been very kind in saying that he will consider it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> but the users would not have initiated all the proceedings <e> <s> i think that it would be unwise to accept an amendment of this sort in the even-handed mood which the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is reading his brief very well but he is not responding to what i said <e> <s> the case i gave in particular was of a local authority proposing miles of new rights of way <e> <s> quite deliberately i did not try to cast this as being simply a worry about local authorities closing rights of way because i do not think that is a fair reflection of the case which has been put from all sides of the committee against the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is about to leave that point may i ask whether that would apply to an area such as the isle of wight <e> <s> that has an excellent network of public footpaths which by and large are used by people who go there on holiday <e> <s> the noble lord says that a local authority is responsive to the local electors but the people who use the paths on the isle of wight are not by and large local electors <e>", "<cs> i say to the noble lord with all seriousness that on this point i think the governments answer is by a long way weaker than their arguments on any of the other points which we have had to consider <e> <s> this is an affront to natural justice <e> <s> the noble lord must know that in his heart of hearts <e> <s> he says that this is a local matter <e> <s> even if we accepted that it still is not fair that an authority which proposes the extinguishment or the creation or the diversion of a path which is then objected to whether by landowners farmers or path users and which holds a public inquiry with an inspector appointed from a panel which the secretary of state has set up should have the final say and be able completely to ignore the public <e> <s> nothing in the bill reflects what the noble lord had to say in his brief about that <e> <s> nothing in the bill says that they have got to give very sound reasons or take it very seriously and so on <e> <s> it may be that a number of local authorities would <e>", "<cs> what about the case where there are no objections and the authority then modifies the proposal <e> <s> that was the point i was trying to make <e> <s> under those circumstances the authority could modify the proposal in a way that leaves it in a state that somebody would have wished to object to it if he had known it was going to be so modified <e> <s> i know that the modifications would generally be of a minor drafting nature but what i am trying to make clear is that even that can be very important given the fact that these are legal documents and they need to be properly drafted <e> <s> it should not be possible for an authority to change something where nobody has objected because people might then want to object <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord really happy <e> <s>

that in the case of a modification all that they would have to do is advertise it in one local newspaper and that would be the end of the matter <e>", "<cs> i should simply like to welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add one very quick point as the government are considering this and i am certainly delighted that they are <e> <s> i wonder whether they could consider the possibility that the ancient monuments and archaeological areas act might apply either as it is currently drafted or with a very minor amendment to deal with the problem which the noble lord lord avebury has raised <e> <s> at least that seems to me to be one possibility worth exploring <e>", "<cs> i am interested in what i heard my noble friend say i apologise for not having been in the chamber to hear all of it <e> <s> my advice is that my noble friends intention is covered first by the bill and more particularly by amendments nos <e> <s> and which are now down in the governments name as well as in the name of the noble viscount lord hanworth <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend would care to wait and see what happens to those amendments and then if he wants to do so to come back to this point at report so that we do not spend too long on it now <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support on both sides of the committee <e> <s> it may be that i did not make it clear enough in introducing the amendment that the effect of the amendment would only apply to new maps which were prepared under clause <e> <s> the purpose of having this in the bill was merely and i probably did not make it clear enough that when surveying authorities were preparing a new map they would prepare it in such a way that it could be copied quite easily and sold to anybody asking for it <e> <s> i understand that authorities who already sell copies of their maps to the public more than cover the cost so there is no financial burden on the authority <e> <s> it is simply that the authorities should prepare these new maps in a particular shape and size which could easily be copied on whatever machine they had and could then easily be produced when someone wrote in and asked for a copy <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should have said and i apologise to my noble friend for not doing so as he had referred to amendment no <e> <s> that amendments nos <e> <s> a to g which we have already accepted do cover exactly the same point as i intended to get at with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will resist this <e> <s> it does seem a bit hard on the parish councils and district councils <e> <s> i take the point the noble viscount is making that it would probably be better to do away with the procedure altogether under section of the highways act given that there is a more modern procedure but while it is there i think it is only fair to allow district and parish councils their existing rights <e> <s> i hope the government will agree <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall not be a lone voice in speaking against the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government also will speak against it <e> <s> i must make it absolutely clear that i have the greatest possible sympathy for the point at which everyone who has spoken on the amendment has been getting <e> <s> but with great respect it does not seem to me that that is the effect of the amendment <e> <s> for example as far as i can understand it it would have the extraordinary result that someone taking dogs into a field where they were trespassing as long as they committed no damage would not be liable to be prosecuted for any offence whereas someone walking down a path with a dog three feet one side of the path or three feet the other with the dog under perfect control would be committing an offence <e> <s> that seems to me to be a nonsense <e>", "<cs> that is not an answer <e> <s> if someone is walking down what he thinks is the line of a public path but it is not how will he know that that is the point at which he has to put the dog on a lead because he would not know that he was off the line <e>", "<cs> we have had a number of references to this committee which as the minister has just said is not a government committee <e> <s> it is as i understand it an entirely informal committee <e> <s> when considering part i of the bill we were all very anxious that the government should have the opportunity to consult the scientific advisory bodies and i am sure that all noble lords on all sides of the chamber would be more than happy for the government between the committee and report stages to consult any committee that they wish to consult <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down he was playing games with my noble friend which were quite unwarranted and not of the normal high standard of his contributions to your lordships committee <e> <s> he knows perfectly well the list of organisations starting with the ministry of agricultures safety division and going through a number of other people including the health and safety executive and the national association of local councils <e> <s> anybody who keeps cattle knows that at least some bulls in almost any breed can be very dangerous indeed and the statistics for accidents to farmworkers bear that out <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount confirm that he is speaking from his own knowledge when he says that there have been no fatalities from bulls to agricultural workers except when the bulls have been penned up <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount did not say that when he got up <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount lord ridley suggested that what was in the bill was a compromise <e> <s> i really do not think that is a sustainable position <e> <s> this is not a compromise <e> <s> it is very strongly opposed by all organisations interested in public access and public rights of way <e> <s> however there was a compromise <e> <s> indeed there was an agreement and i would suggest to noble lords opposite who have spoken against this amendment and particularly the government that the reason why this part of the bill has aroused so much public interest and so much disquiet among all those who wish to visit the countryside without being killed injured or just frightened is that the government allowed the agreement which had been reached between the country landowners association the national farmers union and the ramblers association not to be put into the bill <e>", "<cs> those are exactly the sort of problems which the cla the nfu and the ramblers association agreed could be met by the temporary diversions which were part of the agreed package <e> <s> i agree that simply to ban all bulls from all fields would be wrong and that is why the agreement was that there should be temporary diversions <e> <s> i think that would have met the problems not only of people with single suckler herds or beef herds but also of people with dairy bulls who wanted to run them in the fields and who have a lot of fields with public footpaths going through them <e> <s> they will be in a worse position under the provisions of this bill than they would have been under the proposals which the last government supported <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to accept that the common galloways have all sorts of defects which belted galloways do not have <e> <s> more seriously there are a number of breeds which i assume under this legislation will be allowed to run in fields ranging from white park cattle and i am sorry that the noble earl lord ferrers is not here to tell us a little more about their temperament to a number of continental breeds <e>", "<cs> the mere fact that noble lords accept that it is likely that some people will have to run from bulls seems to me to make the case for this amendment and i hope the noble lord will press it to a division <e>", "<cs> if i may address myself as much to my noble friend as to anyone else it would be useful for us to be able between now and report stage to look at what the noble earl has said and in the light of the decision the committee made on amendment no <e> <s> the amendment of the noble lord lord avebury and my noble friend we might be able to come back to this at report stage <e> <s> i would say to the noble earl that it seems odd to me when the various interests most directly involved the nfu on the one side and the ramblers association on the other were so close to agreement even though there were some minor points of difference that the noble earl mentioned that those points of difference were not felt by the government to he something that they could make a decision on and to come to parliament for parliament to make a final decision <e> <s> instead of that the government went away and came back with a set of proposals which to put it mildly raised great public concern and a fair amount of public outrage <e> <s> it seems to me when one looks behind the governments <e>", "<cs> we support the amendment <e> <s> i am assuming in view of the noble earls traumatic experiences as a child that he will be supporting it too <e> <s> i hope we may hear from him to that effect <e>", "<cs> i have taken the noble earls two points on this amendment <e> <s> first i can see that it would clearly be unreasonable if for example a highway had for some reason been built over the top of a volcano particularly if it were active for the highway authorities to rebuild it every time the volcano erupted <e> <s> but it seems to me a little unlikely that there would be a highway in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i think that if they had accepted the last amendment it would have solved all sorts of problems including this rather unlikely one <e> <s> but that difficulty raised by the noble earl could be got round by the insertion of the word reasonable or some such qualification in the duty that is being placed on the highway authority <e> <s> the noble earl did not seem to place a great deal of weight on that first objection so i wonder whether i could ask him a question about the second one <e> <s> it is after all likely that if part of the m disappeared the highway authority concerned would set about replacing it pretty quickly <e> <s> but what we were wanting to know was whether the government would view with some favour a duty to replace where it was reasonable in the circumstances specified by my noble friend a footpath or bridleway <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl is prepared to consider that limited point which would clearly fall within the terms of the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend said in moving the amendment it seems to be an eminently sensible provision <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may just intervene <e> <s> the noble earl very kindly said that he would consider the point and i know how anxious the government are when they agree to consider something that we should not then prolong the debate <e> <s> that is a feeling with which i have some sympathy so i wonder whether if any noble viscount wishes to add anything more he will bear in mind that we are trying the noble earls patience <e>", "<cs> may i try to encourage the noble viscount to be a little more generous in his support <e> <s> first although the electric current in an electric fence would not be hazardous to a human being the point of wanting some control and it is only a limited control over the presence of electric fences on bridle-ways is that as the noble lord lord spens said horses are likely to come into contact with them <e> <s> a horse will very often be sweating unlike a cow or a bull for that matter and the current will therefore have a much more marked effect <e> <s> that is without the fact that a horse has a thinner skin and would be more susceptible to shock <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that the amendment does not ban electric fences <e> <s> it simply allows some control if an electric fence is a <e>", "<cs> i must say that i have some sympathy with what the noble viscount has just said <e> <s> the thing which worried me particularly about this and i do not know whether the noble lord lord stanley of alderley can help me with this is that as i understand it at the moment under a traffic regulation order there is no right of appeal whatsoever so that if an order was made banning riders from a particular bridleway they would have no right of appeal <e> <s> just as i was complaining earlier i think with some support from all sides of the committee that it would not be right simply for there to be an appeal to the local authority in cases of diversions and so on when they were the people who had initiated matters it does not really seem to me to be fair on horse riders that if a traffic regulation order is made against them they should have no right of appeal to anybody <e> <s> i would hope that before the committee looked with favour on this amendment we could at least deal with that problem if i am right about it <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble earl not only for accepting the point that we made but for managing to meet it before we finished the committee stage <e> <s> i only wish for the sake of us all the government the front benches and everyone else that we had managed to do a few more of the things while still in committee that we have to come back to at report stage <e> <s> nevertheless that is not to be <e> <s> it is wonderful that we have dealt with one amendment <e>", "<cs> once again i am very grateful to the government and welcome these useful amendments <e>", "<cs> again we welcome these amendments <e>", "<cs> i must say it seemed to me that by the time we had finished part i just about every possible exclusion for agriculture and forestry was allowed for at least twice over in the existing provisions of part i we were hoping in a number of respects that when we came back to the matter on report we could at least have them allowed only once rather than twice <e> <s> unless there is some sensible explanation for leaving out part i i propose that it should be agreed here and then perhaps we can get back to the actual drafting of part ito make it a little more sensible than it appears to be at the moment <e>", "<cs> might i suggest to the noble lord lord middleton that it might be a little more seemly if we at least waited until the report stage and see whether we cannot meet some of the very real worries about part i and the exclusions that are there at the moment <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of the problems about general licensing and the provision which allows people at the moment to do something at any time although it was clearly the intention of noble lords at least on the back benches opposite that this should simply be used for emergency procedures <e> <s> if we can get some of thoss problems cleared up we might not feel we were overdoing it quite so much as we would feel at the moment if this amendment were pressed <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord <e> <s> i had intended to put down an amendment which would have covered section one of the sections which the noble lord has covered in his amendment <e> <s> i did not do so in order to save time for which i am sure the noble lord the leader of the house will be grateful <e> <s> section covers the advisory bodies <e> <s> in particular it struck me that it would be useful to see that they were <e>", "<cs> i think this might be a suitable opportunity to thank first my noble friends lady david lord donaldson of kingsbridge and those on our back-benches in particular my noble friends lord houghton of sowerby lord underhill and lord kilbracken for their extremely brief but extremely valuable contributions at numerous stages in the bill <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank the noble earl lord avon who has been so remarkably helpful and patient with noble lords on all sides of the committee <e> <s> at times i dare say he has felt as i have that we were engaged in a process which was never going to come to an end <e> <s> but it has and i am sure we are very pleased about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the first time that i have had an opportunity to say something at the report stage may i echo from this side of the house what the noble lord the chief whip said about the magnificent work that was done last night to get the marshalled list printed <e> <s> having seen what those concerned had to deal with in draft form i have the greatest possible sympathy for them and i am sure that we shall make much better progress today <e> <s> indeed the only reason that we shall make any progress today is because of all the hard work that was done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene if the noble earl will allow me <e> <s> if he looks at clause he will see that the birds included in that are included in part i of schedule <e> <s> it is that subsection to which this amendment refers <e> <s> secondly would he bear in mind that birdwatchers also often can go birdwatching only at week-ends which is why i am suggesting there should be this division between the two groups <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord burton raised one other objection to the amendment at least i think it was intended to be art objection although i would not see it as such in that he said there were some areas of the country where birdwatchers could go and where there would not be sunday shooting <e> <s> that does not seem a point worth while making let alone worth answering but as it was the only substantive objection to the amendment i will answer it <e> <s> there are a large number of birdwatchers who cannot travel long distances because they cannot afford to do so because they do not have any means of transport or as noble lords will be aware public transport on sundays is not particularly reliable to put it mildly and many people will want to go birdwatching in an area close to where they live <e> <s> the object of bird-watching i would remind the noble earl lord swinton is not to watch birds being blasted out of the sky but to watch them feeding and acting naturally in an undisturbed way <e>", "<cs> my lords areas where people go birdwatching are designed so that people can see birds in rushes and reeds and places like that and that is what a million people as a minimum in this country like to do with much of their free time <e> <s> i have no objection in the amendment to people who wish to go wildfowling doing so at the weekend and it is ridiculous to suggest that people will not be able to do so on saturdays <e> <s> in norfolk the county where i live people shoot on a saturday whether they work on farms or in other places or whether they are members of your lordships house and it causes them no inconvenience whatever and those who wish to shoot pest species like pigeons and crows on sundays will still be at liberty to do so after the amendment has been passed which i hope your lordships will now do <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to my noble friend i think that there is a balance of arguments here and on the whole i do not think the one suggestion is that much better than the other <e> <s> if the government feel very strongly that things should be left as they are i would suggest to my noble friend that it might be better to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am worried about this for a number of reasons <e> <s> i am not sure that the damage to forestry can be dismissed quite as easily as the two noble lords opposite have dismissed it <e> <s> in particular as i understand it one of the effects not mentioned yet would be that the capercaillie would no longer be subject to the controls on introductions which come later in the bill and it would therefore be quite lawful to introduce these birds into any areas where they do not currently exist and where it was possible for them to live <e> <s> it would therefore leave totally uncontrolled their introduction into a lot of areas in the north of england and elsewhere where there would be a lot of forestry and where at present none of these birds would be living <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to say so he is the one who suggested that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord onslow said that there has not been a case made out for making the changes <e> <s> may we take snipe and woodcock as one case and then turn to the wildfowl question later <e> <s> the arguments are different and the noble lord lord home addressed himself to only the first of the two amendments <e> <s> i think that there is a strong case on biological grounds regarding snipe <e> <s> i have been given some information about various studies regarding breeding snipe and the development of young snipe <e> <s> for example in a study on st kilda nests were found between mid-july and mid-august that contained eggs <e> <s> if nests which contain eggs are found at that time of year i cannot believe that the snipe are developed sufficiently for it to be justifiable to shoot them at the time when apparently in scotland a few people think it is right to shoot them <e>", "<cs> my lords as in all these matters what is important is what is discovered by scientific inquiry and what the governments experts on the advisory committees have to tell us <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will pay at least as much attention to that as he would to his own personal experiences <e> <s> my understanding is that the advisory committees both in england and scotland which are made up of those <e>", "<cs> no my lords with respect the case is a great deal stronger than that <e> <s> as the noble earl has not been as forthcoming as i for one was hoping he would be perhaps i could briefly state what the case is <e> <s> first i think that noble lords interested in field sports and in particular in shooting in this country are running the danger of making this country by far the worst in europe from the point of view of the extent to which we shoot things the length of time for which we shoot things and so on <e> <s> nowhere do our own practices stand out compared to the rest of europe in a worse light than in this case where we shoot wildfowl so late in the winter <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will allow me i made the point that this shooting in february also disturbs all the protected species of waders and wildfowl as well as the quarry species which are shot <e> <s> that is something which surely the noble earl should be concerned about <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to let amendment no <e> <s> a fall because later we shall come back to a similar point <e> <s> however i should like to ask the noble earl where it is said that the nature conservancy council will always be consulted <e> <s> i know that from now on they will themselves appoint the advisory committees but i thought it was a printing error when the noble earl indicated that he was deleting lines to <e> <s> i could not understand why he was deleting the nature conservancy council and assumed that he had done so by mistake <e> <s> but obviously he has not <e> <s> where does it say in the bill that the government will consult the nature conservancy council <e> <s> it may <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is obviously still making his speech in which case perhaps i may intervene in it <e> <s> i am not sure that he is right i think that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> i think it would be worth looking at this again <e> <s> it is a small matter <e> <s> the subsection has to be re-drafted as a result of the governments amendment but i hope that the noble lords advisers will consider this from the viewpoint of those interested in bird protection as well as those interested in shooting <e> <s> i think it is excellent that the shooters are to be consulted and it is excellent that they are on the advisory committees but if that is to be the case as i hope it will be i think it is only right in the case of these particular orders especially that the bird protection people should also be <e>", "<cs> not as i understand it my lords <e> <s> as i understand it it is not possible to pass a by-law in scotland which would prevent somebody shooting on the foreshore as they are now able to do <e> <s> part of my authority for this comes from correspondence in the <e>", "<cs> my lords at times i am astonished at the extent to which ministers do not appear to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords there are a large number of areas where bird protectionists would like to set up bird sanctuaries and where either owners or occupiers i am not sure about farmers about which the noble lord asked me specifically have prevented the sanctuary being set up <e> <s> i do not regard sanctuaries as being of any threat to farming and i am trying to persuade noble lords opposite that they should not be <e> <s> having made my case i hope that they will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble lord a question about this amendment <e> <s> as i understand it this removes the provision for local authorities to promote bird sanctuaries <e> <s> i assume that there is still somewhere in the bill a provision stating that the local authority can do this because i know they are particularly interested in bird sanctuaries <e> <s> it would be helpful if the noble lord pointed out where that arises <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister my lords <e> <s> i accept what the noble lord lord stanley of alderley says but farmers like others will be advised by people who will have to read the bill <e> <s> they will not have had the benefit of parliamentary counsels lengthy opinion on what the word necessary means or does not mean <e> <s> i suggest it would be a small improvement to include and urgent in the provision especially if as seems the case the government do not propose to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may beg leave to move this amendment simply in order to raise with the government a point on which i would not expect an answer now but perhaps the minister will consider it and write to me <e> <s> as the noble lord has already intimated the government do not themselves intend to move this amendment but if the noble lord lord sandys is concerned about the proprieties of the matter i would say that any noble lord is free to move it <e> <s> the amendment raises the question of what is the legal position of a landowner or farmer who applies for a licence to do something is refused the licence and then goes ahead and does it in any event <e> <s> the amendment would have made it quite clear that in those circumstances such a person would be committing a criminal offence and that seemed to me to be quite a useful point to state in the text of the bill <e> <s> as i understand it at the committee stage the government said i do not have the reference with me that that was the case in any event <e> <s> if a person who had applied for and been refused a licence then took action under clause or under the later clause which applies to animals where the same problem will not now arise and so we are talking about only <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to intervene we are having a confused debate <e> <s> we are not looking at all the amendments that are down <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the amendments to the animals clause he will see that my noble friend has not prevented the use of guns against pest species but only those specially protected mammals referred to in schedule and the noble lord lord stanley has an amendment down which would allow the use of the airgun against pests <e> <s> the noble lord will be happy with the package <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we could look at this more rationally <e> <s> i do not know if lord stanley and his colleague the noble earl are planning to speak to their amendment <e> <s> it would be helpful if the house knew what their intention was <e>", "<cs> my lords the government seem to have temporarily disappeared <e>", "<cs> my lords i was trying to make a speech and i gave way to the noble earl lord caithness in the hope that i would get some clarification which i did not <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful to go through the various amendments on airguns air rifles and air pistols so that we all know what we are talking about <e> <s> my noble friend has down an amendment which is the same except for the inclusion of the word or as amendment no <e> <s> a in the name of the noble earl lord caithness and the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> that would prevent the use of airguns air rifles and air pistols against birds <e> <s> they then have amendment no <e> <s> a which would allow the use of those weapons against bird pest species and that from my point of view is acceptable <e> <s> it states what i understand to be what the law already is that it is illegal to use an airgun air rifle or air pistol against anything but a bird pest species <e> <s> so all that your lordships would be doing before we get heated about it is re-stating where it ought to be stated what the law now is <e> <s> i hope that we will accept either my noble friends amendment or the noble earls amendment <e> <s> it seems to me not to matter which <e> <s> i have not worked out whether the or should be there <e> <s> i would prefer not to see bird pests shot with airguns but i would not wish to oppose that amendment if noble lords opposite wish to press it <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord would not wish to alter what was said but the noble earl lord avon actually said that he had that morning received clearance from the home office for the government to table an amendment <e> <s> he did not say that the government would consider doing it he said that the government would do it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i gave way a number of times and i am sorry that he did not see fit to give way to me when i wanted to broach the point <e> <s> may i ask this <e> <s> the noble lord may not be aware of the fact but at committee stage there was an amendment down <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord belstead did not deal with this in the course of his remarks <e> <s> my understanding is that amendments nos <e> <s> a and a which i gather the noble earl is taking together if they were put into the bill simply restate the existing law <e> <s> i may have been misinformed but my information is that it is illegal to use airguns against game species of birds which have to be shot by shotguns or by other means <e> <s> it is not legal just to shoot other birds because they are all protected <e> <s> the only thing you can shoot at the moment with an airgun is a pest species so these two amendments as i understand it restate the existing law but they do so in a clear way and in a place where it ought to be restated <e> <s> it would be an enormous help to the sort of campaign which the noble lord lord belstead is going to launch on the public in the near future <e> <s> i would have thought that the government would accept these immediately <e> <s> if not i hope they will accept them at third reading having thought about them more carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i see people nodding <e> <s> i want it to be on the record that the noble lord is not talking about the words in the amendment but about a strengthened version <e> <s> i take it that he agrees with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when i did not see an amendment on the marshalled list i had a nasty feeling that the noble earl was going to say this <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be good enough for various reasons <e> <s> it is worth reminding ourselves even if we cannot get this through to parliamentary counsel what kind of legislation it is that we are considering <e> <s> this is legislation which on the whole does not lead to many prosecutions though i know that there have been a number under the protection of birds acts <e> <s> for example under clause which we have just passed and a similar clause applying to animals i am not aware of a single prosecution ever having been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is going to press the amendment and as he has not withdrawn it i assume that he is may i make it clear that i had not thought that he would have done so and far from what the noble lord lord mowbray said being the case there is certainly not unanimous support for the amendment <e> <s> we would see it as a catastrophe if the house passed an amendment which was in direct breach of the eec directive <e> <s> it clearly would not be acceptable to the government <e> <s> it would make a nonsense of the bill and the basis on which all the provisions have been put in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for this series of amendments which go right through the bill and which as he said meet a point i raised in committee <e> <s> i had tabled again the amendments i had down in committee but of course i shall not need to move those now and that will save us a lot of time <e> <s> i appreciate that this series of amendments has involved a great deal of work by officials and parliamentary counsel because this has not been an easy amendment to make and i wish at the same time to express thanks to all the others who have done much work between committee and now behind the scenes <e> <s> we are very grateful to them for assisting to meet the points that were made and i am glad to take this opportunity of saying so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i was a little concerned at what seemed to me to be the implications of some of the things which the noble lord lord burton was saying <e> <s> i do not know whether it in fact amounted to a nod and a wink to go back to a previous discussion but it seemed to me to come very close to it <e> <s> for example instead of talking about the illegal killing of a specially protected bird he talked in terms of somebody protecting their charges <e> <s> what he meant was somebody committing a serious criminal offence by killing a bird listed in schedule and i think it would have been better if he had said so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should feel happier if the government had accepted all the advice that they had been given by the advisory committees rather than just some of it when it happened to suit their views <e> <s> nevertheless even though they are not prepared to accept all the advice i shall do so <e> <s> i do so with some reluctance <e> <s> this bird will continue to be illegally killed <e> <s> of course it will still be illegal to kill it <e> <s> that point i stress most strongly <e> <s> there was some reporting of our committee stage which suggested that removal of the sparrowhawk from schedule would in some way leave it open for people to kill it <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> it remains a protected bird <e> <s> i hope that everyone in your lordships house and all those who read the debate will make every effort to make that point clear <e> <s> removal from schedule does not mean that it is no longer protected <e> <s> it certainly is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first to the noble viscount interesting though his contribution was that i hope the fate of these three species will not be decided on the culinary habits of the red army <e> <s> the noble lord lord burton asked how many of these birds are shot <e> <s> i know he never believes my figures but if i quote him some figures from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome very much indeed this amendment and thank the government for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was sorry to see these birds brought up at this stage <e> <s> we did not have a chance to discuss them at committee stage and i do not know whether the advisory committees have yet looked at them <e> <s> no doubt the noble earl lord avon will be able to tell us whether they have had time to look at them since the amendments went down but if they saw them at the same time as the rest of us i doubt whether they have <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not think that i can withdraw the amendment <e> <s> neither at the committee stage nor today has there been a single voice in support of the inclusion of these birds in the schedule <e> <s> had i had one person other than the noble lord on the government front bench against me either at the committee stage or today i might have felt some obligation not to press the amendment since obviously this is not the most important point in the bill <e> <s> but when noble lords on all sides of the house at two stages of a bill support unanimously the removal of certain birds i do not think that it is on to withdraw the proposal simply because the government say so <e>", "<cs> my lords following the committee stage i had three letters from people i did not know before <e> <s> in effect they could not understand how the <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the questions raised by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley and i can understand his concern but i agree with what the noble earl lord ferrers has said <e> <s> i personally think that this is a very helpful and useful clarification <e> <s> in fact i think it begins to make part i of the bill acceptable to nature conservationists as opposed to being a major step backwards <e> <s> i do not think it really changes the governments intention but what is going to happen is now clear in the bill rather than a reliance on the sort of assurances which nature conservationists frankly felt unable to accept <e> <s> i very much hope that in the spirit of compromise and agreement this amendment will be acceptable to the house <e> <s> certainly from this side of the house we warmly welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment because we have been through a number of stages since the committee stage when i moved with my noble friend lady david an amendment to reverse list mammals reptiles and amphibians <e> <s> that did not receive a great deal of support around the committee and i think that it was felt certainly by the government to involve a great deal of rather complicated redrafting at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i point out that since the committee stage we have had a number of cases where the government agreed to take advice and when the advice has come back they have not acted on it <e> <s> do i understand the noble earl to say that if the advice is that these species should be listed the government will definitely table an amendment to that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble earl did not quite meet my point <e> <s> the worry is that the government having received the advice will not act on it <e> <s> the noble earl very nearly said what i wanted him to say but can he give us an assurance that the government will actually make the changes which they are advised to make <e> <s> because at certain stages during the report stage the government have not accepted the advice that they have been given by the advisory committee <e> <s> i hope that in this case they will do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have not yet spoken perhaps i could pursue this matter <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble earl can speak again but at least we could put the point on the record and someone can write to the noble earl lord cranbrook and myself before the third reading so that we can consider whether or not to table the amendment again <e> <s> we want to know whether the provisions of the bill which cover england scotland and wales also cover the channel islands <e> <s> the noble earl is shaking his head <e> <s> it seems that the bill does not cover the channel islands <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl lord cranbrook and i will find it easier to decide what to do with the benefit of that knowledge and i am grateful to the minister <e>", "<cs> i welcome the amendment my lords and thank the government for tabling it <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested to hear what the noble earl said about this new combination between a snare and a trap <e> <s> as he said we had a debate on this at committee stage <e> <s> in putting my name to this amendment i was quite seriously trying to take account of the objections raised by among others the noble baroness lady elliot who pointed out that she thought this would cause great difficulties in scotland <e> <s> my feeling was that it might be more acceptable to have the amendment which is now down particularly as i stressed at committee stage that licensing procedures would be available to meet the serious problems people foresaw in upland areas in yorkshire as a number of noble lords opposite mentioned and in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the chief whip for not making any noises to me <e> <s> i am sure that would have a far more disastrous effect than a self-locking snare has ever had on anybody <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what i said on committee stage <e> <s> we have had a good go at this and i feel i do not know what my noble friend thinks that in view of the really rather sympathetic reply by the noble earl it might be best to leave the matter there <e> <s> there will be a provision to add prohibited methods to the bill as well as to take them off and i hope this research will be given a high degree of priority <e> <s> if it is not it seems to me that snaring will be banned whether or not there is an acceptable alternative <e> <s> it is a disastrously cruel method of killing indiscriminately <e> <s> that is the main objection to it at least in my mind not that it is used to kill foxes but that whatever it kills it kills very cruelly and also nobody setting a snare can know what kind of animal they will catch a fox a badger a domestic cat a dog or in the few areas where they still occur an otter <e> <s> most of the animals the snare was not intended to catch will be caught cruelly and will suffer a long and lingering death <e> <s> it is a vicious thing and is bound to be banned sooner or later <e> <s> if maff are giving high priority to finding an alternative i think that is a wise course of action for them to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope this amendment will be acceptable to your lordships <e> <s> it seems to me to be no more than a clarification of what i think almost everyone assumes is already the law in england and wales and will be the law in scotland once the bill becomes an act <e> <s> as my noble friend has said although i think some members of your lordships house may have thought that he wished to go further in fact all the amendment seeks to do is to prevent the hunting by hounds of the mammals listed in schedule and while we could have some fun speculating on which of those would be most unsuitable to be hunted by hounds a porpoise or a bat for instance in fact we are really talking about otters and possibly the setting of dogs on badgers although i think that would be an offence under the badgers act <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene the noble earl has already made it clear that it is illegal to disturb otters in their holts and there is no way in which you can hunt otters without running the risk of doing that <e> <s> it is already illegal and all the amendment does is to make the point clear <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to be clear because the amendment is in my name i should point out that amendment no <e> <s> a and amendment no <e> <s> za on which i have received some very considerable drafting help from the government for which i am very grateful do in fact encompass the noble viscounts intention and my intentions on the badgers act and my noble friends intentions on the deer act <e> <s> certainly speaking for my noble friend and myself i think that we are entirely happy with the drafting in amendments nos <e> <s> a and za <e> <s> if the noble viscount is happy and we have an assurance that the government are at least not going to object strenuously to amendments nos <e> <s> a and za then i think that we could short circuit a great deal of discussion simply by leaving all the individual amendments and moving amendments nos <e> <s> a and za when we come to them <e> <s> that will cover what the three of us want simply and quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am sure that these amendments large and important ones represent a significant improvement in the bill <e> <s> i think the fact that they are the result of a great deal of all-party co-operation both on the back-benches and the front benches is something to be welcomed <e> <s> we will in this respect have left part i as well as in a number of other important respects today a great deal better for the time we have taken on it <e> <s> i am delighted that this is going through as smoothly as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am listening very carefully because i think that we got into a muddle over this point at the committee stage <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord where in the bill it is stated that what he has described is in fact the case <e> <s> he said that a nurseryman would have to show that the plant was taken from cultivated stock <e> <s> where in the bill is that stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am hoping that if i intervene briefly the noble lord will be able to receive advice on the point about which we asked him and then intervene during my remarks to tell me the answer <e> <s> it seems to me that without the proposal that we are suggesting in this amendment the provisions of the bill will be totally unenforceable <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord sandys would like to intervene during the course of my remarks so as to answer the question that has been put to him since it is of the most vital importance and if we do not receive a satisfactory answer i feel that we shall have to press the amendment <e> <s> if there are drafting errors in the amendment we could have it tidied up at third reading <e> <s> but if the noble lord does not propose to intervene i shall assume that he was inaccurate in what he said and that the bill does not contain a provision which does what he suggested <e> <s> certainly we have not been able to find such a provision <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that that was already what the bill did but he now appears to be contradicting himself <e> <s> this is a muddle <e> <s> we did not get it straight at committee <e> <s> if we do not make this amendment i see absolutely no prospect of us getting it straight before the bill leaves your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw it <e> <s> it goes some way to meet the point and i am grateful to the noble lord for that <e> <s> it does not help with something not on the convention which is not subject to the endangered species act licensing procedure <e> <s> things that are not covered by that that are going to be dangerous to release in the wild will probably be covered by some disease control restrictions like restrictions on things likely to spread fowl pest rabies or something else <e> <s> although it would be possible to think of some fish which would be highly undesirable to release in british fresh waters but which would not be under the convention <e> <s> they could be imported and released and they could decimate trout or salmon <e>", "<cs> my lords we are in danger of making ourselves a laughing stock if i may say so bluntly to the noble lord lord sandys <e> <s> there are one hundred and one different plants which do not grow ordinarily in the wild which noble lords in all parts of the house will personally have been responsible for planting in the wild <e> <s> i am quite happy to admit that if this goes through i am going to be due for about a fine and i imagine that the total in your lordships house will run into many hundreds <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i would be very interested to have a copy of the letter if the noble lord lord sandys could take that on board because i have a lot of sympathy with the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is excellent <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i am sure that all noble lords including the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley and others who have taken such an active part in this debate over the years many more active than i will be delighted at the news <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that my noble friend has an important point here and that is why i put my name to the amendment <e> <s> if the noble earl is to look at this matter perhaps i may make a couple of further points and i hope that we shall be able to clear this up before the third reading <e> <s> as i understand it the eec directive does not make any provision which allows for all birds or their eggs to be used for food <e> <s> consider the undesirability of this country having that kind of provision in our own legislation implementing the directive <e> <s> if we are seen by the rest of europe taking such powers whether or not we are to issue licences is immaterial <e> <s> people will look at the wording of the bill when it becomes an act <e> <s> if the powers taken in it are as wide as they are currently it seems to me inevitable that those countries in europe which shoot song birds for the table for food to be put into cans bottles or whatever will look at this provision and say ah <e> <s> bingo <e> <s> thats how we can carry on <e>", "<cs> may i ask a point for clarification <e> <s> i thought i heard the noble earl say amendment no <e> <s> a which does not exist but it may be that i heard him incorrectly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that we very warmly welcome this amendment <e> <s> again i think it is a very helpful clarification of the provisions in the bill <e> <s> certainly i shall not be moving amendment no <e> <s> b which was put down in the expectation that the government amendments would not be put down <e> <s> but the government amendments meet my point rather better than mine does <e> <s> i am really very grateful indeed and i think it is a great improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be simpler if we considered just the amendment for the time being <e> <s> every farmer in your lordships house has considerable sympathy particularly with <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down may i make the suggestion that one answer to this would be the removal of the species from the specially protected list if it really was so numerous as to be affecting the population of some other species <e>", "<cs> my lords that may have been the view of parliamentary counsel but how does that leave the licensing authorities <e> <s> they are because they are government departments or agents of the government bound by the provisions of article of the directive so that they have to interpret these words which are used in the directive <e> <s> if they are found to be in breach of them we shall be hauled up in front of the commission or whatever happens to a government if they are in breach of the directive <e> <s> if the words are vague and uncertain then the government should try to find some words which are not vague and not uncertain and put those into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see why it is giving some worry <e> <s> i welcome this amendment <e> <s> i was not going to say anything but i was going to withdraw the next amendment in my name <e> <s> it seems to me that this goes a long way towards meeting the worries not by any means so far as i should like but it is certainly a very welcome move <e> <s> at committee stage the noble earl and some of his noble friends said that the bill already required the minister of agriculture to consult the ncc about the licences he issued and at that stage in our discussion it took quite a lot to persuade noble lords opposite that the bill did not actually say that <e> <s> when the government put in what they thought the bill then said it seems to be a bit rough for there to be a complaint about it <e> <s> i wish this went a good deal further and required the minister of agriculture to consult with the ncc before they issued a licence <e> <s> indeed i think we should have gone a great deal further than that and not had maff issuing licences at all <e> <s> i really think the noble earl lord caithness should not complain about this very modest improvement which really meets the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the government for this amendment which meets the point fully <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that somebody should thank the government for these amendments <e> <s> we carried a vote on the amendment of the noble lord lord craigton which made the point <e> <s> the government have changed it slightly but i am sure that it will be acceptable <e> <s> i think that the figures that they have come up with and the removal of imprisonment and so on indeed the whole combination do meet the points made on all sides of the house and have a great deal of support <e> <s> i think that once again it is a major improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the last thing that i intend to say this evening <e> <s> first i should like to welcome this amendment which is a major improvement again and meets a point a number of us made in committee <e> <s> secondly i think that it is appropriate at the end of a long day to thank the noble earl lord avon for the many really considerable improvements that we have been able to make to the bill during the course of the day not always with his wholehearted support but very often with his wholehearted support and with a great deal of help <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble earl his colleagues and all his advisers for the enormous amount of hard work that they have had to put in in a very short time with some extra difficulties yesterday to produce all these amendments and to meet all the points that they have been able to meet <e> <s> we really are very grateful indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i am quite happy with the governments proposed amendment <e> <s> it meets what i accept were at the committee stage some real worries that noble lords opposite had about the way in which methods of killing animals and birds could be altered in future <e> <s> i am not so happy with lord stanley of alderleys amendment to the amendment because there are inevitably going to be a fairly large number of additions and alterations to all these schedules <e> <s> plants are going to come on and go off <e> <s> during the passage of the bill at least one moth has been discovered that people did not know about and has had to be added <e> <s> if that is all going to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedures it is going to be a nightmare <e> <s> i should prefer to stick at what the government have proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a complicated and technical matter <e> <s> it might be wisest for the noble earl to consider the matter and i should be interested in having a copy of the letter if he intended to write to my noble friend about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl that it is sensible to take the government amendment and the all-party amendment amendment no <e> <s> a which follows it and to discuss them together <e> <s> perhaps i could first make the point that i do not think there is any difference among any of us about the importance of what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not intended as a criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was a nonstarter because the nfu simply said that it was considering it and thought that it would work if everyone agreed <e> <s> the ncc the governments statutory advisers have said that they do not think that it is any use on its own <e> <s> that is what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will allow me perhaps he would read the last four lines <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl would read it <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case perhaps the noble earl could read it out loud <e>", "<cs> my lords that certainly is not the case at the moment in a number of areas particularly where sites are affected by land drainage <e> <s> after the debates at committee stage i was given some more information about a neighbouring county to the one where i live suffolk which gave us some information about the number of sssis that have been lost or damaged recently in that county <e>", "<cs> certainly not <e>", "<cs> it was your decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that assurance <e> <s> probably we had better leave our discussions on the safeguarding of habitats to another occasion <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it from that reply that the noble earl intends to write to me before the third reading <e> <s> we debated both the principle and the detail of this matter very fully at the committee stage when it received considerable support <e> <s> i have before me a note to the effect that at the committee stage the government said that they would consider the point <e> <s> i appreciate that they have had much to do particularly in regard to this part of the bill <e> <s> however i do not think that it would be reasonable for me to withdraw the amendment unless i have an assurance that before third reading the government will come to a conclusion so that i can come back at that stage with the amendment if the government have not got in touch with me <e> <s> if the noble earl wishes to intervene to give me such an assurance i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i know that the bill is to be considered by another place but as the noble earl with his deep knowledge of parliamentary procedure will know if the bill leaves here without containing this amendment and the whips are on in another place so as to ensure that the amendment is not included there then there will not be another chance for this house to consider the matter <e> <s> given the wide level of support that the proposition attracted i think that it probably would be desirable for this house to have a chance to decide whether it wants it included in the bill before it leaves here <e> <s> if the noble earl is saying to me well if that is the case it would be better for you to press it now i think that that would be the best course but if he wants to think about it further and give me a considered response before third reading i should be quite happy to withdraw the amendment in the spirit of reasonableness and light which now pervades the understanding between the noble earl and myself <e> <s> i should like a little more guidance from the noble earl <e> <s> i do not want to withdraw the amendment and then perhaps have to spend much more time on the matter at third reading to no great avail <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given way both to the noble earl and to my noble friend in the course of my remarks which i think i should now bring to a conclusion <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be right to give the government a little more time in the hope that they can give some firm assurance at third reading or before hand in which case we would not need to trouble them with the amendment again but if not i think that i shall bring it back on third reading so that the house can make a decision on it <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not find that reply entirely convincing <e> <s> i feel there is a real possibility that even the very few sites that the government are putting forward for protection for a -month period are still in jeopardy in a number of ways <e> <s> i say that partly because unless we have something along the lines of my previous amendment the penalties will be nowhere near adequate to deter people from destroying a site illegally and also because it would be possible to destroy an sssi of acres and be fined only <e> <s> that is the current position and in the circumstances the amount of the fine would be extraordinarily small <e> <s> secondly because the bill itself gives people some grounds for feeling that there might be ways around even that minimum penalty and that seems to me to be one of the most glaring <e> <s> i should like to think about what the noble earl has said and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all of us who have taken part in this discussion will welcome very warmly what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i received an interesting letter from the association of sea fisheries committees which i think was also sent to one or two other noble lords <e> <s> they feel that they have a very important role to play in the setting up and operation of marine nature reserves and i am sure there are a number of legitimate interests who will also have a role to play <e> <s> i think this will be an improvement on <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble earl lord avon wants the amendments left out and i would certainly echo that myself <e> <s> i believe it would be better to put this clause in and to take the other ones out a straight substitution because it seems to me that this amendment has a number of practical advantages from everybodys point of view <e> <s> i am delighted by what the noble earl has said on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am waiting with interest to hear what the government will say when they get a chance to put a word in among the serried ranks of landowners pleading for compensation <e> <s> when the government have said something i shall be happy to give the noble lord my views <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why i was waiting for the noble earl to respond to the amendment is that the real answer involves the noble earl pointing out to his noble friends behind him that clause is totally ineffective <e> <s> in a fairly convoluted way that was more or less what he did <e> <s> maybe i can put it more simply <e> <s> this is nothing to do with sssis <e> <s> noble lords opposite are misleading themselves if they think that their amendment applies to sssis <e> <s> what is applies to is the or sites on which orders are placed under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords there has never been any indication as i understand it from anybody that that is the governments intention <e> <s> the intention of clause is to put an order on a site which is liable to be destroyed so that months are available for negotiation <e> <s> if that fails the ncc either compulsorily purchases the site or the landowner goes ahead and destroys it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that was the point that i was making on the previous amendment that all that is going to happen is a years delay before the site is destroyed so we are not talking about very much loss of value <e> <s> i am sorry the noble earl did not say that more clearly on the previous amendment because it might have satisfied his noble friends <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i accept that is the purpose of the delay and that is exactly what i said earlier <e> <s> if there is not an agreement the site will then be destroyed or compulsorily purchased in which case the compenation is assessed as it would be normally for a compulsory purchase and as it can be now when the ncc have powers of compulsory purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems a bit tough on the local authority concerned and those involved in this subject if when they moved the amendment to the private bill the cumbria bill they were told that it ought to be in the wildlife and countryside bill <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of us have received fairly lengthy and detailed communications from the local authority concerned and that is what they say was said to them <e> <s> this amendment strikes at some important abuses <e> <s> one that particularly worries me is the question of the use of metal detectors <e> <s> it seems to me that the unrestrained use of metal detectors in the countryside causes enormous problems <e> <s> i know that there is a voluntary code of practice but it seems to me from my personal experience to be honoured a great deal more in the breach than in the observance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord with a question <e> <s> he seems to be very easily satisfied over this <e> <s> how does he know when the limestone is taken whether it will be used for agricultural purposes or be transported all over the country for rockeries <e> <s> it may not be allowed but how will he know as the limestone is being scooped off the limestone pavement its final destination <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am <e> <s> i think the noble lord earl avon has gone just a little further than he did in his letter to me <e> <s> i apologise for preempting his speech but it did have the advantage of shortening the debate on this point <e> <s> i am grateful to him for what he has said and i am sure his remarks will be studied by the organisations concerned <e> <s> i apologise for omitting from my own remarks the national trust one of the important voluntary organisations involved in this <e> <s> i think that the noble earl has met my personal worry <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think parliamentary counsel has confused his role of giving legal advice to the government with that of giving policy advice because i think he has got the point of the amendments wrong <e> <s> we were well aware as were the disablement organisations which put forward these amendments of the effect of the chronically sick and disabled persons act <e> <s> i suspect the voluntary organisations working with the disabled in this country know the act as well as the parliamentary counsel working on the wildlife and countryside bill <e> <s> the point is that the countryside commission and the ncc are providing grants <e> <s> the chronically sick and disabled persons act does not apply to the provision of grant by those bodies <e> <s> i think that is clear and that we got it clear at the committee stage <e> <s> i thought that is why the government agreed to put down their own amendments on this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i am confused about the arguments against the amendment <e> <s> on the one hand it is said that it is excessive and on the other that it is unnecessary <e> <s> i find it hard to understand how it can be both <e> <s> if it is unnecessary because it repeats something which already happens which i take to be the argument of the noble earl and the noble lord lord gibson-watt because the forestry commission would consult the nature conservancy council about any site of special scientific interest why is it excessive <e> <s> it is not asking them to do anything which they do not do at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has put my mind at rest on that point <e> <s> in quoting his honourable friend in another place the noble earl lord avon used words which implied that it would be an enormous bureaucratic imposition on the commission to be required to consult the nature conservancy council about sites of special scientific interest although he also said that they do this anyhow <e> <s> how can that be so <e> <s> i find both arguments to be totally unconvincing because they cancel each other out <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that is what the noble earl is going to look at <e> <s> that is my information that it was said to the forestry commission that they did not have the owners permission to discuss the plans that were going to be grant aided by the forestry commission with the ncc and so far as the forestry commission was concerned that was that <e> <s> there was no discussion with the ncc at all on that one <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for saying that he will look at this again and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the measure of the noble lord lord sandford goes rather wider than the kind of activities which the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard has just mentioned <e> <s> it seems to me of very considerable and fundamental importance <e> <s> i do not want to make the noble lord lord stanley of alderley any more suspicious than he apparently is and perhaps i could simply make some brief remarks from an agricultural point of view and from the point of view of a farmer which i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest <e> <s> the noble viscount did not listen to a word i said <e> <s> that is exactly what i was saying <e>", "<cs> i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i must protest <e> <s> the noble viscount has completely misrepresented what i have said as would have been clear from watching the faces of noble lords opposite <e> <s> i was trying to defend hill farmers and saying that they ought to get more money than they do now and more public support <e>", "<cs> my lords in an effort to speed things up now that we are making such excellent progress i wonder whether i may speak to amendment no <e> <s> aa at the same time because although it does not look like it i have had a letter about my amendment which makes me think that actually the noble lord lord stanley and i are on the same point or at least are very close <e> <s> my amendment was actually suggested by the association of county councils so the noble lord lord stanley may feel that i am not such an unwelcome bed-fellow after all <e> <s> the amendment was designed to enable this clause to apply to man-made features in the countryside which were of historic interest <e> <s> the sort of things i had in mind were parks of country houses which had been designed <e>", "<cs> park <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say that we again while hoping that it does not put the noble lord off see some merit in the amendment despite the problems which my noble friend has seen in the likelihood of it actually leading to something being implemented <e> <s> while i am on my feet i should like to take the opportunity to apologise to your lordships <e> <s> when i last said that i had an amendment which struck at the same point as the noble lord lord stanley i suggested that it had been supported by the association of county councils in fact it was the royal town planning institute but i hope that that makes our co-operation none the less desirable for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say very briefly that i agree with everything that the noble viscount lord ridley has said and at this late hour i do not wish to repeat any of it <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may emboldened by the presence of the noble lord the chief whip i should like to enter a small plea on behalf of the two front benches and those other noble lords who intend to be here tonight for the discussion of amendment no <e> <s> which is the last one on the marshalled list because it is my understanding that we should finish the bill today <e> <s> we had two substantial opening speeches from my noble friend and from the noble earl opposite on this amendment which we discussed at great length at committee stage <e> <s> it is a very important matter <e> <s> it seems to me first that a number of the arguments raised at the committee stage have been met in the new version of the amendment <e> <s> secondly all that can be said in favour of it and i dare say most of what is to be said against it although the noble earl still has to speak has been said and it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what the noble earl has said particularly his last sentence which seemed to me to go a long way towards meeting the concerns of those locally about having to face quite appalling problems and a number of conflicts of interest which give rise to great difficulties while at the same time having to cater for the very large number of visitors to the area who i think are welcomed by all concerned but who do bring some problems in their wake <e> <s> i hope the government will be able to give very speedy consideration to the proposals that have been put to them in connection with this area for the next five years as the noble earl has mentioned that the government are doing and that the conclusion they come to will be that although there is some financial commitment being called for this really is the very minimum that they can give to the area unless the broads are going to collapse under the weight of all the pressures on them and the quarter of a million visitors annually who go there for their holidays as well as everybody concerned with the nature conservation and the amenity aspects of the area they will <e>", "<cs> my lords i very strongly agree with what the noble lord lord sandford has said <e> <s> we all hope that his amendment which your lordships have passed will be a start in moving in that direction which seems to me absolutely right <e> <s> i suppose the <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to correct the noble earl on a matter <e> <s> the amendment does not require adas to give advice on nature conservation and wildlife <e> <s> i think that it would be presumptuous of anybody to make such a suggestion and i do not think that that was the suggestion made by the strutt report <e> <s> the amendment says that when adas is giving advice to farmers on agricultural matters such advice should take into account nature conservation wildlife and landscape interests <e> <s> in other words all that the amendment does is to say to adas officers when you are giving advice to farmers as you do so effectively and efficiently and in a way that is so widely welcomed by everyone in agriculture take into account wildlife and nature conservation <e> <s> it seems to me that that is a recipe for trying to avoid some of the conflicts which will otherwise arise in the countryside between farmers and nature conservationists <e> <s> when a farmer rings adas for advice on anything from clearing a dyke to a drainage proposal to spraying or whatever the advice that he gets will take into account the interests of nature conservation <e> <s> that is not the same as giving advice on nature conservation and i hope that the noble earl and his advisers will take that point on board because it is an important one <e>", "<cs> my lords occasions when government ministers get up and say that amendments are both unnecessary and then do something always seem to me to herald replies of the greatest weakness and greatest suspicion <e> <s> how can something be both unnecessary because the argument is that it is already in legislation and then have all sorts of catastrophic results for the poor nature conservancy council including causing them great embarrassment <e> <s> more seriously i think that it is helpful to have what the noble earl has said about the definition of nature conservation on the record for i do not think that that has been universally accepted among those involved throughout the nature conservancies and the history of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> so i shall look at what the noble earl said with great care <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that information <e> <s> i think that one might be rather niggardly on some of the larger water authorities <e> <s> i hope that the government will bear in mind the enormous concern that the activities of some water authorities have generated in the past and more importantly perhaps the extent to which a number of water authorities are now getting together with nature conservation interests agreeing procedures for prior <e>", "<cs> it is a full and forthright statement my lords but the question is whether anybody takes any notice of it <e> <s> the only way parliament and the public can know whether anybody takes any notice of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i had hoped that it would be called a wca not a wc because that is what it would be a wildlife conservation area <e> <s> there is one other point i should have made in introducing these remarks and did not but of which i think the noble earl is aware and that is that the rubric to clause does not refer to the areas which are covered by orders under clause <e> <s> if one reads it it says orders designating certain that is orders designating some of the sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> so the terminology applies to all <e>", "<cs> my lords you would be with clear concise and unarguable legislation <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin did not answer the question that lord avebury asked <e> <s> that question was if this amendment were put into the bill would it lead to any problems with interpretation <e> <s> the noble lords quotation from clause does lead to a problem <e> <s> it does not seem to be clear to me reading it as somebody who is not a lawyer <e> <s> the legal advice as my noble friend has said and as was said by the noble viscount lord hanworth was given to a consortium of all the interests involved in public rights of way <e> <s> the advice by solicitors and counsel has been that the bill is not clear and that it is possible that all the process of order-making will he gone through and that that will not be taken to alter the definitive map until the procedures in clause are gone through <e> <s> it would be a disaster if that were the case <e> <s> is it a risk worth running <e> <s> i cannot understand why the noble lord wants to run it <e> <s> i accept that he has clear legal advice on the one hand and the people behind the amendment have clear legal advice <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be for the convenience of the house if that were treated as an intervention in my speech so that both the noble lord and i will not be too seriously out of order <e> <s> it is not a point of substance <e> <s> we agree on what we want to achieve <e> <s> it seems silly on an important point to leave it as drafted in the bill with lawyers disagreeing with each other over the interpretation <e> <s> that will end up in court and could go either way <e> <s> the noble lord said he will look at it again <e> <s> i am grateful <e> <s> it may be possible for the lawyer who has advised us to get in touch with the lawyer who advised the noble lord and to let them sort it out <e> <s> that might be quicker and simpler if not cheaper <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not the most important part of the bill and i daresay we would all wish to get on to that <e> <s> this provision was in the previous legislation and has worked perfectly well so far as i am aware <e> <s> indeed i think it must have worked perfectly well so far as the government were aware because they did not mention the possibility of changing it in any of their consultation papers <e> <s> this was a change as i understand it which was sprung on those affected in the bill when it first appeared <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley says that the more plausible i am the more suspicious he gets <e> <s> i just wish that occasionally he would listen to the arguments and if they are good arguments that he would be capable of accepting them without this deeply suspicious nature which i must say is not characteristic of most farmers most of the time <e> <s> i am afraid the noble lord lord stanley will be giving us all a very bad image <e>", "<cs> my lords for myself i am not quite clear why the noble lord is taking these three amendments together but certainly i find great difficulties with amendments nos <e> <s> sca and scc <e> <s> the proposal in no <e> <s> scc which i think is taken from a proposal that was put forward to the countryside act seems to me to be far too subjective to make good law <e> <s> i am not sure that it would be fair in amendment no <e> <s> sca to prevent a surveying authority from taking account of a period of years use by motor vehicles of something which was reclassified as a footpath or bridleway <e> <s> that seems to me to be a little excessive <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as they go i certainly warmly welcome this long package of amendments and am grateful to the government for them <e> <s> as i understand it the government have left out several of the spicer committees recommendations which the noble lord said at committee stage he hoped to implement in this package of amendments <e> <s> i am not on the spicer committee so i am not sure about this but it may be that the noble lord can confirm whether i am right if i list the things which i think have been left out which were agreed by the local authority representatives together with everyone else on the spicer committee <e> <s> there are four points which i think have been omitted and which i think were agreed but i am really asking for confirmation <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not speaking to amendment no <e> <s> ya <e> <s> that amendment is similar but it deals with a different point in other words it deals with the rights of appeal but in quite different circumstances <e> <s> i think the same arguments apply and that if this amendment is accepted that one would automatically follow <e> <s> however this amendment deals with a rather wider question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the feeling of this house that we should come to a decision <e> <s> may i echo what the noble lord lord avebury has said there is nothing among those of us supporting this measure critical of local authorities or their elected representatives <e> <s> just as it would not be critical of the police to say that it would be wrong for a police <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo what my noble friend has said and because i am echoing his points i shall be very brief <e> <s> the amendment is of course welcome <e> <s> it meets a point which was raised in at least two amendments at the committee stage but does not do so entirely <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment does not ensure that the authority would make an order even though it will now be able to <e> <s> secondly the amendment does not i understand apply to the case where the authority failed to add a claimed right of way to the draft map and an objection was entered in an attempt to add the path that is the point that my noble friend was making <e> <s> so it seems to me that there is an important omission <e> <s> as my noble friend said perhaps when we come to amendment no <e> <s> sd the government will accept it and i believe that that would meet at least part of our objections to what the government are proposing <e> <s> however as this amendment stands i think it is a small step in the right direction but it certainly does not go all the way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i am grateful for the fact that he is to consider the point <e> <s> may i ask him to write to my noble friend and myself letting us know the result of his consideration and then we may not need to raise the matter at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i am trying to follow what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say to the noble lord that i have looked at paragraph <e> <s> it says that the authority shall not make an order so as to affect land not affected by the draft order <e> <s> i do not understand whether that means that you have to keep in the same field or that you cannot move a square inch either side of the original line <e> <s> it makes an enormous difference to a farmer whether a path is in the middle or on the side of a field <e> <s> in the normal usage of english my first instinct would be that it must mean that you cannot take it into a different field <e> <s> it sounds as if you might be able to move from one side of a field to another <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not <e> <s> that is a misunderstanding <e> <s> it says in paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that takes me back to the original way <e> <s> what does paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happy with that answer <e> <s> let us take the case of a landowner or farmer <e> <s> everyone so far has attached the greatest importance to their being given personally a copy of the proposal <e> <s> i do not think anyone has felt up to now that that is something which could be left to the discretion of anyone <e> <s> a public right of way across a farm and i speak as a farmer a rambler and a walker is an important matter <e> <s> it can lead to considerable inconvenience from a farmers point of view and possibly some additional costs in fencing stiles or what-have-you <e> <s> from the users point of view these are again very important matters <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying this seems sensible we will put it in a circular then something as important as this ought to be in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> i should like to study in <e>", "<cs> my lords i was just going to say that i think this really is the same point <e> <s> when the noble lord says that he would like to look at it again do i take it that the government do not want it to be put into the the bill tonight but that they will come forward with an amendment at third reading <e> <s> or is the noble lord not going quite so far as that <e> <s> or would be not mind it going into the bill now so that he can look at it at his leisure when the bill is printed <e> <s> as the noble lord says that the same principle is involved i should have thought that this amendment would now be acceptable to the government <e> <s> therefore i beg to move it formally <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very helpful <e> <s> i am sure all of us will be very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we had a formidable and indeed an unstop-able array of speakers and arguments ready had the noble lord not said what he has so it has certainly speeded everything up <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add to what the noble viscount has just said something about ordnance survey maps <e> <s> in replying to a similar amendment at the committee stage the noble lord the minister relied to some extent on the existence of ordnance survey maps and their availability to the public <e> <s> at the committee stage on th february this year at column of the <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord lord stanley is thinking about that i should like to make a couple of points <e> <s> i am certainly well aware of the problem at which lord stanleys amendment is aimed <e> <s> it is true that some bridleways can become completely impassable for walkers and as the noble lord said very nearly impassable for horses during some months of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord stanley sits down if he presses his amendment now then quite honestly i must say that my objections to it are rather more than drafting objections <e> <s> six months and three months are points of substance not of drafting <e> <s> personally i would object to dividing the house on the amendment <e> <s> i thought that the noble earl went all the way to meet him when he said that the government would come back with an amendment on third reading <e> <s> i should have thought that the noble lord lord stanley had done a great deal of very good work in this amendment and had achieved his point and might leave the matter at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i was virtually the only noble lord who at the committee stage had some objections to the amendment that was then moved on this matter and i must say that the redrafted amendment meets all the objections that i previously raised <e> <s> as i believe i said previously i have much sympathy with the problem with which the amendment is designed to deal <e> <s> i certainly very strongly support the amendment and i hope that my noble friends will support it too if the noble lord wishes to press it or needs to do so though naturally i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it is not for me to give him advice but <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little concerned about this amendment <e> <s> the noble viscount said that the parish councils views would be taken into account by the district council <e> <s> but i cannot help feeling that there would be a possibility of ignoring or overriding a parish councils views if this amendment were accepted <e> <s> while we spoke very strongly in favour of a local authority not making the final decision i do not think that we on this side would have any feelings at all against the views of local authorities and parish councils being able to be expressed <e> <s> i understand that what would happen if the amendment were accepted is that if there were a dispute people would be more likely to end up in court rather than at a public inquiry <e> <s> going to court is always much more daunting for most people other than lawyers and is very often more expensive than appearing at a public inquiry <e> <s> it seems to me that there are those two disadvantages to the noble viscounts amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is doing himself a grave injustice <e> <s> in fact what he did in moving this amendment at committee stage was to foresee the outcome of the division before dinner because this amendment which he put in the bill was consequential upon the series of amendments which would have returned the decision-making power to the secretary of state <e> <s> now the house has agreed to that and in fact the noble lord pre-empted all of us by moving this in committee <e> <s> it is now needed in the bill because it is consequential upon the decision that we took before dinner so i hope that the noble lord will withdraw his amendment and i congratulate him on his foresight <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the amendment and perhaps i may stretch the patience of the house by returning briefly to amendment no <e> <s> l <e> <s> this was one of the amendments which was consequential on the decision made before supper and i have a feeling although i have not had time to study it that there will be some consequential changes needed to amendment no <e> <s> k which has gone in pre-empting no <e> <s> l <e> <s> may i ask the government to look at that <e> <s> obviously i shall look at it before third reading but it would be a great help if they could table the drafting amendment which is obviously needed <e> <s> i would like to thank the government for amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords if it has been impossible to move on the land it has been impossible to plough the land <e> <s> normally when the land is ploughed it is then possible the same day that a tractor has been out ploughing to run over it and restore the footpath <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl answer the question i explicitly asked him <e> <s> are the local authority representatives on the spicer committee happy with what the government have proposed <e> <s> my information is that they thought it would be totally unenforceable <e>", "<cs> i hear some of my noble friends saying it is a compromise my lords in that nobody is happy but i do not think it is <e> <s> at present farmers are required to reinstate the path within three weeks and there is no excuse for wet weather or anything else <e> <s> that is the position now and the only reason why anybody suggested changing that to the time from when you plough it is six weeks from when you give notice but you have to give three weeks notice of ploughing so it is a bit of a red herring under the existing law three weeks from when you plough you must restore the footpath and no excuses is that local authorities found it unenforceable <e> <s> they said as i understand the position that the most sensible thing would be that in almost all cases somebody should restore the footpath the day it is ploughed <e> <s> the noble viscount lord ridley says i know nothing about farming on clay <e> <s> i should have thought that if the land was dry enough and suitable to be ploughed be it heavy or light soil it should be possible to run a tractor over the top of the land once you have ploughed it <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is not the case then the exceptional weather conditions or some let-out would be available <e> <s> but it still does not meet the argument i am trying to make namely that there should be a provision for restoration which the local authorities are satisfied is enforceable and i am surprised the noble viscount does not agree with that <e> <s> this house should not be approving something which we are asking local authorities to enforce if they think it is not enforceable <e> <s> after all they are the people who have to enforce it <e> <s> i should be happy with a provision which said farmers should restore a path on the day they plough it except in exceptional circumstances whereupon they should do so within a set period and i should have thought three weeks would be enough because it has been three weeks by law up to this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not be making myself very clear but what i am getting at is that subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble earl indicate that he would do as i asked <e> <s> i gave way to him and then to the noble lord lord burton rather than proceeding to withdraw the amendment but i am prepared to press it <e> <s> i feel that i have made a very reasonable request to the noble earl simply to convey the point to the local authority representatives and see what is their reaction <e> <s> i hope he will agree to do that <e> <s> if the noble earl nods to me i need not give way to him again but i shall give way to him if he wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord lord burton the intention of the word impracticable was to ensure that where it would be unreasonably expensive for one reason or another it would not be necessary for the authority to restore the path and i can see that the drafting could be improved at that point <e> <s> i would be quite happy with impracticable or unreasonable and i think that the concept of unreasonableness is one which is understood by the courts which would have to decide this <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can answer the noble lords question <e> <s> it might speed things up because then i can go on to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that water authorities do not at the moment even have to discuss their proposals with the nature conservancy council let alone take any notice of anything which the nature conservancy council might say to them <e> <s> the effect of the amendment still would not be to require water authorities to take any notice of what the nature conservancy council says to them but it would at least ensure that consultation takes place <e> <s> this happens in the case of some water authorities but not others <e> <s> the government have accepted the spirit of this amendment for which i am grateful <e> <s> it is another important step forward <e> <s> with their next two amendments which i welcome now in order to save me saying anything when we get to them we have a very reasonable number of steps to resolve some of the problems which have arisen between nature conservationists and water authorities in a number of areas <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will be in a position to bring forward the amendment which he has suggested the government will <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i ought to press this amendment because the noble earl actually said to me in a letter on rd march <e>", "<cs> my lords at the last stage of the bill when this matter was discussed we on this side of the house agreed with the government in their objections to the amendment and i must say that i would strongly agree with everything that the noble earl lord avon has just said and i hope that the amendment will be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to accept the superior wisdom of which the noble earl has had the benefit and i am grateful to him for moving these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few brief words <e> <s> we have had debates on the abuse of air weapons at every stage of the bill <e> <s> i should like to reinforce what my noble friend has said about the abuse it certainly goes much wider than that which would be controlled by the amendments <e> <s> i had two letters this morning from parents both of whom had children who had been hit in the eye by airgun pellets and both of whom had lost the sight of that eye as a result <e> <s> one was from wales and one from england <e> <s> it is a widespread and serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords may i disagree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i think that this amendment rewords something which the house accepted at the last stage considerably better than the attempt that we made at it and i would hope that now that the government have put down an amendment to this effect it will be accepted <e> <s> it does not go nearly as far as i wanted and it does not go as far as the noble lord lord beaumont wanted he moved an amendment on this matter both at committee and at report stage but it seems to me to be a useful step <e> <s> i think it is possibly to the credit of your lordships house which must contain more landowners and farmers than certainly another place and possibly any other similar gathering of the same number of people that the house has agreed to make an amendment which recognises the responsibilities of landowners and farmers <e> <s> i think it is an excellent thing and i am grateful to the government for moving this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any worries about the later amendments to which the noble earl has spoken <e> <s> but could he perhaps write to me at some stage and reassure me about this amendment which might be introducing a loophole in that somebody could claim that the animal concerned was not a wild animal although it was an animal to which it would otherwise be illegal to do what they were going to do <e> <s> because they could claim that it was bred in captivity <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may bend the rules a little may i take the opportunity to point out two printing errors in clause <e> <s> in page line i think that the words subsection of section should read subsection of section <e> <s> on page l line section should read section <e> <s> i do not know whether these are errors which can be corrected when the bill is reprinted <e> <s> perhaps the government can look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly thank the noble earl very much indeed for this amendment and echo what he said about the work of the parliamentary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right that it will not do all that is required <e> <s> despite the new clause we shall still see sites of special scientific interest being destroyed by water authorities and internal drainage boards <e> <s> what we need is better protection for those sites in part ii of the bill <e> <s> having said that i think that the governments new clause goes as far as it can in laying duties on water authorities and internal drainage boards to take account of the sites <e> <s> as i was the one who introduced the amendment i think first at committee stage i am very grateful to the government for what they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not attempt to answer the noble earls questions on this amendment but maybe i could say a word about the amendment itself <e> <s> i was not able to go along with similar or although i think rather wider amendments which the noble earl moved at i believe committee stage and certainly at report stage and i still have some major worries about this amendment <e> <s> i certainly agree with him when he says as i understood him to say that the inclusion of a path on a definitive map by mistake should not by itself be a good reason for its remaining on definitive maps in the future <e> <s> but i do think that years of use of a path by the public should be something which can be taken into account and should not be automatically dismissed in the way that i think the noble earls amendment would do <e> <s> that seems to me to be a rather different matter from having an automatic presumption that just because something was on a definitive map in the past it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that basically these are two amendments which we should want to welcome and thank the government for but there are two points of concern <e> <s> the first one which the noble lord mentioned very briefly in describing some of the new things that would be introduced is in amendment no <e> <s> in paragraph on page of the marshalled list <e> <s> it is the requirement for members of the public to give notice of an application to all owners and occupiers of land affected <e> <s> that does seem to me to be an impossible burden to place on members of the public <e> <s> first of all as i understand it they have no way of finding out who all the owners and occupiers would be <e> <s> it may be that in some cases it would be an extraordinarily onerous burden <e> <s> it is not one which is placed on landowners who are wanting to delete a path on a map there is no requirement for them to inform all members of the public who use the path or even all representatives of the public or users groups in the area <e> <s> i should have thought that the interests of landowners or occupiers would be adequately served by the requirement to serve notice of an order on them they will be given notice before an order is made and i should have thought that also to require notice of an application would really be an impossible burden <e> <s> it may be that this simply means that paragraph will always operate and that after reasonable enquiry has been made it will be found not to be practicable to ascertain the name and address of every owner and occupier and this requirement simply will not operate <e> <s> in that case there does not seem to be much point in having it in <e> <s> i would not necessarily expect the government to give an answer now but they may like to look at the point before the bill goes to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to me to be a strong argument in favour of the noble lord lord stanley pressing his amendment <e> <s> it obviously needs some further expert attention in drafting <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord stanley will not feel that that is rude of me but i have accepted all my amendments that have needed redrafting by the government when they have been put in the bill <e> <s> obviously this amendment would need redrafting too but i think that the noble lord lord stanley and his advisers have done a good job of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl in that last sentiment <e> <s> the provision in the bill for exceptional weather conditions is a completely new one <e> <s> there has not been that sort of let-out from the obligations to restore a footpath up until now and i really think that to go a great deal further and be a great deal vaguer as the noble earl lord avon has said and to put these words in would make the position totally unenforceable <e> <s> it seems to me that this is not quite right yet and to that extent i agree with the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> for myself i hope the footpath-users the nfu and the other interests the local authorities will have another look at this in mr michael spicers committee or elsewhere <e> <s> i really do think that the right approach is to have an obligation to restore the footpath the day it is ploughed with then some exceptions allowing for weather or other exceptional circumstances like the one that the noble lord lord stanley suggested of the outbreak of disease <e>", "<cs> my lords i have looked at this amendment twice and each time thought it meant different things <e> <s> am i right in assuming that part i and part iii for that matter will be brought in by order and that they are not going to come into effect within a month of the passing of the act <e> <s> if that interpretation is correct why is not part i being <e>", "<cs> well my lords i was wrong about that <e> <s> i certainly thought that part i should be brought into effect straight away <e> <s> i cannot see any reason why it should not be so <e> <s> i cannot see the reasons for delay on other parts of the bill applying to part i i do not know whether the noble earl is able to confirm that i am right and give me an explanation <e> <s> if he is not then maybe he would write to me <e>", "<cs> we have had my lords debates on this during committee and report stages <e> <s> there seemed to be a fair consensus particularly at the committee stage when we had a very full debate on it that the bill was right <e> <s> i think i heard the noble lord lord burton suggest that the bill introduces some change in status but as i understand it that is not the case <e> <s> the hen harrier is a schedule bird at the moment and the bill merely maintains its position as such <e> <s> the population has been relatively low for <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say from this side of the house i do not want to say very much because i do not think that anything new has emerged since we discussed this matter at report that now as then we entirely agree with what the government have said about this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have supported the noble earl lord cranbrook on these amendments all the way through the passage of the bill and i should like to see this amendment in the bill <e> <s> obviously if the subsection number is incorrect it could be changed in another place <e> <s> my worry would be that while the list does not appear all that long it is a fairly significant change in that it would be the first time that something had been added to the schedule in respect of a particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be happy to agree with what the noble earl has just said if he would agree to take the advice of the nature conservancy council about how sites of special scientific interest should be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this gives me an opportunity to ask the noble earl or the government if they have reached any conclusion about the terminology of sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> i imagine they are now getting keener on areas of special scientific interest which somebody pointed out to me today will produce assis <e> <s> at report stage the noble earl lord avon said that he would look at the point to see whether we could simplify the terminology <e> <s> i wonder whether he or the government collectively have come to any conclusion <e> <s> if they have it would be nice to hear it <e> <s> i was hoping that when the bill was reprinted it would have got rid of sites of special scientific interest in the side title but it did not <e> <s> i hope one of the noble earls might be able to tell me about some happy conclusion to their deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to thank the noble earl lord avon for what he said about me and to reciprocate by saying that i think at times i have been in a happier position than he has in that i have had some rather easier briefs to defend than he has had <e> <s> however his unfailing courtesy to all of us on this side of the house in all parties new and old and to his noble friends behind him has enabled us to get through an extraordinarily heavy burden of work with chief whips and others glaring or smiling depending on how things were going with i think remarkably good speed <e> <s> we are very grateful indeed to him and to all the noble lords on the front bench opposite who have helped him <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by giving this bill a very warm welcome indeed <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the maiden speech of the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to say that i made my maiden speech on a previous zoo bill <e> <s> i then had a speech which should have taken about minutes and i did it in five today i have a speech which should take five minutes and no doubt i shall take over it <e> <s> i certainly fully support the objective at which the bill of the noble lord lord craigton is aiming <e> <s> i should like to associate myself with what he said about the efforts made in another place on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that in the wildlife and countryside bill it will be an offence to release wild animals in the wild without a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord going to mention the general economic climate of the country under the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord particularly as this has been a long debate but this is a particularly important clause in the bill <e> <s> is he saying that the local authority having recommended to the secretary of state that a particular zoo should be exempted from the provisions of the bill the secretary of state may it says in the bill hellip after consulting such persons as he thinks fit in practice what that means is that he will consult his <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the clear statement in his original answer about the scientific interests in this important area may i ask whether the noble lord could say when the ncc first considered designating this area as an sssi and therefore how long consultations with farmers and landowners in the area have been going on <e> <s> could he say also how much of the proposed sssi is currently threatened by proposals for afforestation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord does not know when negotiations and consultations started <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that i have had an extremely helpful letter from the noble earl lord avon responding to a number of the points that i raised at second reading <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be helpful given the pace at which we are taking this legislation for me to mention briefly the points which the noble earl has written to me about <e> <s> there are one or two points on which i should like to ask the noble earl lord avon and the noble lord lord craigton for further clarification because if i do not put these on the record now i do not think that any of those who are interested in the bill will have a chance to know what the government have said until it becomes an act when it may from their point of view be too late <e> <s> but i think the governments assurances have been helpful and i am grateful to the noble earl and his advisers for responding so quickly <e> <s> i know that they have been under a number of competing pressures about the contents of this legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i want to put on record the point which the noble earl made to me in his letter about <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble earl has said about the undesirability of this amendment which would be too restrictive <e> <s> for example it would be very unlikely that somebody who stole golden eagle chicks kept them in the back garden and was caught would be ordered by the court not to keep animals in captivity <e> <s> that would not be their normal practice or course of business <e> <s> nevertheless all of <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that that entirely meets the point i was making on second reading <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> just so that we can have this on the record because i am sure it is the governments intention may i ask the noble earl also to confirm that this guidance will be available in draft to the national organisations concerned with animal welfare who obviously have a major interest in questions of for example suitable enclosures veterinary advice and so on <e> <s> they have been involved in the past of course in drawing up codes of this sort for both farm animals and other animals in captivity and i am sure they will have a serious and sensible contribution to make when the government are drawing up this code of practice <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment of the noble lord lord fisher and personally would have preferred to see the numbers kept down for obvious reasons both on costs and on the efficiency of the inspections <e> <s> secondly i would have preferred to see a majority of the inspection team coming from the secretary of states list as they would under this amendment <e> <s> i think that was something which a number of interested people would have preferred to see but i think that the noble earl has gone really as far as he can in meeting that worry and i have no doubt that local authorities conscious as they are of pressures on them at the moment are more than likely in almost every case simply to nominate a vet as the noble earl has suggested and as they are perfectly free to do under the bill as drafted <e> <s> so i would hope that we could leave it as it stands <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just again raise something which i raised on second reading and which the noble earl lord avon has kindly confirmed for me <e> <s> i raised the question about the keeping of records which is mentioned in clause where the inspectors may having inspected a zoo give advice on the keeping of records <e> <s> i wanted to be sure that zoos would be obliged to keep records because the inspectors can call for them and ask for them but it is not entirely clear from the bill as drafted that all zoos will be obliged to keep such records <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton said at col of the second reading debate that he could assure me that the secretary of state would ensure that these are in fact incorporated that is the question of records will be incorporated and the noble earl lord avon has since written to me confirming that that is also the governments understanding of the position <e> <s> i simply want to put that assurance on the record and i am sure it will be very widely welcomed <e>", "<cs> i also want to raise one point with the noble earl about clause <e> <s> i expressed some concern on second reading about the dispensation which was provided for under clause <e> <s> the noble earl wrote to me about this and i should like to quote from his letter and then ask him one question about what he said <e> <s> the noble earl wrote to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anything i want to add to what the noble lord lord craigton and my noble friend lord houghton have said <e> <s> i echo the thanks the noble lord lord craigton expressed to the numerous people who have been involved with this and not least i am sure the whole house will agree our thanks go to him for the work that he has done over the years in getting this legislation to a point where it was acceptable to the various interests <e> <s> i certainly echo what my noble friend said not only about the procedures for private members legislation but also about seeing this bill as being one which breaks the ice as a first step in bringing some legislation to bear on the problem of the ill-treatment of animals in some badly run zoos which are a disgrace to those who run them those who visit them and <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the considerable evidence in recent weeks of the breakdown in relationships between the police and the local populations in some areas being caused by the use which the police make of their existing powers to stop and search people in the street will the government reconsider the recommendations which the royal commission makes about this sphere of police powers in the light of anything which the noble and learned lord lord scarman has to say resulting from his current investigations <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it is an extraordinary situation where an internal drainage board which is responsible to and indeed part of the remit of a regional water authority can only be taken to court as the noble earl has told us under the prevention of pollution acts by the regional water authority <e> <s> would the noble earl look at that <e> <s> it seems to be monstrous <e> <s> would he agree that it is symptomatic of the total lack of control that is exercised by anybody over the extremely damaging activities of some internal drainage boards <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that it is not very much use putting an obligation on internal drainage boards to consult the nature conservancy council if the boards know that they can only be prosecuted by in effect people who are their masters and who are extremely unlikely to prosecute them <e> <s> can the noble earl also say whether it is possible to challenge the anglian water authoritys decision that this pollution was not pollution when clearly to everyone else concerned it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this amendment has removed the ban on sunday wildfowling which was added to the bill by a vote in your lordships house of no less than to <e> <s> it is for that reason that i thought it right that your lordships should have another opportunity to consider the matter <e> <s> i believe as your lordships house clearly did when the amendment was carried here that the situation would be much simpler fairer and more conducive to obtaining accurate counts of wildfowl if sunday wildfowling were prohibited <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that noble lords opposite who have spoken against the amendment are really scraping the barrel a little if they are forced to suggest that birdwatchers even those who behave in ways which the majority of birdwatchers would deplore are doing as much damage as the people who are actually shooting and killing birds <e> <s> that really is not the case <e> <s> the noble earl lord avon suggested that we should leave this to local democracy and that the existing practice was well understood <e> <s> with the greatest respect that is not the case at all because the existing practice is based on old administrative boundaries in a whole lot of places which so far as local government is concerned do not exist any more and how people are expected to remember that they can shoot in one part of an old administrative area which is no longer in force but cannot do so in another i have no idea <e> <s> that local democracy is still working in places like the west riding of yorkshire or wherever when all the boundaries have been changed since the ban on sunday shooting was imposed is a surprise to me but if so the government have invented yet another tier of local government at a stroke <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> and proposes amendment no <e> <s> a in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in what the noble and learned lord lord mackay has said <e> <s> perhaps i could answer the question which the noble lord lord somers put to me <e> <s> the phrase at the material time is taken from another act of parliament which those who are drafting amendments without the benefit of legal advice often find useful in the hope that thereby the drafting will not be open to criticism <e> <s> that is why the phrase at the material time was used rather than the phrase at the time because it appears in an animals act of some date which i cannot exactly remember <e> <s> of course as the noble and learned lord said the material time is the time when the shooting actually takes place <e> <s> it is at that stage when the shooting has to be necessary to prevent damage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in doing so may i speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and on which i also have motions down to disagree <e> <s> this is the last of the amendments in part i of the bill which i particularly want to ask your lordships to have another look at <e> <s> i do so for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> but my lords there is no intention on any side of your lordships house to rule air weapons out of order <e> <s> the effect of the amendments that were proposed by the national farmers union and which the commons have taken out of the bill was simply to make clear exactly what could and what could not be shot with an air weapon <e> <s> if your lordships reinstate the amendments it will still be legal to shoot any pest species with an air weapon <e> <s> that is not at all interfered with <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord on the government front bench that enforcement is a problem and the amendments would make it perfectly clear to the police when they can and when they cannot take action because it would be legal to use an air weapon against a living thing only if it is a pest shown on one of the pest schedules to the bill otherwise it would be illegal <e> <s> that is why the amendments would improve the enforcement of the existing law <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how very welcome this is to noble lords on all sides of the house i am sure <e> <s> the noble lord lord craigton who moved the original amendment and is not able to be with us today would also like to congratulate the government on the excellent steps which they have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords ability to bust open his argument absolutely astonishes me <e> <s> the whole argument of those who were defending the use of snares was that no reasonable person would dream of setting a snare and not visiting it daily <e> <s> the noble lord has just said that lo and behold that is not practicable <e> <s> i imagine that the areas he is thinking of are the remoter areas of scotland <e> <s> he did not say but he is now nodding <e> <s> he is obviously unaware that it is totally illegal to set a snare and not visit it daily in scotland where this has been a legal requirement for a great many years <e> <s> the fact that the noble lord has not been hauled into court i suppose supports his argument that the law is difficult to enforce but i hope that now he knows what the law is he will buck up and obey it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies may i put to him a couple of propositions <e> <s> i understand that there is no safeguard whatsoever in the legislation that a proposed site of special scientific interest will not be destroyed during those three months <e> <s> at this stage it is going to be very difficult if not impossible to amend the legislation to try to make sure that that does not happen <e> <s> it is a real problem <e> <s> there are a number of sites known to conservationists which were destroyed once it was proposed that they should be made sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> and this is under the existing provisions where site of special scientific interest status is of no very great significance in terms of protecting the site <e> <s> under the provisions of the bill it will he of a little more significance <e> <s> there are other areas where it is known that the nature conservancy council were not prepared to put forward the area as a site of special scientific interest because they knew that if they did the farmer or landowner would destroy it immediately <e> <s> i do not pretend that this is likely to happen very often but obviously this is a problem which exists and which will become worse once the site of special scientific interest designation carries with it the requirement of notification by the owner or occupier before he does something that would damage it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but my point was a slightly different one on the earlier amendment <e> <s> that is when the nature conservancy council notify a farmer that they intend to make a site of special scientific interest and before it becomes a site of special scientific interest there is a three-month period during which the owner or occupier can object to the nature conservancy council about this proposed notification but there is nothing in the bill to stop the owner or occupier from destroying the site during those three months <e> <s> i hope that the code of practice will make it clear that this appeal procedure has not been provided so that everybody can destroy the site while they are appealing <e> <s> it is a straightforward point but it refers to an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has not covered clause and the use of that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make just one comment which is to welcome what the noble earl said when introducing the amendment <e> <s> i was very interested to hear him say that he did not think compensation would be payable under these provisions because it was already covered <e> <s> i imagine that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i need to to deal with noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene again in the noble lords speech <e> <s> i am sure that he does not wish to mislead the house but i am not sure that he is talking about the same amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> the amendment that we are discussing has nothing to do with the level of compensation the amendment that we are discussing affects whether compensation is paid when a grant is denied and as i understand it that is all <e>", "<cs> my lords no that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said as if it was a surprising fact that the compensation would be net of grant <e> <s> is he really suggesting that it might be possible that a farmer when he is refused grant aid should receive compensation which included the grant aid <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief as i sense the house would like to come to a decision on this matter and the noble earl has still to respond on behalf of the government <e> <s> may i say to the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl just one question and make one suggestion which i hope his officials and those responsible for drawing up the code will take on board <e> <s> the question is to ask for an assurance that apart from the nature conservancy council being consulted the code will also be officially published in draft form before it is presented to parliament <e> <s> one of the problems that parliament will always have with the code is that we will not be able to amend it that we will be given it on a take it or leave it basis <e> <s> i hope there will be some consultation <e> <s> i know there is a great deal of consultation going on at the moment and that is very welcome but it would be very nice to have a fairly final draft available for discussion generally before it comes to parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords as we are coming to the end of the limestone pavement amendments may i just say what i know my noble friend lady david would wish to say namely to thank the government very much for the significant improvements in the bill albeit affecting a very small area of the country <e> <s> i am sure that the major loophole in the protection of limestone pavements which was there when the bill left this house has now to a large extent at least been closed and we are grateful to the government for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying very hard to follow the noble lord through all these as bs and cs <e> <s> am i right in thinking that amendments nos <e> <s> a and b are the same amendment put in different ways and that the noble lord will be moving one of them but not the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for putting me right as to which of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down because i did not make a speech before he got up may i ask him to confirm that the explanatory and financial memorandum in the copy of the bill we are now working from is in fact incorrect <e> <s> on page v it says that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word in support of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> there is another argument in its favour which has not been mentioned and that is that the wording that the noble lord lord hunt my noble friend lady white and the noble lord lord winstanley prefer would allow the authority to take into account nature conservation interests <e> <s> after all there are areas of moor and heath which may not look very nice but may be extremely important from a nature conservation point of view and it seems to me that the wording used in another place totally excludes that whereas the wording used in amendment no <e> <s> a by using the term are of significance by reason of their character makes it quite clear that it would be possible to include an area which happens to be extremely important for nesting birds or a very rare protected flower and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is leaving amendment no <e> <s> a can he say something about the nature conservation interest <e> <s> do the government accept that their wording would allow the national park authority to include in the maps areas which were particularly significant from a nature conservation point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to point out that the noble lord lord winstanley said that in another place the minister said that it would be unthinkable if the countryside commission were not consulted by national park authorities when these maps were being prepared <e> <s> the noble earl seemed to be more or less directly contradicting that statement <e> <s> i wondered whether he had any further thoughts about how the two points of view might be reconciled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down would it be of assistance to him if we adjourned the debate at this stage <e> <s> it is getting very late <e> <s> we are not making very rapid progress and it does not seem to me that the spirit of co-operation which we might have had on a simple set of very modest and reasonable amendments is forthcoming <e> <s> it might be better to leave this until monday evening when we are all feeling a little fresher and we could come back and perhaps have a clearer indication about what was going to be done about amendment no <e> <s> d before we have to reach a decision on amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i did actually intervene before the noble earl sat down quite deliberately in order to give him the opportunity to continue with his speech <e>", "<cs> for clarification my lords perhaps i might say that i had intended to say something on amendment no <e> <s> c and i would have wished to move it on my noble friends behalf if she had not intended to do so but i hesitated because i thought the noble lord lord denham was about to intervene before that amendment was called <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it remains to be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord winstanley has said we debated this question when discussing earlier amendments <e> <s> like him i am sure the national park authorities will prepare these figures annually <e> <s> i would have thought it would be a dereliction of their general duty if they did not <e> <s> therefore i see absolutely no harm in their having a duty under this bill to prepare an annual report which will be available to the public <e> <s> when we left this point last week the government seemed to be of the view that none of these amendments were necessary <e> <s> i would hope that the noble earl if not able to be filled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the two noble lords opposite and this amendment <e> <s> i must say that i think we are getting into some fairly difficult waters if that is not the wrong way of putting it when talking about these particular authorities <e> <s> the government appear to be saying two things at once <e> <s> first they are saying that the primary duties of water authorities and idbs are unchanged and all that is being suggested in this clause is that these authorities can do certain things as long as they do not conflict with those duties <e> <s> this is what they are really saying to the nfu to keep them happy <e> <s> at the same time the government are saying to conservationists well lads this gives you everything you want and every idb in the country will be bursting to spend money on conservation projects as long as they are within the overall remit of the act of parliament under which they are working <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that in most idbs the rates are mainly paid by farmers <e> <s> could he quantify the most and mainly because to give us that statement the ministry must presumably have worked out the figures in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not raise a question on this when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> will they be published in draft my lords so that interests other than government agencies may look at them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the real evil in this clause was decided by the house last week by a very narrow majority and it would be foolish to re-open that debate <e> <s> but given that the house and parliament on the governments advice have decided on a really disastrously expensive method of protecting important areas for wildlife it would be reasonable to ask the noble earl to give us some assurance in a rather more forthcoming way than he did last week to the effect that some additional money at least will be made available to pay for all of this <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it from what the noble earl has said that the government intend to use the provisions now in the bill to implement the undertaking given at committee stage in another place that those who have put in a claim for a new right of way and whose claim is abandoned will be informed <e> <s> i think the noble earl said that and he is nodding to confirm it so that it is on the record <e> <s> far be it from me to wish to place any additional financial burdens on the department of environment than those that the government have already placed on it so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth disagree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> and i propose amendment no <e> <s> a in lieu thereof <e> <s> the noble earl suggested that two weeks was a reasonable compromise between three weeks and one day <e> <s> i am not sure if that is typical of the governments mathematics in general but i do not think that it is a reasonable compromise <e> <s> we had several long debates in this house about the restoration of footpaths after ploughing <e> <s> at that stage i was worried about two aspects of the siuation <e> <s> the first was the length of time it was then three weeks and is now two weeks which is given to the occupier to restore bridlepaths and footpaths after they had been destroyed by ploughing and secondly the exemption which allowed the occupier in effect if there was exceptional weather to make the restoration as soon as practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong the debate but i wonder if the noble lord is leaving what the spicer committee recommend whether he can remind the house of what they had to say about the exceptional weather conditions let-out and what the local authority representatives on the spicer committee had to say about enforcement of all this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to press this amendment but i think it is worth making two comments <e> <s> first of all it might have been a little more responsible of the government to check with local authority associations what their attitude was to the change that was made and the further changes which were being proposed <e> <s> they are the bodies which are going to have to enforce this law <e> <s> it is regrettable that the government did not check <e> <s> secondly i would say to the noble lord opposite who suggested that this bill was the result of a careful balancing act by the government between competing interests that it is strange that all the interests on one side see the balance as having swung against them in every single case where there has been any conflict <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very helpful <e> <s> i do think there is a basic misconception which the government may have picked up from frequent contact with other interests and that is that the footpaths are still only used by local people <e> <s> the whole argument in favour of retaining a network of public footpaths is that while it is accepted they are no longer used for people living in a village to get to church or to a neighbouring village the argument the footpath users would advance is that they now form a major part of the recreational assets of this country as a whole and a lot of our debates earlier in the bill were concerned with people visiting areas where they do not live or walking along long-distance footpaths walking in areas they have not been to before and so on and the problems and difficulties and rights that apply to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i supported the noble lord lord stanley and others when they moved a similar amendment in your lordships house and i am delighted that another place accepted it <e> <s> i see it as a very useful precedent to be applied to those who put up buildings whether farm buildings housing or whatever in areas such as national parks <e> <s> hopefully we shall soon have a legislative provision that they should also construct things in a particular stone that is a feature of the countryside <e> <s> i shall not press the noble earl to give a definitive reply on that as yet but will allow the noble lord lord stanley to think about it for a while <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would bring the new clause introduced by amendment no <e> <s> into operation one month after the passing of the act rather than leave it to be brought in by the secretary of state through regulations <e> <s> i hope that this amendment will ensure that things are implemented rather more speedily than would be the case if the bill were left as it is and that again in the interests of getting everything moving quickly the noble earl will be able to accept it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he said at the earliest opportunity <e> <s> this is one of those code words which government use when they do not want to tell you anything <e> <s> can the noble earl go any further than that and give us an indication of whether it is likely to be months or weeks or years <e> <s> could he be a little bit more definitive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that helpful assurance <e> <s> i accept that those of us who have been living with this bill may not think it would take a month to read and understand it but that others coming to it afresh may find it rather more complicated and that local authorities will need a little time to digest and implement the new powers which they have <e> <s> in the light of the noble earls assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed these amendments previously as the noble lord lord chelwood has said we passed them by a very large majority made up of peers from all sides of the house and from the cross-benches <e> <s> we on these benches again support the deletion of the curlew and redshank from the shooting list <e>", "<cs> my lords it might be said that sir hector monro got his deserts at the hands of his leader for sticking up for scotland or anywhere else <e> <s> i waited until the noble earl had replied to my noble friend because i was hoping to hear an explanation of why the government had decided in another place to amend the ground game act when we had been told <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lords down could he tell us on what basis this was agreed by the ramblers association when it was introduced in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i support very strongly the basic objective of the amendment that has been introduced and i would not want to put something in it that was going to make it difficult or even impossible to enforce so i have no intention of pressing the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house would be

my various noble friends at different stages of the bill <e> <s> i have the feeling that had it been up to the noble earl we should have had a much better bill than we actually have but the fact that it is a better bill than it was when it was introduced is certainly in no small part due to his efforts <e> <s> we are very grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has said we are discussing the activities of internal drainage boards following very shortly upon the passing of the wildlife and countryside act and the imposition of new duties on dbs <e> <s> like him i very much hope that the noble earl lord ferrers will be able to say something about that when he comes to reply <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl could take steps to remind internal drainage boards of that section because my experience and that of the norfolk naturalist trust is that that does not happen <e> <s> the first one knows that works are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is leaving that point may i ask him whether the ministry have figures to show what sort of representation there is from non-farming interests on the per cent <e> <s> of idbs where farmers pay less than half the rate <e> <s> that is really the point i think a number of us were trying to get at <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may just ask my noble friend something <e> <s> he quoted that as being the view of the waste management advisory council <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it was a report of a working group of the council and was not actually considered by the council itself <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend would not want to mislead the house by suggesting that it had been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend again <e> <s> however he said that it has been found that it is more effective to contain litter and he quoted a reduction of around per cent <e> <s> in washington compared with the over per cent <e> <s> figure mentioned by the noble earl <e> <s> is he suggesting that a per cent <e> <s> reduction is better than an per cent <e> <s> reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has just repeated if i heard him correctly that the proponents of the bill suggest a loss of jobs <e> <s> that simply is not the case <e> <s> the proponents of the bill and i am one of them suggest that the bill will lead to an increase in the total number of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is leaving the question of security and so on may i ask whether he would with his great experience explain to the house how all these problems were coped with when virtually all beverages were sold in bottles with deposits on them which was the case in this country until quite recently <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord beaumont in the introduction of this bill and to take issue if i may with some of the things that some of my noble friends who have not supported the bill have said in the course of the debate <e> <s> some time ago i was involved as a junior minister in the last government with the waste management advisory committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord irving has said that it is quite wrong to cast doubt on the <e>", "<cs> my lords let us look to see how the experience of the states which had bottle bills was transmitted <e> <s> my noble friend lord sainsbury mentioned the film that was shown to your lordships sub-committee <e> <s> but he did not mention one of the things which no doubt influenced the referendum in california which is one of the states where they did not want the bill <e> <s> this film was produced by the californian brewers association and it gave i am told a one-sided and inaccurate view of what had happened in michigan <e> <s> i hope that noble lords when they go into the debate will go into it with a little more scepticism of the sort of information which was given by the industry interests involved <e>", "<cs> no my lords but i would respond by asking whether it is believed that large numbers of measures that all my noble friends supported under the last labour government would have been passed if we had listened to the argument which said that large numbers of american states did not agree with those measures and therefore we should not legislate <e> <s> if that had been so we should not have passed a single act of parliament in the last labour government or in any labour government since the last war <e> <s> oregon may not be very typical of this country but michigan i suggest is <e> <s> in michigan in contradiction of what my noble friend lord strabolgi has said the <e>", "<cs> my lords the federal report that my noble friend refers to may have come out against it <e> <s> the consumers in the states where they have the bills have come out in favour by an overwhelming majority per cent <e> <s> in one of the states i mentioned <e> <s> that is something which members of my party should place some reliance upon <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i was delighted to hear the noble lord say that <e> <s> the noble lord did however say that the voluntary scheme on the control of persistent organo-chlorines was an example of how industry could successfully and voluntarily control something which was extremely harmful to the environment <e> <s> i recently asked a question for written answer in your lordships house about the level of continued use of persistent organo-chlorines in this country <e> <s> i was very disturbed to see first of all that the government had totally inadequate figures to monitor the use of this and secondly what figures they had showed a continuing very high level of use of persistent organo-chlorines in this country <e> <s> there is considerable evidence to show that the voluntary approach there has been an abject failure <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord lord craigton that the voluntary approach in this field will similarly fail <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point may i ask him to explain why the working groups report was not considered by the council in the considerable period for which it was available and before the council was actually wound up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i concede that government ministers may be happy to ignore the legal advice they have been given when it suits their case to avoid a public inquiry are they not bound by the same laws as everyone else <e> <s> can the noble earl confirm that the legal advice that the department of transport has been given makes it clear that a public inquiry into a proposal of this sort cannot be dispensed with when among other matters a matter of public importance is involved <e> <s> would he confirm that a letter from that department has confirmed that in this case a matter of public importance is involved <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble earl did not answer my supplementary question <e> <s> i was not asking him to tell the house what advice was given <e> <s> may i ask whether he will confirm that the legal advice that the department received and which is published for all to see in the <e>", "<cs> yes legal <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that the paragraph i was quoting from the <e>", "<cs> rose to ask her majestys government whether they will now reconsider their decision not to hold a public inquiry into the proposed diversion of the a at whitway <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble earl too much but just so that nobody thinks we are talking at cross-purposes may i say that the two alternatives which he has just mentioned were the departments alternatives not the alternative of the objectors which as i said earlier was presented to the department somewhat later <e> <s> i think it would be helpful if the noble earl could confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl mentioned the public exhibition and did so in the context of the petition which supported the departments preferred route <e> <s> i hope he will not want to mislead the house <e> <s> could he confirm that at none of these public exhibitions and nowhere in their discussions with the parish councils and others involved did the department publish their own alternatives which as the noble earl said they considered and dismissed nor did they allow <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord avon persists in saying that there is only one point at issue whereas he himself said at the beginning of his speech that in the light of what i said he acknowledged there was more than one point at issue <e> <s> does this not mean that it would be worthwhile for the department to have another look at this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henley has given your lordships an admirable introduction to this bill and i should like to say at the outset that i entirely support a second reading being given to the bill and for it to go to a select committee <e> <s> i entirely agree with him that it is the committees job and not one for your lordships this afternoon to look into the merits and the arguments on one side or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord and i do not want to prolong the proceedings but he has now said twice that i have an amendment down <e> <s> in fact it is an instruction <e> <s> my noble friend has also said twice that the effect of the instruction would he to continue a generally and totally unrestricted right of access by hacks to the downs <e> <s> neither of those statements is correct <e> <s> my instruction asks the committee to make sure that they are satisfied that it is in the public interest that the rights available under the act should be removed <e> <s> it does no more than that <e> <s> the instruction does not tell the committee what decision to reach it simply asks them to make sure that it is in the public interest that the rights given under the act should be removed by this bill no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that there are a number of sites of special scientific interest which have been damaged or destroyed since the passing of the act and that at this very moment one of the most important of the proposed sites on west sedgemoor has drainage equipment on it in clear breach of the voluntary agreement by the local farmers and landowners that they would do no such thing <e> <s> would the government expedite the introduction of those sections of the act which would allow the nature conservancy council to do something about this quite deplorable state of affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords when will the government introduce the sections of the act which will allow the ncc to delay these destructive operations for months <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from almost everyone who has spoken in this debate that one of your lordships major concerns if not the major concern is the unacceptably high number of people in prison <e> <s> rather as my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones did i would like to go back to the stage before that <e> <s> he said that the police and the courts intervened when it was already rather too late and that he thought that the public had rather too high expectations of the penal system <e> <s> i would certainly agree with that <e> <s> my noble friend also remarked on the extent to which the number of crimes has increased <e> <s> i suppose it reflects the general disillusionment with discussions on the causes of crime that we have had very little discussion during the debate about why the number of crimes has increased <e> <s> i would like to turn to that very briefly <e> <s> the government were in part at least elected on a platform of law and order as being the party particularly well-equipped to deal with these problems and i would suggest to your lordships that they have shown themselves particularly inept in dealing with these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords when referring to civil servants in northern ireland it is necessary to distinguish between local civil servants based in belfast and those from this country who go over for a short period of office and then return sometimes with their attitudes enlightened and sometimes regretfully not so enlightened <e> <s> the officials to whom i am referring are northern ireland civil servants who have remained in northern ireland and who are continuing to do excellent work in implementing the black report under this government a report which was prepared under the previous government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness to confirm regarding this particular select committees report that not one member of the select committee including the noble lord who asked questions yesterday and today voted against a paragraph or even a single word contained in the select committees final report <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the leader of the house to confirm i am anxious that this should be on the record that there was a division only on a new clause meaning that there was no division and no dissent expressed about any of the contents of the report itself <e>", "<cs> i should like to make a point to the noble lord before he replies to that question <e> <s> the two detention centres that have been referred to are not simply part of the generality of criminal statistics they were set up as experimental programmes <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord it is not good enough to come to the chamber and say well the criminal statistics are collected two years later and i wont be able to tell you anything until then <e> <s> in the normal course of events if governments really want to know what is happening and i suggest to the noble lord that there must be some doubt about that the experimental programmes are monitored as they go along <e> <s> each individual young person who has been through the short sharp shock will be followed very carefully to see what happens to him <e> <s> it ought to have been possible for the noble lord to give us <e>", "<cs> this seems to me to be a fundamentally important amendment and it is worth just reminding your lordships of the background against which we are discussing it <e> <s> as has already been said over the last few years whether there has been a significant increase in juvenile offending or not the proportion of young offenders being sent to institutions has increased substantially <e> <s> the percentage of young people coming before the courts and being sent to institutions has increased at the same time as our knowledge about the ill effects of being sent to institutions has grown as my noble friend lady birk said with the enormously high proportion that are reconvicted within two years <e> <s> in effect what a sentence to an institution of that sort means for a young person is that his chances of not being reconvicted within the next two years are almost negligible <e>", "<cs> no that was not my point <e> <s> so that i do not forget it and in order to allow the noble lord to get more advice what i want to know is this if the court of appeal lays down guidelines will the reasons given by the magistrates court for imposing a custodial sentence have in writing to take into account those guidelines <e> <s> in other words will the reason which is given in writing have to say which of the various reasons from the court of appeals guidelines they have taken into account <e> <s> i understand that if we put these words into the statute this will quite clearly be an obligation placed on the court <e>", "<cs> to respond to some remarks of the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord monson in criticising the amendment their remarks seemed to imply that there was some deterrent effect of imprisonment that imprisonment for a short time because part of the sentence was suspended would reduce the likelihood of somebody re-offending <e> <s> it is worth reminding both noble lords that there is no evidence for that proposition <e> <s> imprisonment is not a deterrent to future re-offending <e> <s> in fact the opposite is the case <e> <s> all evidence shows that people who are sent to prison are much more likely to re-offend than people who are not and that is one of the major arguments against the partially suspended sentence <e> <s> as my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones rightly said it is likely to increase the use of imprisonment made by the courts and because more people are sent to prison more are likely to be reconvicted after their release and end up in prison yet again and therefore it has a doubly negative effect on the appalling problems we face in the prisons <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is aware of the number of employers who are likely to keep jobs open for somebody sent to prison for four weeks particularly given current problems of unemployment caused by the present government he is a luckier man than most people who end up in prison <e>", "<cs> i am anxious to reach tonight amendment no <e> <s> a which i think is important <e> <s> it is in my name <e> <s> if the government accept amendments nos <e> <s> and i am sure that we would get there <e>", "<cs> i first want to support what was said by the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge about the practice in northern ireland <e> <s> i was a minister there for two and a half years after him and i never heard any serious complaints in the local press or elsewhere about the introduction of per cent <e> <s> remission in northern ireland nor about its operation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that those who have had experience in northern ireland spoke with different voices <e> <s> i do not think that is entirely fair <e> <s> those ex-ministers from northern ireland who have spoken have spoken with one voice <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the motion has not been put <e>", "<cs> it was not my suggestion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris moved the motion <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i would say that i should have thought that if the home office showed more sense of urgency than the noble lord seemed to display it would be possible to come to the house at the report stage let alone at third reading with a great deal more information than the noble lord gave us today <e> <s> the home office has many resources <e> <s> they must have been thinking about this in detail for some time <e> <s> i suspect that they have a great deal of this information already and if the noble lord were so minded as to instruct his officials to have an urgent meeting with the police and the probation service then the government if they set their mind to it would be able to come back at the next stage with a definitive answer <e> <s> to suggest that that is not possible is to exaggerate the difficulty <e>", "<cs> that certainly is a useful assurance but it seems to me that there are two approaches which can be adopted to this problem <e> <s> the first is that of successive governments and which the home office has adopted over the years which is to try to keep what is going on in prisons as secret as possible and not for example to publish the rules by which prison medical officers work to which the noble lord lord avebury drew attention in previous debates and he has done so again tonight <e> <s> that is to keep the lid on things to keep the public in the dark and to wait until as inevitably must happen there are riots deaths and fires and senior prison governors are driven to write letters to the newspapers as the governor of brixton prison did recently which was quoted in an earlier debate <e> <s> there is an alternative approach <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for pointing out the inadvertent slip i made in referring to the wrong prison governor who wrote to the press <e> <s> it seems to me that there must be still a great deal of dissatisfaction about these issues <e> <s> as was said in an earlier debate on this part of the bill on every amend <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord stanley whether he plans to have a separate discussion on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> because if he does and he is nodding i will restrict myself now to saying that i very strongly agree with the proposal that the fine should be rather than <e> <s> given the general agreement among those who have spoken on this point i hope that the government will be able to take that on board in moving amendments at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will have another look at this and will not close their minds to the possibility of increasing the fine to because it seems to me that what the noble lord has just said may be a little out of date if i may say so with respect <e> <s> to give one example in the wildlife <e>", "<cs> if i may say a word about amendment no <e> <s> i would like to support strongly the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> i should declare an interest and perhaps i should have done this sooner because i myself am a farmer who also burns some straw although not quite the same quantity as the noble lord opposite because we try to bale and chop as much straw as possible <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will not mind giving way for a moment driving is in exactly the same category but that does not prevent the law prohibiting people from driving for periods if they repeatedly break the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> are the government aware that would-be falconers in particular appear to be stocking up in advance of part of the act being brought into force that nests of peregrine falcons have been robbed either of eggs or young this spring which affects per cent <e> <s> of the british population and that it is particularly falconers who will be affected by the new procedures brought into force by part of the act <e> <s> when will these procedures be brought into force and when will the government lay the commencement order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask whether the government have considered as far as <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will not <e> <s> i really do not think the noble and learned lord is right to suggest that an increase from to is significant when all of us who are involved in farming along with other noble lords i am a farmer who also burns straw know perfectly well that there is a very real possibility that straw burning will be banned altogether <e> <s> against that background an increase from to is not adequate at all and that view has quite clearly been expressed from all sides of the house both tonight and during the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just as connected as the amendments which aim to reduce the number <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell me what is innovative about this <e> <s> the procedure of cautioning offenders is extremely widely used by police forces throughout great britain <e> <s> the idea that there is anything new in this is if i may say so quite ridiculous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for my noble and learned friends intervention <e> <s> i think it would be very helpful indeed for him to discuss it with the noble lord <e> <s> also it might be possible for me to see the criteria <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact of the matter is that cannabis is now widely regarded as being much less dangerous than it was when these penalties were <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing it my name on the order paper <e> <s> first in moving this motion may i stress that i broadly welcome the aims of the western isles integrated development programme and i have tabled this motion today to give us an opportunity in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not acknowledge that for a moment because the organisation which has been in the forefront of raising this issue and which has raised it with the minister and his officials is the royal society for the protection of birds <e> <s> they first drew this to public attention and they responded to requests for information from a number of politicians <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read this article as well and equally am fond of the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the second time that the actual leaflet describing the idp for the people concerned has been quoted <e> <s> it does seem a shame that the noble lord did not read from the whole of the pamphlet he jumped from the pamphlet to another piece of paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply wanted to put the record straight <e> <s> i would not have dreamt of criticising a civil servant in your lordships house for being rude or anything else <e> <s> i was in fact criticising the minister on the front bench opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank everybody who has taken part in what i think is generally agreed to have been an extremely valuable debate and i think that one or two of the things that the minister has just said will have themselves made the debate worthwhile <e> <s> some were positive and some were possibly negative but nevertheless he did go further than the government have gone before particularly in giving an assurance that crofters and people refused grant under the idp as a result of conservation objections would be eligible for management agreements in the same way as people refused normal capital grant aid <e> <s> i think that will be widely welcomed not only by conservationists but i have no doubt to an even greater extent by the crofters who are likely to be affected and if that is the only thing to have come out of this debate in your lordships house it will have made it worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house is grateful to the noble earl lord avon for his explanation of the code and its provision somewhat shorter and clearer than the code itself i think it is fair to say and i wish to raise a number of points with him in particular the question of resources which he mentioned in some detail <e> <s> at the outset i would like to comment briefly on the wildlife and countryside act itself <e> <s> your lordships will not need reminding any more than the minister will that it was a controversial measure it was controversial when we debated it in this house at great length and it is continuing to be so now that it is passed into law <e> <s> i have been concerned as i am sure some other noble lords have about attempts as i see them to some extent to rewrite the history of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does that mean that the government will support the ncc if it refuses permission to the owner to clear the acres at the south of the wood which apparently the owner has said he intends to clear in direct contradiction of what the ministers involved said after they had visited the site and made their decision <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that his honourable friend at the department of the environment said that he understood that the acres would not be cleared and this has now been contradicted by the owner <e>", "<cs> my lords first can the noble earl confirm that the proposal in this case is not to cut down trees and replant them but to clear the woodland which is a small remnant part of an ancient forest and convert it to agricultural use which would totally destroy it <e> <s> secondly can the noble earl confirm that the acres that is referred to in my question and to which the noble lord behind him has just referred would not require a consent from the forestry commission before it was cleared <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case can the noble earl explain why the words contained in the question on the order paper were deleted from the scrutineers terms of reference at the last minute by the government without consultation with the ncc and without its agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl answered the first part of my supplementary question but not the <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble earl is aware that the government are currently in breach of the berne convention which they recently ratified because the ncc do not have sufficient staff resources at regional level with which to carry out the new international obligations that that international convention placed upon this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i very strongly agree with everything that the noble baroness opposite has just said <e> <s> at this late stage in the debate there is very little left to add <e> <s> it seems to me that the debate has developed into an argument between those who are fundamentally opposed to abortion those who support this bill and a rather broader church indeed a rather broader church than has been apparent from the bishops bench those who support the act and the way it has been interpreted by the medical profession along with those among whom i certainly number myself who would like to go a great deal further than the existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would allow me to intervene briefly if he wishes to maintain the moderate spirit of the debate which he has so praised would it not be more moderate to refer to that statistic as being that particular number of foetuses lost because a number of us do not accept that when an abortion is carried out a baby is aborted <e> <s> it is the foetus which is aborted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has said that this is a significant period for agriculture <e> <s> i believe he was quite right in saying that <e> <s> a considerable debate is going on <e> <s> both in this country and internationally about the current agricultural system <e> <s> i thought it was a pity that the noble earl lord ferrers who spoke for the government managed to avoid mentioning two of the most significant things one in the national and the other in the international field <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to join in a long discussion with the noble lord lord middleton about the way in which it could be financed <e> <s> it is a useful and significant first step in the process of nationalisation of land simply because as the noble lord knows tenanted land would not need to be compensated for at the same level as land owned by owner-occupiers <e> <s> it would help us on the way to nationalising all agricultural land as the labour party is committed to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not up on my local east anglian theology the the extent that the noble lord lord walston is and i am quite happy myself to describe the noble earl as the arthur scargill of the agricultural industry joined as he was in my view by the noble lord lord middleton and the noble lord lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> on the one hand there is something quite appropriate about people who speak not wearing country landowners association or national farmers union hats but with their interests at heart speaking in the way that a good trade union leader speaks on behalf of people working in a particular industry <e> <s> that is what arthur scargills job is that <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be a guess but i hope the noble lord will accept from me that it is a completely wrong guess and that if he goes to the western isles and looks at areas of the machair which have been drained recently and compares the number of corncrakes nesting there next spring with the number in areas which have not been improved in that way he will see how wrong he is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is being even more unfair than he was earlier <e> <s> i do not accept any of the arguments <e> <s> i do not accept the main thrust of the argument which mr <e> <s> body puts forward <e> <s> the labour party is committed to public expenditure going to agriculture and for that to continue <e> <s> it is mr <e> <s> body and other people in the conservative party who are not <e>", "<cs> my lords usually one of the pleasures of speaking from the opposition benches at a late stage in the debate is that somebody has said something in favour of the legislation with which one can quarrel but this must be a pretty unique bill from the governments point of view because i do not think that anyone has said a single word in favour of any of the provisions at all except the noble lord lord bellwin <e> <s> so all of us are having to have a go at some of the things he said but luckily he gave all of us plenty to aim at <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble lord any more but if he does not mind my saying so he has not answered the point <e> <s> why should not the secretary of state for wales still he obliged to appoint among all the people he appoints to the water authorities there two who represent the interests that he mentioned agriculture land drainage and so on <e> <s> there is absolutely nothing to stop that being put in the bill <e> <s> why did not the government do it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that it is very difficult for people to accept the assurance which he has just given in view of the fact that one of his political colleagues wrote to sir ralph verney just before the nature conservancy council took the decision about the somerset levels and said in part that those who use their power in such a way lose it and deserve to do so <e> <s> will the noble lord now say categorically something which the government have previously refused to do namely that they agree with the decision which the nature conservancy council took to notify the whole of the acres on west central as sites of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord skelmersdale just answer yes or no to whether the government agree with the decision to notify the whole acres as an sssi <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> this is the second time that the royal mint has been mentioned by those who support the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the debate i am sure the house is anxious to reach a decision on the motion standing in the name of my noble friend lord shackleton and therefore i shall not speak at length but shall restrict myself to commenting on a few points made in the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin made one point for the government indeed it was one of the few things he said <e> <s> as has already been remarked his speech was notable for how little it revealed of the governments views and real intentions and in that respect it mirrored exactly the white paper so i suppose we should not have been too surprised <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord then took it upon himself to tell people who use maps for recreational purposes such as walkers that they would feel i think he said that they would be getting maps cheaper and better suited to their needs <e> <s> i can only tell him that those who actually do the walking who use maps and who indeed treat them extremely seriously very often when walking in difficult conditions on high ground they need to treat them seriously because their lives may depend on the maps and on their accuracy unanimously feel that the governments proposals will have the opposite effect to that which the noble lord seems to expect <e> <s> it is a matter for your lordships to decide whether or not any weight should be given to the views of those who are actually involved in using maps and who have long experience of using them <e>", "<cs> my lords my reading of the serpell report was that it did not recommend the setting up of a trading fund and from my understanding of the views of the staff of the ordnance survey morale is extremely low <e> <s> as has already been pointed out in the debate the ordnance survey has been messed around and raked over a great deal in recent years and there is a feeling that the proposal by the government will do the ordnance survey much harm a view that is shared by virtually everyone whom the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord a direct question about the contents of the contract and whether or not the figure of per cent would be increased <e> <s> he did not answer that <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question about this matter <e> <s> it seems to me listening to what he said that the governments case was that the two representatives which the bill will allow are there simply to put a point of view <e> <s> one is there to put the agriculture/land drainage point of view the other is there to put the fisheries point of view although that is <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to the amendment i wonder whether i could ask the noble lord lord stanley a question <e> <s> first perhaps i could correct him about something <e> <s> there is absolutely nothing in this amendment which would affect the regional committees <e> <s> i made that perfectly clear <e> <s> it is a point that comes later in the bill and i have some <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> i mentioned the commitment given by the government in june in another place that they would use their best endeavours to ensure that water authorities have on them at least one member of experience of wildlife and conservation <e> <s> could the noble lord say whether that commitment is now being withdrawn by the government or not <e>", "<cs> a great deal of interest has been shown in this issue by noble lords from all parts of the committee <e> <s> the one substantive argument which the minister put forward against the amendment was the problem of numbers <e> <s> he said in effect that if we had a specialist recreationalist a specialist nature conservationist plus two maff people and the local authority people we should be filling the board up <e> <s> to some extent he seemed not entirely to accept the point made by the noble earl lord onslow that it is possible for people to wear more than one hat <e>", "<cs> as i have said there seems to be very widespread support for the amendment particularly if i may say so from the benches behind the noble lord <e> <s> he has been very straight with us <e> <s> he is prepared to look at it but he does not see any other way of meeting the point of the amendment <e> <s> this is really my view as well and i think that in that case he really ought to be voting with us for the amendment rather than as i am afraid he is going to do voting against it <e> <s> i hope the rest of your lordships who are not tied down by a brief will feel having listened to the arguments that this is a modest and moderate amendment to the bill <e> <s> it would reaffirm a clear undertaking which the government gave twice in another place very recently as the noble lord lord chelwood said <e> <s> i think that on that basis alone your lordships committee would be entitled to ask for the amendment to be put in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord and i apologise for having missed the first part of the debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord stanley referred to earlier debates that we had and having thought about what happened before dinner i just wonder whether the sensible thing from his point of view in the light of what he said about my amendment and from the governments point of view would not be to get rid of any particular people nominated to water authorities whether from agriculture or anywhere else and leave all this to the regional committees with which the noble lord lord stanley is apparently very satisfied so far as recreation is concerned <e> <s> i am finding it increasingly difficult to follow the rather convoluted way in which his arguments swing wildly from one amendment to the next and i wondered before he begs leave to withdraw his amendment whether he could explain this further <e> <s> i am trying hard to follow him and not succeeding <e>", "<cs> if your lordships house passed only legislation which was enforceable in the terms which the noble lord has just suggested there would be hardly any legislation on the statute book under any government <e> <s> this point has been made in numerous debates on numerous bills nevertheless your lordships house has seen fit to include exhortations in legislation <e> <s> the suggestion that it is only pieces of legislation which are enforceable through the courts which are worth passing is with the greatest respect a view which may be held by those who spend their lives working in the legal profession and the courts but it is not one which i believe is generally held <e> <s> there are many purposes for including things in legislation other than employing lawyers to take matters to the courts and i suggest that this is one of them <e>", "<cs> your lordships are very good at agreeing on general principles <e> <s> it is my experience both as a minister and in opposition dealing with legislation that when it comes to putting particular measures in bills the general principles tend to go out of the window and everybody wants to see in a bill exhortations and particular points <e> <s> all of us including myself have been party to that sort of process in the discussions on this bill <e> <s> i do not see anything wrong with it <e> <s> it is often useful to have exhortations and declarations of general intent in statute and that has been the case for a great many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords why could not the noble lord go on to say that in this case the government are satisfied that the nature conservancy council are properly fulfilling the duty which parliament has placed upon them <e> <s> so far the government appear to have been deliberately trying to avoid answering that question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it is this prevarication by the government which at least in part has led to the recent deplorable incidents on west sedgemoor when farmers were driven to burning an effigy of the recently retired president of the country landowners association <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will agree to pass on to the chairman of the nature conservancy council the hopes of us all that he does not go up in flames when he arrives in person on west sedgemoor <e> <s> but would the noble lord answer the first part of my supplementary question that if the government had been prepared to state clearly in the past and were prepared to state clearly now that the ncc were acting properly in designating acres as a site of special scientific interest in this area a lot of this trouble might have been avoided <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must press the noble lord <e> <s> he did not cover this point in his previous answer <e> <s> is he prepared to say whether or not the government feel that the ncc are acting properly in what they have done on west sedgemoor <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether my noble friend heard me but i have had that comment made to me and it is a good argument for saying that the amendment should cover grade iii agricultural land as well and i said that <e>", "<cs> i am listening very carefully to what the noble lord is saying it is very interesting and helpful <e> <s> he said that the question of the condition of a distribution system would be a matter which could be considered by future public inquiries <e> <s> would the noble lord also include in the list the other question that i specifically mentioned whether it would be as cost-effective or more cost-effective for an authority to take steps to reduce the demand for water for example for domestic use <e>", "<cs> was the noble lord answering the point <e> <s> i was talking about reduction of demand by consumers <e> <s> it would be helpful to have it on the record if he is saying that that will be something that a future public inquiry would consider <e>", "<cs> i think there is a real problem here <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale said some interesting things <e> <s> i would like to consider what he said and think about it before the next stage of the bill and in particular i look forward to having something in writing on the one question he was not able to answer <e> <s> the point is that however comprehensive the planning machinery was in the past and however <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord goes on would he deal with the suggestion i made that the cost-benefit appraisal would be just as useful if the information were aggregated <e> <s> in other words if particular copies of plans were not identified with particular land-holdings but just given as a total acreage summary of whatever it happened to be in the appraisal that would completely get over the problem that he has <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way and he has interpreted it correctly <e> <s> what i certainly feel and my view is clearly shared by the rest of your lordships is that it would be much better if this information were widely disseminated <e> <s> but the noble lord will appreciate that because of the usual way of drafting amendments in your lordships house i have tried to be modest and to make as small a change as i could envisage in the hope of getting as i am sure i will the noble lords wholehearted support <e>", "<cs> some calculations which i have seen suggest that farmers contribute less than per cent <e> <s> to the cost of land drainage schemes from their drainage rates <e> <s> all the other per cent <e> <s> comes from the public purse generally <e> <s> it seems to me therefore that in this case there could be some argument for elevating somebody or other above the ministry of agriculture before such decisions are taken but that is not what this amendment does <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord lord stanley it is going over the top a little to suggest that simply providing some body with some information which is available to the minister anyhow and on which the minister makes the final decision unencumbered by anybody else is to put them above the minister <e> <s> that is patently not the case <e> <s> the ncc can only give advice and make representations about something which at the moment they cannot even see <e>", "<cs> i too apologise to the noble lord for not dealing with this point when i spoke earlier <e> <s> it is a serious one although promised consultation documents arising from inter-departmental reviews which are not yet completed are fairly nebulous creatures at the best of times <e> <s> in a year when an election is due and the government are going to change they become even more nebulous than in ordinary circumstances <e> <s> nevertheless i take the noble lords point <e> <s> if he is putting it forward as a serious reason could he give us a little more information about why amendments to the bill on land drainage matters should not be made at this stage by the committee <e> <s> it would be helpful for example if the noble lord could say that the inter-departmental committee or review group are looking at the question of cost-benefit appraisals that they are aware of the concern and that they have looked at the three or four points which i mentioned when i introduced the amendment about the way in which cost-benefit appraisals can be modified to meet particular rates of return <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong unnecessarily this debate but subsequent amendments are to some extent affected by it and to deal with the matter now may speed up the process in the long run <e> <s> therefore i should be grateful if the noble lord could answer one other point which troubles me at least <e> <s> i do not know whether it troubles anyone else <e> <s> if an inter-departmental committee is to take a disinterested look at the issue of cost-benefit appraisals and whether they should be published why are the government fighting tooth and nail to defend the existing practice while the committee is sitting <e> <s> if they read the debate and what the noble lord has said on behalf of the government will that not prejudice the officials who are conducting the review <e> <s> the noble lord said first that it is ridiculous to give it to the ncc secondly that these documents are full of confidential information and cannot be released and thirdly that they are not important enough to justify release <e> <s> the noble lord speaking on behalf of the government has tried in every way to suggest that there is absolutely no case whatever for making them <e>", "<cs> i think that is a sensible course in the circumstances <e> <s> i still have one worry and it may be the noble lord can clear it up if i put it more precisely <e> <s> he said that the people conducting the review will read his words as well as mine <e> <s> he represents the government i do not <e> <s> they are likely to place a great deal more weight on his words indeed he has simply repeated what ministers in other places and in your lordships house have said on numerous occasions in the past <e> <s> it would be useful to have an assurance that although the government have defended the existing practice as is the governments wont nevertheless they will approach anything that comes from the review with a completely open mind and will be prepared to consider recommendations if the review makes them for cost-benefit appraisals to be made more widely available <e> <s> if the noble lord can say yes to that i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it would have no relevance if it was invariably the case that a minister of agriculture who received a request from the secretary of state to hold an inquiry simply did it there and then i agree but anyone who has been involved either directly in government or indirectly through reports in newspapers with rows between different government departments and ministers at various times knows perfectly well that life is not like that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord skelmersdale replies to my noble friend lady white may i just put another point to him <e> <s> it is a question which arises out of what he and the noble lord lord stanley of alderley said <e> <s> if it is simply enough to have <e>", "<cs> i really have not been having much luck with the noble lord today <e> <s> i do not claim that that entitles me to any special privileges <e> <s> but this is a simple amendment and it might even be one if the noble lord took it away and looked at it which could be achieved by the government giving an assurance or after consultation with the water authorities saying that when making appointments to regional land drainage committees those factors will be taken into account <e> <s> it could be met without the need of an amendment <e> <s> i really do think that it is a sensible point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that <e> <s> i think that it would be very helpful if he could do that and perhaps in particular look at the suggestion that if there is this veto i will not say from where which says no legislation on land drainage it is something where a few kind words and good intentions might go a long way towards solving the problem <e> <s> that might help the noble lord it will certainly help me and others who are concerned about this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but with respect that was exactly the case i was making <e> <s> i was saying okay it is quite reasonable to pay drainage rates which meet maintenance costs because maintenance will be needed however the land is managed and it is fair for conservation bodies to pay towards that <e> <s> it is the capital improvement expenditure which sticks in the gullet and the amendment is solely and deliberately aimed at that <e>", "<cs> no i do not and with great respect to the noble lord i think that the amendment deserved a little more care and attention in responding to it than it has been given <e> <s> first the noble lord implied that i drafted an amendment to attempt to achieve a complete exemption from rates and that i had failed to do so <e> <s> however as i said in introducing the amendment i deliberately drafted it in a way so that it was intended simply to allow conservation bodies not to have to pay for capital improvement works which in effect destroyed the very reason for their owning the land in the first place <e> <s> i was not suggesting that they or anybody else should be exempt from drainage rates which pay for maintenance works in an area which the noble lord said everybody was liable to pay <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for that but i think he is wrong about land values in west sedgemoor and a number of other areas in the country <e> <s> this is a sensitive issue for those concerned in both selling and buying the land but i am sure that there are organisations that would be able in confidence to provide the noble lord with some information <e> <s> i know that with his keenness on confidentiality in these matters he would respect that which would support what i have said <e>", "<cs> i have one question <e> <s> the noble lord said both sets of committees <e> <s> was he referring to the consultative committees and the regional consultative committees involving conservation and recreation interests <e>", "<cs> it would be better if i pursue this because it will save time on the next amendment <e> <s> would that allow the committees to choose a member of the authority to chair them or not <e>", "<cs> another alternative which the noble lord lord sandford might care to consider before the committee rises is the possibility of a question for written answer being asked that would get it into the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly underline the point which my noble friend has raised about the possibility that the new regional committees which the noble lord lord skelmersdale mentioned i think for the first time at second reading will cover both recreation and conservation interests <e> <s> as my noble friend has said the conservation bodies are not at all happy about this not because recreation and conservation are in conflict or are unhappy bedfellows but because there is already a very well established working relationship between conservation bodies and water authorities at regional level <e> <s> the consultations involve representatives of the nature conservancy council the county naturalists trust covered nationally by the royal society for nature <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord has just given way and i would be quite happy to sit down again if he would prefer it but rather than ask him to make a second speech after he has finished this one <e>", "<cs> it is late at night and we want to get on but with respect i really think that the noble lord ought to agree to take this away <e> <s> the fact is that the government issued guidelines these infamous guidelines from another bill last november which said at paragraph and i shall quote again to the noble lord because this is the important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that some of the previous speakers took a rather gloomy view of the prospects of getting some movement out of the government although i am afraid it would be unrealistic of us to expect very much movement from the noble lord on the front bench opposite this evening <e> <s> however i certainly agree with lord mottistone that this is not something upon which we should give up <e> <s> the logic of the case is so strong as the government themselves admitted in their response that sooner or later it seems to me they will have to give in to it <e> <s> indeed everybody seems to accept that the best practicable environmental option is the most sensible way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can just add a few words as i have an amendment down to clause which is supplementary to the marshalled list <e> <s> it was tabled late for exactly the same reason as the noble lord lord sandford has put forward namely that i did not see the written answer until very late in the day indeed until just before the week-end <e> <s> that written answer contains words which i thought contradicted what was said at the committee stage and which led to my tabling an amendment to try to clarify the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord lyell said in reply to my noble friend lord irving of dartford that the question of the evidence on which his honourable friend the minister had based his remarks was simply something that had to be referred to the minister <e> <s> can the noble lord say why that is the case <e> <s> has he seen the evidence or not <e> <s> if not why not <e> <s> if he has seen it why not tell the house what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to this amendment because as the noble earl lord onslow said we had a debate and indeed a division on a much more precise and stronger amendment at committee stage <e> <s> there seemed to be considerable support both in your lordships committee then and more generally for the view that when appointments are made to new water authorities there should be at least some consideration by ministers of the importance of conservation of both wildlife and landscape and of recreation interests when those appointments were made <e> <s> that is what this amendment would do <e>", "<cs> my lords might i suggest that we dispose of amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i only suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that to keep myself in order the noble earls explanation must be regarded as a lengthy intervention <e> <s> that will enable me to continue my speech withdraw the amendment and allow your lordships to make some progress <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble earl for the assurance which he has given on cost-benefit appraisal <e> <s> i appreciate that it must involve a number of people in some extra work to take this on at a late stage of the deliberations and i am particularly grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i press him to say whether what he said in the previous debate and what the noble lord lord skelmersdale said in the letter to me this morning is the right version so far as the government are concerned <e> <s> is this something which will be treated in the way that the cost-benefit appraisal will be treated or not <e> <s> i think that the noble earl ought to clear up that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e> <s> i take it from what i heard the noble earl say i shall have to check <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not at all happy about the noble earls answer <e> <s> to say that i am extremely unhappy would be putting it mildly <e> <s> i was quite happy with the procedure which the government adopted for putting right what was a serious mistake at the committee stage that the first two matters covered by the four amendments which i put down would be reconsidered by the officials involved and looked at and covered by the consultative document <e> <s> the fourth amendment is on a very narrow and relatively minor point <e> <s> it is not a matter of public policy and it comes outside the considerations which apply to the first three amendments <e> <s> but i do not think it is right for the government to say quite clearly and unambiguously at col of the committee stage of the bill on th march that something comes within the remit of the interdepartmental committee on land drainage <e> <s> indeed there was a proposal from the government which was circulated to a number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave way to the noble earl to allow him to make that intervention but i had no indication until this morning or last night that the interdepartmental committee on land drainage was not looking at all these points <e> <s> it is on the record in <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not presume to give an answer to the detailed questions which have been raised <e> <s> i think it would be much safer for the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to await any advice which the noble earl is able to dig out rather than relying on anything that i might say <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for the remarks at the end about the possibility of owners of land raising this matter and for saying that he is sure that the internal drainage boards themselves will bear it in mind <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord lord mottistone is perpetuating the myth which the noble lord lord sandford so effectively demolished <e> <s> it is not true that water boards are in the same position as the gas or electricity boards or the coal industry or other major suppliers of that kind because the water boards have the power to levy rates on individuals regardless of whether the commodity they supply is used or not <e> <s> if the noble lord will just stop to think about this for a moment i hope he will accept that that <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is going to leave that point may i ask him one question <e> <s> does he accept that the flexibility of which he has made a great deal cuts two ways <e> <s> it gives people flexibility in the sense that they can comment on yet another draft of the guidelines and propose changes to them but one of the worries on all sides of the committee is that it gives a great deal of flexibility to the government in that they can once parliament has finished dealing with the bill put into the guidelines what they will <e> <s> that is why many members from all sides of the committee support writing into the bill rather more detail than the government seem to be willing to accept <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> it goes a great way down the road which i hoped the noble lord would travel <e> <s> however i think it would have been simpler for the government to go the whole way <e> <s> the noble lord knows as well as i that only three organisations are involved because there are only three nature conservation bodies with a regional structure where there are staff or members who can take part in these consultations <e> <s> the view as to what should happen has been expressed quite clearly by the statutory advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not where i was on th may because unfortunately i was not able to take part in the second reading of the bill then <e> <s> i am delighted for that reason that the noble baroness has had to bring her bill back to the house for a second <e>", "<cs> my lords it looks as though the bill is going to get a unanimous welcome <e> <s> it certainly deserves it and i add my own welcome to those which have already been given <e> <s> i disagreed with one or two things that were said by earlier speakers but i am delighted to say that i agree with everything the right reverend prelate the bishop of bristol had to say and i congratulate him on his contribution <e> <s> in particular i agreed with his remarks about the short title of the bill and i hope that we can amend that in committee <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there are clearly serious cases of smuggling very dangerous drugs like heroin and i shall come back to that point in a moment <e> <s> to return to the case which i was mentioning of the briton imprisoned in turkey and serving a -year sentence of which he has served about six years that individual is very seriously ill <e> <s> although there have been contradictory reports from the turkish prison authorities it appears that the person concerned may well have cancer and there is no possibility of medical treatment being given so far as i can ascertain simply because the facilities are not available in the turkish prison system <e> <s> it seems likely that unless that individual can be transferred back to this country in the reasonably near future he will die <e> <s> i wanted to mention that case in particular because it emphasises that we are not talking about just a humanitarian measure we are talking about a humanitarian measure which might make the difference between life and death for quite a few british citizens who are in prison abroad <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think it does <e> <s> and yes i do think it is terrible because the only alternative is to leave the person in prison in south africa <e> <s> we know what fate awaits a large number of people in prison particularly if they happen to be black in south africa for offences against those laws <e> <s> they are likely to die in prison <e> <s> in return i would ask my noble friend whether it is really tenable just to be able to wash our own hands to keep people in prison abroad where they may face death as in the case i have given it would also apply to people in prison in south africa rather than to transfer them here where however disagreeable it may be to my noble friend and myself that they should be in gaol it would be a great deal better from the individuals point of view <e> <s> that seems to me to be the overwhelming argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also a farmer and we also burn straw and have done so for many years <e> <s> but i have become increasingly convinced and am now totally convinced that it is an unacceptable practice which must be brought to an end <e> <s> therefore i very strongly support and welcome this bill <e> <s> i am convinced that it is no longer a question in the public mind of how straw is burned or getting by-laws right and codes of practice right it is the fact that straw is burnt at all that causes the problem <e> <s> i do not agree with my noble friend on the front bench that we are debating this bill tonight because last summer happened to be hot and windy <e> <s> it has been my recent experience when discussing straw burning that every summer nowadays is hot and windy whatever the actual conditions have been <e> <s> i have no doubt it will be the same next year because the problem is caused by the greatly increased acreages of cereals grown and of straw burnt and the much shorter time period in which this all takes place because of the greatly increased acreage of autumn drilling which follows harvesting <e> <s> there is no getting away from that <e> <s> there are no by-laws and no local authority or anything else which will remove the facts of the case that the greatly-increased acreage of straw being burnt in a short <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i thought he was going on to say that it would be welcomed because he has made the point that straw in the soil uses nitrogen and is therefore likely to reduce the problems which the royal society and others have drawn attention to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt my noble friend but if he is about to withdraw the amendment perhaps i may intervene before he does so <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for withdrawing in favour of me and for not withdrawing the amendment just yet <e> <s> perhaps we may press the minister a little harder on this amendment now <e> <s> i listened very carefully to what he said and was not entirely clear that he answered the principal worry in my mind when putting my name to this amendment <e> <s> that worry was that should there be a mistake of some kind in the warrant very real problems could arise <e> <s> this amendment seeks to overcome those problems together with amendment no <e> <s> with which it should be taken <e>", "<cs> the reason why i must press the minister and why i believe it will be very helpful if he can reconsider this point is that were we talking simply about a transfer between rochester borstal and maidstone gaol then matters would be as the minister envisages them <e> <s> but in talking about the transfer of a prisoner from let us say the far east in thailand or somewhere else the situation will not be like that at all <e> <s> i very much doubt whether the prisoner will have access to any advice and if he does do so it may be bad advice and not good advice <e> <s> also the prisoner may be very sick and that may be one of the reasons why the transfer is being promoted <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> what he said is extremely welcome <e> <s> as my noble friend said this is really a very important point <e> <s> the fact that the government are prepared to meet at least some of it is a very welcome move <e> <s> it does seem to me that it might be possible to specify rather more detailed information being given to people who are transferring to this country and who we would reasonably therefore expect to understand english and to whom the various things listed in the amendment and in particular details of our domestic legislation will be especially relevant <e> <s> it seems to me not unreasonable for the government to accept a rather more onerous duty in those circumstances than they would for example in explaining the domestic penal legislation in thailand to a thai citizen who is transferring from this country back to his own country <e> <s> i wonder whether when the minister is looking at this he could consider that point because although it would be in some ways undesirable to discriminate between people who we were transferring from this country and those coming here i think it would be reasonable for the government to take on rather more in terms of people who are coming to this country and indeed it would be quite practicable for them to do so <e> <s> that seems to me to be something which will enable the noble lord to go further to meet the details of the amendment than he might have thought up until now <e>", "<cs> can i say first of all to the noble and learned lord lord denning that i think that in this case there is a difference from some others that he may have in mind <e> <s> as has been pointed out the government have as it were a double discretion they already may or may not consent to a transfer in the first place and then when all the details are agreed including their consent having been given under their own discretion they have a second discretion about whether or not to go ahead with it <e> <s> the noble lord has given us some examples which he thinks might justify that being done <e> <s> i must say that i have my doubts for a number of reasons <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord the minister will do that because as he knows i strongly support the degree of discretion which the bill has incorporated in it <e> <s> i accept the argument that the government put forward on i think second reading that there will be a very large variety of circumstances in which we need to be free to enter into bilateral arrangements with other countries and to meet their requirements to allow people to be transferred back to the united kingdom <e> <s> in those circumstances there does rest upon the government a particular responsibility because given the very wide discretion and the unusual circumstances to which the bill gives rise of people being imprisoned in this country for offences committed abroad which would not have been offences if for example they had occurred in the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment perhaps i could put a question to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> it seems to me that the burden of proof is on the government <e> <s> in drafting this bill and in the approach that they have adopted the government have said that discretion is necessary because they cannot foresee all the many different circumstances that will arise <e> <s> i believe that that is a basic proposition that the committee has accepted <e>", "<cs> there is a case which has occurred to me as i have been listening to the debate <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i put a suggestion though it is off the top of my head and may not be sensible <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me either today or at some future point whether this would fall within the definition <e> <s> if with widespread popular support from the people of great britain somebody recruited a group of mercenaries from this country to go to fight against an evil regime and those mercenaries were caught and incarcerated for hundreds of years in prison and then were subject to a transfer and were going to come back to complete their sentences here when it was discovered that one of them was a stateless person who had no ties with the united kingdom other than that he had been recruited along with a number of other united kingdom citizens he had never been to this country but had no other country in the world to which he could be transferred or which was prepared to take him the government would be faced with the prospect of half-a-dozen returning heroes as it were and one of their colleagues left languishing in jail <e> <s> in those circumstances where the person had never been here had no relatives here and his only connection was the recruiting sergeant who had also recruited a number of people from this country would his case be considered <e>", "<cs> would the act which the noble lord is steering through this house allow the government to consider the merits of that particular case or would it be ruled out <e>", "<cs> i must say that the noble lord has not convinced me either <e> <s> i can see there might be occasions when the grounds for refusing a transfer were national security of one sort or another and the government would not want to have to go to court and reveal the source of the evidence on which they based that decision <e> <s> i should have thought that that would be a comparatively simple matter to accommodate in an amendment so as to ensure that was not something which could be looked at in detail in court and that the government had to give their reasons unless national security was involved or something of that sort <e>", "<cs> with respect i do not think i have and i can envisage plenty of circumstances in which ministers might decide that they do not wish to have a british citizen repatriated to this country because of the threat he poses to this countrys security <e> <s> that seems to me much more likely than objecting to the transfer of someone out of this country <e> <s> after all the whole problem about posing a threat to national security is that it is not something the government are prepared to stand up in court and prove <e> <s> as the noble lord knows from the position in northern ireland this will be information from informers and so on which for one reason or another will not stand up in court or which the government are not prepared to reveal in court <e>", "<cs> that assurance is helpful although it would be more helpful if the minister could tell us where in the bill is his authority for saying what he has just said <e> <s> a number of us looking at the bill thought that it was restricted to people convicted of criminal offences by a court or tribunal <e> <s> there was a worry that a country might announce that it had no criminal code or crime which people could transgress against because it had adopted some other system and that the government might be precluded by the terms of the bill from entering into a transfer arrangement with such a country <e>", "<cs> it is worth stressing that many prisoners in having to decide on whether to accept a transfer will have some very difficult choices to make <e> <s> although they may find themselves in much better conditions if they return here to serve the remainder of their sentence they will also return to face a sentence of a length which they can be fairly certain of although i agree there are some uncertainties about parole <e> <s> nevertheless they will have a fairly clear idea of how long they will spend in prison <e> <s> however in many other countries where people will be serving sentences there are irregular amnesties and people may be let out on the whim of an individual and so on so they will have to gamble as it were on the likelihood of getting a fairly early release from very bad conditions against serving a slightly longer sentence in better conditions <e> <s> obviously one of the factors that will be important to them is to know not only whether they will on return have to serve the remainder of the sentence for the offence of which they have been convicted abroad but also whether they will face further perhaps serious charges <e> <s> these may be charges connected with the offence of which they have been convicted abroad and for which they may feel they have already been sufficiently sentenced <e> <s> there are a number of situations one can see in which it would be important for the prisoner to have access to such information <e>", "<cs> i do not think that that is good enough <e> <s> why cannot the bill say that the time during which the prisoner is out of the country and in custody will count towards the period <e> <s> that would meet the <e>", "<cs> we are dealing with people who are in rather different circumstances than stranded holidaymakers <e> <s> some of these are being kept in quite appalling conditions maybe at very great risk to their health or personal safety <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord does not need reminding of the quite appalling problems which face some british citizens in prisons in some countries overseas <e> <s> there is a very genuine concern at the combination of the governments interest in recovering expenses with their very wide discretionary powers not just at one stage but at two stages and we have already discussed those powers in this connection that is as to whether they will agree to a transfer and then avoid carrying the transfer through even if it has been agreed to by all the parties <e> <s> there is concern that that provision is there so that the government can try to get the money from the prisoner or from dependants of the prisoner in this country before the transfer takes place <e>", "<cs> let me put one thought in the noble lords mind <e> <s> if anyone has stables full of horses or indeed any other considerable assets in this country once he returns it should not be beyond the wit of the government to recover the expenses from him <e> <s> i do not regard that as a major difficulty <e> <s> on the other hand the worry is that some people who have very genuine difficulties in meeting the bill will be told that before they can be transferred they must meet it in some way <e> <s> as there is the real risk that people will be threatened by the government saying you find the money and then you will get transferred we need it met in some way in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that this is something that can he dismissed quite as easily as the noble lord lord elton suggested <e> <s> it may be a small number of cases as the noble lord suggests but that will be after a considerable period of time <e> <s> i do not know whether he would be prepared to give us an estimate of when he expects the backlog to be completed <e> <s> my impression is that it is going to be a considerable number of years <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the end of the abuse of the business expansion scheme by the government may i ask the noble lord to say whether the presumption that he mentioned against the widespread clearance of woodland for agriculture would be absolute in the case of the clearance of ancient woodland bearing in mind the recommendation of your lordships select committee on science and technology that the losses of ancient woodland have been so severe in the period since the war that no more should be destroyed for any reason whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord relied on the forestry commission census which suggested that the area of deciduous woodland in this country had not decreased since the war may i ask him whether he is aware of the very widespread criticism of the basis on which that survey was conducted and in particular of the criticism which suggests that the forestry commission excluded large areas of very small woodland from the figures with which it was comparing its more recent work and that on that basis the survey is completely worthless <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the only people in this house when the wildlife and countryside act was being debated who appeared unaware of the appalling problems to which it would lead were those speaking on his front bench on behalf of the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> is he aware that everyone else criticised the bill on exactly these grounds from all sides of the house <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord say why the government have set their face so firmly against implementing the guidance side of the common agricultural policy in ways that it is implemented in other european countries to make extensive systems of agriculture more profitable and thus reduce the cost of these compensation handouts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo what the noble lord lord avebury has said about the lengths to which the minister has gone to meet a number of points made at committee stage <e> <s> it might be worth mentioning that amendment no <e> <s> which is in the names of the noble lord <e> <s> lord donaldson and others including myself will clearly be withdrawn as it is identical to amendment no <e> <s> to which the noble lord is now talking which shows the lengths to which he has gone to pre-empt the suggestions made by noble lords in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that the government are making a bit of a meal of this <e> <s> i do not say that simply because of the length of time it took the noble lord to say that he did not approve of the amendment <e> <s> for a start whether the amendment is in the bill or not the secretary of state still has the discretion to accept a prisoner back to this country or to refuse the transfer of the prisoner <e> <s> that discretion is absolute <e> <s> if for example a person is a convicted terrorist and the government decide that his transfer back to this country is undesirable whether he is a british citizen or someone who has indefinite leave to remain in the united kingdom the government as the amendment says are still free to refuse him <e> <s> that is why the government are making a bit of a meal of it <e> <s> it does not make that much difference to the governments powers <e> <s> it seems to me that the government in suspecting the motives of those who have put their names to this amendment as i thought was the implication of the noble lords reply in believing that this is an attempt to change the immigration rules have missed a point which would have been helpful to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i can just add to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> it does seem to me that there is rather more room for doubt about the meaning of the word effect than the noble and learned lord lord denning and the noble lord the minister have suggested <e> <s> after all the effect of the warrant is to transfer the prisoner back to this country <e> <s> we are talking about prisoners coming back here <e> <s> it is surely the effect of other legislation the legislation governing parole remission of sentence and so on which will affect the length of the sentence <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i do not think any of us are likely to be sitting in the court which may be called upon to decide this matter <e> <s> it will not be done as all of us know with any reference to what is said in debates in your lordships house it will be done solely by reference to what is said on the face of the bill <e> <s> it does seem to me that there is at least ground for argument for saying that the effect of the warrant is to transfer the person back here and it is the effect of the other legislation which may change in the course of the persons imprisonment abroad or other changes that may be made which will affect the earliest possible release date <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so to the noble lord what he says is based on two quite false and extraordinary hypotheses <e> <s> first he seems to be suggesting that there is absolutely no exchange of information between different police forces in this country no such thing as computers and no such thing as centralised records for people suspected of offences or liable to be charged with them let alone people for whom warrants have been issued <e> <s> that is odd coming from a minister in his position <e> <s> surely he accepts that there is some exchange of information between police forces and that there are records held centrally of people who are wanted for criminal offences <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he say where the phrase withdrawal of consent is defined in the bill <e> <s> so far as i can see that terminology is not defined anywhere in the legislation and it is that which gives rise to the doubt which prompted this amendment both at the committee stage and again now <e> <s> without its being clear at what stage the withdrawal of consent will have been deemed to take place given that it is not defined it seems to me that the need for this amendment remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure he is feeling under a lot of pressure as regards time as this report stage may be taking longer than the government originally envisaged <e> <s> we are dealing with an important bill one that was started in this house and it seems to me that there is some disadvantage in taking all these amendments together <e> <s> they raise rather different points and if they are not debated separately those of us who are moving them do not have the opportunity to speak twice <e> <s> for my part i should like to take amendment no <e> <s> separately for those reasons despite the fact that i am sure the noble lord is being leaned on by others to try to speed us up <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has gone a long way towards meeting some of the criticisms we made at committee stage but i still have a residual worry which i will come to when i move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> but i urge the noble lord however pressed we are for time to bear in mind that we are not always dealing with people who have been fairly imprisoned <e> <s> if i have the noble lords attention he said yet again that all the cases we shall be dealing with under this bill will in some way be less deserving than a stranded tourist <e> <s> but that will not be the case where people have been incarcerated for no reason in quite unjust circumstances <e> <s> in those circumstances there may be much stronger arguments for paying for their travel costs back to this country than there would be for a stranded tourist <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there are in fact two points and the amendment covers only one of them although i covered both in what i said <e> <s> the first is the case where it would be quite unreasonable to charge people for bringing them home <e> <s> the iranian hostages if there was an equivalent situation in this country and if they were transferred back here under the provisions of this bill would be a case in point <e> <s> although the noble lord lord elton suggested that the bill gave the secretary of state discretion in such a case i must say that on the face of it i cannot see that it does <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would agree to write to us on that matter rather than delaying our proceedings now <e> <s> if i may say so he is nodding his head and that is on the record so i think we can leave that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord elton for offering to look at both points and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has gone a very long way to meet my point and i am again grateful to him as i think all of us have been through-out the report stage on this bill for the amount of help he has given the house in meeting points that have been raised <e> <s> he said a little uncertainly that this information would be placed in the library of your lordships house <e> <s> that is on the record and he has not qualified the remark <e> <s> i assume that that will be on an annual basis because the noble lord referred to statistics being kept annually <e> <s> as we leave the bill the thought that we will have all this information placed in the library on an annual basis to allow us to see the results of our work and the effect of the decisions which the secretary of state has made is a very useful commitment by the government and i thank the noble lord very much <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that my amendment provided us with such an opportunity to be polite about each other <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there are three of us who would like to join in this debate whose names are not on the list and from various hand signals around the chamber i think i am going to go first <e> <s> i should like to congratulate my noble friend on asking an important question and say that i entirely agree with the case that he and the noble lord lord saint levan made about prussia cove <e> <s> i have had some correspondence about the case which i read with great interest <e> <s> it seems to me that the muddled planning history of this particular site provides absolutely no justification for the decision that appears to have been taken <e> <s> in both this case and the case which the noble lord lord leconfield and egremont mentioned of oil exploration there is a serious problem in that the department of the environment have given people messages that they are not going to call in applications in cases where sensitive sites such as aonbs are at risk nearly as frequently as they did in the past <e> <s> that is a regrettable line for the department to have taken <e> <s> i have no doubt that that message has got through to local planning authorities and that this is putting at risk a number of beautiful areas of our countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what i believe are two excellent reports as i think has been the case with nearly everybody who has spoken <e> <s> i think that it is worth pointing out that the unanimous conclusions of both probably would have been unthinkable three or four years ago and it is unfortunately the fact that it was three or four years ago that we were debating <e>", "<cs> my lords the statistics are set out in the evidence to the european communitys report <e> <s> i am sure that at this time of night the noble lord will not want me to go through that in a great deal of detail <e> <s> i have given him the page reference and i am sure that he has the report and has read this evidence in great detail and with great interest himself <e> <s> the current rate of reduction over the five years from to i has been hectares <e> <s> that is roughly four times the average rate of loss in the period since the last war <e>", "<cs> i heard the noble earl say that they have but only on a very small area of the broads and not on the area which was being damaged towards the end of last week <e> <s> the government should give a commitment that they will give no further agricultural grants for improvement in that area and instead agricultural money should be diverted to support the current livestock farming systems in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was hoping at this time of night that the noble lord would not sidetrack me into something which does not seem to me to be particularly relevant to the conclusions reached by either of the select committees but since he has with your lordships leave i feel obliged to answer him <e> <s> i did say that and i said it because the government when passing the wildlife and countryside act said that the voluntary restraint system to safeguard wildlife habitats in the countryside would work <e> <s> they said that very largely on the evidence of farmers such as the noble lord lord stanley who himself said that a voluntary restraint system would protect the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has referred to my remarks again may i make clear that i also strongly support the approach that the cla and the cpre are taking <e> <s> had they taken it earlier and had the government adopted it earlier direct intervention would not now be necessary <e> <s> in how many cases have sites of special scientific interest been destroyed as a result of breaches of the criminal law <e> <s> i have information to suggest that it is around <e> <s> in how many of those cases have prosecutions been undertaken by the government or by the governments agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to declare an interest as a farmer who uses pesticides not for quite as long i hasten to add as my noble friend on the front bench but nevertheless uses them <e> <s> i want to concentrate my remarks on part iii of the bill <e> <s> i should like to mention just a little of the general background which i do not think has been alluded to so far first of all the massive public concern there is about the use of pesticides in the countryside <e> <s> that is something which i hope nobody in this house or indeed in another place will ignore <e> <s> for example a national farmers union survey last year showed that there was greater public concern about pesticides used in the countryside than there was about the cutting down of trees the removal of hedgerows and straw and stubble burning put together <e> <s> those three items put together were of less concern to the general public than the use of pesticides <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl mentioned ddt and dde <e> <s> i asked a question of the ministry of agriculture some time ago and was told that a considerable quantity of both chemicals were in fact still in use in specialised agricultural fruit growing or vegetable growing areas so they have not gone out of use completely in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned efficacy testing but did not reply to my specific question about whether he could reconcile the two statements issued by his ministry first that efficacy testing would be applied to all products and secondly that efficacy testing would be applied to all new products <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to concentrate my remarks on the likely impact of this road on the area of the national park that will be affected namely okehampton park and in particular the two areas of open space that will be affected and which led to the matter coming before parliament in the first place <e> <s> i should like to make two comments on the remarks which the noble lord has made on behalf of the government one of which i shall come to at the end of my remarks <e> <s> first the noble lord mentioned the dartmoor preservation association and certainly they have been in the lead in opposing a route that went through the national park <e> <s> but a number of other interests the open spaces society the ramblers association and many national organisations have been concerned about the proposal that this route should go through a national park <e> <s> i take it from what we have heard already that the other interests which the noble lord mentioned as needing to be balanced against these are primarily the agricultural interests and the financial interests of the government <e> <s> those were the main arguments at the time and as far as i can see remain the main arguments against a northern route <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has heard no doubt of the imposition of milk quotas <e> <s> is it not possible that that would have been seen as considerably changing the atmosphere and the importance of agricultural production compared with the period when this was looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl likes having an argument across the house but he really is having an argument about nothing because all i said was just what he said <e> <s> there has been a change of opinion in recent years and conservation is seen as more important than it was in and the need to increase food production is no longer as great as it was in <e> <s> that is all i said i did not say that those things should be disregarded <e> <s> i hope the noble earl would not think me as silly as that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be sensible to take an amendment down in my name later on the marshalled list amendment no <e> <s> with this amendment because it also aims by way of a new clause to set out general objectives which the government should follow in making orders under this part of the bill <e> <s> if the minister thinks that would be sensible i should be happy to speak to that amendment now in order to save time later but i am willing to listen to what the minister has to say about it <e>", "<cs> take the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> lord belstead about my amendment no <e> <s> being more detailed and if it be convenient to your lordships i shall leave that amendment until we reach it in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> take the point that the department of the environment is involved in the clearance of particular pesticides but surely in drawing up the regulations there is a rather more fundamental point <e> <s> i am still a little confused about exactly what role the department of the environment will play in that <e> <s> i understand that it will be consulted and i think that is all the noble lord said <e> <s> but i think he would agree that there is a difference between the secretary of state and his department being consulted when detailed regulations are drawn up and the secretary of state for the environment jointly agreeing the regulations approving the regulations with a number of those ministers responsible for agricultural matters in the united kingdom <e> <s> it seems to me that if i understand the position right while the secretary of states department may be consulted he and other environmental ministers in the united kingdom will not be involved in approving the regulations before they are brought before parliament <e> <s> that seems to me to be a point which would be worth taking on board because given that the effect of pesticides is as great on the environment as it is on the agricultural industry in my view the secretary of state for the environment and <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not mind my mentioning that apart from evidence to the select committees of parliament there have been the reports of two select committees of your lordships house this year <e> <s> in both cases the select committees said that while relationships between the departments might be close they could be and should be closer still in future <e>", "<cs> i was grinning only because someone on the noble earls front bench happened to point to me when he said that and i in turn pointed to the noble earl which i am sure he will agree with <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question about this and then put a point to him <e> <s> i ask that because there are really two parts to this amendment <e> <s> the question is have i understood it right that in practice what the government are intending to do is to introduce a series of regulations <e> <s> with some like the regulations on residues they intend to wait for european or international agreements as with the regulations which will deal with export to other countries <e> <s> they intend to wait for international agreements so there will in fact be a series of regulations possibly appearing over a period of years <e> <s> that is the first question just to make sure i am right about that <e>", "<cs> come back on the question of may and shall <e> <s> i should not do so if it was not for the fact that i am quite certain in my own mind that the noble lord lord belstead is wrong about this <e> <s> he suggested that putting shall in the bill would tie us down in future as to the contents of particular regulations <e> <s> with respect that simply cannot be right <e> <s> what shall does at this particular point in the bill is to say that this and future governments will produce regulations <e> <s> it does not say anything at this stage about the contents of the regulations <e> <s> they could be general narrow or cover a whole range of other things <e> <s> it would simply say that there will be regulations <e> <s> with respect i think that the noble lord is wrong in what he said just now to the committee about its tying us down to a particular set of regulations which would then be fixed <e> <s> that cannot be right <e>", "<cs> there is a real point of difference between what the government have so far said about controlling exports of pesticides and what my noble friend on the front bench said in moving the amendment namely the importance of prior informed consent <e> <s> i simply do not agree that insisting not only on exporters giving information to an importing country but also on an importing country consenting to the imports is interfering with that countrys business <e> <s> we are leaving the power whether to say yes or no to an import entirely to the importing country <e>", "<cs> surely the answer is that subsection deals only with the provision of information and so far as i can see does not give the government power to ban exports even to fulfil international obligations <e> <s> what concerns me is that it looks quite possible not to say likely and i would certainly say it was desirable that international obligations will arise that require more than just the provision of information <e>", "<cs> when the noble earl referred to that just now he said as i said to the noble lord lord craigton that clause gives the government power to require the provision of such information as may be necessary for various purposes <e> <s> is the noble earl telling us that that means the government have the power to prohibit the export of pesticides without the prior informed consent of the importing country <e> <s> that is the question he was asked <e> <s> with great respect to him the whole of his reply to the debate was on a different subject because nobody in supporting the amendment suggested that chemicals should be banned from export <e> <s> we a number of us at least simply said that there should be the informed consent of the importing country first that is quite a different argument <e> <s> do the government have power to do that or do they not <e>", "<cs> if i may say so that would be quite wrong <e> <s> the noble earl missed the point as i thought he had of the speeches most noble lords made in supporting the amendment <e> <s> the international obligation which seems closest to agreement although as he said it is still in draft is the fao one and as my noble friend said the current draft includes a requirement for prior informed consent <e> <s> it may be that the united kingdom government do not agree with that and want to see the draft changed but there are a number of other expressions of international opinion in particular a unanimous resolution of the european parliament which suggest that prior informed consent will not go away <e> <s> even if the fao code is eventually agreed without it it is clearly something which is likely to become an international obligation in the future <e> <s> it may be that at that stage the government would want to come back to parliament with a food and environment amendment bill but i should have thought that it would be sensible if taking wide powers in the first place to include the power to make regulations to prohibit exports to meet what seems at least likely to be future international obligations <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord belstead a question <e> <s> it has already been said by his colleague on the front bench that what subsection does is allow the government to ask for information which will then allow them to approve the export <e> <s> it would really be stretching the meaning of subsection it seems to me to say what i think the government would have to say if they were going to implement an international obligation to impose prior informed consent <e> <s> what they would have to do under subsection is say that they require information from an exporter which consists not only of the exporter telling the importing country what the pesticide consisted of but also that the importing country had agreed to it <e> <s> that really does seem to me to be stretching subsection too far <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord renton that it is not worded very clearly but i certainly do not think it is worded vaguely enough to extend that far <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord take himself one step further <e> <s> we all agree about that <e> <s> i do not think there is any argument about what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> but if the fao code as it now stands is agreed if the european parliaments resolution becomes an international obligation if the rucn resolution becomes an international obligation the government will have to go beyond what the noble lord has just said and they will have to ban the export of products to meet what would be an international obligation on all countries unless the importing country had agreed to their import <e> <s> that power is not in the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl would answer a straight question which has been put to him by several noble lords on all sides of the committee <e> <s> does the bill as drafted give the government power to ban the export of chemicals if prior informed consent from the importing country has not been obtained yes or no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made an uncharacteristic personal attack on the question that i asked him <e> <s> as it has now been repeated again twice from behind him i hope that he might reconsider that <e> <s> there is no difference on either side of the committee <e> <s> we may have different views about the desirability of prior informed consent but that is not the purpose of this amendment and it has not been the content of any of the questions that the noble lord has been asked and which with respect he still has not answered <e> <s> all the people who have asked him questions have asked him whether the bill gives the government power to meet a hypothetical international obligation to impose prior informed consent <e> <s> does it provide that power or not <e> <s> the noble lord has not yet said yes or no to that question <e> <s> in fact he has quite deliberately avoided saying yes or no to that question which has been asked him from behind him more frequently than it has been asked from this side of the committee <e> <s> that is all that has been asked of him simply to say yes or no to that <e>", "<cs> i put my name to this amendment because as i think has already been said by more than one noble lord it is very often the case that the method of application is a matter of more significance from the farmers point of view and the environmental point of view than the chemical formulation of the product itself <e>", "<cs> as i believe i said when i first spoke i certainly accept that there are special powers in the <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this <e> <s> i know that the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord renton have received a visit from the government chief whip <e>", "<cs> but this is an important amendment with respect and i should like to be clear about what the noble lord lord belstead is going to look at <e> <s> there is a clear difference on the merits of an argument <e> <s> i accept that there are merits on both sides <e> <s> one as the noble lord lord belstead said is to look at the chemicals and then make sure that farmers are under a duty to use machinery which is appropriate and safe for the purpose <e> <s> the other side which i think is the case that the noble lord lord craigton and i are arguing is that the government rather than farmers should decide what machinery is safe and appropriate for the purpose <e> <s> that is a serious difference <e> <s> i am not saying that one side or the other is right but i should hope that we could pursue that without being rushed too much <e>", "<cs> i apologise for my unwarranted assumption about the influence of the government chief whip <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i am very grateful for that reply and i should like to consider it <e> <s> can the noble earl just confirm that in that case dieldrin is now no longer available for any agricultural use either for crop protection purposes or for any veterinary or animal purpose at all <e> <s> it would be very helpful if he could confirm that <e> <s> i think that was what he said <e> <s> i just want to be clear <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask for some information <e> <s> are we going to take amendments nos <e> <s> and of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie when we come back to this next week <e> <s> they are on the same subject <e> <s> if we are i should have thought it might be sensible to leave matters as the noble lord lord belstead has left them as we are going to have another debate in a couple of days time rather than have a long debate tonight <e> <s> i just wonder if that is what the committee envisages <e>", "<cs> i think i am becoming a little clearer as to how the government intend to tackle this problem of how pesticides are actually applied <e> <s> i hope the noble lord agrees with those of us who have already raised this point in committee that this will very often be as important as the question which chemicals are applied and for what purposes <e> <s> however i still personally do not follow what the noble lord envisages happening if once they have given a particular chemical clearance in the way he suggests for use with particular sorts of machinery and in particular conditions or whatever machinery is not used which is right for that chemical <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall not pursue the point arising from the previous amendment now although i register my continuing disquiet about the route that the government have chosen <e> <s> on the particular amendment that we are discussing i am grateful for the ministers assurance and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have had a longer debate on the amendment than i had expected <e> <s> i should like to make three points before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> first <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question about this aspect <e> <s> what would be the situation if a farmer bought a pesticide application system a sprayer or whatever from a manufacturer <e> <s> in the hypothetical case that i am suggesting it would probably be a small manufacturer <e> <s> the manufacturer sold the farmer that machine as being appropriate and safe for use with a whole range of herbicides <e> <s> the farmer then used the machine for applying a whole range of herbicides <e> <s> a health and safety inspector saw the farmer at work with the machine stopped the farmer working and said this machine is neither appropriate nor safe for use with herbicides <e> <s> it should not be used to apply herbicides at all <e> <s> it is completely wrong for that <e> <s> you have broken the law and i am going to prosecute you <e> <s> you must stop using the machine immediately <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment is it good enough to say to all the farmers who are potentially affected by this power that the government are taking that if they get into trouble they should consult a solicitor and await to see what <e>", "<cs> i also want to support this amendment which has my name on it <e> <s> i should like to make two very quick further points <e> <s> i think the case has been very ably deployed for ensuring that the bill provides some powers to allow the government if they wish to and i hope noble lords will remember that this is simply discretionary and not mandatory to ensure that the soil of this country is not subjected to dangerous levels of pesticide residue <e> <s> for example i understand that in west germany paraquat has been banned on the grounds that undesirable levels of residues of that chemical were building up in soils subject to minimal cultivations <e>", "<cs> i very strongly support this amendment <e> <s> i think it is one which meets the very considerable concern of many farmers in particular fruit growers who have suffered considerable damage because of pesticides volatising from neighbouring crops often some considerable distance away and appearing sometimes some days after they were applied originally <e> <s> my noble friend drew attention in particular to the problems which volatile chemicals of this sort cause to the natural interests in the countryside <e> <s> after all the nature reserve does not need to be annexed to or even very close to a field which has been sprayed with a particularly volatile pesticide to be affected very adversely by it to say nothing of the generality of plants in hedgerows and alongside green lanes most of which will be particularly susceptible to the types of pesticide which are produced in the most volatile formulations <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that in looking at the safety of a particular product its effect on the environment would be taken into account <e> <s> he then added in parenthesis that that would include nature reserves <e> <s> but as i understand it it would be a major change of policy from the existing scheme if when the particular products were assessed their effects on native flora were considered as significant as their effects on other broad-leaved crops when it comes to volatility <e> <s> if that is what the noble earl is saying then it would be very welcome and would take us a considerable step forward <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble earl for a response to my specific question on the matter of whether in future the effects of volatile chemicals on non-agricultural species on the native flora will be considered a significant factor or not <e>", "<cs> i was going to intervene to say that the noble earl might like to consider taking away the points that i have made <e> <s> i do not necessarily expect the government to give a reply to all these detailed points particularly as we are dealing with some very general clauses <e> <s> there is likely i suppose to be some weeks between now and the report stage and i would be very happy to receive a typed letter in reply to all these points and which we could both read at our leisure over the christmas break <e> <s> i am not trying to put the noble earl on the spot now <e> <s> but if he would like to take the matter away and write to me i should be very grateful <e> <s> i think that both of us might find it more helpful <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> may i respond to the point which the noble earl lord onslow made which i think was put to him as it has been to me by the united kingdom agricultural supply trade association <e> <s> they suggest as i think is agreed on all sides of the committee that if some aerial spraying is necessary for example for forestry operations where clearly no other form of spraying is a practical possibility then the argument runs we must keep aerial spraying available for everything to ensure that there is a viable aerial spraying industry around to spray the trees <e>", "<cs> may i make a brief point <e> <s> i was grateful to the noble lord for giving me a straight answer to the question that i asked although i must say that i find it bitterly disappointing particularly as a farmer <e> <s> i suspect that many of those involved in the manufacture and distribution of pesticides and those involved on a commercial basis as contractors not using aircraft will be bitterly disappointed as well <e> <s> i cannot help asking when oh <e> <s> when will the ministry of agriculture think about making concessions to widespread deeply felt public concern about some aspect of modern agriculture before they are absolutely forced to do so and when no benefit is brought to the agricultural industry when the concession is made <e> <s> straw burning has been a good example and the ministry if they had introduced their new by-laws a couple of years earlier than they did might well have made a dramatic difference to the way that the farming industry is seen by the public <e> <s> if they had made some greater concessions to conservation interests when the wildlife and countryside bill was being debated in this house and in another place we should not now two or three years later be contemplating an amendment bill <e> <s> surely sooner or later the ministry of agriculture and the government are going to have to recognise that they cannot <e>", "<cs> i <e>", "<cs> may i just reply to the noble lord because he asked me specifically what my view was <e> <s> i was supporting the amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and which has been supported by noble lords on various sides of the chamber <e> <s> that is what my view was on this <e> <s> i feel we ought to have a licensing system <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead will remember that i raised this matter on second reading in particular because the ministrys press release on the bill which was put out on th november said that for the first time all pesticides would be screened for efficacy as well as safety <e> <s> the noble lord in replying to the debate on second reading made it clear that it would not apply to all products immediately it would apply to all new products immediately but for others there would have to be a period of time during which products would <e>", "<cs> while the minister is considering that question may i ask him to reply also to the point i made concerning the five-year period which the farming press has reported manufacturers have been told is the period within which the remaining number of products will be cleared for efficacy <e> <s> i have read two reports appearing in different papers in the middle of november which stated quite explicitly that manufacturers have been told there will be a five-year period to re-screen all the present approved pesticides for efficacy <e> <s> it would be helpful to know if that is the time period the ministry has in mind <e>", "<cs> i have been listening to this and i am not entirely clear <e> <s> if the amendment had may instead of shall so that it did not oblige the noble lord to produce regulations on rodenticides and would remove rats from his mind for a moment if that is possible and allow him to concentrate simply on the other things where he said that regulations might be desirable would he be able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is important to note however that there is a conflict between the importance of farmers in this country having access to chemicals which are cheaper on the continent if they are exactly the same as chemicals cleared in this country and safety if the products are not identical <e> <s> the amendment to some extent goes round this question by simply leaving it in the amendment unanswered by saying that a chemical which is safe may be imported in seven days <e> <s> the question is how do you determine whether it is safe <e> <s> how do you know it is safe <e> <s> if it is an identical product in every respect there is no problem <e>", "<cs> with a view to speeding matters up and as both noble lords have touched on the availability of pesticides for minor crops i should like to say a few words about my amendment no <e> <s> a and then i shall not need to delay the committee when we reach it in the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord the minister referred to me perhaps i may make this point <e> <s> the difference between what the noble lord said about farmers and growers themselves having access and what my amendment suggests which is that manufacturers should be obliged to do it is not so much the difference between a voluntary scheme and a compulsory scheme but the difference between farmers and growers paying the costs of obtaining the clearance and under my amendment the manufacturers paying the costs <e> <s> surely that is the distinction that we need to bear in mind <e>", "<cs> as i understand it there is such a licensing scheme and training of operators in the united states and canada which works well <e> <s> this was one of the recommendations of the royal commission on environmental pollution which while recognising the high standard of operator efficiency on farms in the united kingdom recommended that a training and licensing system should be introduced to ensure that those high <e>", "<cs> i have two amendments down on the same point amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> needless to say my noble friend lord john-mackie and my noble friend lady nicol have a better amendment so i shall not be moving my two amendments when we get to them <e> <s> i strongly support their amendment <e> <s> the answer to the noble earl is that if the government were taking a much more stringent look at pesticides for which some of us have been arguing throughout the course of this bill so far they may not need to make use of this <e> <s> but they are going to be approving a number of things which will be very dangerous <e> <s> they will be dangerous if people happen to be standing under an aeroplane which is spraying them and they will be dangerous for the operators <e>", "<cs> i believe it is the intention to take my amendment no <e> <s> with this amendment according to the note which the noble lord the minister sent round <e> <s> if so i am happy to agree and it might be for the convenience of your lordships if i speak to it now <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for taking such trouble to respond to my amendment in particular and needless to say to the debate as a whole <e> <s> however having listened to his comments on my amendment no <e> <s> which dealt with footpaths in a very general way and having heard him say that it was not nearly clear or specific enough and having now heard him say that this amendment is too clear and too specific the noble lord will excuse me for feeling slightly confused about the governments line in dealing with amendments to this bill <e> <s> i am even more confused when we bear in mind that the noble lord suggested that my amendment was not liberal enough because it did not go so far as the united states legislation <e> <s> i was trying as the noble lord rightly said to be realistic <e> <s> when it comes to disclosing information i do not think that this government are going to be as liberal as the united states government <e> <s> it would be foolish for any of us to pretend that they will be <e> <s> therefore it seemed sensible to pitch an amendment rather below the highest standards being set by the united states government <e>", "<cs> my name is down to this amendment and i think that the minister has given us a very helpful reply <e> <s> i want to ask him one question because i may have missed what he said <e> <s> he intends to publish guidance notes under the regulations setting out the tests that would be appropriate <e> <s> what would be the status of that guidance note document or whatever it will be <e> <s> would it be the case that in practice people submitting pesticides for clearance would have had to have taken them through the tests set out in the document <e>", "<cs> i have given the noble lord notice of two matters which i should like to raise briefly <e> <s> both have been raised during the course of debates on amendments to clause but in none of those cases have we been able to spend any time on the specific points i have in mind <e> <s> first i will deal with the question of research <e> <s> in a number of amendments noble lords have stressed the importance of research into future alternatives to current pesticides of research which aims to reduce the level of pesticides and reduce dependence on pesticides and so on <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for going at least some way with part of the amendment <e> <s> in particular i very strongly support his view that there is something to be said for restrictions on the use of a pesticide once it is cleared being made clear in the advertisement <e> <s> it does seem to me extremely undesirable in this field that advertisements should appear with general injunctions to wipe out and kill everything without any mention being made of restrictions particularly when they become statutory placed on the pesticides use <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that response <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the words used in the psps as the general objectives have considerable attractions <e> <s> whether they cover all the points is something that it would be useful to examine between now and report stage <e> <s> i hope that the government may be able to give us some advance warning as report stage is some way away about their intentions and whether they plan to produce an amendment on objectives <e> <s> but i am still very pleased to hear that the noble lord is in favour of this <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure from the farmers point of view that it is tremendously desirable that all food which is not marked pesticide free should be assumed by consumers to have pesticide residues in it and to some extent that seems to me the effect of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i would like to consider that again before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> but i am grateful to him for his assurance on the first part of my amendment no <e> <s> and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the only area where the noble lord did not make himself clear was on the likely future of adas and i am afraid that is something which is going to continue to hang over the agricultural industry for a while <e> <s> is it or is it not going to be another candidate for a british telecom type of sell-off <e> <s> that raises in my mind another point which i would put to the noble lord <e> <s> most farms were already on the telephone before british telecom was in private hands and it was possible for somebody to ring up and make an appointment <e> <s> the noble lord may know something about rural phone services which the rest of us do not and it may be that in future the only way of contacting most people in the countryside will be by going to see them as those sorts of phone services disappear <e> <s> but i take the noble lords general stricture that this is not a particularly desirable amendment and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but i do not think that that is an adequate reply to what seems to me to be a very serious and continuing problem <e> <s> i entirely accept what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has said about the need to change the amendment so that the individual organisations listed here could not act individually and that there should be some such phrase as ministers after consultation <e>", "<cs> again i will look at the question of potential for misuse <e> <s> i think that the noble lord may well have a good point there in saying that the amendment is drawn too widely <e> <s> i am quite happy to refer to the wildlife and countryside act at great length if the noble lord wants me to and i am well aware that there are powers in that act which make these incidents illegal <e> <s> i said right from the start that this was the illegal use of particular chemicals <e> <s> i do not think that the committee would like a long dissertation on the efficacy of the wildlife and countryside act at this time of night and with respect the noble lord should not tempt me onto that ground because i am all too easily tempted <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment if only because i think it would establish an extremely desirable precedent although i am not sure that it is one that the two noble lords who put their names to the amendment really want to establish <e> <s> as i said on an earlier amendment it is a fact that in some european countries and in particular west germany and denmark there are much stricter controls on pesticides and far fewer products available to the farmer than there are in this country in other words we already enjoy as farmers considerable advantages over some of our european competitors <e>", "<cs> we are having a statutory scheme which is going to be almost wholly reliant on an advisory committee the acp which is going to carry out all the testing issue the approvals be the body which gives advice to the government on the whole range of the way that these statutory procedures will work and indeed now possibly as a result of the noble lords response to amendment no <e> <s> a actually be referred to in the legislation as a body which there will be a duty on ministers to consult <e> <s> surely it is pretty strange for that body not to be a statutory body <e>", "<cs> i strongly oppose the amendment <e> <s> even at this time of night for the noble lord lord stanley to try and get away with a suggestion that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the latest figures for swans on the thames show a continuing decline in the population and continuing very high levels of lead and deaths from lead poisoning <e> <s> will he acknowledge that the reply to his noble friend sitting behind him that anglers are not buying the available substitutes which as he correctly said are available at the a same price takes us inescapably to the conclusion that the government must legislate to ban the use of lead weights by anglers <e> <s> will they do this immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my question about the population of swans on the thames <e> <s> can he also say what evidence if any the government have to suggest that the effect of voluntary banning of lead weights by anglers is working <e> <s> all the evidence that i have seen suggests that it is not working and that the government will have to legislate <e> <s> the sooner they do so the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment <e> <s> indeed i have had more forceful support for my amendment than i gave it myself in introducing it <e> <s> i hope that this has shown the noble lord lord belstead that it had nothing to do with the time of night at which he gave his answer in committee but rather that there is continuing considerable unease about aerial spraying felt on all sides of the house and particularly by the general public <e> <s> i am sure that this is a matter to which we shall return as the bill progresses towards the statute book <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving the clear assurance that he did <e> <s> i hope that he accepts that an assurance in answer to a question is never quite as clear cut as an assurance given in reply to an amendment on the marshalled list which covers all the issues that i wanted to be sure were covered by existing powers in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to welcome very much the amendments which the government have put down on this subject <e> <s> rather than reiterate the points that have already been made i should like to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> b which my noble friends on the front bench have put down and to which the noble lord lord belstead addressed himself in moving this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment as i did at the committee stage <e> <s> i am sorry for not chasing up the noble lord for the letter i was expecting from him but i hope he will appreciate that a number of items have arrived from the government rather late in the day for this report stage <e> <s> i make no complaint about that because many of these have been welcome amendments from the government but it has made it difficult to check what answers have been received from the government and what amendments the government are to put down for report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise one question with the minister <e> <s> while having some sympathy as a <e>", "<cs> my lords i also hope that the minister will take another look at this matter <e> <s> in what he has said about the amendment so far he has drawn our attention to the wording of amendment no <e> <s> a where it states that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the idea behind the amendment <e> <s> i agree very much with what the noble lord lord northbourne has said about the importance of somebody taking a creative role in this process <e> <s> it seems to me that that has been somewhat lacking in recent years <e> <s> the very slow and difficult progress which cda spraying has made would illustrate that and the very real fears which the noble lord lord stanley of alderley has expressed more than once about the prospects for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment <e> <s> i strongly agree with what my <e>", "<cs> my lords as somebody who also joined at some length in these debates at committee stage i should like to welcome the government amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead may not be surprised to hear that i do not entirely agree with the noble earl lord onslow that the balance is now exactly right but the government have taken a significant and important step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow that argument which the noble lord has made previously this <e>", "<cs> my lords no i will not press the amendment <e> <s> i should like to make two points if i may <e> <s> i accept that it would be sensible to operate some system of this sort through the statutory body <e> <s> but the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord belstead has been very helpful <e> <s> i agree with his arguments and those of the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> it would probably be counter-productive to insist on every advertisement containing every single restriction <e> <s> it would detract from the importance of the significant kinds of restriction that the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> that sounds to me a sensible argument <e> <s> i am grateful for the positive response to both questions that i asked <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have not had an opportunity to take part in earlier debates on this bill which i regret because i was a member of the select committee <e> <s> i felt very strongly that the provision for winding up charities was wrong in principle <e> <s> it seemed to me that the important part of a charitable gift was that it was going to last in perpetuity and we would be justified in interfering with that in only the most exceptional circumstances <e> <s> i was persuaded by colleagues on the select committee that for a number of reasons we would be justified in including the clause which is in the bill allowing such a winding up and the spending of capital but only for cases where the amount of money to be spent was very small <e>", "<cs> does not that underline the fears that have been expressed not only on this series of amendments but earlier and does it not contradict everything that the noble earl lord gowrie had to say when he spoke from the front bench about future funding <e> <s> if the government are abolishing the glc because it is giving too much money to repair and maintain the historic buildings and churches of london should they not say so instead of just sitting on the front bench and smiling and nodding enthusiastically when the noble viscount says that that is the case <e> <s> if they are going to let historic buildings in london collapse should they not have the courage to say so <e>", "<cs> surely the amendment is not trying to tell the commission how to spend its money but telling the government how much money to give the commission so that this valuable work can continue <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> he said that the additional work the commission will have to undertake will be taken into account when the government come to determine the resource needs for <e> <s> as i understand it that is what concerns my noble friend lady birk and certainly it concerns me that sufficient resources should then be made available to the commission to ensure that it is able to maintain the excellent work that the glc has done in this field <e> <s> to know whether or not the government are likely to do that surely parliament needs to know whether or not the government believe that the level of resources which the glc has allocated to this work in london in recent years is about right <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the noble lord on this matter <e> <s> however the same topic will arise on a range of other amendments to which we shall come later in the bill and no doubt later this evening <e> <s> i did not ask the noble lord to commit the government to a particular level of expenditure under a particular head in and i would not expect him to do so <e> <s> with respect i asked the noble lord a quite different question <e> <s> i asked him whether the government believe that the level of expenditure which the glc has committed to this area of activity in recent years is about right or whether it is extravagant <e> <s> that is the question i asked <e>", "<cs> with respect the minister is plain wrong <e> <s> this is not a local responsibility <e> <s> these are national sites sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> they have been notified by the nature conservancy council as sites of national scientific importance <e> <s> as the noble lord will be aware the nature conservancy council draws up lists of damaging operations which landowners farmers and occupiers of sites of special interest are not allowed to carry out because of the national importance of these sites <e> <s> it seems to me that one of the things which should be added to this list of damaging operations is the local government bill because the noble lord is in effect saying that this bill can lead to the destruction of these sites and the government will not do anything about it <e> <s> surely that is just plain wrong <e>", "<cs> that is helpful because it is taking us forward <e> <s> can the noble lord just tell us what consultations have been carried out by the government with the local authorities who will become the landowners of these sites <e> <s> he seems now to be slightly going away from what he said earlier about a consortia of local boroughs and leading boroughs and so on <e> <s> i think that is a nonsense as the noble lord lord beaumont has already said <e> <s> but if we are talking now about new landowners taking on important national assets surely what the committee needs to know is what consultations have been undertaken with these landowners <e> <s> have they agreed to take on these important national sites <e> <s> i assume that the government have some undertaking about the future management of these sites and that we can be assured they will be protected and that the wildlife there will not be destroyed <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that there is not a single site of special scientific interest owned by the glc which will be going to a borough which is prepared to talk to the government <e> <s> i find that stretching things a little <e>", "<cs> that simply cannot be right with respect <e> <s> i am sorry to keep on because i know everybody wants to get on to the main amendment in the name of the noble lord lord chelwood but i do not think we should leave it there if the noble lord is just giving us some information which cannot be correct <e> <s> one of the sites listed in my amendment frays farm and denham wood straddles the greater london boundary and a part of it will become the responsibility of buckinghamshire county council <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that it is impossible for him to talk to buckinghamshire county council <e>", "<cs> we have strayed rather wide from the terms of my amendment following i hope the noble lord will forgive me for saying so his lead rather than mine because i restricted my remarks to sites of special scientific interest and to these ones in particular <e> <s> we have strayed into a field which i am afraid we shall cover in later and more widely drafted amendments and i shall not follow the noble lord into that field <e> <s> but i still think that there are very real problems here <e> <s> i do not know what the governments relationship was like with buckinghamshire county council before this evening but i would guess that it will not improve a great deal when the county council hear that the noble lord finds it quite impossible to talk to them <e> <s> hillingdon district council is the other council involved in that site <e> <s> once again i am not sure what relationships were like previously but i dare say that they have not improved a great deal during the course of this debate <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> may i ask what the governments intention is on this <e> <s> as i understand it we are due to rise in five minutes and i just wonder whether it would not do this series of amendments greater justice if the noble lord lord chelwood could be persuaded to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we could then resume the debate when the house is again in committee on this bill on amendment no <e> <s> and the subsequent amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be aware that it is not unusual in the natural world for a succession of unlikely events to take place <e> <s> did the government ask advice from their statutory advisers the nature conservancy council about the introduction of the clams <e> <s> secondly is he able to assure the house that information about alien species of this sort which may introduce serious damage to commercial and other fisheries and other interests in the countryside is made readily available to those who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be able to answer the second part of my question <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case may i ask the noble lord a second question <e> <s> i was trying to save time <e> <s> is it possible for the noble lord to assure the house that information about the release of alien species of this sort which may be damaging to sport fishing and other interests is made readily available to those with interests in the subject <e>", "<cs> it might also be convenient if with this group of amendments we also discuss my amendment no <e> <s> za which covers very much the same ground <e> <s> it would save our having separate debates on that later <e>", "<cs> as i will not be moving amendment no <e> <s> za perhaps i may make one or two remarks before the noble lord lord chelwood withdraws this amendment <e> <s> all of us will be grateful for the positive way that the noble lord looked at the future of the ecology unit <e> <s> i did not say anything about that in my own speech because it was touched on by others <e> <s> all of us very greatly admire the expertise built up in the greater london council ecology unit and the magnificent work done in practice not only in giving advice but also in many other ways <e> <s> indeed i believe that the noble lord mentioned the british trust for conservation volunteers a recipient of grant aid from the glc whose work in london will be decimated if that grant aid does not continue <e> <s> that is something we will have a chance of debating later in the bill <e>", "<cs> i want to say a word on one aspect of this that concerns the glc land holdings in the green belt <e> <s> noble lords who have spoken so far have tended to underestimate the scale and the urgency of the problem <e> <s> there was an article in <e>", "<cs> if the

where the countryside meets those developments that all ofus feel we want to keep it countryside we want to keep it green <e> <s> i cannot believe the noble lord really thinks that a whole load of tin shacks and bedsteads and a few horses grazing in a field are particularly productive to this country or to anyone else <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is going to leave that point may i just ask him two questions because he did not deal with the matter of land which falls vacant as tenanted farm land inevitably does over the passage of time <e> <s> i wonder whether the categorical answer he gave to the noble lord lord harmar <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sorry to prolong this discussion but i understand that for example so far as the glcs land in the green belt is concerned most of it lies outside the glcs own area and it will revert to neighbouring county councils <e> <s> surely the financial argument which the noble lord has just used does not apply in those cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> the noble lord said that negotiations had only broken down in one area but he failed to mention the scilly isles where my understanding is that things have also reached an impasse <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to follow the noble lord lord skelmersdale into a more party <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord implying that this growth is a bad thing which should not have happened <e> <s> that is what he seemed to be saying

<s> i must say that during this debate and on previous occasions during our discussions on this bill i have had to pinch myself to remind myself that we are not debating a second reading in another place and that the bill has been all the way through another place and through a second reading in your lordships house and is now getting very close to the statute book <e> <s> what we have had from the government on crucially important issues of this nature is still to my mind incredibly vague extremely uncertain and not at all carefully thought out <e> <s> the discussion which the noble lord has just had with the noble lord lord tordoff seems to me to underline the situation <e> <s> we have crucial scientific and technical services and we are still not clear whether we are talking about them or research what the london boroughs association are on about and so on <e> <s> i think that the noble lord should be surprised that any of us has managed to convince himself that we are actually taking part in a debate at a very late stage in the passage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i listened to what the noble lord lord elton had to say about that <e> <s> indeed the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who spoke from behind the noble lord urged me to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> of course i shall study what was said in <e>", "<cs> my concern and this is a serious point is that it will not just be the noble lord who will be staying out of the laboratory in future but the scientists and technicians employed by the glc and the metropolitan counties who will be leaving the laboratories in their droves and going to work elsewhere <e> <s> the exact outcome which your lordships select committee feared will come about <e> <s> it seems to me that that is a shameful way in which to treat what your lordships select committee quite rightly described as centres of scientific and technical excellence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my honourable friend in another place who moved this clause at report stage there will warmly welcome what has been said about the clause <e> <s> i would simply express the hope that once the bill becomes law the police forces up and down the country will work even more closely with the voluntary organisations involved such as in particular the county naturalists trusts and the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals to prosecute people who are breaking the law and who are illegally digging up badger setts and torturing and <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the arguments put forward both for and against the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may deal with one argument which the noble lord lord burton raised <e> <s> he suggested that there would <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with that <e> <s> i hope there is a constructive suggestion which the government will take away and think about <e> <s> the fundamental cause of the difficulty seems to be that on the one side the crofters and landowners in parts of the country particularly in the west of scotland believe that golden eagles do a great deal of economic damage to their agricultural interests <e> <s> the scientific evidence that i have seen in particular a recent research project carried out at the institute of terrestrial ecology in scotland tends to show that economic losses due to predators whether foxes or golden eagles are very small indeed compared with the huge losses that occur through natural losses of lambs on the whole i would say to the noble earl lord onslow caused by over-stocking rather than under-stocking the areas concerned <e>", "<cs> we should not be sidetracked into arguments about species which are not in schedule to the wildlife and countryside act and that covers carrion crows and foxes <e> <s> i believe it is right to say that the area where that research was done did have a reasonable population of golden eagles <e> <s> as far as i know the results as far as that species is concerned have not been challenged <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there were no losses but their numbers paled into insignifiance compared with the losses suffered as a result of poor husbandry bad weather and overstocking <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord leaves the matter of this alleged remark by a member of the nature conservancy councils staff will he deal with the comment made by his noble friend behind him to the effect that golden eagles will be illegally killed if some change of policy is not adopted by the government <e> <s> that is an altogether more serious question and it was a remark that all of us heard whereas the other comment was simply alleged to have been made <e>", "<cs> i am afraid to say to the noble lord lord burton once again that i am not all that happy with the proposed amendment to the bill <e> <s> perhaps i may explain the two reasons why i would hope your lordships committee will not agree to its inclusion in the bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make one more point about the nccs contact with owners and occupiers <e> <s> in consultation with the ncc about amendments to which we shall come in a minute it is my understanding that they have had to drop the explanatory letter the more informal chatty letter which they have sent to farmers and landowners in the past because of the loss of two court cases in recent months <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for letting me say a word about the amendment <e> <s> i am delighted we have reached an amendment which as sponsor of the bill i should be happy to see in the bill <e> <s> it was in a slightly lengthier form in the bill which received a second reading in another place <e>", "<cs> i should like to raise a similar question of resources at the ncc with the possibility of the ncc at least starting the basic research work in the marine conservation review that i mentioned <e> <s> i was not trying to equate that with the limited experiment involving scallop dredging but i should have thought that if the government are going to show everyone that they are determined that real progress should be made in this field the starting of the marine conservation review must be a major priority <e> <s> it would be helpful if we had some commitment from the <e>", "<cs> i am sure that all noble lords who are concerned with this amendment will no doubt decide for themselves what to do about it <e> <s> there are one or two points i should like to address to them rather than to the government <e> <s> first of all i hope that at this stage they will not press the amendment to a <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend might consider that if negotiations really have only just begun which i believe is the case in respect of one or two of these reserves they have begun because of the possibility of the law being amended and that surely makes the case for the amendment just as well as if the talks had been going on for four or five years <e> <s> i do not honestly think that my noble friend can find an escape clause for the government either way <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may stress the importance of clearing up what appears to be yet another major loophole in the act because according to a recent written answer in another place of the sites previously notified under the national parks and access to the countryside act the ncc has so far renotified only under the wildlife and countryside act so that it has a very large number of renotifications still to carry out although as the noble lord told us earlier it is hoped substantially what that means no one seems clear to complete the process by the end of next year <e> <s> but if the ncc has to deliver each notification personally with somebody there as a witness and if as the noble earl lord peel said some areas of common land have to be renotified as sssis there may be very large numbers of people holding commoners rights all of whom will have to be approached personally by two ncc staff <e> <s> the position will be impossible and the target for finishing renotification will recede not just towards the end of this century but well into the next <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> first are the government entirely confident that the extra administrative burden which the new procedures will involve can be managed <e> <s> anybody not returning a reply slip acknowledging receipt of a letter will have to be visited by two people personally which seems to me in any event to be a great shame because the ncc staff resources will once again be diverted into formal legalistic procedures rather than what all of us on both sides of the committee particularly if i may say so noble lords behind the noble lord lord skelmersdale appear to want which is the ncc spending more time talking informally with farmers and landowners and improving relations locally <e> <s> that clearly will be less easy <e>", "<cs> another alternative would be to accept this amendment and then the staff would not have to do any extra work <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is i believe right in saying that the wording of the amendment is not as strong as it should be <e> <s> indeed it is not as strong as the wording that was contained in the bill of my <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment if he is going to do so may i return to the swavesey case <e> <s> i know it is difficult to concentrate on a particular case but it is important to try to get home to the noble lord if we can why a number of us think that a duty of this sort would make a real difference <e> <s> as the noble lord says there were no objections at the public inquiry <e> <s> the nature conservancy council did not enter formal objections <e> <s> what the nature <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be right in saying that in theory this provision already exists but in practice i am afraid matters do not work out quite like that <e> <s> i was recently in scotland looking at abernethy a grade site of special scientific interest <e> <s> it includes the rspbs loch garten reserve which in turn includes the famous osprey tree and the nest which has been seen by hundreds of thousands indeed nearly a million visitors over the years <e> <s> in that caledonian pine forest that sssi i saw an area which has recently been clear felled by thompson forestry with permission given by the forestry commission and not only that the area subsequently has been drained right up to the edge of the site <e> <s> this is a grade site of special scientific interest <e> <s> it is a grade nature conservation review site which makes it if anything more important scientifically and it looks like part of a battlefield from the first world war <e> <s> and this has been done not just after discussion with the forestry commission hut as i understand it with their active support <e> <s> and that is not the only part of the abernethy sssi which has been destroyed in that way with the agreement and support and in some cases grant-aid from the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> if any of the facts that i have given about abernethy or salcey forest are inaccurate i am happy to be corrected by the noble lord <e> <s> i can assure him from my personal knowledge that what i have said about the attitude of the conservation bodies to the broad-leafed review which the forestry commission are carrying out is in fact their attitude <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to contradict that i am happy to give way to him <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i was pre-judging the actual policy <e> <s> what i was saying was that the conservation bodies are very unhappy about the way in which consultations have been carried out <e> <s> the noble lord is right to say that the seminar was held recently but he may also know that a number of conservation bodies who commented to the forestry commission on the proposals were excluded <e> <s> it is an unfortunate fact that the forestry commission chose to exclude those organisations which happened to have made some of the most critical comments on the proposal <e> <s> the noble lord is shaking his head <e> <s> if he <e>", "<cs> while the noble lord is sitting down may i make another point that at creag meggiadh in <e>", "<cs> i do not know what one office of the nature conservancy council did or did not do but the fact is that the nature conservancy council nationally consistently opposed any conifer planting on that site of special scientific interest as they were bound to do it seems to me under the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> it seems to me very undesirable that one publicly-funded body should be giving permission in effect to destroy a site of scientific interest which leaves another public body the nature conservancy council having to spend even more public money to prevent that planting taking place <e> <s> that is in fact what the result was of the forestry commissions agreement for some of it to be planted <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord to confirm one thing <e> <s> i know your lordships want to get on to other business <e> <s> the noble lord said the amendment and i take it he means the whole of the amendment adds nothing to the existing law <e> <s> i am not asking any trick question <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment and make two points <e> <s> it appears that the most favoured body so far as the government are concerned to take over the running of the heath is the city of london <e> <s> i would have to say to the noble lord lord elton that if that is the case it will meet with fierce resistance and fierce resistance based on practical experience of the ability of the city of london to manage areas of a similar character <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord to get something clear <e> <s> he said in that quotation of the noble lord lord moyne that the house and the park should be vested in a single authority <e> <s> can the noble lord say what he was referring to in the term park <e> <s> is that the ground fenced by the lcc the ground that was originally granted with house or the heath plus house as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness not recognise that all the experts who have looked at this matter say that by the time the government have got round to reaching a multilateral agreement if such agreement is possible at all there will be no fish stocks left to conserve or economically manage <e> <s> do not the government have to take immediate unilateral action to prevent what is currently a major ecological disaster and a major economic disaster for this country and the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> it has gone some way to reassuring me about the matters i wanted to raise <e> <s> i still have one concern which is the first point i mentioned over the ability of district councils which i understand will become responsible for these activities when the mccs are abolished to undertake the task <e> <s> after all in other areas it will be the county council as highway authority which would normally take on this responsibility rather than the district council or in some cases the job might be transferred to the district councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord was right in the second part of what he said that the district councils do it in some areas where the county council transfers the obligation to them rather than doing it itself <e> <s> it is possible but that would be in places where the district council showed some willingness and expertise <e> <s> however they will not have any choice in the matter in areas where the mccs are abolished <e> <s> that is my concern given the good record that many metropolitan councils have on dealing with footpath matters and speedily responding to complaints or requests for help from the public <e> <s> indeed in some cases they actively encourage members of the public to come to them with worries and concerns about footpaths and rights of way <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank those noble lords who mentioned by honourable friend dr david clarke who promoted the bill in another place and on whom almost the entire burden of work and it has been an enormous amount of work has fallen as a result of the bill going through parliament <e> <s> he certainly deserves the thanks that have been given to him <e> <s> i should also like to thank the interests which came together to provide the initial suggestions for the contents of the bill and some of the drafting help particularly the voluntary wildlife animal welfare and landscape conservation bodies the national farmers union and the country landowners association all of whom played a big part in helping my honourable friend to introduce the bill and to get it now to this stage and on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house whether in the light of the exchanges we have had so far today the new policy which he announced recently of only one supplementary question being asked at question time and only one question being answered by ministers on the front bench has been subsequently changed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the particular concern that has been expressed about the possible plans to privatise the water industry <e> <s> will he agree that in that area particular safeguards will be needed to safeguard the countryside and wildlife <e>", "<cs> my lords it is nice to have agreement from the noble lord <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed to him <e> <s> two things that he said gave me a great deal of encouragement <e> <s> first i think he said that he had no reason to believe that the successor authorities would not wish the ecological services provided by the g lc and the other metropolitan counties to continue <e> <s> that matter has been subject to considerable debate as the noble lord lord chelwood pointed out as the bill has been going through your lordships house and indeed another place <e> <s> i am sure that if there were any reasons for the successor authorities not to wish the services to continue the government would have heard about them by now so what the noble lord said must be encouraging <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the emphasis that the noble lord has placed on the views of the priorities board can he say what consultations the board has had with environmental interests either with the governments statutory advisers the ncc or the countryside commission or with voluntary organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is widespread concern within the agricultural industry and among environmental interests that the priorities board is not being very forthcoming in looking for outside views and asking other interests to comment on the issues that it is considering or indeed in telling people what issues it is considering <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a little unrealistic given our experience with terrestrial species such as mink and coypu to make the assumption that species will not escape when they are being kept for commercial purposes <e> <s> should not the nature conservancy council therefore be asked to issue a licence in every case whether the purpose is to release them into the wild or to keep them for farming purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is anything left for me to say except to thank my noble friend and the noble lord lord skelmersdale for the welcome they have given to the bill <e> <s> i hope with my noble friend that it will reach the statute book in the very near future <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the other noble lords who voted for the amendment may i say to the noble viscount the leader of the house that we spent seven minutes on each of the preceding three questions and have spent about two minutes on the substantive point of this question <e> <s> while the feelings of the house as a whole have clearly to be respected so i would suggest have those of a small minority who happen to be involved in this particular question <e>", "<cs> my lords two minutes on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i also welcome the bill and i warmly congratulate the government on introducing it <e> <s> it has taken a great deal of courage and determination not least by david mellor <e> <s> i think that all of us should be congratulating the government as indeed all speakers have so far and i add my congratulations to the noble viscount lord allenby on his maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to make a point about this matter as well <e> <s> one centre may contain a large number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong what the noble lord has to say but i was recently told by a reputable pharmaceutical company that the ld test was not used by pharmaceutical companies at all any more <e> <s> therefore i was surprised to hear the noble lord give the example of anti-cancer drugs as an area where it was needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be grateful if the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> he would have heard my noble friend lord stoddart who was a member of the joint committee and other noble lords state quite clearly that two officials from either house had to decide whether the general petition could be referred to the joint committee <e> <s> the officials of both houses decided that the general petition could be so referred <e> <s> is he now saying that the officials of both houses were wrong in that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to something said by the noble earl lord caithness at the start of the debate a long time ago now which struck me if i may say to him with respect as being particularly silly <e> <s> he suggested to my noble friends on the front bench on this side of the house that because the labour government had proposed the southern route in it was absurd for this side of the house not to continue to support it <e> <s> it struck me as unfair just because he happens to be a member of a government who are well known for pursuing out-of-date and discredited policies that he should expect others to do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for those remarks and i listened carefully when similar things were said earlier but they do not seem to me to answer the question <e> <s> if this was a matter of national policy the secretary of state should not have used the procedure that he did <e> <s> as far as i am aware he did not say at any stage during the procedures that were the joint committee to come to the decision that it did the government would immediately overrule it <e> <s> if the noble earl wants to interrupt again to contradict me i shall gladly give way but he does not because the secretary of state did not say that <e> <s> he never made the position clear to the petitioners the joint committee or anybody else <e> <s> in my view he deliberately misled all those involved from both houses of parliament and all the petitioners who went to great trouble and very great expense for which to my mind the secretary of state is responsible in going through a lengthy and as it turns out totally meaningless and useless procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give way and the noble earl can correct me if he wants to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl said that the secretary of state took the view when he first tried to restrict the basis on which the petitions were made to the joint committee that a matter of national policy was at stake in other words that it was a matter of national policy that the bypass round okehampton went to the south of the town rather than to the north <e> <s> the noble earl has nodded confirming that view <e> <s> that means that the secretary of state intended to introduce this sort of bill right from the start to overrule the joint committee were it to come to the conclusion that it did because a matter of national policy was at stake <e> <s> that indeed is the only basis on which the government could even presume to try to justify the miserable procedure on which they have embarked <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> the noble earl has taken up about half of the eight minutes i have been speaking for but i am happy to respond <e> <s> the facts i believe are that the secretary of state for transport and the government did not realise that there was a chance of the select committee considering a general petition <e> <s> i am convinced that up to that point they thought that there would be a petition on the narrow issue of public open space <e> <s> that would go one way or another but nevertheless the bypass would go to the south of the town <e> <s> but as the noble earl says it was in their mind all the time as a matter of national policy to quote him that the road should go to the south of okehampton <e> <s> what upset the apple cart from the governments point of view was that the authorities in both houses allowed a general petition to be made to the joint committee <e> <s> at that stage if there had been a spark of decency in the secretary of state for transport he would have stood up immediately in parliament and said right we must stop this <e> <s> the government will overrule the joint committee if they come down in favour of a route to <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will remember as those who are sitting behind him and were not in the chamber at the time will not that i was interrupted twice by a member of the government front bench during my speech <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for the courtesy he has shown in giving way something not shown by those behind him <e> <s> the noble lord has not yet said what the question of government policy of national principle was which the secretary of state for transport had in his mind when he first made representations to the authorities in both houses and that was the issue i raised with him <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble viscount a question about this amendment because i must say that i find difficulty in following the english of the new paragraph <e>", "<cs> i certainly shall not press the amendment and i take note of what the noble lord says that the amendment goes much wider than i had intended <e> <s> i shall study what the noble lord has said it would seem to me to contain some good sense <e> <s> if necessary i shall come back to it <e> <s> however i suspect that the noble lord has satisfied me <e>", "<cs> if i might try to help my noble friend i was glad to hear him say that he felt this should be left to the home secretary because presumably he would agree that this fact should appear in the guide-lines which i think i am right in saying it does not at the moment at least explicitly <e> <s> also if i may say so to my noble friend while his objection may apply to amendment no <e> <s> i do not think it applies to no <e> <s> where what the secretary of state is required to do is to satisfy himself as to competence and not experience <e>", "<cs> if i may pursue the same point before the noble lord replies it seems to me that there is a much stronger argument and one with which the noble lord did not deal for putting a reference in the guidelines if only to tell people applying for a personal licence or for a project licence that if they intend to carry out procedures where anaesthesia will be necessary particularly on primates cats or dogs in cases which will be complex then that is something about which the home secretary will require some information <e> <s> surely that would be useful <e> <s> in my brief intervention earlier i said that i had not as yet been able to find anything in the guidelines which refers particularly to this and it would be helpful if there was something there <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i strongly oppose the amendment <e> <s> i should like first of all to echo what the noble earl lord selkirk said <e> <s> the amendment does not talk of excluding simply sixth forms or sixth form colleges but all secondary schools that is children from the age of upwards presumably <e> <s> secondly a number of noble lords who have spoken in support of the amendment have at least implied that this will discriminate against some children as opposed to others <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the bill will apply to all young people going to university <e> <s> they will not have had the opportunity of carrying out the procedures which would be governed by the bill <e> <s> they will all he in the same position <e> <s> it will not discriminate against some people as against others <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord really mean to say that children whether in a public school or a state school would be undertaking such work themselves <e> <s> the amendment deals with the use of live animals for the purposes of education or training <e> <s> unless there happens to be an year-old teacher in a sixth form it will not be people of that age who will be doing such work if it is a case of the use of animals in training <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount said that this procedure was used only very rarely i believe once every few years were his words <e> <s> can he tell us when a judge last granted a licence or whatever it is a judge grants so that an animal could be used for forensic purposes <e> <s> can the noble viscount also indicate how long before that a licence was granted <e> <s> is it every two or three years every seven or eight years or how long <e>", "<cs> i think that we are in danger of getting confused <e> <s> with respect the noble lord is not supporting my amendment but amendment no <e> <s> which is on a different point <e> <s> my amendment does not cover alternative means of experimentation or investigation <e> <s> it deals with experimentation or investigation which is designed to produce a product where an alternative product already exists <e> <s> i suggest that it is quite a different point from the point covered in amendments nos <e> <s> or <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is perpetuating something that my noble friend said <e> <s> the quotation that i gave i thought that i had stated this clearly was from the medicines division of the department of health and social security <e> <s> i was not quoting my own views <e> <s> i am quite happy to give the noble lord the reference to the quotation <e> <s> it appears in a paper written for the british journal of clinical pharmacology vol pages to by a mr mrs or miss griffin and diggle <e> <s> that is what i was quoting <e> <s> it is my understanding that those individuals work for the department of health and social security <e>", "<cs> i should like to make another point before the noble lord replies <e> <s> i was rather unhappy about his first reply to the amendment <e> <s> i share the view of the noble lord lord beaumont that he had not taken into account if i may say so the words take into account in the amendment <e> <s> i was not suggesting that it would be impossible for someone to produce a similar or indeed identical product but simply that this was a factor that the secretary of state should take into account when weighing the benefit of developing the new product or a similar or identical product against the disbenefit to the animals that the product will have to be tested on <e> <s> i should have thought that this was a different point to that on which the noble lord responded <e>", "<cs> that is neither the intention nor the effect of the amendment <e> <s> the amendment says that the secretary of state should not take into account what other companies are doing in research but what other products are already available in addition to the product on which the research application is made <e> <s> so it is quite a different point from the one that the noble lord raised <e> <s> in any event the amendment if i may repeat myself for the third time i think does not suggest that the secretary of state may not issue licences for that purpose but simply says that the secretary of state should take into account the availability of already existing products when determining an application of this sort <e> <s> that is quite a different point <e>", "<cs> it is not but this bill places the duty on the secretary of state to do just that in the case of every project licence application a matter which was covered in some detail at second reading <e> <s> the secretary of state has to weigh up the relative benefits of the proposed research or testing as against the effect on the animals <e> <s> that is something which i strongly welcomed about the bill at second reading and which i should not want to see removed as apparently the noble lord lord hunter would <e> <s> i think that that is a crucial part of the bill and the package that has been put together <e>", "<cs> i did not ask the noble lord to bring back an amendment at report stage <e> <s> to be clear i asked the noble lord whether he would write to me before report stage if he takes any different view from the one which he has expressed today <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for saying that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to hear that the advisory committee are looking into this <e> <s> but as i understood what the noble lord said the advisory committee have been looking into it for some time and are due to report to the home secretary in due course <e> <s> he did not say when <e> <s> i wondered if the advisory committee will be looking into the problem in the context of the regime which would be set up under this bill where the secretary of state will have to take into account the likely benefits which will accrue from the <e>", "<cs> that is very encouraging and i look forward to seeing what the advisory committee have to say about this <e>", "<cs> we will not pursue this because i do not think that either of us are experts certainly i myself am not <e> <s> i had understood that the reduction of an animals body weight by per cent <e> <s> was a fairly standard procedure in behavioural testing and research and that there was not anything particularly unusual about it <e> <s> certainly the induction of electric shock is there <e> <s> with respect i do not think t was exaggerating <e>", "<cs> as i have said we shall not prolong it <e> <s> my understanding is different from the noble lords <e> <s> we shall both have to take advice to see who is right <e> <s> but i am grateful for the information he has given me about the advisory committee looking into this <e> <s> as i said earlier i look forward to seeing the report that they produce and the advice that they give the home secretary in due course <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was very interested to hear the noble earl say that the draize eye irritancy test is no longer in use at all and is obsolete <e> <s> it would be helpful to have that confirmed by the government <e> <s> if that is the case it is new information to me <e> <s> at second reading the noble lord lord glenarthur and i disagreed about the extent to which the ld test <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a brief word in response to something that the noble earl lord halsbury said <e> <s> at various stages today we have been in danger of rehearsing the old arguments which the noble earl knows well have been gone over many times before with a reiteration of debating points rather than a discussion of the amendments which have been put on the marshalled list <e> <s> it has happened to me and i have some sympathy with the noble lord lord beaumont because it seems to have happened to his amendment <e> <s> as i read it the noble lord lord beaumont has taken some trouble to avoid the very argument which the noble earl spent his speech developing that there are some uses for what might be called cosmetics where there is a genuine medical or psychological need for the product to be used <e> <s> he gave the example of a person with a scar across his face <e> <s> that surely is not what the amendment is aimed at or where the real argument lies <e>", "<cs> the noble earl asked the question what is beauty <e> <s> he then went on to develop the argument about scar tissue somebody with a serious injury which needed some covering up and where there was a serious medical danger of a cancer developing <e> <s> the noble earl may have asked the question what is beauty <e> <s> but he went on to talk about a medical and clinical problem <e> <s> the answer to the noble earls point is that there are many companies now which sell beauty products and which say quite openly that the products have not been involved in any animal testing in their development or safety testing and that that is seen as a selling point <e> <s> the argument put by those who oppose any remaining tests that are done is that if some companies can do this for beauty preparations why should not all of them do so <e> <s> although the noble earl may have asked an interesting question i do not think with respect that he actually addressed himself to the question which the amendment itself raises <e>", "<cs> i do not want to take up a lot of time because as my noble friend said time is short although he took up some considerable time himself <e> <s> i must say however that i very strongly objected to two remarks that he made <e> <s> first any amendments that appear in my name on the marshalled list were tabled by me on my own behalf as is the custom in this house <e> <s> none was tabled on behalf of any other interests <e> <s> if i may say so to my noble friend i resent the suggestion that the amendments might be other than in my own name <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i said in introducing the amendment although i may not have made it clear that the zoo licensing act applies to all that it defines as wild <e> <s> i have not looked up the exact definition but the words are to the effect that it applies to all animals not commonly domesticated in the <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to get into a long argument with the noble lord but i would query very strongly the use of the word happy in these circumstances on a number of bases <e> <s> however i shall not go into that <e> <s> the purposes for which animals are kept in zoos are not only for the enjoyment of the public <e> <s> indeed those who run zoos make a very strong case for saying that the primary purpose is educational and a secondary very important purpose is research <e> <s> zoos therefore are designed by those who support them for those purposes primarily and i think that it is possible to see some parallels at least with the justification for having animals in laboratories or breeding animals for laboratory use <e>", "<cs> i will study with care what the noble lord said <e> <s> i should have said in introducing the amendment i think the noble lord lord auckland made this point anyway that my understanding is that any large and reputable pharmaceutical company doing research on animals would provide -hour cover and would have available on a -hour basis when i say available i mean available on the end of a telephone not only a person responsible for the animals in that companys premises but also a qualified veterinarian <e> <s> the noble lord seemed to be saying that those standards would not necessarily be practical or be able to be applied to other establishments unless i misheard him <e>", "<cs> as i said i shall study the noble lords words <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> i may have misunderstood this but i had assumed that the words gives rise to concern implied that something was going wrong <e> <s> i had not assumed that this subsection was designed to apply in for example circumstances where it had become slightly too hot or slightly too cold in the laboratory or in the area where the animals were kept <e> <s> this provides power for somebody to come in and kill the animal <e> <s> my noble friend spoke about people on the spot putting an end to unendurable pain or distress <e> <s> i had assumed that it was circumstances of that sort for which this subsection was designed so as to allow somebody on the spot to step in immediately and deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> this is an important change to the bill and a marked improvement so i do not apologise for pursuing my amendment <e> <s> there is clearly some difference of emphasis at least between the government and my noble friend about the kind of circumstances in which the subsection might apply <e> <s> if the governments version is correct and i am not questioning it for a moment it may be that it would be unduly onerous to make the amendment to line and insist that one of the inspectors appointed under the act is notified every time somebody has cause for mild concern although i hope it will be a requirement of one of the licences i am not sure which one that the inspector is notified whenever there is cause for grave concern of the kind my noble friend spoke about a moment ago <e>", "<cs> i think i accept that point but with respect unless i am misreading this my noble friend is wrong in saying that the person responsible for day-to-day care will always know what happens <e> <s> that is what line of the amendment refers to <e> <s> it says that he <e>", "<cs> i shall read what the noble viscount has just said in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that information <e> <s> the noble lord did not deal with the problem of an overlap between establishments licensed under this bill and those licensed under the animal boarding establishments act <e> <s> i know that i did not give him notice of my question but i shall be happy if he will write to me later on this matter <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it is but perhaps i can leave the noble lord to look at this matter and if there is a problem he can write to me <e> <s> if there is not a problem the noble lord need not bother because i do not seek to make extra work <e> <s> however my understanding is that there are boarding establishments licensed under the act which breed animals which can then be sold both to the pet trade and for scientific procedures <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be difficult to know under which conditions the breeding animals are meant to be kept if they are potentially covered by two acts of parliament and two separate and possibly different codes of practice or requirements about how the animals should be kept <e> <s> that is the point i am seeking to raise <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble earl lord halsbury i appreciated that there was a cosy relationship as he i think described it between an inspector and people working in the establishment which he visits <e> <s> the inspector will go there regularly and see a number of people <e> <s> as the noble earl said he will be advising people on their project applications and so on <e> <s> it seems to me therefore that the answer to the noble lord lord glenarthur is that the secretary of state will have had the benefit of a particular <e>", "<cs> i shall consider that point <e> <s> i accept that there is some force in the argument <e> <s> i believe that there is also some force in the argument that i am putting <e> <s> it may be that given there are arguments on either side it would be sensible to leave the secretary of state free as he now is to consult any one of his inspectors and not necessarily the one the bill does not tell him to do so who works with the establishment <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord has said about applications involving training in microsurgery is welcome and deals to some extent with the second part of my amendment but not wholly <e> <s> i am afraid i am not entirely happy with what he has said about the first part <e> <s> he has suggested that to look at these applications would completely bog down the animal procedures committee <e> <s> this is a committee which will be able to set up technical sub-committees so i assume that the noble lord is saying that there are so many applications in the two categories which i have mentioned narrowly drawn as he said and i think i am quoting his own words that the animal procedures committee which has the ability to set up <e>", "<cs> no i am afraid i am not reassured but at this time of the evening i do not intend to pursue the matter any further <e> <s> however in view of what the noble lord said it is something to which i should like to come back at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i shall do so and i am very grateful to the noble lord for his positive response <e> <s> i am sorry that my use of a phrase from a government white paper and that the language of a government white paper led me into such trouble with the noble lord lord adrian and the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> i should have learned my lesson from last week when i quoted from a dhss publication and got into trouble <e> <s> what the noble lord has said is very welcome <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord just two questions <e> <s> first i have been told that there will he cases where a particular breed of dog is needed for an experiment <e> <s> it might be an unusual dog the example i was given was that of a collie and that particular breed might not be available <e> <s> there may possibly be no collies available from any of the establishments licensed under clause <e> <s> that is a limited kind of exception <e> <s> if that was the only sort of exception made under this part of clause i think the worries would be considerably allayed <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl is going to leave that particular point may i interrupt him because i thought that when the noble lord lord glenarthur referred to greyhounds it was said that greyhounds were used for a very short-term purpose and that it was possible and indeed common practice for greyhounds which had finished their racing careers to be sold for experimental purposes and not for long-term use that is as i understood it <e>", "<cs> the safeguards are there with the exception which the bill provides and which the home secretary will exercise and i am afraid that i am not reassured <e> <s> i was going a long way to being reassured by what the noble lord said in his first answer to the amendment when he gave as an example of the way in which the exception would be used a specific case <e> <s> what he said was that there might be an experiment where a particular sort of dog was needed which was not available from a breeding or a supplying establishment <e> <s> that would be a one-off example <e> <s> but as i understand it greyhounds are regularly used in experiments for particular purposes and that is why i imagine the noble lord mentioned that breed <e> <s> if they <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do <e> <s> the concern is not about what happens to the retired greyhound <e> <s> i do have that concern but that is not the point of the amendment as i said quite clearly in introducing it <e> <s> the point of the amendment is to allay the public concern about what happens to pet animals dogs and cats which are stolen <e> <s> i followed the noble lords argument very carefully <e> <s> as i see it the bill provides considerable safeguards against that which would go a very long way if not all the way to allaying that public concern but with this exception in the second line of subection <e>", "<cs> i was coming to the point on which the noble lord has intervened <e> <s> i am sorry if i am taking some time about it <e> <s> my concern is that if the exception in subsection is going to be exercised quite broadly for example to allow the existing trade in retired greyhounds which would be a very wide exception as i understand it and which would involve large numbers of dogs for routine procedures for which greyhounds are routinely used it does not seem that that amounts to an exceptional use of a particular species for a particular purpose but to a very general exception for a category of dog for routine procedures which go on regularly <e> <s> if the exception is going to be exercised in that broad way in the case of greyhounds we have hit upon that example but it is only an example i do not think this part of clause will serve to allay the genuine public concern <e> <s> that is why i pursued the point about greyhounds and what happens to them <e>", "<cs> i shall not prolong this debate and i shall be withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> however i want to make a couple of remarks before i do so because i am still not satisfied <e>", "<cs> in reply to the point raised by the noble lord lord airedale if he looks at what is said in the guidance notes he may find that in some respects this is more restrictive than the effect of his amendment would be <e> <s> i should have thought that what the noble lord has just said would be by far the best way of dealing with the concern which he feels <e>", "<cs> if we are to speak to amendment no <e> <s> it might be sensible to take amendment no <e> <s> at the same time <e> <s> the noble lord did not mention it but it covers much the same point <e> <s> the noble lord lord glenarthur appears to be happy with that <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one other point about this which worries me and perhaps the noble lord lord adrian could give me some advice <e> <s> as i understand the effect of the amendment if it is passed it would be possible for an animal subject to a series of regulated procedures then to be kept in a laboratory for some considerable period of time perhaps even for a period of years before the final experiment subject to anaesthesia and termination which would be allowed by this amendment was proceeded with <e> <s> if i am right about that it is a rather more dramatic change from the animals point of view than i think the noble lord suggested <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not happy with this amendment <e> <s> i am not entirely clear about the objects of the act to which the amendment refers <e> <s> but in any case it seems to me extremely undesirable that presumably some sort of test should be applied by the secretary of state which would involve asking people in detail what were their views about certain subjects before the secretary of state was able to appoint them <e> <s> what position the secretary of state would be left in if somebody changed his mind when he saw in detail how the act was working i am not sure <e> <s> presumably such a person would be forced to resign from the committee if he told the secretary of state that he had changed his mind <e> <s> if he did not tell the secretary of state that he had changed his mind the secretary of state would be breaking the law <e> <s> i think that the amendment is a bit of a nonsense <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just make one very quick point <e> <s> i do not support the amendment though i agree with the noble lord lord beaumont that it is an important point to raise <e> <s> i should just like to say to my noble friend that while many people who work in laboratories may be concerned as he puts it for animal welfare nevertheless there are two distinct points of view and there are people in the middle as well <e> <s> there are those people who believe that animal experiments are justified and those who believe that they are not <e> <s> i see that my noble friend is shaking his head <e>", "<cs> i rose only because i wanted to make a different point otherwise i should have been wasting your lordships time with due respect <e> <s> those two different points of view exist <e> <s> i oppose this amendment because we hope that this bill will become an act and will last for a long period of time <e> <s> i hope too that eventually there will be enough alternatives to the use of animals in experiments and sufficiently strong public opinion against the use of animals in experiments for such experiments virtually to come to an end <e> <s> at that stage it will be necessary to have far more than half the people on the animal procedures committee who do not believe that animals should be used in experiments at all and this amendment would then be restrictive <e>", "<cs> i am astonished at the noble lords reply <e> <s> i had assumed that the answer was going to be that the committee had power to do this anyhow <e> <s> this is an advisory committee first of all <e> <s> it is not a committee carrying out instructions on the secretary of states behalf in an executive capacity <e> <s> it is there as a group of independent scientists of other experts and of those with a particular interest in the subject to give the home secretary advice in a very technical and very controversial area <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment i want to make one more point <e> <s> i think at least two other noble lords wanted to say something <e> <s> i want simply to say to the noble lord that the suggestion that an advisory committee will issue an annual report to parliament in which it lists all the things that the home secretary has not let it investigate and that this will lead to a happy or constructive relationship between the advisory committee and the home secretary is clearly not right <e>", "<cs> i have not moved amendment nos <e> <s> and and i do not intend to at this stage <e>", "<cs> i am going to accept what the noble lord has said and i know that everyone wants to get on but the point that the noble lord lord airedale has just made was the point i wanted to make <e> <s> this answers the point of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> we have been told during the course of these debates that there are regulated procedures which do not involve suffering that there will be animals which are used as controls for example there will be animals which are anaesthetised <e> <s> maybe the administration of the anaesthetic involves suffering but as i remember it the noble earl described to us last week how you anaesthetise a mouse or a rat with the express purpose of convincing your lordships committee that no suffering was involved <e>", "<cs> the use of alternatives will not reduce avoidable suffering if the use of animals does not involve avoidable suffering <e> <s> that is the point i was making <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury said last week that it was possible to anaesthetise a mouse and then use it in an experimental procedure and kill it without the mouse suffering at all <e> <s> there will be no suffering involved and therefore to use an alternative would not avoid any suffering <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i am not at all reassured by all that <e> <s> if that is the effect of the amendment i apologise but i had not intended that the committee by asking to look at a project or personal licence application should stop the processing of that application <e> <s> i am sure that there are photocopies in the home office and it would be possible to let the committee have a copy while the original was being processed <e> <s> i did not hear the noble lord make any suggestions as to why the members of the committee could not visit establishments for which licences had been issued <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite a reasonable power to give an advisory committee <e>", "<cs> i think it is sensible to take amendment no with this amendment because it covers the same point <e> <s> i am very concerned about this provision in clause which would make it very difficult for somebody on the advisory committee to talk about the work that the advisory committee was doing <e> <s> i should be interested to know if the government can provide any precedents for treating an advisory committee in this way <e> <s> it seems to involve a lack of trust <e> <s> i do not know which noble lord is to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment and as we are discussing my amendment as well perhaps i may say a word <e> <s> i must say that i find the noble viscounts response extraordinarily unconvincing <e> <s> first the mind boggles at what intimate personal details would be revealed to the animal procedures committee <e> <s> i do not imagine that the home office inspectorate will be reporting in detail on the sex lives of different research workers which is what the noble viscount seemed to be implying <e> <s> if he has any particular intimate personal details in mind i shall be happy for him to intervene <e>", "<cs> no i thought that i would take them separately <e>", "<cs> i am worried about that <e> <s> as the noble lord will know the most recent prosecution under the act was that taken against the royal college of surgeons in respect of the experimental farm the buxton brown farm in kent <e> <s> as i understand it in that case the animal concerned was not covered by the previous act <e> <s> it was a monkey used for breeding purposes <e> <s> it is possible that animals at designated establishments may not be covered by the bill <e> <s> it will be possible for a designated establishment which is a research establishment and not licensed for breeding and supply also to have animals on the premises which are used for breeding purposes and i think i am right in saying that they would not be covered by the bill <e>", "<cs> at this time of night i am sure that dealing with this question by correspondence would suit everyone <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is reassuring to hear that scientific papers have been published more quickly than i had realised <e> <s> perhaps this is not typical <e> <s> i am interested in the comments that the noble lord made <e> <s> i can see some explanation for three years if it is a standard period <e> <s> i still think that there is an argument for extending it but i shall consider what the noble lord said and for the time being i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether any steps have been taken since the debates last year in your lordships house to speed up the procedures leading to the designation of the marine nature reserve <e> <s> it has taken nearly four and a half years and we still do not have one <e> <s> are the government doing anything to speed up the process so that it does not take another four and a half years before we have a second marine nature reserve <e>", "<cs> my lords the additional grant-in-aid for the nature conservancy council is very welcome but is the noble lord aware that this is likely simply to speed up the process of proposed marine nature reserves being identified by the nature conservancy council <e> <s> my question which with respect i do not think the noble lord answered is whether the government are doing anything to speed up the process which a proposed marine nature reserve has to undergo before it is designated <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment to which i have put my name <e> <s> i have been considering carefully what the noble lord lord glenarthur told us at the committee stage <e> <s> although i accept that within the terms he used performance testing of weapons does not take place it seems to me that things are not quite as clear cut as we were led to believe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the assurances that the noble lord has given which take us a long way forward <e> <s> the noble lord made a long and detailed speech which i should like to read <e> <s> i was particularly grateful for the two categoric assurances that the noble lord gave about the guidelines <e> <s> it may well be that that is the best way of dealing with this problem and meeting these concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i or for that matter my noble friend either today or at the committee stage suggested that there was a trend in the industry which was leading to more and more me-too drugs being produced <e> <s> in fact i would be quite happy to accept that the trend is in the other direction <e> <s> but surely the paper which we have both quoted makes it clear that there are some cases where <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the comments on my amendment and again it has aroused considerable interest <e> <s> i find the arguments raised against this suggestion difficult to follow not to say contradictory <e> <s> on the one hand it is argued that no commercial company in its right mind would develop a me too drug because the cost of development is so great that it would not be worth while if there was already something on the market <e> <s> on the other hand it is suggested that anything which looks like a me too drug is not so really because it may have slightly different side effects on some people who take it than on others although how it is possible to tell that when development starts i should be interested to know <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i thought he quoted that part of the article because it was a part with which he agreed <e> <s> if he did not agree with it he certainly did not say so at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has used that argument and did so on several occasions at committee stage sometimes with some force <e> <s> however it does not seem to me to be a valid argument in relation to this amendment <e> <s> the consequence of what the noble earl is saying is that there may forseeably come a time when he thinks it would be right for a licence to be given when a thorough consideration has not been given to the alternatives to the use of live animals <e> <s> i do not think any of us believes that we are legislating in this field so that the law will mean that it is possible for a future secretary of state to dish out licences without any consideration of whether alternatives are available <e> <s> it may be that to write into the bill specific requirements about particular tests like the ld test and so on poses difficulties because if some eec regulation comes in which requires these tests to take place or which increases the number of animal tests a specific requirement in the bill affected by that would be a considerable disadvantage and it would be necessary to change the act itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the number of noble lords who have supported the amendment <e> <s> i should certainly like to join others in welcoming my noble friend lord houghton back to our proceedings although i must say that his intervention on my amendment was rather less welcome and i disagreed with what he had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome this amendment and i hope that those outside parliament who are concerned with this matter will accept that adding either the word inviolate or inviolable would make absolutely no difference <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord is right about that <e> <s> this is an important strengthening of the bill and i am grateful to the minister for bringing it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by commenting on what the noble earl lord halsbury said in the debate on this amendment although it was not entirely about it <e> <s> first i am well aware that the noble earl has been involved in this subject for a very long time <e> <s> however to suggest that those who drafted the amendment or others know nothing about the subject is if i may say so a little arrogant <e> <s> there are many other people as well as the noble earl both in this house and outside it who know just as much as the noble earl about animal experimentation and who are quite capable of drafting amendments to the bill <e> <s> the fact that a number of amendments have been met one way or another by the government during the course of the bills passage through this house gives some support to that suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome what the noble lord has said and i feel sorry for him having made such an excellent response to something about which there was genuine concern then to be criticised and complained to <e> <s> i have had that experience myself occasionally on the front bench and it is rather disappointing <e> <s> i can assure him for myself and for the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and many other animal welfare organisations and literally millions of people in this country that we are all grateful to him for what he has said this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not entirely accept the force of the argument because as is often the case in trying to draft an amendment which does not place a firm duty on the secretary of state one nevertheless receives an answer that suggests that that is what the amendment actually does and that the secretary of state would have sufficient discretion not to be drawn into providing the sort of details of which the noble lord spoke in response to inquiries <e> <s> i am afraid that in this country we still live in an extremely secretive society compared to many other democracies and in particular the united states <e> <s> i regret that for i believe it lowers the standard of public debate about important issues such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to find myself wholly at one with my noble friend <e> <s> i will not say for a change but it has not always been the case on this bill <e> <s> as the noble lord lord glenarthur said in introducing the amendment i had some very strong objections to the move that the noble lord lord adrian made at committee stage to reintroduce the concept of re-use after it had been dropped from the second white paper <e> <s> as my noble friend has said it really was one of the two major changes which started to make it possible for legislation to be introduced which would not be virulently and consistently opposed by a large number of people in both houses of parliament <e> <s> i really think it would be a great pity as my noble friend has said to start to re-open the whole question of whether the bill can proceed unopposed for example on second reading in another place <e> <s> i firmly believe that if this amendment were to be moved into the bill that would be one of the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords amendment without asking him any awkward questions <e> <s> it is a significant and important amendment and i am again grateful to him for bringing it forward at this stage <e> <s> while i am on my feet i would add that i agree with him that it would be undesirable to put a number on those who are to represent the interests of animal welfare <e> <s> this is the best way of ensuring that the concerns that a number of us expressed in committee are met <e> <s> i think that the amendment is just right and i congratulate the government on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to welcome this amendment as well although slightly less <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the right reverend prelate we have not yet reached amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no my lords i shall not <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for taking up this suggestion which i believe was originally made by my noble friend on the front bench that in the light of yesterdays debate it would be desirable to consider this question again <e> <s> i take the ministers point about the first of the three subsections but i totally disagree with him about the need for subsection <e> <s> frankly it may be self-evident to a lawyer as those who advise the noble lord the minister and my noble friend might be but i do not think it is self-evident to most people <e> <s> most of the people implementing this bill will be working in laboratories and not in the courts of law <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be self-evident that a failure to follow guidance contained in a code does not give rise to any offence <e> <s> it would be desirable for that to be made clear in the bill for the sake of those who will be operating it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i had not realised that this applied to the secretary of state <e> <s> in the light of recent events i can see why the chemical industries association and others are so anxious that a secretary of state disclosing confidential private and confidential is it <e> <s> letters should be immediately locked up <e> <s> i now see why the clause is worded so strongly <e> <s> more seriously as my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords commitment to legislate is very welcome but it is conditional on the voluntary system not working <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that the voluntary restraint is not working and that the introduction of model bylaws seems likely to confuse matters rather than simplify them because different water authorities are taking a different approach <e> <s> in those circumstances would it not be better for the government to get on and legislate as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments firm commitment to legislate can the noble lord assure the house that the government have seen a way forward for doing that which will not give rise to legal or other difficulties should they decide to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said i tabled an amendment about this subject at both committee and report stage <e> <s> i am very grateful to the government for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> as the minister has indicated it is an improvement on my amendment but is very close to it <e> <s> i know that it will be warmly welcomed by many people and in particular by the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals which as the noble lord knows was most concerned about this matter <e> <s> i thank the government very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i put my name to an amendment to this effect on report and i support this <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a brief word <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby that this is a good bill <e> <s> it is a better bill as it leaves your lordships house than it was when it arrived and for that i have no doubt that we have to thank the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> he has responded to many amendments and many i am conscious from me or with my name to them with considerable courtesy <e> <s> i am grateful for the helpful attitude adopted both by the noble lord and by his colleague the noble viscount lord davidson and the officials at the home office who have been responsible for the bill <e> <s> i thank all those involved very much indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that last year before the scientific committee on problems of the environment had produced their report the government said that they were waiting for that scope report before deciding whether the nuclear winter hypothesis was a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to the noble lord for reminding me that the working papers of the scope report in volume have not yet been published although i believe they are available in the scientific literature <e> <s> what i asked the noble lord was whether the government accept the conclusions of the scope report which last year they said they were awaiting before they came to a view on the nuclear winter hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i moved an amendment which had a very similar purpose to this when we debated the bill here so i very warmly welcome the fact that in another place the government have amended the bill in this way <e> <s> it is quite right if i may pick up a point made by the noble earl that sometimes administrative effort should be spent in ensuring that in the grey area that he mentioned the maximum number of experiments on animals do not take place and the maximum number of alternatives to the use of animals are employed <e> <s> i think that the amendment is important for that very reason <e> <s> i know it was always intended that this should be done <e> <s> it makes a great deal of difference and we shall see it making a great deal of difference over the years to have this written into the face of the bill <e> <s> i am delighted to see it there <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said i raised this matter when we were considering the bill <e> <s> i was still concerned about the two matters that he mentioned the convenience of supply and the cheapness of pet cats and dogs which had not been specially bred <e> <s> the government have very much strengthened the amendment which we made in this house and have probably gone so far as is practical in the bill to put an end to the very great concern which has been expressed by many members of the public particularly to the rspca about the problem of stolen pet cats and dogs being used in experiments <e> <s> i now hope that we can look forward to seeing the home office inspectorate and voluntary organisations like the rspca implementing this new law as firmly and as effectively as possible to remove completely any grounds for worry by members of the public <e> <s> but i very much welcome what the government have done <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was one of those who moved amendments to this effect when we debated the bill initially i very warmly welcome the changes which the government made in another place and not for the first time i very strongly disagree with what the noble earl lord halsbury had to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to start by saying a word about the environmentally sensitive areas in clause <e> <s> needless to say along with i think everyone else who has spoken i warmly welcome this clause of the bill <e> <s> there is not a great deal left to say about it as a number of noble lords have touched on the subject but i want to echo what has already been said by the noble lord lord moran and others about the name of these areas <e> <s> environmentally sensitive areas seems a complete misnomer <e> <s> conservation farming areas would be much better <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord onslow said that the minister was under attack from all the people who usually attacked him on agricultural measures <e> <s> but when we come to discuss the future of adas there is a significant difference <e> <s> concern about its future unites all who are interested in the british countryside <e> <s> it unites farmers and landowners with environmentalists and conservationists and with many other interests <e> <s> for instance the water authorities which i want to raise specifically on a later amendment are extremely concerned about the dangers of the present state of adas and the contemplated cuts <e>", "<cs> may i take up that point <e> <s> the noble lord has made some interesting and i think thoroughly confusing points about how charges will or will not be implemented <e> <s> however i agree with the noble earl lord onslow that we may return to that on a later amendment <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble earl lord onslow and the noble lord lord walston have successfully widened the debate on a narrow and simple amendment no doubt as a result of the enthusiastic encouragment they received to do this from the noble lord lord belstead <e>", "<cs> if i may say so at last we have got to the nub of the question which this amendment was designed to address <e> <s> we have spent a long time the clock has not been restarted but i think it is about minutes getting to what i had hoped the noble lord would have said after i moiled the amendment and then we could have embarked on the debate which i hope we can now embark on which is what this amendment was designed to address our minds to <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that that raises serious issues <e> <s> so far as i know the government have not admitted that this is the case up to now that what they are doing by making all this advice simply a discretionary power rather than a duty is preventing anybody insisting that they carry out their policy and give advice on these matters <e> <s> frankly i find that unacceptable and i hope the committee will find it unacceptable <e> <s> certainly i shall want to come back on report stage with an amendment which does not have the technical defects which the noble lord kindly pointed out to the governments version of the amendment of the noble lord lord sandford and insist that the the minister should have a statutory duty to give advice on matters which the minister is saying he will do anyhow <e> <s> if that means that the ministry ends up in court for not carrying out their duty i do not see that that is a great advantage to anyone except possibly the minister <e> <s> it will be a great advantage to the farmers and the countryside as a whole <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> so that we do not repeat earlier experiences it may be helpful if we stick to the amendment <e> <s> that is what i should like to do <e> <s> i am delighted incidentally that the noble lord lord belstead enjoyed so much as he did the countryside commissions launch of its access charter with mr waldegrave and sir derek barber <e> <s> i am not sure whether he was aware that the access charter was produced by the countryside commission as a result of an amendment made to the national parks and access to the countryside act through the wildlife and countryside act in your lordships chamber an amendment which i moved against the governments wishes and had placed in the bill <e> <s> i am delighted that the outcome has been to give the noble lord lord belstead a good party at the countryside commissions expense <e>", "<cs> i was going to make precisely the same point <e> <s> the government themselves have laid this power on the minister <e> <s> they have taken to the minister of agriculture the countryside commissions remit <e> <s> to say that it is all right to take it to the minister of agriculture who has to balance these matters but that it is not all right to take it to adas and one should remember that it is a powers and not a duty on adas that can be exercised if they want to exercise it is something that i find impossible to follow <e> <s> it is made even more difficult by the point that the noble earl lord onslow has raised when he said that one cannot do that for adas because that will overlap with the countryside commission but one should not <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that is the kind of advice i should like to see adas being able to give <e> <s> the governments point of view as i understand it is that adas should not do so because it might upset the countryside commission <e> <s> my information is that the countryside commission would welcome the amendment i have tabled which is in sharp contrast to what has been said by the <e>", "<cs> in that case it would have short-circuited matters a little if the minister had said so in the first place rather than base his whole argument on what he suggested would be the view of the countryside commission which is what he spent several minutes telling the committee <e> <s> nevertheless even if the minister will not speak to the commission between now and report stage i shall do so <e> <s> that will at least remove what the minister said was his main argument against the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure the water authorities association which apparently has not previously received such a clear assurance on the matter will be encouraged <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with everything that the noble earl said and i said so in introducing the amendment <e> <s> it is possible in committee to introduce probing amendments so that subjects can be raised for debate <e> <s> i explicitly said that that was my intention <e> <s> i agree that it would be wrong to put this amendment in the bill but i hope the noble lord the minister will be able to give us some information on what the government are doing in this respect <e>", "<cs> i was very interested in what the noble lord had to say <e> <s> i think that organic farming is different and special in two respects <e> <s> first it represents one of the only areas in uk agriculture where there is a rapidly growing market and where there is no sign of that market being met from domestic production even though it could be met from domestic production <e> <s> that makes it rather different and rather special but i do not think that it makes it sufficiently different or special to warrant a particular mention in the bill <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> it is a common misapprehension that modern organic farming simply involves turning the clock back years <e> <s> perhaps he should take the opportunity to see some of the detailed research work that is being done in west germany for example on flame weeding using quite sophisticated modern equipment <e> <s> i doubt whether that was available even in aberdeenshire years ago <e> <s> this is one of the areas modern equipment for modern organic farming where i am afraid that our rivals in the rest of europe although we are all in the ec will be stealing a march <e> <s> british agricultural machinery manufacturers will be suffering from even more imports as organic farming grows throughout europe as it will <e> <s> the ec is considering setting a european-wide standard for organic farming produce <e>", "<cs> i was waiting for the noble lord to do what he said he was going to do spring to the defence of the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i was waiting with interest to hear him defend the indefensible <e> <s> however he never got round to it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he will say anything more about the other important problem raised by noble lords on all sides in this debate about distinguishing between conservation and other free advice and advice which will be charged for <e> <s> can he say something more about what happens if a project turns from one thing into another in the course of discussion <e> <s> the noble lord the minister told us how he saw the dividing line working on an earlier amendment but it clearly did not satisfy noble lords on either side <e> <s> is the noble lord able to respond to any of those criticisms which have arisen despite the long statement he has made on another matter just now <e>", "<cs> i rather agree with that <e> <s> it seems that both noble lords opposite have pointed to a real difficulty and indeed a real evil so far as adas and other people operating in this field are concerned <e> <s> i do not believe that the amendment does much to help matters <e> <s> if anything like my noble friend on the front bench i feel that it will probably make matters worse <e> <s> like other noble lords i as a farmer make use of the services of private consultants <e> <s> at the moment because adas advice and particularly research advice from things like experimental husbandry farms is made available generally to the industry including private consultants it is then very effectively disseminated to many farmers through the services of those private consultants <e> <s> it is interpreted at an individual farm level and converted into pounds and pence by private consultants for a particular farm business in a way that an experimental husbandry farm or adas itself would not be able to do <e> <s> all that is going to stop <e> <s> nothing that the two noble lords opposite can do in this amendment or any other that we are likely to debate will help matters <e> <s> experimental husbandry farms have already stopped sending reports free of charge <e> <s> the flow of information from the advisory services and their research facilities has dried up <e> <s> the only people who will get it in future are those prepared to pay <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not suggest that any of the experimental husbandry farms had been closed <e> <s> perhaps i should add the words closed yet <e> <s> i suggested that the information which used to be freely available from them for example in the shape of annual reports has dried up <e> <s> it may be that my annual report from gleadthorpe has not come through in the post but i understood that all the experimental husbandry farms have been told that they should not issue information like that generally and freely to farmers as they have in the past <e>", "<cs> that seems to miss the audience at which an experimental husbandry farm should be aiming <e> <s> i was not aware that the annual reports were aimed at the general public <e> <s> my understanding was that they were aimed at farmers farming on soil similar to the experimental husbandry farm with systems similar to it <e> <s> the scientific press is very useful for scientists but not many farmers i would certainly include myself in this have the opportunity to read the scientific press <e> <s> open days are very useful for having a look at what is happening but they do not give one the facts and figures which annual reports do <e> <s> annual reports from experimental husbandry farms as the noble lord knows contain the results of work done on the farm in that year <e> <s> it is not just a glossy report it provides one with facts and figures which are often very valuable indeed <e>", "<cs> can i pursue one further point with the noble lord <e> <s> he knows that this is a matter which is giving rise to a great deal of concern not only among farmers but private consultants at which the amendment was particularly directed <e> <s> as i understand it what will happen the noble lord has now confirmed it is that farmers will have to pay for this information from experimental husbandry farms by buying publications <e> <s> am i right in assuming that that will also be the position of private consultants <e> <s> they will have to buy the information by buying the publications <e> <s> but adas will presumably have free access to the information from experimental husbandry farms <e> <s> is not one of the matters about which the private consultants are worried that adas will have this huge publicly funded research programme through such things as experimental husbandry farms available to them for nothing while all the rest of us will have to pay for it twice through our taxes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask a very brief question simply for information <e> <s> has the ministry taken any decision as to who should pay for badger control operations in the south-west of england where badgers are being killed by the noble lords department in efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis in cattle <e> <s> is there any intention of charging the farmers concerned for that operation <e> <s> i ask this question with no particular desire to hear one answer or the other <e> <s> on balance i would probably prefer to hear that farmers would be charged for the service and then the killing of badgers would come to an end <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can tell me what view has been reached on that <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support this amendment tabled by noble lords opposite <e> <s> we spent some time until a few minutes ago discussing the terms of competition between adas and private consultants <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead said in an earlier debate this afternoon that the new duties laid on the minister of agriculture in clause will apply to adas and other functions carried out on the ministers behalf <e> <s> so adas will continue quite rightly and i think it is supported by everyone to need to have regard to balancing the various interests in the countryside giving advice on conservation free of charge of course and other matters <e>", "<cs> may i just point out to my noble friend that those who moved this amendment are not <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend why he has changed his view about this so sharply since we were discussing the animals scientific procedures bill when on numerous occasions he staunchly defended the home offices decision to include in guidance notes a whole range of matters which posed much more difficult philosophical questions if i may say so than matters of balancing conservation and agricultural production <e> <s> that if i may also remind him is not something that was invented by the amendment but by the government in the text of the bill in clause <e> <s> nevertheless in the animals scientific procedures bill my noble friend against some opposition from other parties insisted that it was sensible to put something of a sort which involved guidance to the experimenters in exactly the sort of code of practice that this amendment is proposing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves to withdraw the amendment which i sense he may perhaps i can intervene to ask the noble lord lord belstead one question <e> <s> he said that with his colleagues he had considered this proposal very carefully <e> <s> i wondered whether in the course of that he had an opportunity to talk to the two professional associations which represent the overwhelming majority of private consultants in agriculture and whether there was any possibility of them accepting voluntarily the need for themselves to prepare a code of practice <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether i am on exactly the same point as the noble earl and the noble <e>", "<cs> on some matters at least <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for responding so positively to the amendment <e> <s> we shall come later to the issue of the ploughing of footpaths and the problems associated with that <e> <s> i acknowledge that the noble <e>", "<cs> i did ask the noble lord a specific question but i may have put it too briefly and perhaps he missed it <e> <s> i shall be delighted to put it again <e> <s> what i was trying to find out for clarification for those outside your lordships committee as well as those inside is whether the new duty in being restricted to land will not apply for example to appointments made to advisory committees and similar bodies by the minister <e> <s> i had in mind the hill farming advisory committee for england wales and northern ireland and the sub-committee for wales about which i recently asked the noble lord a question for written answer <e> <s> the noble lord said in reply to my question that when clause the clause we are now discussing was enacted it would provide statutory backing for what ministers of agriculture are already doing <e> <s> he also said and i quote from col of <e>", "<cs> i neither approve or disapprove because that is not the reply to the question i asked with respect <e> <s> i asked the noble lord whether or not when the minister comes to make appointments to the hill farming advisory committee the clause we are discussing today will cover those appointments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not like the reply only because it is so obscure and it is difficult to tell what it means <e> <s> i wonder whether i could ask the noble lord the specific question will clause influence the minister and will the minister need to take account of his new duty under clause when making appointments to the hill farming advisory committee <e>", "<cs> we are on a narrow point and i do not want to prolong the debate but the noble lords reply to my question in <e>", "<cs> i think i have either to withdraw the amendment or to press it and i am inclined despite the noble lords reluctance to give me a straight answer to a specific question to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i take it from what the noble lord said in reply to my last intervention that in fact clause will apply when the minister comes to make appointments to the hill farming advisory committee in future because the noble lord said that the hill farming advisory committee is all about land <e> <s> he did not say yes to my question but he answered it by saying that the hill farming advisory committee is all about land <e> <s> i therefore assume that clause must apply to future appointments to the committee <e> <s> if i find after reading <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment and make one point which i do not think has been made <e> <s> in drawing up environmentally sensitive areas and in particular the management <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i respond to that question before the noble lord replies <e> <s> on the issue of altering public rights of way the ramblers association and as far as i know other users or footpaths and bridle ways are not opposed to changing the rights of way network <e> <s> the ramblers association is opposed to changing the rights of way network in a way that will make it less convenient or enjoyable for the public <e> <s> there are public rights of way which are laid down in law as being available to the public <e> <s> in law they are as open to the public as the m motorway or the a or whatever it may be <e> <s> the legal duty not to obstruct them is exactly the same <e>", "<cs> that may be so but the noble lord did not go on to say that the scheme provides a greater length of public footpaths than is currently the case <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to look at the case if that is so <e> <s> i have seen a proposal for the rationalisation of footpaths in kent which does the opposite <e> <s> it would end up with a shorter total length of public rights of way than is currently the case <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord and i are talking about the same scheme <e> <s> if we are our measuring tapes have come to different conclusions <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has a good point on the first amendment <e> <s> i had intended that the word maintenance should be used in the same sense as it is clearly used in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should also like very strongly to support this amendment and to take up the point also in subsection about extending grant-aid outside less-favoured areas <e> <s> let me say immediately that not enough of the public support available to agriculture currently goes to maintain the incomes of farmers in less-favoured areas who in many circumstances have a very hard time of it compared with those people such as myself found in the south-east <e>", "<cs> i am delighted at the noble lords reasonably positive response <e> <s> will he think before report stage about one other thing <e> <s> while he may be right at this moment that going to the european commission and asking for an extension beyond the less favoured areas of the kind that subsection suggests might meet with a rebuttal i hope he will remember that the common agricultural policy is changing rapidly <e> <s> only a couple of years ago he was <e>", "<cs> no i would not <e> <s> in fact there has been one court case where this particular point had to be determined by the court where a rambler said he had been chased by a bull in this case a dairy bull and the farmer concerned was taken to court <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> as an ex-president of the ramblers association i do not know whether the noble earl was referring to me but i earn my living from farming and i dare say that does not necessarily qualify me to talk about cattle and their dangers <e> <s> therefore i rest my case largely on the advice given by the health and safety executive which investigates all deaths caused by livestock to farmers farmworkers and other people <e> <s> the noble earl if he is a farmer will no doubt have seen a copy and should look at the advice given <e> <s> he will see that the health and safety executive having investigated the actual cause of death is quite clear in saying that bulls are extremely dangerous that they are unpredictable and that they should not be trusted <e>", "<cs> the only way i suppose it is possible to come to an objective view on this matter is to look at the statistics for deaths and injuries caused to people by various breeds of livestock <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to do that he will see that bulls cause considerably more deaths than other livestock <e> <s> did the noble earl wish me to give way <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee is anxious to get on to a number of other amendments that we have to face <e> <s> i have now been interrupted by members opposite on four or five occasions and i have a list of about six points to which those opposite sitting behind the noble lord lord belstead have asked me to respond and i am sure that they would want me to do that before i withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to support this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said i moved the inclusion of some similar words earlier <e> <s> it is very important that the new kinds of agricultural support for environmentally sensitive areas and i hope that we shall soon be able to stop calling them that absurd name succeed because this will provide a new source of funds for many people involved in the agricultural industry and one which will be extremely welcome i have no doubt <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in the argument between the two noble lords opposite <e> <s> however it seems to me that the noble lord lord belstead is answering this amendment as though it related to subsection which prescribes the things which the ministry can do in an area once it has been designated rather than to subsection which describes the sort of area which is to be designated <e> <s> those are two quite separate points <e> <s> the basis on which you designate the area is one thing what the ministry then has power to do in the area is a different matter <e>", "<cs> i accept that but we are not trying to change the noble lords right honourable friends powers <e> <s> that happens in subsection <e> <s> what we are saying is that it would be unduly restrictive to say that areas where it is desirable to conserve or protect these various things can only be areas where the conserving or protecting is done through the mechanism of agricultural policy <e> <s> there are very few buildings of architectural merit where agricultural policy is going to make a huge difference to their protection but they nevertheless may add to the general beauty and importance of the area from a conservation point of view <e>", "<cs> i think that that is a bitterly disappointing reply <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will think about it again <e> <s> if he will cast his mind back to the wildlife and countryside bill debates we discussed the possibility of changing the name of sites of special scientific interest to something that was rather less of a mouthful and rather less intimidating to those who were going to receive notification about it <e> <s> we were not able to do so in that case mainly because the term site of special scientific interest appeared as a sideline to the bill and in that position it was not capable of amendment <e>", "<cs> it is the purpose of providing public money in these areas as the noble earl knows <e>", "<cs> i am well aware of that but if we were not putting new public money into these areas we would not be bothered with this clause in the bill <e> <s> the point of this clause is to provide a new source of money for farming <e> <s> what i want to see is that being generally accepted by the public at large unlike most support for farming at the moment <e> <s> it seems to me that we have designed a phrase to describe these areas which could be really designed to put the public off and put farmers off rather than to persuade the public that it is a good idea and that their taxes should be spent on supporting farmers in an additional new way over and above what we do already <e>", "<cs> i very strongly agree with what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> it is perfectly clear to all of us whether we have been in government or not that the treasury control government expenditure <e> <s> it is true under governments of all parties and you do not need to write something like this into an act of parliament to secure that much as many spending ministries would wish that you could get round it in some way <e>", "<cs> i should also like to ask a question <e> <s> the noble lord seemed to imply that if any order was signed simply by the minister of agriculture under which the ministry was going to incur expenditure nobody would believe that money was going to be spent <e> <s> in his original reply he said that the purpose of having the treasury here was to persuade people that when the order was signed by both the minister and the treasury minister money would actually flow <e>", "<cs> may i suggest to the minister that the statute might at least convey what he has said in parliament if it said that the treasurys consent is needed for making an expenditure under the order <e> <s> the minister is suggesting to us that the treasury are not going to consent to the making of one order as against another but simply to the making of expenditure under all these orders <e> <s> if that is the case why does it not say that in the bill <e> <s> what the bill says is quite different from what the noble lord is saying <e>", "<cs> i am sure that my noble friend on the front bench is right that adas and the ministry will manage the schemes <e> <s> however what is equally important is that the provision in the amendment of the noble lord lord buxton is the way that it will work <e> <s> in other words the ministry manage after taking advice from a number of experts in particular the two statutory bodies which are responsible for conservation and countryside amenity and so on <e> <s> i think that that is what has happened in the broads <e> <s> i know that the countryside commission staff and the adas staff in norwich have worked very closely together and have consulted regularly with the nature conservancy council although rather unusually that area is not of particular importance from its wildlife conservation interest <e> <s> it is much more as the noble lord lord belstead knows a landscape conservation area <e> <s> i am quite convinced that if esas are to succeed it will be vital to draw on the expertise although it will be limited initially of the nature conservancy council and countryside commission in drawing up the management guidelines which will then be implemented by adas working with the farmers concerned <e>", "<cs> i should like to support both my noble friends amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is so uncontroversial and sensible that the noble lord lord belstead will have no difficulty <e> <s> i should therefore just like to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord has already given us an indication that he is not very happy about the first part of amendment no <e> <s> the nominated officer point <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend will agree but i think there is an important point there <e> <s> as the noble lord lord stanley of alderley said there should be somebody of reasonable qualification and experience in charge in each esa so that everyone knows particularly the farmers and landowners in this case who is in charge of the operation and who they can get on the phone and talk to if there is some problem <e>", "<cs> i merely make the point that i think it would be impossible for that not to happen <e> <s> it is impossible to envisage circumstances where it could not happen <e> <s> but there is a real worry about the involvement of the ncc and the countryside commission with which amendment no <e> <s> would deal <e>", "<cs> if i may say so to my noble friend lady nicol the noble lord the minister is right to say that it would he unusual to put into the statute how staff at the ministry should be deployed <e> <s> there might come a stage where there was an esa where it would be sensible to split it into two sub-divisions and to have different persons in charge of each part particularly if the area straddled a county boundary or something of that kind <e>", "<cs> i might have misheard my noble friend but i think he suggested that non-grant aided forestry was on the decrease <e> <s> in fact as i understand it the position is exactly the opposite and until very recently there have not been any cases of non-grant aided afforestation taking place <e>", "<cs> the future of forestry policy in the ec is interesting but i cannot see what on earth it has to do with the amendment <e> <s> the amendment does not suggest making payments for planting trees or not planting trees in esas <e> <s> it would simply give ministers power to prevent a damaging operation going ahead in an esa if that operation was afforestation <e> <s> as the noble lord clearly said for the second time round that is not affected by the treaty of rome <e> <s> given that we should not be making any payments under the amendment i cannot see what it would have to do with the european commission <e> <s> it is an entirely domestic matter <e> <s> several other european countries have strict controls over both new afforestation and the maintenance of existing woodlands within the community and under the cap <e> <s> none of that is prevented <e> <s> i cannot see what the noble lords argument has to do with the amendment <e>", "<cs> first the noble lord suggested that i had said that nobody was claiming grant-aid any more <e> <s> that would be a strange thing to see and an even stranger thing to say and i did not say it <e> <s> i said that some water authorities and i understand an increasing number recently have decided for the first time to go ahead with quite major drainage programmes without seeking grant-aid <e> <s> i have a cutting from the <e>", "<cs> i agree that there is a basic philosophical difference between those of us on this side of the committee and those opposite <e> <s> i hope we can explore that in a little more detail on the next amendment <e> <s> the noble lord says that we do not want to hit people on the head <e> <s> the question is whether we should try to stop this idb going around mugging the landowners and wildfowl of somerset because that is what they have been doing <e> <s> they have destroyed an area that has been farmed in a particular way for centuries where public money has been spent buying a national nature reserve and is listed as a potential environmentally sensitive area <e> <s> they are vandals on the loose and the noble lord is saying jolly good let them go on voluntarily doing what they want to do <e> <s> he makes a particular point of not having any statutory controls over these rural vandals and he is pleased about it <e> <s> that is a scandal and it is deplorable <e>", "<cs> i strongly agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is totally irresponsible but it is not my report <e> <s> it is the governments report <e> <s> they have had it since june in draft and since september in final form <e> <s> who is being irresponsible i ask the noble lord in not releasing this report to this chamber and to another place <e> <s> if the noble lord wants to intervene again i will gladly give way but if not i will come to a conclusion <e>", "<cs> i am addressing myself to my amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord said no doubt the government will now publish the report indeed they have done so and in considerable confusion and disarray a few days ago after it had been leaked <e> <s> the noble lord may decide that the timing was determined by the government in the light of all the considerations but i have to say to him that i have been waiting for a letter from the noble lord lord skelmersdale about this report from th march <e> <s> it was with some considerable surprise that i received a <e>", "<cs> the reason why the report which i gave the noble lord lord belstead notice i was going to raise is relevant to this amendment is because as <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment as will have been obvious from my moving of the <e>", "<cs> i think that is a question that should not be left unanswered as it was directed specifically at my noble friend lady white and myself <e> <s> there is ample evidence to show and i should have thought farmers would be the first to recognise it that the spread of conifer afforestation in the uplands has led to a decrease in jobs and not an increase <e> <s> what few jobs have been provided have been provided at centres a long way from where afforestation takes place <e> <s> for example there is ample evidence to show that as the acreage of conifer planting owned by the forestry commission goes up the number of jobs actually goes down <e> <s> the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard gave one of the reasons for that situation <e> <s> modern techniques of planting allow for self-thinning so that no labour is required on the newly-afforested area if it is done with alien conifers as it is now to the extent of over per cent <e> <s> or more of new planting for the first years or more of the new plantations life <e>", "<cs> i was interested to see that the noble lord has a copy of the final guide which i had not seen <e> <s> no doubt a copy will be put in the library as soon as friends of the earth have got hold of it and leaked it to the <e>", "<cs> i should also like very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> if the government and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the noble lord lord belstead and to the noble lord lord sandford who was responsible for these provisions appearing in the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> but they have a long and honourable pedigree <e> <s> they were first recommended by sir nigel strutt in the strutt report many years before that <e> <s> it has been endorsed by everybody from the agricultural industry who has looked at the future for agriculture and conservation that adas should play a major part in giving advice to farmers on conservation matters <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sandford said the provisions have not been wholeheartedly endorsed by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but this would not make it a statutory duty it would make it a statutory power <e> <s> this is now a discretionary clause as the noble lord will remember <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that this glossy and attractive booklet entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would do me the courtesy of answering my specific question <e> <s> i asked him in the light of the cases which the ramblers association presented to the government between committee and report stage whether the government still hold the view that it is safe for members of the public to walk on footpaths through fields where beef bulls are grazing with cows or heifers <e>", "<cs> my lords i was particularly disturbed to hear the noble lord lord belstead begin his remarks by saying that there was a lot of truth in what the noble lord lord burton had said because i think that was rather an insult to the many hundreds of thousands of people who are concerned about this <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said it should not involve extra work because the noble lord should be putting up warnings signs as it is and under my amendment he would be having to put up diversion signs <e> <s> i do not see that that will involve extra work as he suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords both noble lords who have just spoken are right to say that we have a number of ways of designating the countryside and there are a number of further designations which they have omitted to mention heritage coast for example <e> <s> all these are fancy-sounding names for fancy bits of countryside but very few of them contain any powers to protect those areas of the countryside <e> <s> a major study of national parks undertaken a couple of years ago showed that whether you farmed or operated a business or anything else inside or outside a national park made little difference to whether developments went ahead whether landscape was changed hedges were lost woodlands were lost and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is very late but no it is not covered <e> <s> the noble lord and i read out almost exactly the same brief but i went on to say that the problem with the guidance notes to which the noble lord referred is that they cover only consultation procedures they do not cover the operational requirements and they do not give practical advice on operational requirements <e> <s> i am afraid that i said exactly what the noble lord said and <e>", "<cs> my lords i have great pleasure in begging leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two basic approaches to environmental pollution issues current in this country at the moment <e> <s> the first is the governments which in practice means that they take no action until there is overwhelming scientific proof that a problem has actually been caused <e> <s> they have adopted this approach in the numerous examples which have been quoted in the debate so far nitrates leaching into water supplies the problems of acid deposition from power station chimneys so-called acceptable levels of radioactive discharges and so on <e>", "<cs> i very strongly support my noble friends three amendments <e> <s> i think it is worth bearing in mind that this bill was introduced because of widespread and long-standing concern about the deterioration in the conservation and amenity interests of the norfolk broads <e> <s> it was not introduced because of concern about navigation or concern for some other interest such as agriculture in that area <e> <s> it was introduced because of concern at the appalling loss of wildlife and loss of the natural beauty of the area <e> <s> for that reason the setting up of the broads authority has been welcomed by amenity and wildlife conservation interests <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble lord is wrong for a third time <e> <s> there is no agreement among all the parties involved as regards the composition of the broads authority <e> <s> as far as i am aware widespread concern has been expressed by all the voluntary wildlife and amenity organisations both about the composition of the broads authority as proposed in the bill and the way in which the broads authoritys duties are set out <e> <s> if it were not for the grave problems that have existed for many years in the broads i daresay that some organisations would be opposing the bill for those reasons <e> <s> there is no agreement <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord a question in relation to that matter <e> <s> earlier in his speech he said that one of the interests which would not be represented along with angling was land management <e> <s> how can that be if the national farmers union and the country landowners association are to be asked to recommend two people to the authority <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i misheard the noble lord earlier but his reference to land drainage not being represented does not help me very much because some land drainage interests will be represented by the person appointed by the anglian water authority which has statutory responsibility for most aspects of land drainage in this area as in others <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness tell me why it is necessary to have three boating experts <e> <s> boating is a fairly technical subject but not as technical as the ecology of the invertebrates and the fauna of some of the broads <e> <s> if her arguments were accepted there would be no interests represented on the authority at all <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong the debate but the noble baroness has not looked at clause where the secretary of state appoints three people from the boating interests <e>", "<cs> i shall say a brief word in support of my noble friend and ask the government one question <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord sandford that to some extent we are having a debate <e>", "<cs> will the government provide some general guidelines of the sort that were discussed in committee and which the noble lord has been asked about <e> <s> that is the question <e>", "<cs> would it be possible for the government to consider the matter before the bill leaves this house <e> <s> it is a significant point <e> <s> the noble lord has said very strongly that this should not be pressed because of the danger of hybridising the bill <e> <s> that puts a considerable constraint on your lordships house <e> <s> would the noble lord be prepared to consider the matter before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not mind me saying that his constant repetition that we are bringing things up late in a bills passage when we are in committee is getting a little wearing <e> <s> if the noble lord was saying that at third reading it might be reasonable but as my noble friend has already said this is the first opportunity we have had to debate any of these detailed points on the floor of the chamber <e> <s> the fact that this is a hybrid bill and that private interests have had the opportunity through an entirely different procedure to have their interests debated is really of no relevance whatever <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not keep repeating for the rest of the time that we spend on this bill the point that we are coming to it very late in the day <e> <s> we are in committee regarding the public aspects of this bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not mind me making that point <e>", "<cs> for the first time this evening i should like to give some support to the noble lord on the government front bench <e> <s> i think it would be a good idea <e> <s> i hope that i have not entirely put him off his dinner <e> <s> i think that it would be a good idea to get moving on setting up the authority and the transfer of functions <e> <s> as he said a provision of this kind will encourage everyone to make appointments quickly to the new authority <e> <s> given the assurances that the noble lord has mentioned about a quorum i personally should be happy for this amendment to form part of the bill <e>"]
