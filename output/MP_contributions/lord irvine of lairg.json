["<cs> my lords i feel sure that in this house there will be no dispute that every criminal statute should be judged by whether it will promote or hinder the development by the courts of a rational

foreign state which requests the extradition of a suspect must produce to the english courts <e>", "<cs> i feel that the clause is subject to grave question <e> <s> at first sight it represents a conspicuous erosion of the citizens right when accused of an offence to test the evidence against him by cross-examination <e> <s> there must also be serious questions over whether it is not administratively unworkable and as capable of being manipulated by an unmeritorious defendant as of causing injustice to a meritorious defendant <e>", "<cs> i should like to assure the noble and learned lord lord roskill that i yield to no one in my regard for her majestys judges not least on occasions when they are exercising a discretion <e> <s> however together with the noble lord lord

any against south africa the government believe to be of real practical effect today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount believe that these sanctions each of them agreed at nassau continue to

privilege of appearing many times before him in the courts can confirm that this is not unprecedented <e> <s> he is a legal genius <e> <s> i remind the committee that the first thoughts of a genius on

provisions which we completely support <e> <s> the only question and that is the purpose <e>", "<cs> i will study with care what the noble earl has said and in the meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw

claimed is not substantial <e> <s> however i appreciate that the argument has not fallen upon receptive ears and i therefore seek to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that i am

subsequently that what appeared to be clearly hopeless was clearly right <e> <s> i would be astonished if the noble and learned lords experience did not likewise extend to such cases <e>", "<cs> as i understand the answer which the noble and learned lord has just given it is to acknowledge judicial review in the sense that an application to the high court would not run <e> <s> it now appears that

to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord indicating that in his view if a lady the victim of a criminal injury suffered a scar that required revision and was concerned about her appearance because it was injuring her sense of well-being not to have this plastic surgery privately the board would be perfectly entitled to regard that treatment as essential so that the only question would be whether the expense was reasonable <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> it appears to me that there must be many people who earn between one-and-a-half times and twice the average wage but who can hardly be described as wealthy <e> <s> surely they will not be properly compensated if this large gap is opened between their actual lost earnings and the earnings for which they can be compensated <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to read whether the noble and learned lord will say in answer to my question that the provisions in their amended form without the words wholly or partly inserted in place of for would have the effect of excluding any arrangements to which an employer has contributed no matter how small the employers contribution may be <e> <s> if he accepts that that is the consequence of the provisions as they stand does he think it is just that that should be the position <e>", "<cs> i am content that the noble and learned lord will simply say as he has done without giving any undertakings whatever that at least he will consider the specific point that i have raised <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support of the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> i must confess that i am distinctly unimpressed by the form of argument which says that because

the nature of this amendment i anticipated that the noble and learned lord might be about to say that and therefore i was ready to move it to be blown off course if i was <e>", "<cs> it was good to

have listened with care to what the noble earl has said but with very great respect to him i do not begin to feel that he has replied properly to the arguments that have been addressed <e>", "<cs> the minister has kindly indicated that he may wish to give further thought to <e>", "<cs> my lords conscious as i am that i am speaking to an amendment which appears to me to be purely consequential upon an argument of principle which your lordships will have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that it paves and is not consequential <e> <s> the main argument on this issue is that it is a grave matter to send a man or a woman to face trial in a strange country perhaps a country they hardly know whose language they do not speak where they have no friends or family to turn to for advice and support no lawyer with whom they are familiar and no member of parliament of either house to champion them <e> <s> such a person although still presumed innocent will be far more cut off from his roots than a

replace a ruined overcoat or something of that kind without great difficulty <e> <s> however there are many people especially as the noble lord says the old who are not so fortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i desire to add a few words in support of the remarks made by the noble lord lord morton <e> <s> in particular i desire to deal very shortly with the arguments that were put before the chamber at committee stage by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a few words in support of the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend says the bill obliges the board to deduct from compensation gratuities paid to a victim by an employer <e> <s> as i recall it in committee it was conceded by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate that the provision might well deter employers from behaving benevolently towards injured employees <e> <s> obviously it will do so <e> <s> the generous employer wants to benefit his employees and not to transfer the burden of assistance away from the public purse on to his own shoulders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged by what has just come from the noble and learned lord lord denning to add a distinct point of my own in support of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is really a drafting matter <e> <s> the point should be uncontroversial <e> <s> it may be that with the press of business the government have not had sufficient opportunity carefully to consider the point <e> <s> after committee i had hoped that it would be the subject of a government amendment <e> <s> i shall reiterate the points which i made in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments are heartily welcomed by noble lords on this side of the house <e> <s> it was a subject on which we had a good deal of discussion in committee <e> <s> the government have now accepted the greater part of the criticisms that we made and the worst of the anomalies of which we gave examples will not now occur <e> <s> i respectfully suggest to the government that they should give further consideration to going somewhat further to make the point absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches strongly support this amendment <e> <s> when the noble earl rises to reply we ask him to answer this distinct question what conceivable objection can there be to giving this information <e> <s> what prejudice to the public interest can there be in making this information known to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour i shall be brief <e> <s> the noble earl has answered some of the questions which i raised and has half answered others but some he has completely ignored <e> <s> he recognises that the opportunity to consult a solicitor is an advantage which derives from these eight-day remands but says that it does not justify eight-day remands which otherwise are not necessary because no progress is being made in the case <e> <s> on the other hand he recognises that the approach will mean that when solicitors visit unconvicted accused persons in prison extra costs will have to be borne by the legal aid fund <e> <s> he then told us that some calculations of comparative costs have been made <e> <s> he does not tell us the basis upon which those calculations were made <e> <s> i would welcome it if he were to write to me on this subject so that we can see how these calculations which were not available in committee have been made and upon what basis <e>", "<cs> my lords on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that merely to intone the virtues of the home office defeats better arguments <e> <s> i have listened with care to what the noble earl has said i have read with care what he has written <e> <s> i shall not enlarge the argument at this hour by demonstrating that that is so <e> <s> my position remains <e> <s> i am satisfied that the main inspiration of the governments experiment is economy <e> <s> i predict that they are misguided and will be proved to be even in their own terms <e> <s> i have no doubt that the proposal will be reverted to in another place <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords every system of social provision can only be as good as its structure and resources <e> <s> resources must be efficiently deployed as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor emphasised but the prior issue is the resources made available <e> <s> so both sound structure and adequate resources are needed <e> <s> both are necessary and neither is sufficient in itself <e>", "<cs> i too desire to support this amendment <e> <s> so far as i am concerned its signal purpose is to call attention to the fact that there is no secure basis for the funding of the advice centres and the law centres <e> <s> these are the bodies on which the government intend to build a more efficient and effective legal aid system <e>", "<cs> if the noble and learned lord is of the opinion as he has said that it is inappropriate for central government to provide the core funding for these agencies does he believe that local authorities should be under a duty to provide <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as i read the amendment put down by the noble lord lord meston the purpose is to put a duty on the board to establish these regional legal services committees but subject to the approval of the lord chancellor <e> <s> it does not appear to me that there is any duplication with the provisions of clause to which the noble lord lord renton has referred because these are permissive only so far as the board is concerned <e>", "<cs> i am heartened by the support for the amendment that has been offered by the noble and learned lord lord ackner and i see great additional force in the reason that he gave for his support <e> <s> i have heard the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor say that the power which it is suggested the advisory committee should have in relation to the board is not one which it presently has in relation to the law society <e> <s> if i were generally to accede to that form of reasoning it would follow that nothing new should ever be done for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i could now but for obvious reasons do not seek to answer some of the concerns which the noble and learned lord has expressed <e> <s> however plainly in view of the potentially sympathetic and co-operative posture that he has struck i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords uniformity with scotland may not be an end in itself but to some extent it is inherently desirable <e> <s> the reservation expressed by the noble lord lord renton that these factors being mandatory might be thought to be exhaustive could certainly be dealt with by some expression such as which are not exhaustive <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has indicated he would wish to retain the flexibility to alter these mandatory factors that is to say they might he added to subtracted from or modified by statutory instrument <e> <s> for myself that appears to be entirely sensible <e> <s> the basic purpose of some such provision as this is to promote consistency of practice which since we are talking of justice is no doubt an aim of justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble and learned lord would explain how the new legal aid board can conceivably become a watchdog in the public interest over a system which it is administering <e> <s> does he not understand that the public can have confidence only in a watchdog which both is and is seen to be independent <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a deeply unattractive bill <e> <s> it is partisan it is punitive it is disproportionate <e> <s> by disproportionate i mean that it is an excessive reaction to what it addresses <e> <s> so i ask whether its real purpose is not to improve industrial relations but to settle old scores with the unions

to me that the amendment is all about fairness <e> <s> misconduct means a serious breach of contract of employment <e> <s> the words <e>", "<cs> has the minister shuffled his papers <e> <s> the question to which this amendment is directed and no other question is whether individuals on approved training schemes should lose their places by reason of single acts of misconduct <e> <s> does the minister propose to address directly the subject matter of this amendment and not to entertain us with history <e>", "<cs> the subject of this amendment is not the turning down of places offered but the removal from existing places by reason of misconduct <e> <s> can the noble lord address the subject of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been most generous in giving way and i am grateful to him for doing so again <e> <s> it may be my own fault that i have not put the question as clearly as i desired <e> <s> does the minister accept that there can be cases where someone on an approved training scheme has misconducted himself but that it would still be unfair to take away his place because of this misconduct <e> <s> does the minister accept that there can be such cases and that they should be catered for <e>", "<cs> my lords i propose to speak on what i believe to be one of the most crucial challenges facing business education today the education and training of our businessmen to equip them for the common markets big bang in <e> <s> that is the internal market to which the noble lord lord russell of liverpool has just referred <e> <s> it is an attempt to create

disappointed me <e> <s> it would not now be appropriate to test the opinion of the committee and accordingly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i give notice that emphatically the matter is of such great importance that we shall return to it on report <e>", "<cs> i must say that sometimes i wonder whether the government understand what they are doing <e> <s> by this amendment

solution to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is a very welcome amendment <e> <s> the bill as originally drafted provided for review of crown court orders under the contempt of court act forbidding publication of reports of proceedings <e> <s> we on these benches pointed out that it was anomalous that there should be no similar possibility of review where the court went further and decided to sit in camera <e> <s> we made the point too that it was not clear whether there was also a common law jurisdiction to prohibit publication with which the bill should have dealt <e>", "<cs> my lords i move the amendment in the place of my noble friend lord morton of shuna who i can assure noble lords opposite is not victualling himself elsewhere on the premises but is i hope on a train to scotland which appears to be a sensible direction in which to be travelling at this time on a friday afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that the noble earl is right <e> <s> it appears to me however that the first thought was right and it would be a safer and surer course to follow to make it express that exemplary damages are excluded <e> <s> but in the circumstances i do not press the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i was sorely disappointed when i read these amendments <e> <s> my first impression was that they would do something to correct one of the more undesirable and mean-minded aspects of this part of the bill <e> <s> but on the contrary when one reads them carefully what one sees is that they make it even clearer that there will be set off against the compensation payable by the board any insurance or pension payment which results even to a small extent from the payment of premiums or contributions by an employer <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a rich and full debate <e> <s> the house must be grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for bringing this motion before us <e> <s> it is a pleasure to wind up a debate of such quality from these benches <e> <s> it was heartening to read in the july green paper the implicit acknowledgement of what so many of us had been saying for so long that we send too many people to prison for too long <e> <s> but this debate has above all focused attention on the question how do we build on the consensus to keep people out of prison <e>", "<cs> my lords this important bill merits the balanced response it has received from these benches and elsewhere in the house <e> <s> we welcome much in it that is good but deprecate what concerns us as possibly bad <e> <s> my partys concern for child care is long established <e> <s> a labour government were responsible for the children act which provided that local authorities decisions concerning children in their care had to be taken so as to foster the welfare of the child <e> <s> in the family law reform act extended the ancient highly valued jurisdiction of the high court in wardship cases <e> <s> it enabled the high court in proper cases to commit a child to local authority care <e> <s> in the same year there was the children and young persons act <e> <s> approved schools were abolished and community homes established for children in care <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that what came from the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor was most encouraging <e> <s> for my own part however i should have thought that there must be a real risk that clause would be read as impliedly prohibiting the court from asking any person other than a probation officer or a local authority to arrange for an officer of the authority to report <e> <s> there must be a danger that it would be read exclusively as the noble lord lord trafford has said <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor said it is natural in the case of a probation officer or a local authority being asked to arrange for an officer of the authority to assist the court that it should be the duty either of the authority or the probation officer to comply with a request for a report <e> <s> on the other hand it would not be natural for there to be such a duty if a voluntary body was requested to assist in that way <e>", "<cs> it may be possible to deal with that by some kind of notification obligation <e>", "<cs> i specifically support amendment no <e> <s> tabled by the noble lord lord meston <e> <s> as regards the contribution of the noble lord lord renton i cannot see that the discretion vested in the court in clause meets the point <e> <s> that is a discretion which goes only to the relevance to the question of the statement or the evidence <e> <s> if the statement is hearsay it may still of course be relevant to the question <e> <s> therefore it does not appear that the discretion affords any protection <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> what i had in mind was that the court may take account or in so far as it is relevant <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify the position that i adopted a moment or two ago <e> <s> it may be that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor misunderstood me <e> <s> it is perfectly possible that i am wrong but it is equally possible that i have been misunderstood <e>", "<cs> we support this amendment <e> <s> clause goes to the provision by local authorities of day care for the under fives and the supervision of school children <e> <s> as i understand it amendment no <e> <s> would remove all the words in line that is as they consider appropriate <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would remove only the words they consider leaving the line to read as appropriate <e>", "<cs> is not a serious point about this clause of the bill the question of how much humbug is involved in these provisions <e> <s> it is all very well to confer discretionary powers on local authorities to do this or that but if there is not the remotest likelihood of their doing it in practice and no means of enforcing the weak power or the almost non-existent duty that is imposed on them under clause because of the effect of the words as they consider appropriate to what extent are such provisions merely an exercise in window dressing with no substance to follow <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these amendments was to call attention and i think we have done so successfully to an unwillingness on the part of the government to legislate for national standards in this area in contrast to a gross willingness to do so in other areas <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i am inured to disappointment and for that reason i am better able to tolerate the answer that i have received <e> <s> i desire to separate the wheat from the chaff <e> <s> there is no suggestion on the part of the proposers of this amendment that the bill changes <e>", "<cs> if i may say so the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has made a most detailed and interesting answer which i shall read with care <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords and noble and learned lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it has certainly shown that the subject extends beyond mere lawyers law and is of general importance and interest <e> <s> i am sure that the debate will be widely read elsewhere <e>", "<cs> the only difficulty that i see is that on the one hand the amendments that are before the committee now are designed to make more detailed and more particular the discretion to be exercised whereas amendment no <e> <s> which stands in my name would make the discretion much simpler <e> <s> for my own part i prefer not to move amendment no <e> <s> until i have heard the argument on this group of amendments <e>", "<cs> the explanation given by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in reply to my amendment no <e> <s> persuades me and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to lend my voice in support of the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale and suggest that serious thought should be given to expanding the language in terms of amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> i was persuaded to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> by the explanation of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor that the provision as it stands properly construed bore the meaning that he advanced <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the discussion on the amendment led into a discussion on a much more important subject <e> <s> as to the answer i am not clear <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house must be grateful to the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford for bringing before it once again the legitimate concerns of the people of hong kong on the passport issue <e> <s> the government have deployed the argument that wrong signals would be sent if we were to give the people of hong kong a lifeline to great britain in the form of a full british passport <e> <s> but because that security is not there there are as the house has heard the beginnings of an enormous brain drain out of hong kong <e> <s> the noble lord lord wyatt has given the most recent figures in and last year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege to congratulate the noble lord lord rees-mogg on a distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> the house would have expected no other from the noble lord who has enriched our national life in so many spheres <e> <s> it is i who follow in awe of his non-controversial contribution and we look forward with even greater awe to his truly controversial contributions <e>", "<cs> the argument that professional standards are so high that there would be no risks does not impress <e> <s> lawyers are ordinary human beings <e> <s> no lawyer at the front end of litigation should be in the position that the ability to pay next months mortgage turns on the outcome of the case <e> <s> litigation turns on advocates being trusted by the courts and by one another to play fair <e> <s> flirting with contingency fees is another gimmick to avoid state responsibility and to secure justice on the cheap <e> <s> like so many bargain basement practices the lawyers would be no exception to the risk that shoddy standards would result <e>", "<cs> my lords what specific cost benefits to the consumer does the noble and learned lord anticipate if the green paper proposals are implemented by statute <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble and learned lord addressed the question of whether legal costs could be increased as a result of the implementation of the green paper proposals <e> <s> if he has done so can he tell the house how that will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that although it is often desirable to retain the originality of buildings there are some which were originally bad <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill coming as it does from a lawyer one of great experience in this field and other fields is doubly admirable <e> <s> it admits the laws delays and tries to alleviate the consequences <e> <s> to be lawful industrial action requires the support of a ballot of all the workers likely to be involved <e> <s> the ballot in favour of action then becomes a ticket of admission to the immunities <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having been in the chamber during the speech of the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> i was absent for the same reason as that given by other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a particular pleasure to follow the distinguished vigorous and economic maiden speech of the noble lord lord sainsbury of preston candover not merely because he is an honorary bencher of the inner temple of which i have the honour to be a bencher but because his services to the arts which are too broadranging to list and extend far beyond the opera house are of such value to the country at large <e> <s> the noble lords contributions to the future proceedings of your lordships house over a wide canvas are keenly anticipated <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to wind up from these benches but on on my own behalf <e> <s> i echo my noble friend lord mishcon who opened up from these benches <e> <s> this is a subject for individual judgment and not for party line <e> <s> that is the position of my party and i wind up on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house in that a longstanding commitment will prevent me remaining until the conclusion of this debate <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady hooper in her reply to the debate feels able to deal with any of the questions that are troubling me about the bill i shall of course tomorrow read with care in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that what will emerge from the consultation process is an independent training authority which will be charged with giving accreditation to laboratories and businesses or local authorities offering in-house training <e> <s> i hope that in line with ec directives inspectors will meet the standards set by an independent testing authority <e> <s> the regulations should include provisions for batch records traceability of source of food and additives in the production process <e> <s> they should also require quality control tests to be undertaken by the food producer and the appointment of quality control staff distinct from the production line staff for in-house quality control <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble and learned lord lord donaldson of lymington the master of the rolls <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in the previous second reading debate explained that he had the authority of the noble and learned lord in his absence to communicate his views to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does so from his seat <e> <s> the court in its discretion may <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged <e> <s> i accept the bill in good faith <e> <s> i accept what was said by the noble and learned lord and i support the bill <e> <s> i confess to surprise at the position expressed on second reading by the noble lord lord strathclyde that in all circumstances the ballot must have a finite shelf life of days so that her majestys judges may not be trusted with a discretion to extend it in proper circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to wind up from these benches some seven hours minutes after the debate began at pm <e> <s> there seems to be no lack of appetite for this subject in your lordships house <e> <s> our debate on the green papers on th april occupied hours minutes so that perhaps the appetite is becoming a little more under control <e> <s> in winding up i shall certainly not regard it as boundless <e>", "<cs> i would like to bring the support of these benches to both these amendments <e> <s> i focus on amendment no <e> <s> e which is designed among other things as the noble lord said to remove an inequality which the high court masters <e>", "<cs> my lords the most depressing feature of the debate about the social charter is the governments hostility to social objectives which are broadly uncontroversial in the rest of europe and if adopted would create no more than a reasonable expectation that the workforces within the single market will share equitably in the benefits intended to flow from it <e>", "<cs> my lords he went on to declaim <e>", "<cs> my lords following the contributions of the three noble lords who have just addressed your lordships house perhaps i may remind the noble and learned lord on the woolsack that when replying to various amendments in committee which addressed the resource issue he was good enough to say <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the amendment not for any partisan reason as a member of the bar but because i believe it to be of great value to the consumer and of major constitutional importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that it is a matter of judgment but with respect i differ from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> in one part of his response he suggested that the ombudsman not looking at these matters was a corollary of the immunity rule it would be inappropriate for the ombudsman to look at these matters if the court could not do so in the context of a negligence action <e> <s> he also said that what the complainant would <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down will he say what are the distinctive characteristics of the scottish legal tradition and history which justify the various differences between the scottish and english legal systems to which my noble and learned friend lord ackner referred <e>", "<cs> my lords as i recall the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard much from the government during the passage of the courts and legal services bill through this house about access to justice <e> <s> the government have told us that <e>", "<cs> my lords i confine my speech to three subjects the eligibility limits the extension of legal aid to tribunals industrial immigration and social security and the impact that the courts and legal services bill may have on access to legal aid for those who need it essentially the point made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple purpose of the amendment is to add a presiding judge to the membership of the advisory committee while preserving the lay majority <e> <s> in committee my noble friend lord murray of epping forest correctly emphasised the necessity of getting right the overall membership of this large advisory committee with its lay majority <e> <s> we accept that the knowledge of what is happening on the ground particularly at first instance which the presiding judge would have would be an invaluable addition to the committees store of knowledge and experience <e> <s> the amendment expressly recognises the maintenance of the lay majority which we support <e> <s> accordingly we on these benches support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> it has been light in the number of contributors but heavy in the weight of the contributions it has attracted <e> <s> i assure noble lords that i accept that our comparative international standing in upholding liberty is high

commend to your lordships house despite what the noble lord lord beloff said when addressing your lordships so characteristically on behalf of the man on the clapham omnibus <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl the deputy leader of the house for his clear explanation of the governments thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i confine my speech to a single important issue of principle the exclusion of judicial review in a system designed to bolster confidence in hong kong <e> <s> the provisions of the bill are unclear and the task to which your lordships may think we should set
