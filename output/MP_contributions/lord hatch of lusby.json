the neb is prepared to produce titanium which is vital to this country and where private enterprise is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that britain has a special responsibility in this case in view of the obvious welcome that was given at the time to the overthrow of ex-president obote and bearing in mind that both president nyerere and president kaunda from the start condemned the racialism of ex-president amin as well as the fact that the world has now been rid of a dictator by the action of a very poor country <e> <s> does the noble lord also agree that it is the duty of all members both of the commonwealth and of the world community to lend that country support in the use of her treasure in a task which affects us all and which is an international obligation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble marquess give way this is a matter of genuine puzzlement to me as it

policeman every civil servant <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to the noble lord lord carver on a remarkable maiden speech and may i also add congratulations for his efforts in the rhodesian crisis and attempts at assistance to solve that crisis in the last few months <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to answer that question because in my opinion and i have said this consistently for years what you call the guerrillas or what are called out there the freedom fighters are doing the job for which the british government are themselves responsible <e> <s> there was a rebellion in rhodesia <e> <s> what did the british government do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just about to finish and i shall willingly give way for as long as noble lords like <e> <s> the guerrillas the noble lord speaks of were and are acting against a regime which has revolted against her majesty the queen <e> <s> i ask what are the british government doing <e> <s> those guerrillas have been losing their lives doing the job that the british government have always said is their responsibility <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i fully recognise the force of that point <e> <s> those of us who have had any influence in rhodesia and again the noble viscount lord boyd will bear this out have been trying for years to bring together a single nationalist movement in rhodesia as in tanzania and eventually in kenya and in other countries and we have failed <e> <s> i do not deny that for one moment <e> <s> however it is still our responsibility to go on trying <e> <s> otherwise the future of that country will be too awful to contemplate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be interrupted at any time but it would help if the questions were pertinent <e> <s> of course there has been a refusal by the patriotic front to attend a conference but it was the patriotic front which said that it would go to a conference first when the smith regime said it would not <e> <s> then what happens <e> <s> smith and sithole go to washington and what is the news on the same day that they announce that they have changed their minds and that they will attend a conference <e> <s> rhodesian planes

it was told in that spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not know that that is why i was asking the question about the boyd report <e> <s> my second question is did lord boyd or any of his team go to lusaka and maputo to see the leaders of the opposition joshua nkomo and robert mugabe <e> <s> because they also are parties to the political future of rhodesia <e> <s> it would seem to me obvious that

established by the americans themselves that there were no russians and no cubans in angola until the country was invaded by the south africans <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl opposite give this house a direct answer as to whether her majestys government consider that the fifth principle has been fulfilled that is that the constitution not the election but the constitution has been submitted to the rhodesian people as a whole <e> <s> secondly does his answer suggest that her majestys government consider that the patriotic front has no further part to play in the future agreement in rhodesia-zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> but my lords would the noble earl please <e>", "<cs> my lords my question really has not been answered <e> <s> i am still asking whether her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to try to help the noble earl to understand the purport of my question by

changing the question and for any inconvenience that that has caused may i ask whether he will answer directly the question on the order paper does her majestys government accept or not accept that

final supplementary question <e> <s> would he agree that there is some parallel between the situation in zimbabwe-rhodesia today and that which existed when his noble friend lord home of the hirsel put his constitution to the population of rhodesia <e> <s> is there not a difference between voting under a constitution which is the only constitution you can vote under and voting for a constitution

competition between subsidised beet sugar from europe and the cane sugar on which many of our commonwealth friends rely for their economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether he is aware that i asked a similar question of the previous government and was given virtually the same answer <e> <s> is he further aware that the opportunities for british business for investment and for cooperation with the guinea government in the exploration and development of minerals in particular is very ripe today in guinea that the door will not remain open for ever and that here is an opportunity for british enterprise in this very promising country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that answer would the noble lord tell us whether the government have protested to the sporting clubs particularly to the rugby clubs which have been visiting south africa recently and the surrey county rugby club which has visited rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was have the present government protested to those clubs since they came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by associating myself very warmly with the tributes that have been paid to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord miles <e> <s> this is not just in a conventional way because i shall be referring to a part of his speech during the comments that i make <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords but i just do not accept that interpretation <e> <s> when len murray says that he can see the possibility of this leading to industrial action i agree with him <e> <s> i do not agree with anybody who says we

sympathy whatever with the use of industrial action for political purposes <e> <s> but let me return for the last few minutes to what should be the alternative to the philosophy which has been put forward <e> <s> i know that a number of noble lords have criticised me in the past for speaking for too long <e> <s> i would just ask them to see how many interruptions there are in my speeches and add on that time <e> <s> i have only a moment or two left but it is imperative to say what is our alternative and i say it very simply and in over-generalised terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has answered a question i did not ask <e> <s> i was waiting for him to answer a question i did ask <e> <s> i did not want to interrupt him before the right opportunity occurred <e> <s> the whole thrust of what i was saying was that between and under the heath government before the u-turn british manufacturing industry declined the number of british manufacturers declined and investment went abroad <e> <s> what reason has he to think that the same policies followed this time will not have the same consequences <e> <s> and if they have the same consequences what is his policy then <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that so long as his government continue with their two-nation policy based on the confessed principle of inequality it makes it so much more difficult for responsible trade union and labour leaders to restrain those who would take industrial action to defend their standard of living <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his courtesy in answering my question <e> <s> may i ask him to draw to his right honourable friends notice the fact that it was a member of his party who stated that arising out of the bingham report the whole integrity of parliament was at stake and that therefore there is a very strong inter-party case for further examination of the responsibility for the revelations that were made by bingham in his report <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he is aware that in every trade union there is a constitution under which the general secretary and the president of the union are elected by the members and can be dismissed by them in exactly the same way as the shareholders he mentions can act <e> <s> the big difference is that whereas a member of a trade union can contract out of contributing to the funds of a political party a shareholder cannot <e> <s> he may object <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him whether he

in the subjects they have raised particularly the noble baroness lady masham in what she had to say about the deprivation of rural areas <e> <s> i share with her the fate of living in such a rural area where both rail and bus transport are almost non-existent <e> <s> i am also tempted to follow her in what she had to say about small garages <e> <s> i have previously pointed out to your

likely to be increased this year <e> <s> in the cambridge econometrics report which i quoted from earlier this afternoon a paragraph suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to my noble friend lord brockway for putting down this question <e> <s> i confess that i feel somewhat of a pretender if not a young pretender in following lord brockway with whom i have worked since i was a boy

pleasure to speak following my noble friend lord ritchie-calder whose practical work in the third world is acknowledged in every quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene

cent <e> <s> down to per cent <e> <s> for the current year with no promise as to what it will do for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i do not intend to press him on this point today in view of the very delicate nature of the negotiations in view of his long journey

effect before our debate next week would he agree that the comments in australia of his right honourable friend the prime minister made i was glad to see in his absence will make his task and that of the british government much more difficult at the commonwealth conference which is to take place next month <e>", "<cs> my lords i must press the noble lord on this <e> <s> surely to say in advance that parliament is not going to pass the sanctions order or is unlikely to pass the sanctions order or will have difficulty in passing the sanctions order in november is untrue as the government know

whether it is a fact that the swap agreement is made between bp and the continental oil company in which bp will send oil from indonesia to durban despite the fact that the indonesian government has declared a boycott on its oil being sent to south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords this question was accepted by the table <e> <s> may i press the noble lord the foreign secretary as we did have a little

interesting issue which he raised about the effect in south africa of what happens in rhodesia <e> <s> would he agree with me that the future of racial under-understanding in south africa would be even more enhanced if the struggle in rhodesia comes to an end through a round table conference of whatever kind between all the parties involved <e> <s> would the noble lord recognise that it is only

tanzania as a result of its removal of the dictator amin who incidentally was sustained by western and other governments has been the blow that it has suffered not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too welcome the visit of the british diplomat to namibia and pretoria and ask the noble lord whether her majestys government will pay particular attention during the transitional period to the somewhat indiscriminate extraction of minerals from namibia which may very well have a prejudicial effect on the future of that country after it becomes independent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since the speech referred to by the noble lord the foreign secretary a number of things have happened and the situation has moved <e> <s> may i ask him whether he would agree to three major propositions on which british government policy should depend at lusaka first that there is a serious erosion of bishop muzorewas always somewhat tenuous authority secondly that the only real hope of peace in that country lies in negotiations between the internal regime and the patriotic front and thirdly arising from the first two points that british policy should therefore now concentrate on promoting a dialogue between the two sides in order to bring peace and provide an opportunity for the settlement which the noble lord is attempting to reach <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i deliberately put this question down as late as possible before the recess in order that the government should have the maximum amount of time to consider the issue which i raised before and which i also raised with the previous administration <e> <s> is he further aware that the object of the question is to try to encourage promote stimulate and assist british trade in conjunction with the government of guinea a country where there is a great opportunity at the moment but which will diminish rapidly as our competitors get in before us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that there are already negotiations about this question of the debt and that there is a much more hopeful response from conakry than was so in the past <e> <s> is he further aware that if he does not know that the presence of an ambassador or at least a substantial consulate in a wealthy country like guinea is important to business men and to trade then the business world will tell him so <e> <s> at the moment there is no more than an honorary consul a lebanese who cannot speak english <e>", "<cs> my lords i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble viscount is not going to continue to tear me to bits <e>

the tax cuts went to per cent <e> <s> of the richest of this country <e> <s> overseas aid must be administered according to principles and that has been done over the past five years particularly by the last minister dame judith hart <e> <s> but it is estimated that for every that is spent in overseas aid this country gains between and and at the same time new employment is created in this country <e> <s> i shall simply leave the noble viscount with that thought <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he will lift his eyes above the clouds that the government have drawn around themselves in the past three months to the much wider and more important horizons of the rest of the century <e> <s> is he aware that for the past two and a half years this committee sitting and acting voluntarily have spent many hours producing a report <e> <s> this was done with the assistance of devoted officials in the ministries <e> <s> it was a report which was accepted by five ministries and designed to encourage and stimulate organisations in this country right from the formal education system through the voluntary community education system to the media and to spread the concept and understanding of the international world with which the ministry is dealing <e> <s> this subject is of the utmost importance to the future of the present and coming generations of this country <e> <s> will the noble earl tell us whether the government at least in principle give the same support to the report and the recommendations of this committee as did the previous administration <e>", "<cs> my lords might i assist the noble earl <e> <s> the money he is speaking about has nothing to do with aid to developing countries <e> <s> it is entirely confined to support of projects put forward by a whole range of voluntary organisations and some formal organisations in this country in order to help those who are spreading international understanding among the people in this country <e> <s> in his reply to me he referred to the fact that a review of public expenditure was being undertaken and this item would have to take its turn along with the rest <e> <s> would he not agree that this is not like the rest of public expenditure but is a unique exception <e> <s> would he not agree that the money that he has spoken about is not going to the committee it is going to those organisations which the committee are assisting to spread international understanding in this country <e> <s> in that respect it is an earnest of the intention of this government to spread international understanding between now and the end of the century and a meagre -odd is a very small amount for such a tremendous task <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree first that he has not answered my question and secondly that this committee has been composed unlike the notorious quangos of distinguished men and women from all over the educational world and elsewhere who have worked unstintingly and without payment for years and have produced a report of the utmost value to the educational system both formal and informal of this country <e> <s> in those circumstances why is this committee to be closed down <e>", "<cs> but surely my lords the committee that has been sitting is not dependent simply on spending money <e> <s> it has been advising the educational system of this country <e> <s> is

country namely zambia which is playing an important part behind the scenes in these negotiations is invaded from without and its lifeline to tanzania on the tanzan railway is cut <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first add my congratulations to the three maiden speakers this afternoon each of whom brought to us a particular and special personal experience which enriches our debate and each of whom we hope to hear again <e> <s> it is strange is it not <e> <s> that this is a debate on the family the family which has always been upheld as the great symbol of the conservative party of great britain

worthwhile house in which to speak about the family <e> <s> i think the answer to that is very easily encapsulated in the figures already given <e> <s> i am not going to repeat the many excellent speeches on specialist subjects made this afternoon but the fact that you can put on one side the million that this government are going to find as extra government finance in order to support the private schools of this country while at the same time they are cutting down the money available for school milk school meals school transport for the number of teachers and above all perhaps for school books in the public sector of our education system gives the answer in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to know if that is the case whether that includes the extra cost imposed by vat

<e> <s> that work as i understand it from the answer this afternoon has now been wantonly abandoned <e> <s> i am simply pointing out that the future of the children in this country depends upon their consciousness of their role in the world in which they live and i want to know what the government are going to do to replace the work which this afternoon they have announced they have abandoned <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain to the house why he believes that the removal of foreign exchange controls in this year will have any different effect in british industry from that which it had when it was tried under a previous conservative government when it was tried in and when the capital released left this country for other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord trefgarne for his kind words about my noble friend lord brockway whom we all miss today who would have been speaking in this debate and who has certainly done as much as or more than any other living britisher for the cause of the third world <e> <s> i should also like to express my sympathy with the noble lord opposite <e> <s> he has the thankless task of

understand from the minister concerned that that decision was taken on may th or th in other words it was taken within a few hours of the general election results being known <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to that is very simple we are a trading country we cannot look parochially to the economy of this country as though it were surrounded by a wall <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> that may be the opinion of the noble lord it is not my opinion and it is not my opinion according to experience <e> <s> as i have just pointed out when cuts have been <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords and i have already

increased by per cent <e> <s> in real terms over the next four years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i just answer the point that he has made about the loan to mozambique <e> <s> in fact the loan to mozambique was a loan to a friendly country a country which had just emerged from many years of colonial rule <e> <s> it was a loan for development and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him three specific questions arising out of his answer <e> <s> first he tried to convince us that there was no change in the policy of the new administration so far as aid is concerned <e> <s> will he tell us whether or not the present government believe in direct government monetary support for development education <e> <s> secondly he said that this was simply an administrative matter and suggested that there was no policy difference <e> <s> then he gave the instance of the ships to vietnam and commented on that that this was surely a big gap between the aid policy and the foreign policy <e> <s> does not this then imply that in future it will be foreign policy that decides what aid policy shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree with his right honourable friend the home secretary that the proposals mentioned in this question are both sexist and racialist and if so does this not directly contravene the pledge given by the conservative party in its manifesto that all british citizens should be treated equally <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the statement of the leader of the house which indicates a much more seemly

the war and would he agree that the country of zambia has to its own detriment played a very noble part at the request of successive british governments in the application of sanctions <e> <s> is he really telling the house that when he is discussing matters with the leader of the illegal rgime in salisbury he is making no reference to this attempt at economic boycott of a commonwealth country which is friendly to britain <e>", "<cs> but my lords would the noble lord not agree that this particular measure is designed to starve the people of zambia and if as he claims the british government

nothing to do with the guerrillas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure why i am frequently listed to speak following the noble lord lord barnby <e> <s> perhaps it is because it is known that i feel a very deep affection for him as i am sure the whole house does <e> <s> however in my case i agreed with not a single word he uttered on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i did not want to interrupt his argument would he follow a point that he made one stage further for enlightenment <e> <s> he rightly said he was frightened of external interference in rhodesia <e> <s>

necessity for a general agreement <e> <s> if two or more parties are negotiating with an object of reaching an agreement any party has a veto inevitably it must have a veto <e> <s> if any part says no that is a veto a veto to agreement <e>", "<cs> it is a pity that the foreign secretary has already replied to this because there were certain questions that i asked in my speech on second reading this afternoon which were not answered and i have to make implications in relation to those answers now <e> <s> i do so in this way <e> <s> i asked directly whether the government will use the powers in the bill in order to re-enact section of the act which applies to sanctions <e> <s> i was not given an asnwer but i believe that i am right in saying and i trust that he will correct me if i am wrong that the noble lord the foreign secretary has answered that and that the government do not intend to re-enact the sanctions under section <e> <s> where does that leave us <e> <s> it leaves us with a government who have declared that they will lift sanctions when there is a return to legality and who at the same time are saying we are lifting sanctions now <e> <s> i think that this is a dilemma it is a contradiction which will be seen perhaps much more importantly in the rest of the world than in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while his noble friend the foreign secretary may <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the noble lord to answer my original question <e> <s> this has nothing to do with the lancaster house conference <e> <s> this is an attack on a friendly commonwealth country which is our friend and which has been trying to assist the british government in their mediations <e> <s> is this the attitude which the present government take to the commonwealth that they will allow and excuse an attack from another country on a friendly commonwealth country and call it nothing more than an incident <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a supplementary question from me last week i understood the noble lord to admit that there was some dichotomy within the conservative party manifesto at the election <e> <s> if he has read beyond what he has just quoted he will find that the conservative party put itself forward as a party which was going to control immigration in the interests of better community relations in this country but it then went on to insist that the rights of all british citizens today should be equal <e> <s> does this white paper not contradict that pledge <e> <s> is it therefore not the case that the government are introducing legislation which is completely opposed to the mandate on which they were elected <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has already referred to the fact that he answered this question on st june does he recall that he said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that his <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome a part of that answer which the noble lord the foreign minister has given but would he not agree that the most effective way of stopping incursions into zambia would be to make very firm and strong representations to general walls who is a part of the lancaster house conference <e> <s> is he aware that his noble friend lord trefgarne yesterday agreed that zambia had been in the forefront <e>", "<cs> my lords can i persuade the foreign secretary to distinguish between the civil war in rhodesia or zimbabwe-rhodesia and the invasion of a fellow member of the commonwealth namely zambia <e> <s> can i not persuade him to condemn the invasion of zambia <e> <s> also as his right honourable friend in another place indicated yesterday that representations had been made to the salisbury delegation and it is apparent that those representations are being defied and ignored will he not make still further representations to general walls to stop this attack on a friendly commonwealth country that has played a very great part in the success or partial success of the lancaster house talks <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he is saying that it is not simply a question of economy but that this government are in principle opposed to government support for development education in this country <e> <s> if that is what he is saying may i draw his attention to the letter that has been written from major voluntary and church organizations in which it is alleged that the withdrawal of government money from development education will destroy many of the voluntary projects which have already been started <e>", "<cs> but with respect my lords the noble lord the minister has not answered my question <e> <s> i am asking specifically is this a matter of immediate economy which we can all understand whether we agree with it or not or is it a matter of principle that this government do not believe in putting government money along with money raised by voluntary organisations for the purpose of development education in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords on friday the prime minister stated that the lancaster house conference was within an ace <e>", "<cs> was within an ace of success <e> <s> may i ask the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord now answer my first question <e> <s> does he agree that this is the missing ace and that it would be a tragic disaster if after all the exceptionally tough and skilful negotiations that have taken place by all sides in lancaster house the negotiations were to founder on this one central issue as to whether there should be a third force during the pre-electoral period and if asked during the post-electoral period <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it from the ministers answer that the government do not intend to change the representation in conakry <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that i have raised this question with successive governments over the past year for the purpose of trying to assist the british export trade in competition with the germans the swiss the americans the italians who all see the opportunities for co-operation in the development of the country of guinea which is now looking for co-operative arrangements with the western world <e> <s> is he aware that the level of diplomatic representation in conakry is a crucial issue so far as the business world of britain is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have the highest regard for the new ambassador in dakar <e> <s> would he consider increasing the commercial expertise in dakar if he cannot increase the diplomatic representation in conakry to assist the business world of this country in its competition with the businessmen who are now flocking to what some people consider to be the wealthiest country in west africa <e>", "<cs> my lords associating myself with all the desires of every member of this house that the noble lord the foreign secretary is successful this afternoon in getting agreement and also noting the very real warning of the noble lord lord gladwyn about the real fears of the patriotic front which i repeat are real fears without going into any details which obviously are inappropriate this afternoon may i ask the noble lord whether he still stands by the statement which he made in this house that the sending of a governor depends upon an all-party agreement on a cease-fire <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the foreign secretary to be a little more forthcoming with this house <e> <s> would he not agree that over the past few weeks the one single issue that has prevented agreement on the cease-fire is the belief and i stress the word belief on the part of the patriotic front that its forces could be massacred could be attacked by the forces of the salisbury rgime <e> <s> he has said in his statement that there will be disengagement and that he believes his new proposals will satisfy the patriotic front <e> <s> could he tell this house where the forces of the salisbury regime are going to be stationed during the interim period by whom they are going to be monitored and what authority the governor will have over them to prevent such incidents as the invasion of zambia and mozambique over the last weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend to follow the noble lord who preceded me except to correct him on one fact <e> <s> there are now about two to three times as many europeans living in kenya as there were before independence <e> <s> is it not remarkable that in the latest election in kenya one of the white citizens of kenya was elected a member of parliament by a massive majority from an almost entirely african electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords no i would not agree with that <e> <s> one cannot judge the time that they will spend there but it is a very common feature of black independent africa for there to be far more europeans living in those countries today than there were before independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend lord stewart of fulham for raising this issue <e> <s> i only wish that it had been possible to combine this debate with the debate that we had last night on immigration because i believe that the views that have been expressed about the value of a mixture of cultures and of individuals from different cultures would have been particularly appropriate in view of some of the speeches we heard during yesterdays debate <e> <s> it has been clearly proven by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord whether bearing in mind the number of reports that have been made and the number of answers which have been given to me about the statement which will be forthcoming from the attorney general he can give us any clear idea as to when this statement is coming <e> <s> i ask this particularly in view of the fact that the other place has already expressed a view it did so in the last parliament that there should be a public inquiry and that one of the noble and learned lords own colleagues has stated that this is a matter which calls into question the whole integrity of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot with sincerity join in the chorus of congratulations which have been expressed to the noble lord the foreign secretary with regard to the conduct of this conference and i am sure he is the last person who would want insincere compliments paid to him <e> <s> i believe he has made mistakes i believe he has aroused unnecessary frictions and as i shall try to show in my speech i believe that the conference could have been concluded successfully much earlier <e> <s> however i should like to congratulate him and very sincerely on two points <e> <s> the first is in cutting the talons of his own prime minister and those members of his own party who have been traditionally supporters of the ian smith white-supremacy rgime and more lately of the smith-muzorewa rgime and in forcing a change in what was thought to be at the time of the election conservative party policy <e> <s> secondly i should like particularly to congratulate him on his great courage in doing what no british government has had the courage to do since and that is to involve the responsibility of the british government and the british parliament which i believe has always been the crucial issue in the ending of udi <e> <s> that i believe has given britain the opportunity for the first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad the noble viscount has raised that point because it is one that has been raised by so many noble lords on this side of the house and indeed a number of noble lords on the other side <e> <s> of course there are soviet advisers of course there are soviet weapons of course there is a danger of the involvement of cuban troops just as there was the involvement of cuban troops in angola after the south african army as attested by the americans

fighting for self-determination inevitably turn to those who will help them <e> <s> they are not turning to the russians because they are russians but because they cannot get help from western europe

of principles that we hold to make a <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would allow me to intervene if he describes members of the patriotic front and similar people as communists and terrorists

that the noble lord was going to continue on the same point because he has not answered the question which i asked nor that which my noble friend lord wigg asked <e> <s> i quoted specifically from the under-secretary who in the debate in another place last week said <e>", "<cs> in full support of my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies i draw the attention of the committee to the issues involved in this question <e>", "<cs> i very much regret that there is not the same amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has not answered the simple question involved here or made any response to the appeal made by noble lords on this side of the committee <e> <s> i quote to him paragraph of a paper which the government submitted to the lancaster house conference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister one brief question in two parts <e> <s> as i understand it perhaps he will correct me if i am wrong this order gives power to the governor both to command the armed forces and to order the police <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my congratulations to everyone concerned in the success of this conference <e> <s> i am sure that the minister and all his colleagues will agree that this is still only a first step and that we hope that we shall all be able to assist in its successful conclusion <e> <s> may i ask two questions which arose out of the debate on the bill yesterday <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us who is actually responsible once the cease-fire has been signed for suppressing any incidents in which that cease-fire is broken <e> <s> will it be the salisbury security forces responsibility to suppress any incidents from their side and the patriotic fronts those on their side or is there any danger of either side being used against the other <e>", "<cs> what about the responsibility for suppression of incidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a great pleasure to be able to support the noble lord opposite in the tone of his question <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord lord trefgarne this question in view of the fact that there are many countries that are allocating aid at a much higher percentage of their gross national product irrespective of the question of economic status is it not time that the government of this country recognised that this is a priority need in the world in which we live <e> <s> will they reverse the policy that they have so far taken of cutting overseas aid despite the low position that we hold in the league table of percentage of gnp <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that three times i have asked this question about the follow-up to the bingham report and on each occasion from both administrations the answer has been that the papers are with the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> so may i ask the noble and learned lord in pressing the second question asked by my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones is there not inevitably a link which has already been given to me three times between the statement that has just been made to the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer the main economic issue that i put to him <e> <s> do the government consider that the work of the british council is an agent for economic commercial and industrial revival which should be fostered for that purpose or do they discard that role entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> would he agree that all british governments have claimed that they are responsible for the actions of first rhodesia and then zimbabwe-rhodesia <e> <s> is he further aware that the chinese who have no responsibility for the actions of the rhodesian government have already partially repaired the railway bridge on the tanzam railway a railway bridge which i might point out is nowhere near any of the guerrilla camps in zambia <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question of my noble friend lord paget will the noble lord agree that the country of zambia which is a member of the commonwealth was asked by the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a fact <e>", "<cs> that the british government have asked the zambian government to assist them to put down the rebellion in rhodesia <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i myself returned with the united nations officials on the same plane on friday of last week and that there is very deep despondency in central africa over the prospects in namibia for two reasons first that there appears to have been a strengthening of resistance within namibia by the turnhalle alliance since the rhodesian elections in the fear that elections in namibia might follcw the same course and secondly that the western nations appear still to be encouraging the export of minerals from namibia despite its being in contravention of the united nations resolution on this matter <e> <s> while i am on my feet may i belatedly congratulate the foreign secretary on his success in rhodesia <e> <s> i was not able to do so previously because i was otherwise engaged <e>", "<cs> my lords i endorse everything that my noble friend lord underhill has said particularly in regard to the excellent imaginative and sympathetic manner in which the officers conducted this election right from early in january <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne introduced this order in a non-controversial way and indeed it is a non-controversial order so i do not propose to question anything in it <e> <s> but may i take this opportunity of asking him two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall the answer he gave me to a similar question on th december when he said after agreeing that zambia had been in the forefront of the troubles in that part of the world that the british government were contemplating discussions with the zambian government <e> <s> are those the discussions to which he is referring and is he aware that in zambia itself despite the poverty which has been increased as a result of the war a great deal of money has been voluntarily donated in order to repair the bridges roads and railways that were damaged in these raids <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree in general that zambia has suffered severely since and udi when the british government asked the zambian government to assist in the policy of sanctions <e> <s> does he agree that in present circumstances with many thousands of refugees from zimbabwe to be looked after by the zambians and i can quote the figure of orphans who are being educated at solwezi it is necessary for there to be an international effort to help zambia back on her feet and that because britain has been responsible for rhodesia and now zimbabwe it is the british government who should take the lead in mounting an international campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that is not an answer to my question <e> <s> i am asking what the government will do if there are requests by civil servants or members of the armed forces to take part in the rugby tour of south africa <e> <s> surely the noble lord is aware that this is a matter of principle <e> <s> would he not agree that it is gross hypocrisy for the government who have been accusing those of us who have been opposed to sporting contacts with south africa of dragging politics into sport now to be quite blatantly using sport for their own purpose in politics <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case why did not the government announce this when they opposed the lions tour of south africa as they have done in thehypotheticalcase of people wanting to go to moscow for the olympics <e>", "<cs> my lords my only comment in following the noble baroness opposite is that she appears to have a much lower opinion of her own sex than i myself or i think most members on this side of the house do <e> <s> i see no reason whatever to suppose that british women would be any more liable to be bribed into the activities that she has suggested than a british man would <e> <s> i just do not see the point in following that kind of argument <e>

the noble lord on some other occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept my warmest congratulations on the courage of the government in taking the decision that they have taken since this question was put down particularly in view of the fact that the prime minister promised her party that british forces would not be deployed in any way in this exercise <e> <s> further may i ask him whether he will consider when the deployment of british military technicians and trainers is being decided the very special requirements of this extremely complex situation in zimbabwe today <e> <s> it is not surely just the conventional sandhurst type of training which is required <e> <s>

in nigeria can be a grave civil danger <e>", "<cs> and will he advise those who are putting together the british team that a great deal of detailed knowledge is required when they are selecting the military advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one last question <e> <s> as one who has spent a great deal of time with all sections of the forces in rhodesia may i ask him whether he

asking what representations the government had made <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the most serious threat to zimbabwe happily lessened now comes from her southern neighbour the republic of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord further aware that it was <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord answer that part of my supplementary question which he did not previously answer <e> <s>

lead in all the international associations of which we are a member in collecting funds for this great human need in zimbabwe irrespective of the political policy followed by the new government <e>",

for his own government and the guinea government in their constructive approach to breaking this impasse <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that during their visit the minister leading the delegations pointed out that guinea is rich in bauxite iron ore gold diamonds and uranium and that this offers an excellent opportunity to british business to collaborate with the guinea government in an important new industrial venture oversees which could help our overseas trading balances <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord also aware that the president of guinea m skou tour has just last month

fairer way of conducting that election <e>", "<cs> my lords it was simply a repetition in lusaka of what i had already said in this house <e> <s> i considered that the appointment of lord soames as the governor was a mistake not because i have any personal anomosity towards lord soames as a person but because lord soames was a prominent member of the conservative party that had fought the election on the policy of recognising the muzorewa/smith rgime <e> <s> what i was advocating in this house and what i advocated in lusaka was that the governor should be an impartial person not drawn from either side of the house as had already been done under the owen/vance plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i would remind the noble earl that i have now been interrupted four or five times so he might like to take that off the clock <e> <s> as to the relevance of what i am saying what i have been describing are the preparations of the british government for the independence of zimbabwe <e> <s> briefly i

have overlooked its content and would like it now to be removed <e> <s> i say this in no party spirit <e> <s> i put this suggestion to them on the testimony of their own leading members of the cabinet <e> <s> i want to quote first from the noble lord the foreign secretary who in this house on th february at column of the <e>", "<cs> i have only two or three words to say in reply to the noble lord opposite who spoke following my opening remarks <e> <s> i think he has misunderstood the purpose of this clause <e> <s> we are not talking here about an alternative between the overseas development

appeal to noble lords particularly many of the noble lords who have a special interest in overseas development and to the government not to oppose the removal of this clause which will take away an opportunity for increasing our contribution first to the development of developing countries and secondly and equally importantly to the development of our own industries in their relationship with the developing world <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has agreed that the implementation of the brandt report has an advantage to the industrialised nations as well as to the developing nations

report in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that the work of the commonwealth observers in rhodesia during the election was of crucial importance <e> <s> would he further agree that their report is an historical document which should be as widely available as

with my noble and old friend lord hale but i do so on this occasion and i take his own words to illustrate my first disagreement <e> <s> my noble friend said that amnesty means the abolition of

this order introduces discrimination and i wish that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor were here because i should very much like to hear his views on the question of natural law <e> <s> does it square with natural law that certain groups of people and certain individuals should be penalised under our law for an offence when we are now asked to grant an amnesty to other people who have been accused of the same offence <e> <s> i doubt it and it is for that reason that i disagree with the argument that my noble friend has put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with everything that my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead has said <e> <s> it is indeed appropriate that it should be my noble friend lord pitt of hampstead especially who welcomes this new state into the commonwealth <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister has already said it will be probably our last opportunity to debate zimbabwe and its relations to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is part of a desperately dangerous world crisis in which we are all participating at this moment <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the house would agree that since the end of the second world war there have been two great world powers in contention and that at those points at which these two world powers clash there is a massive danger of world conflagration which might well see the end of the human race <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the united states was attacking iran what i said was that the united states had taken military action <e> <s> if you land military aircraft on foreign territory that is taking military action <e> <s> i am passing no judgment on whether the united states was correct or incorrect in trying to rescue its hostages i am simply saying that to ask this house to support sanctions as an alternative to military action before military action is taken is quite different from asking the house to support sanctions after military action has been taken because if economic sanctions are applied after military action has already been taken those sanctions are thereby debased <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer to my noble friends question was in fact given by my other noble friend lord brockway when he i thought very persuasively argued that friends indeed good friends must be frank friends <e> <s> many people have talked about racial harmony and being able to get on with the blacks <e> <s> one test that many black people will say they apply to the genuineness of their white friends is whether a white man can say to a black man you are a bloody fool <e> <s> without it being offensive <e> <s> in this case i would suggest to my noble friend lady gaitskell that if we believe as i have argued that sanctions are opposed to the interests of the united states as well as the interests of the united kingdom and as well as the interests of europe and world peace then it is our task to say so and if there is genuine friendship that will be accepted as frank and honest advice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the noble lord that he has not answered the specific question that i asked him concerning diego garcia <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the foreign secretary to clarify one issue which i know has somewhat puzzled a number of members of this house and the other place <e> <s> in the debate on th may we were assured by the leader of this house that the sanctions order which we were being asked to approve would not apply retrospectively and i have the quotation from <e>", "<cs> my lords my first objection to this bill is its title <e> <s> one can understand why the government after their previous experience have decided not to call this an industrial relations act but to call it an employment act is surely a misuse of the english language <e> <s> what has this got to do with employment <e> <s> at a time of rapidly rising unemployment as we have seen from the figures today what have the government done about employment <e> <s> as far as i can see they have done two main things reduced the budget of the job creation scheme which the labour government set up and undermined the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now speaking about the measures that were taken in july of last year <e> <s> the budget of the job creation scheme was reduced i think i am right in saying by million and the powers of the manpower services commission were similarly reduced at the same time <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that does not in any way detract from the point that i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> according to the tapes tonight the figure given today for unemployment in this country over million is the highest figure for may since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add to two points raised by my noble friend lord bruce of donington referring to the developments since the report stage of the bill <e> <s> as my noble friend has pointed out all the economic indicators that have been published since the report stage bear out the fears that have been expressed by this side that this bill along with its accompanying industrial policy from the government is leading to disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister take this opportunity to disassociate his government from the categorisation of people in this country whether they be immigrants or any others into white and non-white <e> <s> if he does so i am certain he will have the support of all parties on this side <e> <s> in doing so will he make it plain to his noble friend behind him that we in this country find it offensive to differentiate people according to the colour of their skin <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is the latest in a series of measures introduced by this government on the social and economic affairs of this country <e> <s> we had the employment bill which was a misnomer because its main object was to undermine the power of the trade unions <e> <s> we had the industry bill again a misnomer because its object was to reduce the power of the national enterprise board and the regional agencies <e> <s> we had the social security bills whose objectives were to reduce social security and i should like to ask the minister who is to wind up the debate tonight in the jargon of the ministry of the environment how many new units of accommodation does he <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord goronwy-roberts has devastatingly exposed the technical nonsense of these orders <e> <s> it will be recalled by the house that on th may my noble friend lord brockway and i spoke against the iran temporary powers bill and also divided the house against it on third reading <e> <s> i should not like it to be thought that because it is inappropriate tonight to divide the house against these orders they have the unanimous approval of parliament <e> <s> indeed what has happened since we had the debate on the bill has only borne out the arguments that my noble friend lord brockway and i put on that occasion and in the interim period between the debate on the bill and the tabling of the orders events have shown exactly what we exposed as our fears <e> <s> may i say first that if either my noble friend lord brockway and i know that i can speak for him on this or i believed that these sanctions orders would lead to the release of the hostages in a reasonable period we should both support them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> is he saying that although the methods differ each of the nine countries will apply sanctions in the same way that we are not going to be different from the other eight in refusing to apply restrospective sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to address himself to a specific example to illustrate the point behind the question <e> <s> does he agree that in the case of a country like jamaica when it is short of foreign reserves as a result of massive increases in oil prices high import costs and declining commodity prices it is a scandal that the imf should make it a condition of supporting its claim for foreign reserves that there should be massive devaluation substantial increases in import prices severe restrictions on budget expenditure <e>", "<cs> and a relaxation of price controls causing drastic cuts in social services in addition to an already long queue of unemployed numbering between and <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the minister back to my original question <e> <s> i am sure that he will accept that the british government have a responsibility as a member of the imf <e> <s> he has mentioned the guidelines of march <e> <s> my question is designed to elicit from the government an indication of whether they consider that since that time conditions of the kind that i have described in fact not in opinion have not put those guidelines out of date <e> <s> will the british government now use their influence to persuade the imf to return to the articles which the minister has mentioned and which include respect for members policies <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent will forgive me if i do not follow the point he has been making in his speech except in one respect <e> <s> he said at one stage that everything had been tried except monetarism <e> <s> this i would challenge and the burden of my remarks is to suggest an alternative which has not been tried by governments of either political party but which seems to me and i believe increasingly seems to many particularly of the younger generation in the world to be an obvious impartial solution to our economic problems <e>", "<cs> my lords is this good enough <e> <s> if the brandt commissions report or the matters arising from it are to be discussed at venice during the current conference would the noble lord not agree that the governments views should be put to parliament before they are put to the summit meeting in venice in order to avoid the difficulty into which the foreign secretary got himself in naples by announcing a policy which was not then supported by parliament here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the commonwealth development corporation is a strictly commercial enterprise carried out with very strict commercial administration that it provides revenue to the treasury that this year it was hoping for a million loan which would be set against the development budget that it was also planning to pay million straight to the treasury which would not be offset against the development budget and that therefore the government treasury will be making a profit out of its operations <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord has appreciated my point <e> <s> is it not the case that the treasury are actually making a profit out of the operation of the cdc <e> <s> would it therefore not be economic folly in the terms of the governments policy to cut down on the loans they make to the cdc which are more than repaid by the profitable enterprise that accrues from those loans <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up the matter raised by my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> would the minister take the opportunity of this statement to pledge the full support of the british government behind the democratically elected chief minister and his government because from reports there would appear to be some dubiety about the degree of support that the french government are giving to that minister in view of the fact that they have withdrawn their gendarmes against the wishes of that minister <e> <s> may i also ask whether it is still the intention of the british government that the marines who we understand are now on their way to the island will go there and will give full support to the elected government there <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the foreign secretary can clarify one aspect of his statement <e> <s> on friday in his absence his noble friend lord trefgarne in answer to a question from me assured the house that the marines who were being sent were to give full support to the democratically elected government and its chief ministers <e> <s> this presumably would include the suppression of any rebellion against that democratically elected government and yet it is reported that the french have a veto on the movement of those marines once they arrive in the new hebrides <e> <s> can the noble lord clear this up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the noble lord the foreign secretary away from the middle east for a moment <e> <s> i understand that it was reported in certain sections of the german press before the venice meeting that herr schmidt intended to raise the issues arising out of the brandt commission report <e> <s> could he tell us whether this was discussed at venice and if so what line the british government took there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has partially answered a number of questions about the defensive qualities of the cruise missile <e> <s> he has not yet answered the question asked by the noble lord lord gladwyn is the cruise missile anything more than a first-strike weapon <e> <s> can it in any circumstances be used as a defensive weapon or is it to be held by the nato countries simply as a bargaining tactic <e> <s> above all will the noble lord please answer directly the question of whether the cruise missile is capable of being used in any capacity other than as a first-strike weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords may i draw the attention of the noble lord the leader of the house to the fact that when i questioned his noble friend the foreign secretary on the previous venice conference the eec conference as to the content of the brandt commission discussion there he asked me to go and read <e>", "<cs> one phrase of the statement which the noble lord has read out quite rightly stated that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the minister for that answer

africa <e> <s> would he further agree that this seems somewhat strange in view of the fact that the policy of <e>", "<cs> may i bring the minister back to my original question my lords <e> <s> while congratulating the government on maintaining the stand taken by the commonwealth in at gleneagles may i ask whether he would agree that in the present circumstances it would reinforce the advice that was originally given by the government to the rugby unions if at this very tragic time that advice was repeated and the government strongly urged the four rugby unions to recall their touring team in view of the violence we have seen in the past week in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lady birk i consider that clause is the core of the bill and that

during second reading <e> <s> in particular i should like to remind him that far from answering the specific issues which i raised during the second reading debate he had this to say in his winding up speech <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> in order to put the record straight i wish to point out <e>", "<cs> this is not good enough <e> <s> there is a basic difference between this amendment and those that have been put down to clause and indeed clause itself <e> <s> this amendment as i understand it would preclude the right of the tenant in rural areas i am confining this to rural areas to purchase a house <e> <s> it is not just the national parks it is not just the areas of great natural beauty it is our countryside and our countryside includes our seaside <e> <s> just go around the coasts of this country and see the number of villages where the traditional community was based on fishing where the fishermen had a council estate which was particularly important when they retired just as it is to agricultural workers where old people could retire <e> <s> it might be very small but it was an essential element in cementing the community together <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i ask the noble lord lord sandford to elucidate a point which has been puzzling me all afternoon <e> <s> he is constantly saying that he is speaking on behalf of this association <e>", "<cs> i realise that there has been a lot of debate during this committee stage on the question of rural areas <e> <s> i believe that it is something which more than anything else unites the different sides of the committee <e> <s> i speak to this amendment specifically because clause deals in chief with the rural areas <e> <s> i want to ask the minister to address himself to one or two issues that are raised although they have been touched on before <e> <s> i do not want to raise the issue of principle <e> <s> as the noble lord lord evans has indicated this is an issue of principle which we have debated before <e> <s> i assure the minister that i had no intention of trying to give him a lecture on local government and i do not intend to do so tonight <e>", "<cs> may i combine my point with that of the noble lord lord ross so that the minister can answer both <e> <s> i have one very simple point of clarification <e> <s> the noble lord said that he could not go any further <e> <s> i think that he can go a step further in this respect that he has been referring to a local authority possibly applying for its area to become a rural area <e> <s> presumably he is not suggesting that the local authority either is a rural area or is not a rural area <e> <s> the parts of an area that come under a local authority could be rural while other parts were not rural <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow my noble friend lord soper for whom i have long had the deepest affection and the most profound admiration <e> <s> i should like to take up the last point that he made and perhaps to add a mite to the alternative to the apocalypse which he is so rightly seeking <e> <s> we are talking today about foreign policy and the motion of my noble friend lord stewart of fulham allows us a very wide range <e> <s> i want to confine my comments to a single though i believe profound subject and i wish to begin by reminding your lordships that foreign policy is indeed an extension of domestic policy <e> <s> so long as we have the nation state it is the duty of those who are responsible for foreign policy to protect the citizens of that state <e> <s> i believe that that point should be extended a stage further <e> <s> the duty is to protect not only those citizens at present living but also their successors <e>", "<cs> this has occurred before my lords and i do not seem to be able to convince the minister that when i am talking about the mutuality of interests i am not talking about aid <e> <s> i was trying to emphasise as brandt does the fact that investment and transfer of resources to developing countries is in our interest as well as theirs <e> <s> it is not charity and it is not aid it is an attempt at a mutual solution to a common problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the british government agree that this is a naked invasion of a sovereign state which has been taking place since th june and would they consider applying the same kind of publicity for their views to the invasion by south africa of angola as they have and it is the same principle if not the same extent to the invasion by the soviet union of afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to the noble lords original answer to my question <e> <s> would he agree and remember that i specifically used the word principle that in principle the invasion of angola is in the same category as that of afghanistan <e> <s> if that is so why was it that the british government abstained in the security council when the security council with the exception of the united kingdom the united states and france condemned that invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second reading of this bill i tried to persuade your lordships to put it in its economic context and i was immediately challenged on the facts that i was quoting <e> <s> i do not think that the challenge and i am sorry to speak in his absence that the noble lord lord orr-ewing made to me on unemployment figures would be sustained if he were here today <e> <s> certainly not after the figures have been published later this week <e> <s> it seems to me that unless we consider the effects of this bill within the social and economic context of our time we have no chance of estimating its effects <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his noble friend the leader of the house publicly declared two weeks ago that the total amount that would be needed in zimbabwe over the next three or four years was of the order of million <e> <s> where is the rest of the per cent <e> <s> likely to come from and what are the british government doing to secure it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the foreign secretary tell us whether it is still the case that the americans are not allowed to use this island for military purposes without consultation with the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords i have taken part in the debates on this bill from the second reading onwards but have particularly avoided intervening in the third reading until now because i have tried at all stages to concentrate on the basic principles upon which the bill has been drawn <e> <s> i believe that tonight we are facing a very serious situation <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin whom i congratulate along with his officials and the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton too has been excellent patient and accommodating in every little detail <e> <s> but i found that every time we came to the principles embodied in the bill the noble lord the minister refused to meet the arguments <e> <s> time after time he referred either to the conservative election manifesto or to there being arguments on both sides or he studiously ignored the arguments <e> <s> and on one occasion he <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that according to a recent survey four out of five zimbabweans are facing famine in the next few months unless something drastic is done in the immediate future <e> <s> is he also aware that the previous rgime in zimbabwe had estimated that it would require million of development money to offset the effects of the war <e> <s> as the last reply i received from the government on this matter indicated that they were trying to mobilise resources from our allies could the noble lord be a little more forthcoming as to what is to be done in this emergency situation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a further supplementary question of which i have given his office notice <e> <s> would he agree that one of the aspects of aid which we can give to zimbabwe is help in training their young people to take over the various positions of responsibility in that country and in that connection could he tell the house what is the present position of the two young ladies miss nkala and miss tshuma who apparently were refused entry to this country when they came here in order to further their education <e>", "<cs> but my lords is it the governments intention to deport these two young ladies tomorrow as i understand according to reports is the present position <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who participated in drawing the attention of the house to the danger to old people in the context of this bill i only want to ask the minister about one point which disturbs me in the amendment which he has proposed <e> <s> i join in the general congratulations well-merited congratulations to my noble friend lady birk and her assistants in representing not just this side of the house but the whole of the house in pushing through this amendment against the will of the government <e> <s> i would still have preferred the text of her amendment in particular paragraphb <e>", "<cs> my lords i heartily agree with the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i am somewhat puzzled by the ministers speech in support of the rejection of this amendment because it is quite different from the reasons which he gave in speaking against the amendment when we were debating it <e> <s> this amendment was carried by this house because there are many members of this house who are desperately anxious about <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me <e> <s> i think this is a very important point which should be got over to the public <e> <s> the figure which the noble lord has just given and i am sure he does not want to deceive anybody is a figure which has been changed at its basis since the election <e> <s> as i understand it and as the noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him to be very careful in what he says about this question because i do not know whether he knows but the zambian engineering services is part of a nationalised industry in zambia and i would hate him to get into trouble with either his masters or his mistress over this issue <e> <s> in view of the fact that this service is employing british workers may i ask him whether he would agree that it would be a very good idea for british firms and british nationalised industries to create further links with industries in the third world in order to assist them in particular in processing the raw materials which are extracted from their countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking whether the government agree that it would be a good idea to encourage british firms to pursue the same line in third world countries as the zambians have in this country <e> <s> would it not be an assistance both for british industry and for the development of world trade if british firms and british nationalised industries linked up with firms of this kind zambian engineering services in joint ventures particularly for the processing of raw materials in third world countries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister say whether during this protracted interim period since the five western countries began negotiations the british government or any other of the five have made representations to the south african government about the continued loss particularly of mineral wealth but also of other economic wealth which is going into the south african treasury at the expense of a future independent namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that if the estimate of the need of zimbabwe was between million dollars and million dollars three years ago with inflation that figure must be much larger today <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us how much the british government are contributing to the immediate emergency fund and are they prepared to increase that amount when the donors conference is held next year <e> <s> finally will the noble lord agree that the future peace and harmony of zimbabwe may very well be determined over the next five years by the emergency aid that can be collected in order to enable the economy to be put straight in the next few years <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one specific question which arises from the questions that i was asking earlier <e> <s> does <e>", "<cs> there is a certain irony in being asked to conclude this debate so that we can go and have dinner <e> <s> however i do thank those who have taken part in it <e> <s> very briefly i would simply say to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that on july four days before the armaments sales were resumed a british citizen miss wilson was released from prison in chile by the british diplomatic officers there <e> <s> can he tell the house whether the british diplomatic mission in chile has been able to discover whether she or anyone else within their purview has been the subject of torture and if the answer is yes how does he equate that with the statement of his noble friend lord strathcona on th march of this year in this house col <e>", "<cs> my lords this really has not answered the question <e> <s> as the noble lord lord avebury has pointed out there have been many substantiated cases of torture in chile <e> <s> it is not simply the question of miss wilson <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that of dr cassidy some years ago <e> <s> there have been many other cases established by reputable international authorities that torture is practised in chile <e> <s> when he says that the british government have to take all sorts of things into consideration how does he equate that with the plain statement of fact made by his noble friend that i read previously and will repeat <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree with the president of the world bank mr mcnamara when he says that a major re-examination of the function of the bretton woods institutions is essential <e> <s> secondly is it the case that the british government the united states government and the west german government blocked this re-examination at the special session despite the fact that the other seven members of the eec and japan all supported the compromise resolution which was produced before the end of that conference <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister really cannot get away with this <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that when <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that when mr mcnamara was speaking in critical terms of our aid programme he was talking about the per cent <e> <s> reduction that this government have brought in <e> <s> and whether it is or makes no difference at all to that issue <e> <s> could i ask him does he agree and do the government agree that in the present chaos of the world economic situation the use of the imfs conditions for the developing countries is quite inappropriate and is not only hindering their development but as my noble friend lord brockway has pointed out is also hindering the recovery of this country by denying them purchasing power which they could use to buy our goods particularly when per cent <e> <s> of our aid is tied to british goods <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister be good enough to educate a very innocent layman <e> <s> he has repeated this afternoon what he said last week to my noble friend lord beswick and my noble friend lord kaldor the governments policy is to restrict the money supply through interest rates <e> <s> does he not agree that his governments own figures show that the money supply has been running way above the projected level <e> <s> is it not therefore logical that the interest rates should have been raised before now and is it any other reason than political cowardice that they have not been so raised <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to answer my question <e> <s> according to his own logic why have the government not increased the interest rates in order to keep down the supply of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm or deny that at this conference which was called because million africans are facing starvation nine countries including not just developed countries but algeria promised immediately extra food aid and that britain did not <e> <s> will he confirm that the british government spokesmen said that they would watch the position <e> <s> what is this position they are going to watch <e> <s> is it the million people starving <e> <s> is it not a disgrace that the british government were the one that stood out refusing to increase their food aid in face of this great disaster and is this not the kind of policy which is giving us a reputation for meanness in the world particularly in the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord the minister is giving a number of figures perhaps he would compare them with those of other countries <e> <s> for instance will he answer my original question as to why britain stood and watched the position when a country like algeria made an immediate pledge of additional aid along with nine other countries <e> <s> is it not the case that there has been and there is growing in this country what is known as a barley mountain <e> <s> is that not of any use to the starving million people who will be facing death during the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and i am quite sure that he is that the whole burden of the brandt commission report is that the recovery of the north or industrial world depends as much on the recovery of the south as does the south on the north <e> <s> will he take the interim period between now and the conference to be held in mexico early next year to ask his noble friend to take an initiative within government circles to work out at least some skeleton plan in which our interests and the interests of the third world can be moulded in such a way as to produce mutual benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a question which is not premature <e> <s> can he assure the house categorically that he and the home office regard the work of the commission for racial equality as a valuable service to race relations in this country <e> <s> will he therefore assure the house that his <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister consider whether the figures that he has given do not suggest that there is a much wider market than that of the eec open to the exports of this country and that if the tariffs were lowered as they have been within the eec without any question of marxist socialism the standard of living of the people of this country could increase the number of unemployed could be decreased and our export market could be greatly expanded because <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord agree that since at least half of the human race is outside the present market we have there an opportunity for increasing the standard of living of the people of this country and reducing the unemployment which we are now seeing increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a question which seems to be particularly appropriate to the question asked by the noble baroness lady elliot <e> <s> has he considered whether in this period of rapidly rising youth unemployment it would be worth while getting together the large number of charitable organisations like oxfam in this country and seeing whether they cannot attract the services of at least a proportion of the large number of young people who are at present without work <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers previous answer to my noble friend to the effect that the government are assisting race relations through their immigration policy may i ask whether he equates policy on immigration into this country with coloured immigration or is he speaking of immigration of all people irrespective of their skin colour <e>", "<cs> how is that assisting race relations my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that some of us believe that the government are perfectly sincere in their efforts to develop trade with the republic of guinea but may i ask him two specific questions <e> <s> first does he recognise that the situation of guinea which is potentially a very rich country is that in common with many third world countries there is at the moment a shortage of cash flow and the investment necessary in order to develop the very rich minerals that they have in that country <e> <s> secondly would he agree that the release just a couple of weeks ago of prisoners who have been held since the invasion of makes the situation as to human rights much more palatable to those of us in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that last answer by the noble lord may i ask him whether the government can hold out genuine hope that ecgd cover which is so important to business in this country as well as to the economic situation in guinea can be restored in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble minister is not responsible for the reports following the visit of the united nations team there but the reports appeared to be extremely negative <e> <s> will he tell us whether he agrees that the renewed invasion of angola by south african troops is handicapping the efforts of the five western powers in this matter <e> <s> is it not consistent with the obstruction that the south african government has been putting up to the suggestions made by the western group and the united nations over the last few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my gratitude to everyone who has taken part in this very stimulating debate <e> <s> most of the points which have been raised have been answered by subsequent speakers but there have been one or two addressed specifically to me that i feel obliged to take up <e> <s> the noble lord lord home suggested that the amendment we are supporting is superflous <e> <s> may i relate that to the question asked by the noble lord lord goodman of my noble friend on the front bench the question of what would happen if this amendment were defeated <e> <s> the answer is very simple indeed and if your lordships will look at any of the surveys done on public opinion over the past five years you will find that answer <e> <s> i would suggest that you look at the schlackman report published two years ago as a specifically government-commissioned report on public opinion on international issues <e> <s> there you will see admittedly over-simplifying the findings that the general finding was that two-thirds of the people of this country were parochially minded and anti-international <e> <s> and that is what you will find if you leave the situation as it is today if you consider that this amendment is superfluous if you consider as the noble lord lord goodman suggested that there was no need to put support behind it <e>", "<cs> my lords may we take it from the ministers original answer that during the course of the discussions at the united nations on this most important issue the british government will use all their influence in order to establish a zone of peace in the indian ocean <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister three questions which relate directly to the preparation for global negotiations <e> <s> first when the vienna conference meets tomorrow is it the case that britain will not be present <e> <s> secondly is it the case that there has been a much heavier cut in development aid than in any other aspect of government expenditure in this country <e> <s> thirdly is it the case that this policy of the british government has been successively criticised and condemned by the commonwealth finance ministers by the secretary-general of the commonwealth organisation and finally by the president of the world bank <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord the minister did not by any means fully answer my question <e> <s> why is it that the british government will be absent from the conference in vienna in the next two days when most of the industrial countries who incidentally have promised increased aid will be present <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not intend again to go through the arguments that we have had in two very lively debates in committee and on report on amendments to the bill but it would seem inappropriate if a word were not said very briefly before the bill becomes law on the attitude that has been taken by so many organisations in particular religious and charitable organisations on the absence from the bill of that international dimension for which we have been pressing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that there is a very widespread feeling in southern africa that the south african government are deliberately postponing any decision about the cease-fire until they are able to destroy the forces of swapo and that if this were so it would ignite an inferno which would sweep right across southern africa <e> <s> do her majestys government condemn the aggression which the south african forces are daily carrying out within the boundaries of angola <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that this conference was originally planned for this month then postponed until june and has now been postponed until october <e> <s> is he further aware that the brandt report has now been published for months which would give any government the opportunity of preparing itself to make a response and does it not suggest that this postponement is yet another example of the lack of political will which killed the pearson report over years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to expand on just one point in his speech <e> <s> i thank him for his very full and courteous reply <e> <s> i hope that his voice will improve perhaps a visit to zambia would do his throat good <e> <s> the noble lord spoke quite correctly about the importance of skilled technicians being made available to the area that we have been considering <e> <s> but can he give some advice to the vice-chancellor of the university of zambia for example <e> <s> the vice-chancellor is now faced with a drastic cut causing great dismay in the british governments support for members of staff that he and the administration would like to recruit in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord the minister expand on what he said about the present governments opposition to apartheid <e> <s> is it the case that president shagari said publicly that he hoped that britain would stop supporting and strengthening the <e>", "<cs> my lords surely on consideration the noble lord would withdraw his suggestion that my question was outside the bounds of the question of my noble friend lord brockway <e> <s> i was referring specifically to a statement made by president shagari during his visit to this country <e> <s> could the noble lord answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords while sympathising with my noble friends concern about the uncertainty raised through this delay can the minister give an assurance that there will be no speeding up of the process that can obviate the very real objections that are being made particularly in rural areas where it takes a long time to collect such objections <e> <s> can the minister assure us that where there are wide objections as there are in many rural areas they will be treated with the fullest possible concern by her ministry <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that those of us who have been most critical of the present governments attitude towards zimbabwe are filled with admiration for the stand which the noble lord lord soames has made in persuading his less enlightened colleagues to support him on this issue <e> <s> will the noble lord convey that to the noble lord lord soames <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that in addition to the decline of per cent <e> <s> that he mentioned the public expenditure white paper also provides for a further decline in the following year of over per cent <e> <s> making over per cent <e> <s> in total and that this is nine times as high as the average government expenditure <e> <s> can he tell the house why overseas aid has been picked out in this way <e> <s> is he further aware that the reduction already made brings down the british contribution to overseas aid to just over per cent <e> <s> of the gross national product round about half the figure in when the country as a whole was half as wealthy as it is today <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a quick question <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> while i thank the minister for that reply my lords may i ask whether she agrees that there is a strong difference of opinion on this issue that on the one hand there are those who think it is crucial that the present generation of british children should break out of the island mentality and become world citizens and that that can be done only if the government give a lead and assistance to the voluntary organisations while on the other there are those who think the government should keep out of it and leave it to the local authorities voluntary organisations and so on <e> <s> where do her department and the government stand on the division of opinion on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree that the words in the pamphlet which her department has issued and which she has quoted will remain as pious platitudes unless there is some action and support by the government in regard to the intentions which they express here <e> <s> since the abolition of the advisory committee on development education which was set up by the last government and then cancelled by the present government has there been any government support for development education <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that reply and will he accept that those who have been pressing for greater trade with guinea are pleased to know that this acceleration in trade on both sides has taken place <e> <s> can he tell us whether there is any question yet of ecgd cover applying to trade with guinea which would certainly increasingly accelerate the figures that he has given <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has attached the question of ecgd cover to the debt could i ask him whether it is not a fact that the debt is below million and in view of the fact that cuts in government overseas aid have already cost jobs in this country would it not be a good gesture both from the point of view of the economy of this country and from that of further business with guinea if that debt were cancelled and serious attempts made to arrange for ecgd cover for business with this potentially very rich country <e> <s> will he also tell us what is the comparison between the figures that he has given and the figures of trade between guinea and our competitors such as france the united states italy and west germany <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that in view of the grossly distorted views put out by a good deal not all of the western press <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> i am sure that there is no question of a deliberate falsification here but if the noble lord will read <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether your lordships realise the character that this debate has taken over the last hour or so <e> <s> we began with a speech from the right reverend prelate it was a speech based on the concept of the human being as a human being and took the issue of nationality right out of the irrelevant subjects of skin colour racial origin and cultural background <e> <s> over the past hour or so virtually every speech has been based upon the assumption that this bill is a part of immigration control and immigration control not because of the numbers of population in this country as the noble lord lord home of the hirsel suggested and not because we are bursting at the seams but because a new element has grown up in our midst over the past to years distinguishable by the difference in the colour of their skins <e>", "<cs> in fact there are more people per year who emigrate from this country than who come here as immigrants <e> <s> what is the difference <e> <s> surely the difference can only be that over the past to years a large section of the people who have immigrated into this country have had a differently coloured skin and have come from different cultures although i must say with my noble friend lord pitt and i am sure he would bear this out there are some west indians who come to this country who are much more british than the british and in cultural terms are sustaining the traditions of britain in a way in which many white british people are not <e> <s> nevertheless surely the history of this country i am sure the noble lord lord home would agree with me in this is one of mixed cultures enriching and stimulating each other <e> <s> are we now to stop that process <e> <s> are we to include in the parochialism which we see on so many sides in different aspects of national life the parochialism of culture <e> <s> surely we are being enriched by the ideas the music and the literature of the west indies india pakistan and of africa and surely our culture is being enriched if we will accept the people who are coming here as human beings and not as skin colours <e> <s> so where is this crisis <e> <s> the answer to that question is the answer to the noble duke what is the connection between <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure every member of the house welcomes the suggestion of the use of open university facilities for this very important task <e> <s> will the noble lord answer directly the question put by my noble friend lady fisher <e> <s> is it not the case that the present governments policy is reducing technological training and technological apprenticeships at this moment when they are needed to a greater extent than ever before in the history of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how many of the nearly members of the association of polytechnic teachers are non-academic members whose salaries are not subject to the burnham committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that on th april this year in cols <e> <s> to i asked a similar question of his noble friend lord trefgarne and did not get an answer to the question that stands on the order paper <e> <s> is he further aware that the average cut in government departmental expenditure is per cent whereas the cut in overseas development is per cent of gnp over two years <e> <s> nine times as high as the average <e> <s> what i am asking the minister to explain is why overseas development has been singled out in this way for such a large reduction in expenditure in comparison with the average cuts which the government have been making particularly when other countries in europe are increasing their overseas aid <e> <s> countries like sweden <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not customary for the originator of a question to have a second supplementary <e> <s> this is the second time that i have been denied a second supplementary on this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept fully the explanation of the leader of the house <e> <s> however does he realise that it leaves some of us in a difficult position <e> <s> we deliberately do not rise while noble lords in all parts of the house are asking supplementary questions because we assume that the convention will be followed that a final supplementary will be allowed to the initiator of the question <e>", "<cs> further my lords i would remind the leader of the house and this will be borne out by his colleague the noble earl lord ferrers that on this very subject this is the second time i have been prevented from following up the ministers first answer to my question with a further supplementary <e> <s> that has happened on this very issue <e> <s> in other words this is the second time i have been prevented from putting such a supplementary <e>", "<cs> just the second time on this issue my lords but many other times on other issues <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i wonder whether i might ask him to include in his reply if he is able to do so the answer to one question <e> <s> in drafting this bill and following the discussions in another place have members of the diplomatic corps been consulted <e> <s> because i have had personal experience of members of the diplomatic corps who are very concerned about the future particularly of their grandchildren <e> <s> as the noble lord lord spens has pointed out there are many british citizens in different parts of the world who are doing excellent work and the value of that work may well be reflected in the desire of their families to settle in those countries at least for an extended period <e> <s> what is the position of the grandchildren of a present member of the diplomatic corps in many parts of the world particularly those grandchildren who may marry indigenous spouses and thereby at least put in doubt their claim to a continued citizenship of this country <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be unfortunate if the burden of the argument on this amendment concentrated solely on the eec <e> <s> the case for the offices of the eec has been fully and amply made <e> <s> however there are many other international organisations which are serviced by british people <e> <s> in his reply to my intervention on amendment no <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord advocate did not really take the case that i had made about the disturbance which is being caused among the diplomatic service not as regards their children <e>", "<cs> i fear that we are emphasising this issue of a close association with the united kingdom to such an extent that it is becoming almost mechanistic <e> <s> surely the noble lords amendment which refers to a citizen whose mother or father was a british citizen by descent at the time of the birth and whose grandfather or grandmother was also a british citizen in itself demonstrates that there is a close <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord mccarthy i think it is obvious that clause is the core of the whole bill <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble earl and to the committee for not being able to speak at second reading the reason being that i was abroad at the time <e> <s> nevertheless the noble earl may recall that he had another bill last year the employment bill and in some ways this resembles that bill in the sense that while the employment bill created no <e>", "<cs> then again according to the manpower services commission only

employment at the end of if present trends continue <e>", "<cs> in my submission t am speaking to clause because everything after clause stems from clause and we are talking about clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> what i am trying to do is to draw from the minister who is to reply the noble earl an explanation of why he is introducing this clause giving the secretary of state and the government the power to reduce at this time the institutions which have been set up to promote training within industry <e> <s> all that is contained in clause <e> <s> i am trying to probe the mind of the government as to why these powers all of which are contained in clause are now being taken to reduce the training and the institutions to promote training as the noble baroness lady seear put it to prod the employers into further training just at a time when more and more training is needed in this country and when the economic future of this country depends on increasing rather than decreasing training <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that outside this country indeed in some parts of this country there is a firm conviction that this government are opposed to the recommendations of the brandt commission report as shown in the conferences in venice and new york last year and in the very cold terms of the foreign office the official response to the report published just months ago <e> <s> is he further aware that at the ottawa conference the canadians are taking the lead in trying to stimulate western positive response to the brandt commission report in preparation for the mexico conference <e> <s> will he tell the house on behalf of the government whether the government accept the core of the brandt commission report the core being the interdependence of nations throughout the world with the inevitable consequence that the recovery of the british economy depends upon the kind of measures that have been put forward by the brandt commission which included a former conservative prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord the minister aware and perhaps he will be further aware if he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware and would he accept that the purpose of this question which it has taken me three attempts to ask is to give the government the opportunity to deal with a very serious issue of economic philosophy and economic practice and would he agree that the overseas aid given by this and other countries is of great benefit to both the industry of the donor country and the employment of the donor country <e> <s> would he either agree or deny the figure that was given in another place some months ago that the cuts in overseas aid so far perpetrated by this government have cost british jobs that is jobs in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister one stage further <e> <s> do the government accept that overseas aid is a part of their strategy for british economic recovery and will he deny the widespread belief which is shared by many of his noble friends behind him at least that overseas aid is some form of charity or hand-out but is rather an investment in the recovery of the economy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> does she recall that on th april this year in answering a related question she had this to say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble baroness one stage further <e> <s> is she aware that her answer has justified the suspicions of some people that this government are less interested in the development of international education than previous governments as the hmi now has to split his time between his international responsibilities and other duties <e> <s> is it not also the case that the hmi concerned who was a member of the advisory committee on development and who did a most excellent job was concerned not simply with formal education but also informal education or adult education as it is often known and that the description which she gave in her previous answer of the advisory committee as a quango should not be taken to indicate that any single member of that committee was paid a penny because in fact they were not <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the foreign secretary a question about clause of the communiqu <e> <s> i understand that clause reads <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that this country

to mr denktash the necessity for making conciliatory gestures towards the approaches which have been made by president kyprianou <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misunderstood my question <e> <s> i was not referring to british aid to cyprus i was referring to british aid to turkey <e> <s> i was asking whether the british government have made representations to the turkish government not to the cypriot government to use its good offices in order to persuade mr denktash to come to compromise negotiations with president kyprianou <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house for the fact that my name does not appear on the speakers list <e> <s> this was due to some confusion in the drawing up of the list which is entirely my responsibility <e> <s> but i could not resist continuing the dialogue that i have been having with the noble lord lord cockfield over the past two years on one of the few occasions that we have had recently of debating economic policy generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made no statement i have asked a question <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm or deny that

than in the relevant period for <e> <s> is this what the government mean when the prime minister talks about industry being fit and lean <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him whether he is aware that the supplements now being paid to british citizens serving overseas have been drastically reduced since the last general election <e> <s> is he further aware that in zambia which is the country i am mainly interested in at the moment it is planned that the total number of recipients of supplements is to fall from to under by the beginning of and can he equate this with the pledge that the government have made on a number of occasions to further the cause of the transfer of technology from the rich world to the poor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot accept that explanation and i should like to ask the noble lord whether he is aware that in order to get local people trained to do the technical and the academic jobs which british and other foreign experts are doing now it is essential to have the experts there to do the training <e> <s> is he not aware that in many cases in the universities in the schools and in technical occupations the performance of that operation is being run down because of the lack of foreign experts <e> <s> is this not completely contrary to the communiqus which have been regularly signed by members of the present government promising to further the transfer of technologists <e> <s> is it not the case that more british young people in particular are needed in the developing world in order to help the developing people themselves to become trained so that they can do the job <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that as a result of the actions taken by the illegal rgime in rhodesia during the rhodesian war there are still bridges and roads destroyed which are handicapping the development of the transport system of the whole of central africa <e> <s> is he further aware that the zambian people themselves have taxed themselves specifically to assist in the repair of this infrastructure <e> <s> would he agree that the british government have a very special responsibility in view of their responsibilities in rhodesia at that time to assist in the restoration of what was destroyed by the illegal rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will consider a practical suggestion which follows on the point regarding locomotives made by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> would he consider not building new locomotives but providing the technical expertise to repair the steam locomotives which are still there in zambia <e> <s> their use could drastically and constructively cut the oil bill if they were substituted for the present diesel engines <e> <s> the locomotives are there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am trying to explain the background of my question <e> <s> the steam locomotives are there <e> <s> they were made in doncaster and manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider the possibility of making a contribution by sending experts from this country in order to put these locomotives back into use <e>",

i want to say i have argued with her over a number of years without getting any satisfactory answers <e> <s> but this does give me an opportunity despite his absence which i understand of tackling yet again the noble viscount lord trenchard as in the days when he was concerned with industry and again we have had many arguments none of which i feel have been satisfactorily answered <e> <s> fortunately my noble friend lord bowden and the noble lord lord winstanley following him have said a number of things that i intended to say in this connection and that therefore makes it unnecessary for me to say them <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord the foreign secretary tell the house whether he has any evidence and if so what evidence that the south african government are following any different policy from that which resulted in the breakdown of the geneva talks at the beginning of this year particularly in view of the fact that they are constantly invading both mozambique and angola <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord on the woolsack whether he would divide what he has just said between going to a division and having a discussion and let us know whether or not it would be in order to discuss the consolidated fund bill without any question of a division <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister telling us that the figure in the sixth replenishment for this year has been reduced from billion dollars to billion dollars <e> <s> can he explain a little further how he equates that with his original answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise one point with the chairman of committees not on the two paragraphs which he has mentioned but on paragraph on page <e> <s> did the committee consider whether there might be a case for this house using the consolidated fund bill in the same way as another place uses it particularly in view of the fact that there are many issues of local and of national and international importance which back-benchers would have an opportunity of airing as is done in another place if the precedent of the last years were changed now <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that the debate this afternoon so far as i personally am concerned is tinged with a profound sadness <e> <s> i believe that this is the first time we have debated this subject when the voice of lord ritchie-calder has been silent <e> <s> ritchie had an intense passion for and an unrivalled experience in this field <e> <s> he was a personal colleague and friend of mine for some years and i would like to pay tribute to the tremendous contribution he made to every aspect of the subject we are debating this afternoon <e> <s> his unstinting generosity and infinite interest in ideas brought him naturally to this subject <e> <s> in fact the last time i saw him just before the christmas recess he asked me for a copy of a scientific paper i had written concerning this subject <e> <s> this debate will be the poorer for his silence

noble lord allow me <e> <s> if i understand him aright he has just been quoting criticisms of both the donor nations and of the governments which included if i heard him aright certainly tanzania and zambia <e> <s> may i ask him two questions <e> <s> first so far as the noble lords latter point was concerned regarding the donor nations would he not accept that there can be foreign aid given in such a way as to deepen the economic dependence of the recipient nation and that that is what is being criticised in the passage he has quoted <e> <s> secondly on the former point will he say who it was that was interfered with by the governments of countries like tanzania and zambia when he suggests that the economies of these countries were being damaged by government interference <e> <s> who was being interfered with <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether he has read the answer given by his colleague to a similar question which i put in december <e> <s> the answer which i paraphrase was that the numbers had fallen because local indigenous people had now become sufficiently trained to take those positions <e> <s> if the noble lord has looked since at these figures would he agree that this is not an adequate answer and that this is a deliberate policy by the government to reduce the number of british citizens who are given supplements to work overseas <e> <s> would the noble lord further agree that this is causing very great difficulty to universities to technical colleges and to a whole range of national activities in the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> but surely the figures which have been given this afternoon if i heard correctly have reduced the number by about per cent <e> <s> in two years <e> <s> does this not entail a great reduction in british influence all over the commonwealth <e> <s> and is the noble lord aware that

stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware as i am sure he is that there is an ecgd delegation in lusaka at the moment which arrived last saturday <e> <s> will he and the government take into account the very real difficulties which the government of zambia have had over the past few years relating to the price of copper on which almost all of the countrys exports depend <e> <s> will the government consider that the price of copper which is not in the hands of the zambian government is directly related to their ability to pay off previous debts <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister two last questions <e> <s> would he agree with me in reply to another question that was asked that it depends who you were in northern rhodesia as to whether you were better off then than now particularly in view of the tremendous increase in education opportunities since independence <e> <s> secondly is the noble lord aware that one of the conditions laid down by the imf which the government of zambia has had to apply prevented that government from moving the pipeline as they had hoped to do in regard to past debts which certainly would have helped to enable the government to restore the ecgd cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall the number of times that his government have objected to the principle of economic sanctions as a means of international pressure <e> <s> why have the government changed their mind over poland <e> <s> do they believe that the polish rgime is more tyrannous than that of south africa <e> <s> is this not leading the government to use double standards in their actions in foreign

asked while welcoming the condemnation of the south african invasion of angola have the british government any plans particularly in view of their attitude towards events in eastern europe as to action which they can take to stop further invasions and to use their influence on the south african government to withdraw from southern angola <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree on reflection that the question asked by my noble friend lord bruce of donington is very relevant to this question <e> <s> if the lady in question had been a citizen of the irish republic

the cost in other countries <e> <s> would he at least give us an assurance that he and his ministry will consider whether students in this country should not be given exemption from this penalty <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out to the noble baroness that unless my hearing is deficient she has not answered the two questions that the noble lord lord gladwyn put to her about the plans for food and aid in the third world <e> <s> may i add a third question to those questions <e> <s> in the statement there are the usual bromides such as we had last year from venice and from cancun about the necessity for growth in the third world and the im-portance of growth and so on <e> <s> if that is not hypocrisy can the noble baroness tell the house what the british government are specifically proposing and what they proposed at versailles in order to get the third world out of the deep slough of depression which is so much greater than and is causing so much more suffering than it is in the industrial world <e> <s> the proposals and i should like her opinion of this may very well be the key to the end of the depression in the industrialised world if the third world is given the purchasing power to lower unemployment rates <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this is not simply a matter for congratulation <e> <s> if there is a surplus of billion in our overseas account that means that there must be a deficit of billion in other countries <e> <s> would he not agree that some countries are suffering because of our surplus particularly those whose exports have been reduced because of protectionism in the industrialised world <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord the minister two questions on that answer <e> <s> first can he confirm or deny the report which appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords following the questions from the other side i should like to ask the noble lord whether he would not agree that the objections that swapo has made so far to the contact groups proposals have been that they were insufficiently democratic in preparation for the election <e> <s> i should like further to ask whether the noble lord has noted the observation of the dutch government that if the illegal occupation of namibia by south africa is not soon ended they will seriously consider applying economic sanctions to south africa in the same way as the british government reacted to the illegal invasion of the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look into the operations of the ecgd which he mentioned in his original answer <e> <s> because those of us who travel to any extent know that in the present economic climate of the world british manufactures are being replaced by inferior manufactures simply because many of the third world countries are so poor and so heavily in debt due to oil price rises that they have no option now that ecgd cover has been removed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he will link this question with the one i asked him yesterday which he did not answer <e> <s> is it not ironic that the british government should ask the south african government to apply sanctions to argentina because of the argentines breach of international law when the same british government have consistently refused to admit that the application of sanctions to south africa is appropriate over a similar breach of international law in namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer and for his sympathetic response <e> <s> may i ask whether he and the government are aware that the drought in zambia zimbabwe mozambique botswana and namibia is the worst for years that cattle are dying now and unless something is done very quickly people also will be dying <e> <s> is he further aware that mr mundia the prime minister of zambia appealed to the fao early in may to declare this area a disaster area so that united nations organisations could go in and are the british government supporting this move at the fao <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this drought has undermined the hard work that has gone into the production of food in this area over the past two or three years which succeeded so far as zambia is concerned in making her self-sufficient in maize last year <e> <s> would he agree that the two major factors that can ensure against the effects of such a drought are irrigation as my noble friend mentioned and storage facilities both of which are expensive <e> <s> would he draw that to the attention of the minister for overseas development <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him two supplementaries <e> <s> first would he agree that it would be of great benefit to the reputation of this country as a multi-racial nation to be seen to appoint members of the ethnic minorities black or brown as ambassadors and high commissioners to represent britain in the world <e> <s> secondly would it not reinforce the nations anti-sexist development if there were women in similar positions <e> <s> can the minister say how many women for example are either high commissioners or ambassadors representing this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the first part of the answer that he gave to my supplementary question is quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> i appreciate that he has a point in suggesting that women ambassadors might not be acceptable in all parts of the moslem world but it is certainly not the case that any part of the moslem world would refuse an ambassador or a high commissioner from the ethnic minorities <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether he will bring to the attention of his right honourable friend the importance for the reputation of this country over the years of bringing forward members of the ethnic minorities as representatives in our diplomatic service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has reported on what her right honourable friend has been discussing in america with regard to the future of the falkland islands <e> <s> on a previous occasion the noble baroness also mentioned the options which her government were considering for the falkland islands <e> <s> could she tell this house whether one of the options being considered by her right honourable friend and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord three related questions <e> <s> first does he consider that the illegal occupation of namibia by south africa illegal under the united nations and under the international court of justice is as serious as the invasion by argentina of the falkland islands and that the invasion by south africa of angola comes into the same category <e> <s> secondly would he agree that economic sanctions are one of the alternatives to warfare <e> <s> and if the answer to these two questions is in the affirmative would the noble lord further agree that the application of economic sanctions to south africa so long as she resists the international community could save the whole of southern africa from a terrible racial war <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that in view of the answer that he has given to me and the questions which came from behind him all the countries of south africa which have been mentioned are in favour of sanctions being used by the western powers against south africa until south africa withdraws from both angola and namibia <e> <s> secondly in the noble lords answer he referred to resolution is he aware that this matter was debated in at the united nations general assembly and the mandate was then ended but that in the international court of justice declared that south africa was illegally occupying namibia <e> <s> is he now saying that south africa is not in breach of international law <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister to be a little more specific about the principle quite apart from anti-americanism involved <e>", "<cs> some did my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is dealing with business could he tell the house whether there are any plans to make a statement in this house <e>", "<cs> may i draw the attention of the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord mottistone to the speech just made by my noble friend lord plant and also to the opening speech of the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> the argument that is being put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with some support from the noble lord lord mottistone is irrelevant to this amendment <e> <s> the question is not whether the public accounts committee will find irregularities that is not the object of it at all <e> <s> the object of the amendment is to make public what the secretary of state is doing and if the secretary of state is handing out up to million of public money i would have thought that anybody who believes in open government in democratic government and as my noble friend lord wedderburn quoted from the secretary of state himself public accountability would support this amendment <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl allow me to interrupt <e> <s> could he just tell the committee what distinction he makes so far as publicity is concerned between other unfair dismissals going to a tribunal and the unfair dismissal that he has characterised in this bill <e>", "<cs> can we just get the question of the hour straight <e> <s> the noble earl has made an important statement <e> <s> he said that the draft gennard report is in the ministry but that the secretary of state had not read it <e> <s> we know that the draft report has been in the ministry since at least the beginning of the year <e> <s> is the noble earl really saying over six months later when there has been a standing committee in the other place sitting many days to go through the details of this bill when the bill has been through its second reading and committee stage in another place and when it has been through its second reading here and is now at committee stage here that the secretary of state has not even read the gennard report and that he has not got the information <e> <s> we are not talking here about whether the report is ready for publication <e> <s> we are not talking about looking for a commercial publisher for the report <e> <s> there is good material there and the noble earl has confirmed it is there <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl really saying that all these stages of the bill have been gone through without the secretary of state even looking through the draft report which the noble earl says has been in his ministry for so many months <e>", "<cs> before we part with the clause i wish to make a few comments about its contents and significance <e> <s> i have no intention of making a second reading speech <e>", "<cs> very well <e>", "<cs> very briefly as i know that we want to adjourn my objections to clause and schedule are twofold <e> <s> the first is contained in the words in clause who in certain past cases <e> <s> in other words as has already been mentioned this afternoon this is retroactive legislation which i personally think is bad and dislike whichever party happens to be in government <e> <s> but it was described by the noble earl lord ferrers as retrospective justice <e> <s> this seems to me to be very revealing <e> <s> why is it that the defence of the non-unionist or the lapsed unionist is retrospective justice and why is it that the years to are so important <e> <s> what about before that <e> <s> was it not retrospective justice to compensate those who were unfairly dismissed before when they had no right to any redress <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down will he please answer the question which both the noble lord lord howie of troon and i asked him <e> <s> why is there a difference in compensation between unfair dismissal on the grounds that we have been considering and other forms of unfair dismissal is that not an invitation to members of unions to leave their unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that the countries particularly those of the third world that have been accustomed to receiving the benefits of ecgd are now in a vicious circle <e> <s> their increased oil bills the low price of commodities and the protectionism of the industrial world prevent them from earning foreign currency or the money for internal investment <e> <s> they are then faced with the necessity to borrow money <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that when such countries are having to borrow money for their own purposes they have to pay very high interest rates <e> <s> they are therefore unable to repay their debts <e> <s> at that point ecgd cuts off its support and so the vicious circle is completed <e> <s> would he agree with that analysis <e> <s> would he recognise that this is a new economic situation in the world in which a re-examination of the operations of ecgd would be very appropriate <e>", "<cs> but my lords if that is the answer of the noble lord the minister then he has totally misunderstood the case i have tried to put to him over the past three years <e> <s> is he not aware that i have been trying to impress on him that this is a mutual interest between the countries benefiting from ecgd and our own country <e> <s> would he agree that this is a global issue now in which the future of this country as well as that of the third world countries is very much bound up <e> <s> does he realise what actually happens when ecgd is removed <e> <s> those countries then have to buy usually inferior goods from other countries with less stringent rules thereby losing britain the trade that they want to engage in with us <e> <s> would he look again and consult with his right honourable friends in the government to see whether in this desperate situation <e>", "<cs> i am trying to probe the mind of the minister my lords as i have been trying to do for three years <e> <s> i can briefly conclude by asking if he will reconsider his answer and consult with his noble and right honourable friends as to whether ecgd could play a greater part in the mutual interest of this country and the countries which previously enjoyed the benefits of ecgd <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is dealing with that may i put my question of yesterday <e> <s> have the government any intention now of putting down in this house the same kind of motion as has been put down for debate tomorrow in another place so that this house may also participate in the discussion on the falklands inquiry <e>", "<cs> before the mover of this amendment winds up may i say a few words which i <e>", "<cs> i am glad the noble lord intervened because it shows that the alliance so-called is getting even more confused <e> <s> if it is reduced to the pathetic argument that two amendments are totally different because one says per cent <e> <s> while the other says per cent <e> <s> that hardly suggests they are taking the work of this committee very seriously <e> <s> i too have the record of standing committee g and i have read the speeches of mr bradley and mr cyril smith but who do we believe <e> <s> we had an instance of this yesterday in the first vote <e> <s> after all the talk we heard from the sdp about the necessity for open government and publicity about what ministers were doing in the very first vote yesterday

circles and we must remember that a considerable number of the sdp members owe a great deal of their public life to the trade union and labour movements and on this issue the position has been made clear by the publications of the tuc on the whole principle of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord the minister will read my question again he will see that the word mandatory does not appear in it <e> <s> is he aware that last december the united nations general assembly passed by votes to a motion for oil sanctions against south africa <e> <s> is he further aware that the british government themselves prevent north sea oil being sent direct to south africa <e> <s> has he or his department studied the amsterdam-based shipping research bureau report which states that between january and june tankers with british managers or british charters of which were from shell or bp were presumed to have delivered oil to south africa <e> <s> has the noble lord studied these figures and does that equate with the answer he has given <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister with respect has not answered my question <e> <s> has he or his department studied the findings of the shipping research bureau <e> <s> if he has done so is it or is it not the case that tankers british owned or british managed have been shown to have delivered oil over this -month period <e> <s> does he agree that british oil companies should carry on this trade or not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that british companies should defy a resolution of the united nations general assembly <e>", "<cs> i have sat through most of the committee stage of this bill and have deliberately refrained from taking part in the detailed debate since clause the reason being that clause was important in the first half of the bill the part in which trade unionists were tempted by the offer of large sums of money to leave their unions <e> <s> but this clause is the fourth clause of the real heart of the bill the bill which is intended to open up trade union funds to confiscation <e> <s> i think it would be right before we divide and i hope that we shall divide on this to put the bill itself in its political context for one or two moments <e>", "<cs> i would not dream of trying to lecture the social democratic party or indeed any member of it <e> <s> what i would suggest though is that when you look at the division lists you will not find the divisions within the labour party that have become quite apparent between the two sections of the alliance during the passage of this bill through both houses of parliament and i was just hoping that this time they <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall about two weeks ago answering a question put to him by the noble lord lord kilmarnock regarding the treatment of foreigners who come to this country and particularly of foreign students <e> <s> is he aware that quite apart from reciprocal arrangements there are countries in the world in which british people and indeed any other foreigners can go and get some completely free medical treatment and i am thinking particularly of a country where i spend a lot of time zambia whereas now under the new government arrangements such foreigners and foreign students coming to this country are not given reciprocal arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that british people going to zambia get completely free medical treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> can he confirm or deny that the british government give support to the namibian institute in lusaka and is there any connection between this and what he has been saying about training here <e> <s> is there any combination of the two <e> <s> secondly he spoke of bilateral aid <e> <s> with whom is this bilateral aid negotiated <e> <s> the reason that i ask is that presumably the noble lord can tell us whether the aid that the british government provide is provided to the present namibian administration in which case they would select the students who come here

spring but to last autumn <e> <s> may i ask him two questions arising from the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i did not omit the word further from the quotation which i gave <e>

full quotation from the banks report <e> <s> but may i ask him in particular to address himself to the second part of the second quotation which i gave concerning commodity prices <e> <s> will the noble lord note that the bank reinforces the argument which has come constantly from these benches that the weakening of commodity prices and the worsening of the income and payments position of developing countries is in turn tending to reduce their demand for imports from advanced countries <e> <s> this is the essence <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to echo the words of my noble friend lord bruce that the object of this unstarred question is to persuade not attack the government and i hope that nothing i say will be taken as an attack on them <e> <s> this kind of case which is very much an individual one the case of an individual person must be dealt with often outside regulations and it is evident from the details that have been given by my noble friend that that is the

which has been raised by the noble lords speech and which has been raised in correspondence <e> <s> quite frankly i do not know the answer and i should be very grateful if the noble lord could give it to me <e> <s> on what grounds did the department of employment refuse the application of miss luczak when she applied for a work permit <e> <s> also why was it that they disapproved of her employers

greatly obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> in his concern for the hotel industry is the noble lord keeping himself informed as to the number of international chains of hotels mainly based in the united states of america that tend to undermine and take the place of the traditional british hotel industry <e> <s> is he aware that this is a worldwide problem and one that we could well do without <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the children who are suffering most from the governments cuts in grants to education authorities are those in areas where the comprehensive principle has not as yet been applied <e> <s> does he know for example that in the area where i live in lincolnshire where there are grammar schools and secondary modern schools the secondary modern schools where the need is greatest are having to give up facilities like school bands because they are not allowed peripatetic music teachers whereas grammar schools are able to continue with such facilities <e>

discussing these issues in versailles <e> <s> the sound of this institution representing as it does and consisting as it does of representatives of the greatest landowning wealth-owning section of our community talking about the problems of the unemployed of the poorly paid of the sick of the aged does at times smack of the hypocritical <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the correction of the noble earl but would add that we are not entitled to talk about the experience of the indignant aged <e> <s> however we are here to discuss these matters and i should like to add my congratulations to the two maiden speakers who have spoken this afternoon and to assure them that they are not only welcomed by this side but that they may very well find that there is a certain degree of understanding and sympathy on this side for the problems of industrialists which they will not find in the government or the front bench behind which they speak <e>", "<cs> my lords that may have been the intention of the noble lord but i still think that there is a connection between the thrust of his argument and the point that i am making because it is the wealthy who are in a position to invest abroad and the

members of his own government including the parliamentary under-secretary of state at the department of education <e> <s> therefore i assumed that it was not necessary to define it <e> <s> would he say whether he and the government stand by the attack made by the under-secretary of state in a public speech in which he described peace studies as a trojan horse and would he agree that peace studies themselves in the teaching of mediation as an alternative to force have a very valuable part to play not only in this country but throughout the world <e>", "<cs> as a non-urban guerrilla may i ask the noble lord whether in the light of his original answer to me he will take this opportunity of dissociating himself from the words used by the under-secretary when he described these studies as a trojan horse <e> <s> is he further aware that there are five universities in this country with schools of peace studies training teachers of peace studies and therefore that the term peace studies is defined and is being taught under the aegis of our universities <e> <s> would he invite his honourable friend the secretary of state and his noble friends behind him to visit these schools of peace studies and see what is being taught there and whether it is not helpful to the peace of the world that we are all seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i have been unable to elicit

almost unbelievable hypocrisy which has come from the opposite front bench tonight and which came from the government front bench in another place just a week ago <e> <s> when government ministers are claiming as they are today and as my noble friend lady birk has already pointed out that they are the party of the family and then they make proposals of this kind which are going to split couples and

unemployed themselves are concerned it is quite clear that whether or not the government consider this to be a matter of principle will not affect them they are concerned about the money <e> <s> the

april said specifically that the rationale for that tax ends as soon as benefit comes under tax <e> <s> the benefit came under tax in july <e> <s> if the rationale has ended why has the practice not ended <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and while appreciating that he has dealt quite explicitly with the questions that were asked may i ask him again in order to be absolutely sure that i have got it right whether he believes that there is any public morality in both taking taxation from the unemployed and maintaining the per cent <e> <s> cut which was supposed to be in place of that taxation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> first is it not the case that government ministers both here and in another place have consistently confirmed that this years aid figures were planned at per cent <e> <s> below those of last year <e> <s> secondly since we know that in the final year of the last labour government british jobs were directly created by british overseas aid can the minister say how many british jobs are at present directly related

different criteria and that there has been a change in the criteria between to <e> <s> would he not also agree that it is a well-known fact that the present british government have quite openly cut overseas aid and have not tried to disguise it <e> <s> is he aware that there is no government department other than housing that has cut its expenditure to the same extent as that of overseas aid <e>", "<cs> but my lords that is in cash terms is it not <e> <s> am i not right in thinking that the noble lord said specifically that these figures are in cash terms and not in real terms <e>", "<cs>

are opposed to the transfer of technology to the poorer countries <e> <s> will the noble lord tell the house whether it is the case that during this two years the consortia of mining companies that are already prepared for the mining of minerals on the seabed may very well start their operations if they have not been started already <e> <s> is there any precaution against that happening despite the fact that the convention has not been signed by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to speak on this unstarred question but i had no idea as to whether

lord does not have the opportunity to answer my question but perhaps the occasion will arise in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering my noble friend lord oram the noble lord spoke of an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the imf is selective on a political and ideological basis <e> <s> in addition to the instance given by my noble friend lord kennet the imf is now negotiating with zambia <e> <s> in the case of both zambia and tanzania is it not the case that the imf is insisting upon a reduction in government expenditure against the socialist principles of both

behind her that in many countries in the world particularly in scandinavia and in the united states of america many new methods have been and are being developed to teach children the methods of

be a setback for the governments rightful attempt to increase the competitiveness of our british exports <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect my second question was not wide of the original question <e> <s> what i am asking is whether the government have considered the proposals made at the gatt meeting by the developing countries that the british government because this is a state organisation should use the ecgd for the provision of loans which would increase the purchasing power of those countries and therefore increase our exports and jobs in this country rather than investing their surpluses and as the noble lord knows there was a trading surplus last year in the consolidated fund <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in assuming that the ecgd does make loans and that it does so to the consolidated fund out of its trading surplus each year <e> <s> are we not in a catch- <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord use the same criteria in imposing sanctions against those who infringe the social security laws as are used in the case of those who infringe the laws on income tax <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the statement of the noble lord the minister represent a shocking exposure of the way in which the industrialised nations are preventing the developing nations from expanding their growth as has been customary on the basis of textiles <e> <s> is the minister saying that the developing nations or the that he mentioned will be able to expand their exports to europe by only per cent <e> <s> over the next few years <e> <s> does that not also make a mockery of the

he will remember that there were some noble lords on this side of the <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to add my voice to that of my noble friend lord houghton in protesting at the lack of time which has been given to all the stages of this bill <e> <s> i do not in any way criticise the noble lord lord skelmersdale i know that it is not his responsibility <e> <s> but it is a denigration of the importance of this bill that it has to be passed through all its stages within minutes <e> <s> if that is put down to the responsibility of the usual channels then it is time we had different usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer the point i raised as to whether the increase announced in another place in relation to aid funds over the last two years and for next year takes into account inflation <e> <s> in other words is it an increase or is it a decrease <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the unemployed are not concerned about whether the government accept the principle <e> <s> they are concerned about when they will get their money <e> <s> how is the noble lords answer consistent with the statement of his right honourable friend the then secretary of state who on th april said that the rationale for the per cent <e> <s> abatement would cease at the time that unemployment benefit came under tax <e> <s> has it not been under tax since july of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question on the order paper <e> <s> is this not a form of double taxation <e> <s> is he really telling the house that the government after its years of professedly successful economic pruning cannot afford the million which they have virtually promised to return from july this year <e>", "<cs> my lords on a business matter may i ask the noble lord the chief whip whether the government have any intention before the recess of making a statement on the security risks based on and emanating from the south african embassy which were revealed in our courts last week <e>", "<cs> my lords in the statement repeated by the noble lord lord trefgarne mention was made of national interest and in his replies the noble lord has spoken of public interest <e> <s> may i ask him whether the government have not considered that the national interest and the public interest will be gravely damaged if the british government are seen to be facilitating the takeover of a scottish company by a south african company which inevitably has been giving strength and support to the policy of apartheid and which was known to be supporting the illegal rgime of ian smith in the then rhodesia <e> <s> is this feeling of shame in this country not likely to be strengthened by the news of the activities of south african agents revealed in the courts last week and the invasion of a fellow member of the commonwealth lesotho at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble lord lord trefgarne that is no answer to my question <e> <s> i asked whether he had considered on behalf of the government whether the national interest and the public interest would not be damaged by the revelation that the british government were facilitating the incursion into industry in this country of a south african company <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have expected that a debate on a paper entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like me to answer that <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said that he was putting the matter to me i presume he wished for an answer <e> <s> my answer is simply that i have never defended and never would defend the invasion of the falkland islands or any other part of the world <e> <s> i agree with him entirely on that point <e> <s> some of us have had a longer history than the present government in criticising the fascist rgime in argentina so we have no sympathy there at all <e> <s> the point i have been making is that there may be invasions by fascist rgimes by communist rgimes by self-styled democratic rgimes and there are conflicts in the world which i believe and i think the noble earl will agree that we all wish to solve if possible by negotiation <e> <s> the facts seem to suggest and i have asked the noble lord lord belstead to answer them that up to the time of the sinking of the general belgrano there was an opportunity devised by the peruvians with american help for a negotiated settlement which would have included i make this quite clear the withdrawal of the argentine forces from the falklands <e> <s> that was part of the peruvian plan <e> <s> i believe the facts suggest that is as high as i put it that the argentine junta had in fact been forced by the army to agree to that plan <e> <s> within a few hours the sinking of the general belgrano had destroyed any hope it may have been a faint hope that there could be a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has i understand quoted from an answer in another place given by a minister of state in which it is asserted that the commander sought and obtained i think those were the words approval for action outside the exclusion zone <e> <s> sought and obtained from whom <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing entirely with the noble baroness that it would be stupid to go into any of the details of the report this afternoon there is one public matter concerning the report about which i should like to ask her a simple <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in this debate this afternoon as a member of a long-standing teaching family <e> <s> my mother taught virtually all her life for years until she was nearly years old <e> <s> both my sisters are teachers and i have taught in every stage of the educational system from the primary school to the university including spending some years as chairman of

deliberately resisting that temptation in order to confine myself to one aspect alone of the effects of educational cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the two noble lords on the other side of the house who have faithfully stayed with us will report to their superiors the lack of support which they are receiving from their back-benches <e> <s> theirs is supposed to be the caring party and it really gives little lead to the rest of the country to see that not a single back-bench conservative member has seen fit to stay for this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> nobody has suggested that the future of development education depends upon government finance or as the noble lords leader would say government handouts <e> <s> what the previous government tried to do were two things first to assist the voluntary organisations the noble lord has listed and secondly to take an initiative themselves <e> <s> can the noble lord prove that development education is better than ever as he suggested and would he not relate that to what he said earlier when he suggested that people would feel better towards overseas aid when they were better themselves <e> <s> will he not see that development education on behalf of his governments programme of overseas aid is necessary in order to show people that one way out of their present economic plight is to help the half of the world that is unable to buy our products at the present time <e>", "<cs> answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords for the first time since i entered this house i have to start with a similar apology to that just made by the noble baroness lady trumpington <e> <s> before the second reading of the bill appeared on the order paper i had contracted to attend a meeting

the noble lord the minister who is to reply <e> <s> i apologise to the succeeding speakers and if i am unable to be here when the minister winds up i apologise to him also <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have already made my apologies to him and i repeat them now <e> <s> but i was here when he made a particular issue of the question of the prejudice towards the carrying out of the law <e> <s> will he help the committee stage by telling us why it is necessary to include control of immigration when already there is in the exemptions any breach of law <e> <s> is this not saying in effect that we are lumping together in these exemptions people who are suspected of being criminals and coloured people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask him two questions <e> <s> can he tell the house whether the newspaper reports of th december were correct in reporting that warrant officer joseph klue of the south african embassy was sent home on rd november at the request of the foreign and commonwealth office for activities incompatible with his official status a euphemism for spying <e> <s> if so can the noble lord tell the house what action not whether any action but what action has been taken since <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord tell us whether newspaper reports in september were correct in saying that ben van der klashorst a first secretary at the embassy left the embassy and returned to south africa after the successful prosecution of three british arms dealers at the old bailey involving arms smuggling of over million <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer my first supplementary question what action was taken after the foreign office asked for the removal of warrant officer klue <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that these cases which are coming up so often reveal that based in the south african embassy are a number of agents who are acting illegally and are collecting information <e> <s> this has been substantiated by the south african foreign minister mr botha who said that intelligence was gained by warrant officer klue and used against the enemies of the government <e> <s> against the opposition to the government in south africa <e> <s> is it not clear that here is a centre of illegal activities and can the government not tell us clearly what action they have taken and are proposing to take <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that comprehensive reply <e> <s> may i first ask one technical point <e> <s> are those gross figures or net figures taking inflation into account <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that in the debate on the gracious speech i asked the same question and his answer then was that britain had fully met its obligations under the ida <e> <s> that can mean many things <e> <s> at the same time is the noble lord aware that at that time the then president of the world bank mr clausen referring to a cut of per cent <e> <s> in the budget of the ida said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord again for what is a considerably reassuring answer and i hope that he will use all his influence to continue that lead <e> <s> i should like to add one small <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it would satisfy the objections raised by his noble friend lady trumpington if the term were <e>", "<cs> my lords the first principle of responsible government is the granting and acceptance of responsibility <e> <s> the electorate delegates its responsibility to its elected representatives and they to members of the government <e> <s> at the apex of this pyramid of responsibility is the prime minister <e> <s> this responsibility must be recognised and its consequences accepted <e> <s> we are discussing today a war which cost british lives and several hundred maimed men some of them incidentally killed or maimed by arms provided by this country <e> <s> the consequence of responsible government is that every wife every son and daughter and every mother and father of those who died or who were maimed has a right to know who is responsible <e> <s> that is the awesome task which we in this parliament have to approach today in both this house and in another place because it is parliament which is the final court <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way <e> <s> is it not the case that the situation at the time that she is describing was precisely what had been forecast by the noble lord lord carrington from onwards <e> <s> that there was a grave danger of invasion of the islands if either fortress falklands or negotiations without concessions on sovereignty were the options taken by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister for some information <e> <s> is it the case that in this year for the second year running per cent <e> <s> of those offered places in the open university were unable to take them up mainly because of cost <e> <s> secondly is it the case that over the last two years the fees for the open university have been increased by per cent <e> <s> lastly has the noble earl read the analysis made by the open university itself on its admissions which states that continually increasing fees may mean that lower income and other underprivileged groups will be priced out of study <e>", "<cs> my lords my other supplementary was is it the case that per cent <e> <s> of those offered places at the open university this year and last year were unable to take up their places because of the rise in costs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister put it on record that the open university is one of the jewels in the british crown and universally respected all over the world <e> <s> it is a great help particularly to industry <e> <s> perhaps he would tell his noble friend that <e> <s> is he also aware that one of the reasons for a large number of students not taking their examinations is that the grant to assist students to attend summer schools which are compulsory for certain courses has fallen from per cent <e> <s> in to under per cent <e> <s> by so that students simply cannot afford to go to summer schools <e> <s> is he further aware that it is women who are particularly discriminated against as students are unable to take up their courses in the open university and particularly students in the north as distinct from the south <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with my noble friend lord molloy on the encouraging nature of that reply can the noble lord the minister tell us whether the government consider that there is any moral difference between the american government supplying arms to guatemala and the british government allowing their banks to lend to the argentine money which as the prime minister admitted yesterday can be used to purchase arms which could be a danger to british forces <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is now saying that the government are considering the possibilities of deciding between grants and loans will he assure the house that the government will look very carefully at the american model <e> <s> because a number of his noble friends and members on the cross-benches are apparently unaware of the fact that those of us who have taught in the united states are appalled by the number of students who have to fall out because they cannot afford to keep up their loan payments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord very warmly indeed for that reply and will he accept that its contents will give a great deal of satisfaction in both political and non-political circles <e> <s> may i ask him whether it is the case as i believe it is that last week in lesotho at the summit meeting to which he referred the british government put their name to the communiqu which stated that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister tell his noble friend on the back-bench that women and children not to be classed as terrorists

years ago <e> <s> may i suggest to her that if she is concerned about the provision of milk to school children she should speak to her own prime minister who was the first at least to dent the principle of free school milk rather than to members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> all power to the noble baronesss elbow <e> <s> i hope that she will go on speaking so <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i gave was billion a year <e> <s> i said that the consumer is billion a year worse off because of the difference between world prices and the eec <e> <s> i took that figure from the book i

food and agriculture organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would allow me could i ask a question <e> <s> he is making the general statement that additional government expenditure for this purpose would be inflationary <e> <s> is it then inflationary for the present government according to the estimates published yesterday to increase defence expenditure by the very large amount that they have since and apparently are going to do to an even greater extent in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has not even approached the central issue which my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the answer which the noble lord has just given could be put in another way that as a result of the fierce battle between the treasury and the department of industry the cash spending of the department has been reduced and that this necessarily causes a reduction in investment in the regions and in rolls-royce and british leyland <e> <s> does it not also cause a reduction in the support for british exports and the attempts of british exporters to obtain markets overseas <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends have dealt with the domestic effects of these cuts <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord to concentrate on the second part of my first

supplementary questions <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate is clearly part of the overture which began last weekend and i must tell the noble lord lord carrington who has just left his place that perhaps he has been allocated only the role of playing the triangle in this orchestra <e> <s> nevertheless the debate plays a part in what will clearly be a determined campaign by the conservative

cse regulations which now allows the easter school-leavers to take cse examinations is not in conflict with the assurance that has to be given to the social security authorities <e> <s> if the school-leaver is unemployed will he no longer have to assure the authorities that he is not returning to school for either classes or examinations <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the point of the question <e> <s> is it then the case as has been reported in the educational press recently that if pupils leave school at easter they are allowed to take the cse examinations if they have a job but that if they do not have a job they are given the choice either of taking the cse examinations without social security benefit or of taking the social security benefit and not being allowed to take the cse <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earl read the report that when this issue was first ventilated the national association of head teachers declared it to be a gross injustice and said that

country as is equal to the british governments contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify to the house the question which at least in my mind is still clouded by his answer to my noble friend lord oram <e> <s> are the figures the noble lord has given cash figures or cost figures <e> <s> in other words do they take inflation into account <e> <s> if they do that is a reduction <e> <s> i fully take the noble lords point that he has read the report of unicef and has seen their forecast that the number of children who die each year from these causes can be halved <e> <s> what is the british government going to do to assist what must surely be one of the first priorities in our world community today <e>", "<cs> my lords so this is in fact a reduction in the amount contributed by the british government to unicef in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that on th november last when i asked a similar question i was also then given what are now called the cash figures as distinct from the cost figures <e> <s> is he aware that he has again in his comparison between last year and given the cash figures not the cost figures <e> <s> is it not a fact that the cost figures bear out the assertion that i made on th november that this government

roles and ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the answer to the question of the noble baroness sitting behind him is that the voluntary organisations provide about million a year for overseas territories but that that is not included in the figures that i have asked for this afternoon because i asked for the official figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that that percentage is lower than the percentage in the netherlands norway sweden and denmark <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that over years ago i was accustomed to playing both tennis and rugby union with

of apartheid that a person whether in sport or in social life is judged according to the accidental colour of his skin and not according to his prowess in the sport <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the greatest difficulties with which we have been living in the last four years to which the noble baroness lady faithfull referred has been the impact of the policy of this government <e> <s> when they

themselves the verdict on their record over those four years must be that they were elected on a false prospectus and i wish briefly to point out why <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl have available a comparison of the figures he has given with those for <e> <s> when he says that it is no part of the governments policy to destroy the school meals service is it not part of the

oclock in the evening <e> <s> in many rural areas have not school meals had to be abandoned because there is either no one to supervise them or no one to provide them at lunch time <e>", "<cs> my

noble earl lord swinton not agree with his right honourable friend in another place who is reported to have said that nursery education leads to a saving in later life in a reduction in the necessity for remedial education <e> <s> is he agreeing that the public expenditure figures show a fall in the provision for nursery education not an absolute fall but a percentage fall on the lower number of children of nursery school age during those years and that that fall is provided for in the present estimate <e> <s> in view of the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that his first answer is very unsatisfactory <e> <s> is it not the case that in south africa every individual is classified and is so classified in his or her passport according to racial origins <e> <s> should it not therefore be perfectly simple for the british council to supply the minister with the information that my noble friend has asked for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister recall from the franks report that in the first few days of march our representative in buenos aires

him <e> <s> may i ask him again is it correct that the franks report whatever its final conclusions might be exposed the fact that at the beginning of march the foreign office here told the governor of the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take this opportunity of agreeing as i believe he will that the commonwealth with its broad span is a most suitable forum for discussion of the grave economic questions that the whole world is at present facing <e> <s> further will he suggest to his right honourable friends both in the foreign office and the exchequer that they might very well discuss with the secretary-general of the commonwealth the results of the expert examination which he mentioned before the world economic summit at williamsburg next month <e>", "<cs> my lords

the widespread activities of the south african security and intelligence forces and that they will accept their responsibility to protect all british subjects against such attacks in the future <e>",

bbc on th february in panorama on this subject <e> <s> if he did not may i suggest to him that he asks for a copy of the script <e> <s> is he aware that that programme showed clearly in direct interviews with the islanders that there was a great concern among the islanders that if they were going to remain on the islands and particularly if there was going to be any chance for their children to remain on the islands the crucial issue was their ability to get land and that that ability was at the moment frustrated by absentee landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord had his attention drawn to the interview given by the president of peru in which he stated that he in conjunction with the then secretary of state of the united states had devised a plan by which australian canadian and venezuelan troops would supervise the withdrawal of the argentinian forces from the falklands and that this had been agreed by the foreign minister of the argentine and that just at the moment when the junta was meeting to consider it the news came of the sinking of the belgrano <e> <s> is he aware that in that interview the president of peru stated that he realised that that action had destroyed any chance of his plan coming to fruition <e>", "<cs> my lords in that situation

made <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him whether his attention has been drawn to the answer given by his noble friend the secretary of state for trade at column on th march this year in which he informed me that over million worth of military material had been sent from this country to the argentine during the month of march <e> <s> in the light of that answer would he not agree that this along with the projected withdrawal of hms endurance could be taken as a signal by the argentine junta that there was no intention on the part of this government to resist any invasion of the falklands <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if he had been in a government which were receiving arms from a potential enemy he would have considered that that supply of arms indicated that there would not be military action against him <e> <s> in view of that proposition would he not also agree that the continued supply of parts of armaments since the end of the falklands war by companies in this country to assist in the rearmament of argentina in the past months is likely to give the same impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood my supplementary question <e> <s> may i put it to him again <e> <s> may

considering this matter to consider whether there is a matter of principle involved here <e> <s> if this new principle were introduced would it not be very dangerously close to insisting that only those with money available would be able to have the right of free speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer but i wonder whether his attention has been drawn to the study made by an independent organisation the institute for fiscal studies in which they found that in real terms the income of an average man with a year has risen by a week since which is a rise of per cent <e> <s> whereas an average unemployed man is now taking home in real terms per week less than in a decrease of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord lord cockfield aware that he has not answered my original supplementary question <e> <s> if he cannot do so this afternoon will he be so kind as to write to me comparing the figures given by the intitute of fiscal studies with the selective figures he has given <e> <s> further will he tell the house whether it is correct that his defence of the reduction of taxation on the high income groups was that it was to give an opportunity for an increase in investment and in production <e> <s> but has this not been followed by a drastic decrease in investment and an even more catastrophic fall in production <e>", "<cs> my lords before it was always the practice that one hmi specialised in the teaching of international affairs which is a very

to existing international economic institutions <e> <s> but this report has done one invaluable service to our generation <e> <s> it has spotlighted the growing world crisis the irrational policies which are being followed by a number of governments and the mounting misery of the majority of the worlds population <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as he referred specifically to me may i just point out to him that in asking my question about the issue of employment and aid the figures that were given by the ministers in the last labour government were not guesses they were worked out by officials <e> <s> i resent the suggestion that this was guesswork <e> <s> they were worked out by officials <e> <s> i have repeatedly asked the minister why he cannot instruct them because the same officials are in the oda and i am sure they would be very willing to do this to give him the figures of the results of the cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that answer and the continual answers of the ministers noble friend the minister of state at the foreign office that there is an absolute ban how does he equate that with the continued manufacture of parts of warships in this country to be sent to third countries who are now supplying the argentine with replacements for the armaments that they lost months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords within the context of the ministers reply in which he said that the government have specific proposals to put to unctad vi can he tell the house just what position the government take towards the protectionism which has been condemned

condemned both in the brandt commission report and the commonwealth report <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government have boasted of increasing the amount of protection against imports to this country <e> <s> what policy will they take through unctad on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great temptation to follow and pick up the points that have been raised in a succession of obsessive speeches apparently sparked off by a psychosis of fear over the soviet union <e> <s> i shall resist that temptation but there are one or two issues which have been raised to which i feel i must reply <e> <s> first to the last speaker the noble lord lord walston i would just say in regard to tanzania that if tanzania is a communist country it is the only communist country that i know of that has regular five-year elections in which on every occasion ministers and members of the assembly are defeated <e> <s> when he puts the blame for the economic ills of tanzania on inefficiency and their inability to develop their economy may i just point out to him that at this years prices it will take times as much sisal which is the main crop in tanzania to buy one tractor as it did years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords my i ask the noble lord the government chief whip one technical <e>", "<cs> while appreciating the purpose of this amendment i support the objections made by the noble lord

no medical qualifications whatever <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment may i suggest to him that in the intervening time between the committee stage and the report stage or when the bill is reintroduced he considers this aspect of introducing an amendment which is based upon consultation with two psychiatrists for the mental health of the person <e> <s> i think that we are in a difficulty here <e> <s> i should like the noble lord either to answer this this afternoon or to consider it <e> <s> none of us in this committee is fit to understand the deep psychological trauma

lord lord kennet has pointed out we accept that depression is a medical disability in this country <e> <s> although i fully appreciate the purpose of the noble lord lord rea in putting forward this amendment i agree with the noble lord lord kennet that it would weaken the bill <e> <s> it would create another loophole as the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith has just pointed out for a defence

past year if we now find that the increase in retail sales is being met by foreign manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that over the past year manufacturing production has been down <e> <s> would he answer my previous question as to whether it is not still necessary for this country to have a surplus in manufacturing trade in order to obtain our essential imports of food and raw materials <e> <s> could he say what government policy is going to be when they find the buffer of north sea oil is beginning to run out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking the noble lord about manufactured goods <e> <s> what is his answer on manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that these units have played and are playing a crucial role in the attack on such diseases as bilhartzia tsetse fly and malaria which attack both people and animals <e> <s> is she further aware that the present budget for the units is only million this year which is much less than per cent <e> <s> of the total aid budget much of which is also paid to british people and british firms <e> <s> could she not at least urge her colleagues that this is not a suitable institution to include in the governments cuts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree with the proposition that the old-age pensioners have spent virtually the whole of their working lives in contributing to the accumulation of wealth in this country putting aside as they are statutorily bound to do a part of their earnings in order to keep them in their old age <e> <s> therefore would it not be more appropriate that the old-age pension should be linked to present workers earnings rather than to an arbitrary retail price index which often does not cover the main items of an old-age pensioners budget <e> <s> secondly will he confirm that if the treasury forecasts that in november the rate of inflation will be at per cent <e> <s> are correct the loss to old-age pensioners will be per week for a married couple and p per week for a single pensioner representing over the <e>", "<cs> my lords the first supplementary question that i asked was a matter of argument the second was a matter of fact <e> <s> the noble lord has contradicted both of my propositions <e> <s> can he tell me whether or not the figures that i gave for the difference between the forecast method and the historic method are correct <e> <s> secondly he has addressed himself to comments made in another place <e> <s> is he aware that in the other place it was stated by the government that pensioners would catch up next year if the inflation rate fell <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that the probability is that at least half a million of those pensioners will die during that year <e>", "<cs> my lords on the surface one would expect a data protection bill to have as its main purpose the rolling back of the dangers foreseen by george orwell in <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> i would however correct his interpretation of what i was saying <e> <s> i understand that under the bill the doctor himself may not know that the information is being passed on <e> <s> it is not necessarily the doctor <e> <s> the doctor or his assistants can feed the information into a computer <e> <s> but that information under the bill can be passed on to the home office authorities without the doctor knowing at all <e> <s> the doctor does not own the computer <e> <s> in all likelihood the doctor does not even <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to reply to the second part of the supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> is it not iniquitous that a pensioner who has been contributing to the pension fund all his or her life should be penalised if they choose to go and live in say canada <e> <s> is he aware that exactly two weeks ago by coincidence i was asked about the status of pensioners in canada by the relatives of a pensioner who has gone to live in canada to be with his children <e> <s> is it not an iniquitous system when pensioners have been paying their contributions all their lives that they should be penalised if they decide to go and live with their family in a commonwealth country such as canada <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl not conscious that his statement reveals an unacceptable degree of contempt by the government both for the people of the country and for parliament <e> <s> is he not aware that during the election many of us pointed out that by their own standards the government were allowing the money supply to rise far above their target and at the same time by their own policy increasing credit in this country in a pre-election boom obviously designed to gain votes <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask two questions of the noble earl <e> <s> first will he answer the question put by my noble friend lord lee of newton does he accept with all the long experience my noble friend has in the trade union movement that the conditions in the union which he described are fully democratic and do not need to he interfered with by any law imposed by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl please answer my second question <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for the letter that he sent me following our exchange concerning his statement on rd june in which he wrote on the same lines as he has just answered <e> <s> if this per cent abatement in the unemployment benefit was made at least partially as a matter of savings may i ask whether he is then saying that the government over the past months have been cutting the unemploymnent benefit by per cent simply as a matter of government savings <e>", "<cs> my lords so the noble lord is saying that over the past months unemployment benefit has been cut by per cent as a deliberate matter of government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords surely this is not accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that a per cent deduction in unemployment benefit took place from and took into account the whole issue of inflation <e> <s> will he again confirm that despite the fact that the government used the excuse that the abatement was to be imposed until the time that benefit came under taxation the government have been penalising the unemployed by per cent <e> <s> irrespective of the fact that benefit came under taxation months ago <e> <s> for the past months the unemployed have been underpaid by per cent irrespective of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not simply conventional etiquette for me to begin by thanking the noble lord lord seebohm for initiating this debate <e> <s> it was to have been initiated before the election <e> <s> the noble lord and i have had very similar motions down <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this is very much a matter of semantics <e> <s> in practice what is happening is that subsidised by their governments the western world of which we are a part is exporting agricultural produce particularly processed produce to the third world countries at such a rate that the farmers in the third world just cannot compete with it <e> <s> we have only to look at our grain and butter mountains today <e> <s> the figure which i have just quoted which i do not think the noble lord has contradicted and i shall be interested to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i did not wish to interrupt his speech but would he agree that so far as tanzania is concerned the policy of ujama is a policy of self-help and self-reliance and that the private trading that he speaks of as being suppressed did not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper asks what was the british governments policy <e> <s> i hardly think that the noble lords reply constitutes an answer to that question <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to put aside his brief for a moment and to take the house into his confidence <e> <s> was not this conference a wasteful fiasco for a month <e> <s> is it not the case that on the side of the industrialised nations britain america and west germany were the main stumbling blocks to an intelligent dialogue with the developing countries <e> <s> was that not the sole cause of the fiasco but one of them <e> <s> may i ask him in particular what the british government representatives did in urging upon the conference the findings of the report of the commonwealth group especially their recommendation that there should be smaller conferences on single issues <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord asking us to believe that the success of a conference is to be judged by the number of resolutions passed <e> <s> would he answer my supplementary question concerning the commonwealth report which i understand the british government urged on the conference but not strongly enough to have it accepted <e> <s> when he says that the major issue at the conference was a recognition of the interdependence of <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe we would all agree that the noble viscount is doing a public service in asking this question and in initiating this debate tonight <e> <s> there is only one point in his speech which i would pick up and that is where he hinted at the powers of darkness which have been mobilised by the developed industrialised world <e> <s> it is not simply the anniversary of wilberforce that we are thinking of today we are also within a few days of the th anniversary of the dropping of the bomb on hiroshima <e> <s> nothing could be more certain to abolish all human rights than the waging of a nuclear war which was initiated by the developed not the developing world <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> will he not agree that provided you have a choice of candidates for the electorate you have democracy without having a multi-party state <e>", "<cs> there are three points i should like to make to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> he will remember that on second reading he made a statement contradicting an instance which i had given earlier <e> <s> in that statement and i do not think i am doing him an injustice in telescoping it the burden of <e>", "<cs> can i perhaps save the noble lord from getting up twice by adding to this before he sits down <e> <s> can he clarify absolutely crystal clearly whether i heard him aright when he said that the home office before asking for medical information for the purpose of immigration control would ask the permission of the doctor <e> <s> secondly would he address himself for a moment to the question i asked him as to why it is necessary for the united kingdom to include this exemption under the term of immigration control when no other european country does so <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is speaking on business may i ask him a business question <e> <s> can he tell the house why the statement by his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer yesterday to the effect that he intends to sell the states capital assets in order to finance the governments current expenditure was not repeated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer but can he address himself directly to what the british government are doing with their own special responsibilities in this situation <e> <s> is he aware that for many years now and right up to the present moment namibian citizens men women and children have been detained tortured and killed by the south african administration <e> <s> this has gone on for many years <e> <s> what are the british government doing at present in order to fulfil their obligations to bring independence to namibia under the terms of the united nations resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a little concerned at the first answer given by the noble lord to my supplementary <e> <s> may i ask him to clarify it <e> <s> did i hear him aright in saying that the negotiations between the united states and angola were all important for security in the region <e> <s> surely the british government have their own responsibility quite apart from united states policy <e> <s> is it not the case that the cuban troops are in angola not in namibia and that they are there because angola was originally invaded before there were any cuban troops there by south african forces <e>", "<cs> my lords i promise that i am not making a habit of raising business questions but there does seem to me to be today a matter of some parliamentary importance quite apart from party interest <e> <s> the noble baroness the minister of state at the foreign office has twice first to my noble friend lord oram and then to myself the noble earl lord longford and the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley promised to make a response to the report of the foreign affairs committee in another place concerning the scientific units in the overseas development association <e> <s> today the minister of state at the foreign office responsible for the overseas development association held a press conference at noon when was revealed the governments response to the budgets of the scientific units <e> <s> is this not a prevention of the responsibility of government <e> <s> should not the minister of state have come to parliament and had his statement repeated here so that it could be properly examined by parliament before the public and so that questions could be put to the minister concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will agree that this is an extremely generous package to gibraltar much more generous than the government have shown themselves towards dockyards closing in this country <e> <s> i should like to ask two specific questions <e> <s> is the sum in the grant of up to million to come out of the british provision for overseas aid <e> <s> if so although presumably he does not have the figures can the noble lord publish the figures showing how much <e>", "<cs> my lords that really does not answer the question <e> <s> is this money coming out of our overseas aid <e> <s> i can divide million by but how does that compare with the average <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl he a little more frank <e> <s> what percentage of the places available is represented by the number that has been taken up the that he mentioned <e> <s> is it not a fact that a lot of young people are reluctant to join this scheme because they realise that when it is finished they will become unemployed and that this is simply a postponement of their unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness is representing the governments view that the deployment of cruise and trident will take place anyway which is an escalation is it also the governments view that it increases deterrence to raise the percentage of the human race that can be destroyed by nuclear weapons by times <e> <s> is deterrence now to be dependent on the ability of the nato alliance to destroy the human race times rather than times <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem to be the right time just to put in one plea to the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to suggest that in future he has some words with those who organise government business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house deplores the violence on the island of grenada and sends its sympathy to the victims <e> <s> may i ask the noble baroness two questions <e> <s> first will she state the governments view that there should be no outside interference on this island whatever and that the british government will give full support to any action which the commonwealth secretariat may take to mediate and assist in the reconstruction of a stable rgime on the island of grenada <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble baroness did not answer the thrust of my original first question <e> <s> would she take this opportunity to state the view of the british government that there should be no outside interference in the political affairs of this island from any source and particularly to use the influence of the british government as a restraining influence on the government of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the minister is old enough to remember privatisation <e> <s> it is not very long ago since the railways in this country were all privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have to ask a question this is a statement <e> <s> does not the noble lord realise that the nationalisation of the railway network in this country has brought great benefits to the traveller <e> <s> i want to ask him in particular whether he would expand or explain what seemed to me to be a specially menacing reference to the conservative partys manifesto <e> <s> when he talks about there being no major route closures those of us who live in the rural areas begin to get very concerned <e> <s> it is not the major route closures that we fear <e> <s> we are already suffering and have suffered for many many years from the beeching cuts and the minor route closures which still continue <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us specifically where the government stand on this matter <e> <s> do the government regard the rural railway system as a public service for the social good of the rural inhabitants or do they regard it solely as a commercial venture which must pay its way <e> <s> if they take that latter view then further closures in the rural areas are inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect i do not think that the noble lord has answered my question <e> <s> i understand that these are guidelines from the government to the british rail board <e> <s> i have not had the advantage of reading the letter <e> <s> i asked him specifically whether it is the governments policy to regard rural rail networks as a social service or as simply a commercial enterprise <e> <s> the noble lord has not answered that question and i certainly was not confining my attention to the south-east <e> <s> there are many rural areas outside the south-east that require a railway service a great deal more than the commuters of the south-eastern area <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether the consultations to which she has referred include consultations about the fate of the former inhabitants of diego garcia whose treatment contrasts so sharply with that of the inhabitants of the falklands <e> <s> many of those former inhabitants are now living in misery and penury on the island of mauritius <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the excellence of the agreement that has been mentioned by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter does not extend to those former inhabitants of diego garcia <e> <s> is the noble baroness really saying that she is satisfied that they themselves are content with their new lot in mauritius where they are having to live in shanty towns often without employment or hope of employment <e> <s> is this not in fact a forced exile that they are suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will recall that i asked her some questions yesterday <e> <s> is she aware that grenada is a sovereign state owing allegiance to her majesty and a member of the commonwealth and has now been invaded by a foreign power <e> <s> despite the fact that all of us would condemn the violent <e>", "<cs> a british allied territory within the commonwealth and what do the government intend to do in the face of this intervention <e> <s> what was the action of the governor-general representing the queen when the invasion took place <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that point is the minister not aware as the house should be that certain caribbean states including trinidad have refused to participate in this venture <e> <s> does she not also recall that just yesterday afternoon she told the house that there was no obstacle to british citizens leaving grenada <e> <s> if there is no obstacle to british citizens how is it that there is an obstacle to american citizens or a supposed obstacle <e> <s> finally when the noble baroness answered my first supplementary question she said that she had no knowledge of any plans for an invasion <e> <s> is she not aware that there was general knowledge as long ago as sunday that the united states was planning to invade this island and had been asked to do so by certain caribbean states <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have asked the noble baroness a question on two occasions this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow up the question that i have asked her on each of the statements that she has made <e> <s> does the noble baroness recall that on monday i asked her whether she was prepared on behalf of her majestys government to condemn the invasion of the commonwealth state of grenada which is a monarchy <e> <s> the noble baroness would not do so <e> <s> this afternoon she has expressed regret <e> <s> will the noble baroness now escalate the word regret to condemnation <e> <s> is there any precedent for a commonwealth country a monarchy within the commonwealth being invaded by a foreign power without the expression of utter condemnation from her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords my first duty is to apologise to lord beloff for not being able to be here for his opening speech and secondly to apologise also to the noble lord the minister for having to be absent when he spoke on behalf of the government <e> <s> i am quite sure that both noble lords will forgive my absence when i tell them that i was away on a speaking engagement the result of which i have no doubt will be that they will transfer from that side of the house to this at a fairly early date <e>", "<cs> my lords that is surely not a valid point <e> <s> ken livingstone was elected <e>", "<cs> by his constituents <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry but ken livingstone was elected by his constituency and he is representing his constituency on the greater <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a totally different case <e> <s> the electorate of the country was not consulted when mrs thatcher took mr heaths place <e>

to challenge me on this issue i am very willing to take up the challenge <e> <s> it seems perfectly plain to me <e> <s> certainly members of the conservative party have very thick skins if they are going to talk about the democratic election of leaders <e> <s> how do they elect their chairman <e> <s> who elects the chairman <e> <s> who has decided that mr cecil parkinson is no longer fit or suitable to be chairman and should be replaced by mr gummer <e> <s> it is not the electorate <e>", "<cs> my lords no member of the electorate has been consulted <e> <s> in the conservative party it is one man no vote <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords knowing the noble lord i know that he will not want me to mislead the house <e> <s> however will he confirm that when the tanzanians the ugandans and the kenyans asked for military help it was a request which came from their elected representatives that it was not in any way thrust upon them but was the response of the british government to a request from the elected governments <e>", "<cs> my lords on our behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate no one has doubted that international law has been broken by the invasion of grenada nor that the united nations charter has been flouted <e> <s> as my noble friend lord beswick pointed out the american administration has given a number of excuses for this action <e> <s> it began by talking about the safety of american citizens <e> <s> like the noble lord <e> <s> lord hankey i also watched panorama last night and whether or not one believes in a political motivation behind the production of panorama the fact is that there was an interview on that programme which showed quite clearly without any dubiety that the americans who were in the medical school were the principal american citizens on the island and that their dean had been asked by the american administration to demand protection from the american government as a pretext for the invasion <e> <s> that was the first excuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the opportunity of being answered for the first time by the noble lord lord gray of contin <e> <s> i have made this speech in different forms on many occasions with a whole succession of ministers sitting on that front bench not one of whom has yet answered me <e> <s> therefore i particularly hope that the noble lord lord gray may be able to do so <e> <s> i believe that i may have some reason for that hope because as a scotsman <e> <s> i think he will appreciate more of what i am saying and perhaps understand more of what i am saying in view of my experience when i was teaching in glasgow university <e> <s> than would a simple englishman <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made this point before to the ministers predecessors <e> <s> when dame judith hart was minister for overseas development she got the officials some of whom are still in the overseas development administration to work this out for

my lords will the minister give way now <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> will he be so good as to add to his answers whether he has the knowledge that in textiles for instance there are six times as many textile imports from developed countries as there are from developing countries and that the developing countries contribution to textile imports is dropping while that of the developed countries is rising <e>", "<cs> my lords the cuts in these organisations are yet another example of the complete absence of imagination in the minds of this administration <e> <s> from this i exempt entirely the noble lord lord trefgarne who has debated with me on a number of occasions on the subject of aid and whom i have always found to have a most sympathetic attitude towards it largely i imagine inherited from his father <e> <s> but this is a mean-minded measure <e> <s> it is rather like and i think that this is apposite the owner of a supermarket who cuts the number of cash tills thus making the work of his employees more difficult and the life of his customers more uncomfortable <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he answer the question that i put to him specifically <e> <s> when he talks about a reduction in demand does he see a reduction or a projected reduction in the necessity for dealing with a disease like bilharzia

leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house what was the last year in which the balance of trade in manufactured goods for britain was in deficit <e> <s> can he also confirm that as as result of the governments policy over the last four years what they inherited as a surplus of billion a year has now <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to ask the noble lord a question which he can answer <e> <s> is it not the case that this is the first year since the industrial revolution that britain is in deficit in its manufacturing trade <e> <s> is it not further the case that <e> <s> notwithstanding the boasts of the government about the so-called recovery based on a per cent <e> <s> increase in retail sales it is demonstrably caused by a rapid increase in imports over exports and that this is at least partly attributable to the massive outflow of capital from this country to our competitors rather than an investment in manufacturing industry in this country to supply the demands of our retailers <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be ungracious of me having taken part in all the seven previous sessions of debate not to pay my tribute to the noble lord the minister for having accomplished what i in particular have been most anxious should be done right from the second reading the first time round <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that answer <e> <s> may i please ask him three simple questions <e>

there has been a history of conflict within this prison <e> <s> secondly is he aware of the very large extent of the use of drugs by the prison authorities in holloway <e> <s> regarding the use of drugs i understand and he will know of a written answer from his office in another place in there were roughly doses dispensed to prisoners in holloway <e> <s> may i ask whether any of these drugs have been dispensed as a matter of discipline <e> <s> how does the number compare with drugs administered in male prisons <e> <s> thirdly will the noble lord tell the house whether the government are now prepared to publish the report that was made on the death of mrs christine scott in in that prison <e>", "<cs> but my lords that last answer is really not the whole of the truth because there was a report made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the report made to his department on the death of mrs scott and will he tell the house whether his office is prepared to publish that report <e> <s> secondly if his office is satisfied with the conduct of the governor how does he equate that with the clash that they had with the all-party parliamentary penal affairs group when they visited that prison earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that this is a correct forum for the ventilation of and questioning of ministers on matters of public concern and that when these are brought to our attention it is our responsibility to put them to the appropriate minister <e> <s> also would he not agree that he welcomes this opportunity of having a discussion on public affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord kennet for being late but i missed the cue on the monitor until it was rather late <e> <s> i have not much to add to what was said on second reading on st april <e> <s> i do not believe that there is anybody in either house of parliament who does anything but detest the

those principles <e> <s> i should like to refer your lordships to the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he expand on the answer he gave to that part of my speech which referred to the statement of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> if it is the case that the director of public prosecutions can intervene under present law why has he not done so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ezra has done the house a great service in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord lord lyell has totally misunderstood the point i was arguing <e> <s> i was not arguing for increased imports i was simply pointing out that the major competition for british textiles comes from the developed countries where british capital is being increasingly invested not from the developing countries which are being prevented from developing their manufacturing industry on the foundation of textiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether it is not a fact that british contributions to the undp have been reduced by per cent in real terms since

there were in <e> <s> finally in view of the last figures he gave is the noble lord telling the house that funds for this year will be broadly speaking the same as for last year which in real terms is a reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer the noble lord the minister back to the second answer he gave to my supplementary concerning the relationship between funding the undp and our weak economic position <e> <s> is it not the case that we receive back in orders and in fees for training a great deal more money that we contribute to the undp <e> <s> is it not the case that the rest of our aid is especially monitored through the activities of the undp and therefore becomes more effective <e> <s> finally is it not the case that many members of the industrial world who are also in a world depression and i could read out a list of them are increasing their contributions to the undp while the british government are reducing theirs <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not investment rather than giving <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that the mountain of surplus coal mentioned from the conservative back-benches is nowhere near as large or as expensive as the mountain of grain that the government are subsidising all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> it has been a privilege to listen to the learned legal opinions stated this afternoon <e> <s> i do not

withdraw any suggestion that the noble and learned lord was talking of immigrants if he says that he was not <e> <s> that is what i had interpreted his words to mean <e> <s> i am very glad that he intervened and made the position absolutely clear and i apologise to him <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> again i accept the noble and learned lords interpretation <e> <s> all that i would say to him i think he would agree is that the question of fault within the whole of our matrimonial laws has declined over the past decade <e> <s> it would seem to me that the addition of this clause with the words that the noble and learned lord read out <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case but the travesty is not mine alone <e> <s> it is a travesty supported by the legal action group as i am sure the noble and learned lord is aware which has quoted specifically the three cases i have used to show the way in which there is at least a danger that the old concept of fault within the matrimonial causes is being reintroduced <e> <s> i say no more than that in the hope that the matter will be raised and debated by much more learned lords than myself at the committee stage <e> <s> i raise it because i hope that it will be recognised that there are some members of the legal profession who believe that this is a danger <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in certain schools one of them in north london a large comprehensive school of which i had the privilege to be chairman of the governors for some years it has been found that the inclusion of pupils as observers at the governors meetings is not only useful to the pupils as an exercise in democracy but is also of great value to the governors themselves <e> <s> while no one is asking the government to lay down any laws can the government not be a little more forthcoming in encouraging this development among pupils in schools as distinct from further education institutions and suchlike <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware and if he is not aware will he make himself aware of the fact that any good chairman does not talk as much as he listens <e> <s> may be that is not the philosophy of the party opposite <e> <s> but a good chairman is a good listener <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that one of the responsibilities of the governors of a school is to encourage and make facilities for the pupils of that school to pass through the transition period into adulthood in a full and democratic manner rather than in the authoritarian manner that has been expressed from behind him <e>", "<cs> my lords we all welcome what the noble baroness has said about economic and commercial relations and the initiative which the british government have taken <e> <s> however will not the noble baroness agree that the crucial issue over the next few years is to restore normal and friendly diplomatic relations between britain and the argentine <e> <s> as the question of sovereignty is just as important politically in the argentine as it is in this country and so it would seem that neither government would be in a position to start negotiations would it not be sensible to start talks about talks as we had to do in rhodesia using the good offices of the united nations and particularly of the secretary general <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by thanking the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for his chairmanship of the committee and the production of the report <e> <s> i would also express my sympathy with the noble lord lord lyell who once again in yet another debate on economic issues is having to sit on the front bench without the presence of the eager-beaver businessmen who give such support to the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down was he aware when he referred to competition in textiles that seven times as many textiles are imported into this country from the developed countries as from the developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble baroness for that answer <e> <s> is she aware that many varying figures have been given as to the killed and wounded citizens of both commonwealth and other countries <e> <s> is she satisfied that this invasion of grenada which was claimed to be to save life has actually saved more lives than it has cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness the minister feels as deeply saddened as the rest of us by the loss of life in this commonwealth country and i should like to ask her to express that regret on behalf of the government and of parliament <e> <s> in view of this loss of life among commonwealth citizens may i ask whether her attention has been drawn to a report in the american <e>", "<cs> my lords i continue <e>", "<cs> my lords has the attention of the noble baroness been drawn to this question and does the government equate this with the american claim that they went in to grenada in order to save american lives <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount three questions <e> <s> first is it not the case that the secretary-general made a specific appeal before the conference started for a new form of bretton woods conference <e> <s> whilst welcoming that part of the communiqu which suggests that a working party be set up already there has been disappointment expressed as to the powers that it may have <e> <s> what attitude do the british government take to that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that both the americans and the japanese had been monitoring this aircraft for two hours before it was destroyed and had passed on no information that it was off course to the pilot or had any communication with the soviet authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble earl this question on an earlier occasion and he did not have the figures with him <e> <s> i wonder whether he has them today <e> <s> can he tell us what is the percentage of places taken up in comparison to the places that are available and the number of young people who are eligible to enter this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that she herself on behalf of her right honourable friend in another place stated that the news of the peruvian peace plan did not appear before the prime minister until three hours after the general belgrano was sunk <e> <s> if the noble baroness on behalf of her right honourable friend is now saying that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness not aware that the article was first printed in <e>", "<cs> my lords but will the <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness please answer the second part of my question <e> <s> will the noble baroness answer whether the government intend to take any action against the <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes <e> <s> some of us discussed whether an amendment should be tabled on this clause regarding pensions <e> <s> i know that pensions are mentioned here but in parentheses as though it was just a side issue <e> <s> surely the reality of the pension issue in a divorce settlement is that very frequently the wife has contributed often by going out to work or by her housework to the pension itself <e> <s> frequently she is not <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his explanation <e> <s> i quite take his original point about the lack of cohesion between the two sides of my argument <e> <s> if this is so i see no reason why we should reinforce the present law of determining a limited period of maintenance and i would prefer to see it omitted <e> <s> but if after carefully reading the words of the noble and learned lord it seems necessary we shall have an opportunity on report to table an amendment which would at least lessen the effect of the limited period of maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will recall that i recently asked him a question about holloway and he very courteously offered to have private discussions about this which i hope to take up at a suitable time <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord one question about holloway <e> <s> is he aware that as i understand it padded cells are not allowed to be used in holloway prison <e> <s> can he explain why that is particularly in view of the fact that the evidence seems to suggest that a number of prisoners in holloway have damaged themselves because of the lack of protection on the walls <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness answer two questions <e> <s> first is it not the case that the commonwealth communiqu mentioned the issue of other countries accepting as important the linkage between the freeing of namibia and the removal of cuban troops which the noble baroness has also mentioned this afternoon <e> <s> does that indicate that the british government have changed their opposition to the linkage element in the namibian settlement <e> <s> secondly as the noble baroness says that the british government are open to take any initiative to complete the freedom of namibia and in view of the fact that they have rejected the call for economic sanctions against south africa what initiatives do they now intend to take to conclude this long story of providing namibia with independence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to be a little more forthcoming about the second part of the question which concerns cottage hospitals <e> <s> is he aware that in rural areas many cottage hospitals have been closed or have had their services curtailed <e> <s> i should like to give him one example <e> <s> in the area of skegness which caters for about a quarter of a million people in the holiday period in the evening people needing attention now have to go to boston which is miles away <e> <s> is it not sensible for the government to grant extra facilities to cottage hospitals in rural areas where frequently the need is immediate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this gives me a very rare opportunity of congratulating the government on their policy and leadership in the issue of overseas aid although one would still say it is far too low <e> <s> may i ask the minister two specific questions regarding the ida <e> <s> can she say anything about the meeting which is taking place today i understand between britain japan west germany and france to try to help the situation or is this too early <e> <s> if it is too early will she make a satement next week after the meeting <e> <s> secondly what influence is the british government bringing to bear on the united states government to give the ida the money it requires to carry out its invaluable task after june <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two supplementary questions <e> <s> first he refers to the importance of relations with the government of south africa <e> <s> could he expand on thatwhat is the state of relations between the british government and that of south africa <e> <s> secondly he will recall that in the commonwealth communiquthe word fraudulentwas used to describe the new constitution on which the referendum was based <e> <s> in another place the prime minister objected to the word fraudulent and said that she would not have used it <e> <s> the word was used because the vast majority of the inhabitants of south africa the africans are not to be represented in the new constitution <e> <s> can the minister explain the british governments objection to the word fraudulent <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord the minister objects to the word fraudulent as extreme will he take the opportunity to state categorically that in the view of the british government and of all the heads of government who met in new delhi the new constitution in south africa does not meet the requirements which he has laid down for the development of a democratic system in south africa <e> <s> if he is sincere in believing on behalf of the british government that apartheid is abhorrent and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that the present diplomatic representation so far as guinea is concerned is based on dakar and senegal and that that embassy covers senegal mali upper volta and niger none of which countries has substantial if any trading relations with this country whereas guinea is one of the richest countries in africa and many business interests from various countries are represented there <e> <s> would it not be sensible and profitable for this country to have such diplomatic representation in conakry as would assist the development of british business interests in that country <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord has told the house that there is such a small <e>", "<cs> so far in both considerations of the bill before and after the election all sides of the committee have been meticulous in avoiding any value judgments on the customs of other people <e> <s> i am afraid that by introducing the term custom or ritual the government have broken that general agreement and i hope that they will recognise that that is dangerous to the bill <e> <s> it is also dangerous to our relations with other countries and it is particularly dangerous to the relations between the government and indeed parliament and the ethnic minorities in this country <e> <s> that is of course no defence of the practice of female circumcision <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is he saying that the mental anguish caused by the inability of a girl to have a cosmetic operation is of greater importance and should be included as a condition within the bill than the mental anguish caused to girls who come from a society in which female circumcision is the general practice and that that should be a reason for accepting the governments amendment <e> <s> i could not follow the noble lords argument as to the difference between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank those who have taken part in this debate and for the ideas that they have put forward to this house <e> <s> in particular i thank the noble and learned lord on the woolsack whose assurance i accept unreservedly <e> <s> it is clear that there is widespread disturbance about this inequity at least in the present practice if not in the present law <e> <s> it is equally clear that there is unanimous agreement that a wife will have contributed to the pension which is paid to her husband during the time that she has been living with him up to the time of divorce and therefore she has a right to a part of that pension <e> <s> it is our responsibility to see that that right is put into law <e> <s> i leave it to those with much greater legal experience than mine and particularly to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack to see that this is done <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> again i thank noble lords who have participated in this short debate and particularly the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> i wish him godspeed in his promised endeavours <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not in any way questioning the sincerity or the instances given by the noble baroness <e> <s> i feel that she is being a little unfair to her gender <e>", "<cs> gender <e> <s> take your pick <e> <s> when she refers to the increasing number of women who leave their husbands and children because of the greater occupational mobility of women in recent years one can understand this <e> <s> i wonder however whether she has considered that even on the question of the allocation of the children it is the woman who is normally most highly at risk <e> <s> let me explain briefly <e> <s> if the judge decides that it is the husband who is to retain the care and control of the children then it is also normal i am not sure whether it is statutory that it is the wife who has to leave the matrimonial home <e> <s> it is much more difficult for a wife to leave a matrimonial home than it is for a husband <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for not having put my name on the list for this debate <e> <s> i was unable to do so as it is less than two hours since i landed at heathrow and i was not sure that i would be here for the debate <e> <s> i also apologise to my noble friend lord jenkins of putney for arriving a few minutes after he started his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and other previous speakers mentioned that there are members of the labour party who think differently from others <e> <s> that is not altogether extraordinary <e> <s> if he has to comfort himself with pleasure for the liberal party because there are people in the labour party who hold different views then the fortunes of the liberal party must be even lower than those indicated by the opinion polls <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply and particularly for his recognition that this is an open and flagrant invasion of a sovereign terrritory by a foreign power <e> <s> can he tell the house what action the british government have taken or are proposing to take at the united nations which was created precisely for the purpose of protecting the sovereignty of states against foreign invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister tell his friends behind him that on the authority of no less than the cia the cuban advisers and troops entered angola only after the south african invasion <e> <s> does he agree that one of the major elements in any settlement for the future independence of namibia now depends on the breaking of the linkage which the united states appears to continue to insist on between the withdrawal of cuban troops and the application of the united nations resolution for the independence of namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords saying that it has not been established that the cubans only entered angola after the south africans <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity of paying my tribute to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack for his patience and receptiveness during the whole of the process of this bill right from the time of his anger during second reading to the modified rapture that he offered us on report <e> <s> i should also like to add my voice to those who have expressed concern that this bill might at least increase and strengthen the use of matrimonial conduct in divorce cases particularly in those which concern the allocation of the care and control of children <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord on the woolsack has chided me for neglecting the use of conduct under present law <e> <s> all i ask him to do is to ensure that there is no strengthening of the use of that conduct particularly when the future of children is at stake <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this gives me the unique opportunity of congratulating the government twice within the last two weeks on the lead which they have taken in this matter <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord to clarify some of the words of his honourable friend in another place <e> <s> these are questions of elucidation <e> <s> is it the case that the british contribution will be million dollars or million <e> <s> if it is how does this square with the report that the united kingdoms share has fallen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> thirdly when he quotes his honourable friend in another place by referring to equitable burden-sharing among the countries concerned as a condition for the new british contribution what exactly does that mean <e> <s> does it mean that if one of the other countries defaults or refuses to pay the british government will not make their new contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord two further questions <e> <s> is it not the case that unless the billion dollars is provided for the next tranche starting next july the work of the ida will have to be cut because it requires billion dollars just to stand still <e> <s> secondly i was referring to the supplementary amount that the british government have offered and i understand that the british government along with other governments are hoping to hold a new meeting later in the year in order to make up some of the shortfall <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us how the arrangements for that meeting are progressing and whether as happened in the case of japan and west germany it is likely to be deliberately sabotaged by the united states administration <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my first supplementary question <e> <s> is it not the case that unless billion dollars are provided for the ida this year then according to the world bank there will have to be a cut in the operations of the ida <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can tell us how it is if the government claim to be sincere about the importance of teaching ethnic minorities and indeed teaching british children about ethnic minorities that they wound up the development education committeee which was set up partly for this specific purpose and was destroyed by this government <e> <s> can he add and if he does not have the details perhaps he will write to me how many teacher training colleges and institutes of education are teaching specifically the cultures of the ethnic minorities <e> <s> i am thinking of places like balls park in hertfordshire and jordanhill in scotland <e> <s> how many are there in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer my first question <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was simply if the government are sincere about the teaching of the ethnic minorities and about teaching british children the cultures of ethnic minorities why did they wind up the development education committee which was set up under a labour government in the ministry of overseas development and was specifically designed for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to confine myself to one aspect alone of the problem which the noble baroness raised this afternoon and it gives me great pleasure to pick up the point made by the noble lord lord stallard because at one time i was one of his constituents <e> <s> i want to take up the last point that he made about northern ireland and to confine myself entirely to that <e> <s> northern ireland suffers the worst housing conditions of anywhere in the united kingdom per cent <e> <s> of the housing stock is unfit for human habitation per cent <e> <s> of the houses in the province lack the five basic amenities and there are around households on the northern ireland housing executives waiting list <e> <s> what is more this situation is getting worse and it is getting worse because a quarter of the houses were built before <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that in this question there is no implication whatever of any criticism of the course of justice in malawi <e> <s> may i ask him further whether he is aware that life president hastings kamuzu banda is held in great esteem in the country and that it would be a great act of clemency which would give him considerable standing and reputation in this country if <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord consider whether he could advise his right honourable friend the prime minister that she might take an initiative perhaps an all-party initiative before the time is too late to press along with other european countries the claims for clemency in this case and assure president banda that his reputation would be greatly enhanced if he were to listen to such a plea <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that there is a political stalemate in northern ireland which is assisting the recruitment of men of violence particularly from the younger generation <e> <s> will the noble viscount give the house a little more encouragement and say that the government are looking for the opportunity to take a new political initiative which might very well include the suggestions made by the noble lord lord hylton <e>", "<cs> as one who took part in the protection of the elderly in the act i think it only remains for me to underline one or two points that have already been made by previous speakers <e> <s> however i want to emphasise the fact that this is a non-party amendment that it does not involve the principle of the right to buy but that it is a crucial amendment so far as the whole of rural britain is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister has been able to look up the matter since i last asked him a similar question last year <e> <s> can he confirm that i am correct in stating that this is the first time since the beginning of the industrial revolution that britain has had a deficit in the balance of trade figures on manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be kind enough to answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that as consumer spending has apparently <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply and welcome its tone with which i completely agree so far as her majestys broadcast is concerned <e> <s> but would she address herself to the second half of the question and tell the house what the british government are doing in order to meet what the queen stressed was the greatest and i stress the word greatest problem in the world today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness would not wish to mislead the house but would she not agree that the figures which she has just given represent a fall of between and per cent <e> <s> in net terms on the figures for before the present government came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer for the noble baroness by asking whether she is aware that last years overseas aid from the british government amounted to per cent <e> <s> of our gnp in contrast to the per cent <e> <s> which is the objective of the united nations and which has been achieved and passed by certain countries on the continent such as scandinavia and the netherlands <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to welcome the noble earl lord stockton to our house <e> <s> i do so in particular for a personal reason <e> <s> in his wind of change speech in africa made my task much easier when in charge of commonwealth and colonial affairs for the labour party <e> <s> that speech was also a most notable contribution to the subject which i have closest to my heart in this house <e> <s> in view of that i welcome the noble earl very warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall reply only briefly <e> <s> in the first place it is not the case that malnutrition or death from malnutrition was by any means unknown in pre-independence days <e> <s> we could argue this for a long time <e> <s> however the fact is that in most of the third world countries there is a long history certainly dating back to the days of slavery of oppression malnutrition and dire poverty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the phrase in the gleneagles agreement which calls for <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wish to endorse and to re-emphasise the words of my noble friend lady jeger <e> <s> this is a bill which has unanimous support not just in this house but i believe through-out the country <e> <s> if the issues that have been debated in this house were put to the people of britain i believe there would be virtual unanimity that this is a further step towards the civilising of the practices and the law of britain <e> <s> that is the first reason why i wholeheartedly support my noble friend lady jeger in pleading with the government to make it absolutely plain tonight that they are not only approving of the bill but unreservedly putting their total weight behind it when it passes to another place and in the form in which it has passed through this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the book that an interview actually took place but that the answers at that interview were suppressed by the minister of state at the ministry of defence <e> <s> is it the case as is stated in this new book that hms conqueror had been tracking the general belgrano for hours including a period of refuelling before it was attacked <e> <s> is it also the case that a message ordering the general belgrano to return to home port was decoded by gchq at cheltenham <e> <s> did admiral woodward have such information if this is true and was this the reason why the ministry of defence suppressed the answers which he gave to the authors of the book <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the first two questions which i asked him in my first supplementary <e> <s> is it the case that hms conqueror tracked the general belgrano for hours before she was attacked and is it the case that a message ordering the general belgrano back to port was decoded at gchq in cheltenham <e> <s> will the noble lord also say why the general belgrano was attacked on nd may if she was being tracked and was refuelling on st may <e> <s> and why was it that neither of her escorts which i believe were loaded with exocets was attacked at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer the questions which i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord the minister read the assertion that when the then chief of the defence staff the noble lord lord lewin to whom i gave notice that i was raising this question heard that the belgrano was under visual observation he proceeded to chequers where the war cabinet was meeting and stated <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister explain how he justifies his claim that the belgrano was a threat to the task force when it has now been established first that it was sailing away from the task force and secondly that for hours it had been under observation by hms conqueror <e> <s> if it was a threat to the task force why was it not sunk much earlier than nd may <e> <s> secondly will the noble lord answer the assertion that has been made in view of the new revelations about the peruvian peace initiative that either the war cabinet authorised the sinking of the belgrano knowing that the peruvian peace initiative was on the brink of success or in ignorance of that fact in which case the foreign office was in dereliction of its duty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he tell the house whether it is the case that a number of black children have died through this disease because of the lack of screening facilities <e> <s> is it not the case that only three weeks ago in lambeth a boy of two died from this disease which he had had since birth but which had never been diagnosed as sickle cell anaemia <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow up the noble lords last answer does the noble lord agree that as the noble baroness has pointed out this counselling service and the medical follow-up are of equal importance to the screening methods and are of particular importance if not as regards curing the disease then certainly as regards preventing its spread <e> <s> does he also agree that sensitive counselling to the parents can prevent the spread of this disease <e> <s> will he get his department to look into what are at least alleged delays in setting up both screening and counselling in order to restrict this disease to the minimum proportions in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two factors in this debate that strike me as interesting <e> <s> the first is that if your lordships include myself the last five speakers have concentrated on that part of the motion which deals with the third world with the poor of our globe <e> <s> i trust that this is not lost on the noble earl who is to wind up and that he will spend a substantial part of his winding up speech in answering the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble earl is making some movement away from the traditional party which he supports <e> <s> perhaps he can move even further by the end of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness recall that i asked a similar question some months ago and was told that this was a question of government expenditure <e> <s> are the pensions that are due to pensioners who for example go to stay or to live with their children in canada not their own money money that has been contributed throughout their working lives <e> <s> is it not another example of this governments meanness towards the poorer sections of the community that they are not allowed to draw their full pension if they emigrate to a country like canada <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the statement by the noble lord the minister that the government are not satisfied with the signal to south africa may i ask whether he is aware that in many parts of the african continent and indeed as far afield as the united states the signal of the south african radio service is much stronger than that of the world service of the bbc <e> <s> in view of the fact that all broadcasting in south africa is censored and under government control will the noble lord assure the house that the government will press on with their plans for giving further support to the bbc in beaming its signals to the whole of the african continent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of his noble friends behind him told me on the night of th april that he had had to guide one of his colleagues into the chamber never having been here before apparently and then had had to guide him into the government division lobby <e> <s> does the noble lord the chief whip believe that this enhances the reputation of this house or detracts from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that according to ex-secretary of state haig and i quote <e>", "<cs> yes the dates are confused my lords but the days are not <e> <s> this was a report in his memoirs as to what happened on the sunday that is on the morning of nd may when he further said that the agreement was down to words <e> <s> at that moment our foreign secretary of the time francis pym <e>", "<cs> was in washington <e> <s> why did he not know of these negotiations between general haig and president belaunde <e> <s> and if he did know why did he not relay them to chequers

programme that the british ambassador in lima charles wallace was kept informed by telephone at every step of the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has already answered a question about the panorama programme from one of her own back-benchers will she be so courteous as to answer my question about the same programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this delaying tactic is acceptable i would say to no part of this house <e> <s> is it not a fact that the last time the death grant was revised was in october <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the discussions on the government document bearing on the death grant were completed by july and we have still had no reactions to the document <e> <s> is she satisfied with the speed with which the government are approaching what is a very vital problem for thousands of people in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the major issues have already been raised <e> <s> all want to ask the minister is one final question regarding the review which was supposed to be completed in july <e> <s> will she answer the original question that i put to her <e> <s> is she satisfied that on this desperately tragic issue the government are moving with sufficient speed when they have not yet responded to the result of that review which is now almost two years old <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking very warmly the noble lord lord beloff for introducing this motion not simply because it is leading to a most interesting debate but because in my view british politics is greatly lacking in ideological debate and this kind of motion is particularly apposite to this house where we can debate ideologically and can add a valuable element to british politics <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> it is a point on to which i was going to lead my argument <e> <s> i accept completely that the wording of the motion indeed supports the basic philosophy that i hope will follow from the enunciation of the form of socialism which is the central part of my speech <e> <s> but at the moment as the noble lord has by implication admitted the wealth distribution of this country allows freedom for the few and denies freedom to the many <e> <s> once you get into the situation in which an elite has freedom inevitably that is denying the same kind of freedom to the vast majority of the citizens of this county <e> <s> this is the central thrust of my examination at least not necessarily of the noble lords interpretation of the conservative philosophy but of the conventional conservative philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not just talking about those who have cars <e> <s> i am certainly not unaware of the fact that a lot more people in rural areas have cars now than say years ago <e> <s> but there are still a lot of people who do not have cars and who are leaving the rural areas because they find that they neither have mobility nor the elementary opportunity of just doing their ordinary shopping <e> <s> when the test of the services whether bus or rail rests simply on the issue of profitability then i suggest that we are penalising the old the young and indeed a large number of middle-aged people in rural areas who do not have cars <e> <s> we are driving them out of the rural areas and seeing particularly the young people being forced to go to the cities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him if he would accept from me that certainly i would urge mr scargill to hold a national ballot but that does not mean that i will support the rejection or the withdrawal of the right of citizens in the metropolitan areas to elect their own councils rather than have them imposed by nominated representatives of central government <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the figures are there <e> <s> they show a rising gini co-efficient during the lifetime of the present government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness the minister for that reply and welcome the <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble baroness on her comments concerning the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house what was the increase in the retirement pension at its last pegging last may or june and at the same time what was the inflation rate during the comparable period <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness accept from me that the increase in pensions over the past year from the last time that they were pegged was less than the increase in the inflation rate during that comparable period <e> <s> if that is so how does the noble baroness justify her claim that the government have maintained the purchasing power of the pension <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in welcoming the release of these prisoners but is it not a fact that unita is a rebel organisation with no international standing rebelling against an internationally recognised state <e> <s> is it not also a fact that it is well known that unita is supplied with resources by the south african government <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house whether any representations were made either publicly or privately to the south african government regarding this outrage against british citizens by a rebel organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the present government are continually telling the public and this house that taxation is money belonging to the taxpayer is not the withholding of the appropriate rebates to non-working miners a blatant act of theft <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister trying to transfer responsibility from the government to the national coal board <e> <s> in his answer he stated in an aside that this was the way in which the national coal board was acting <e> <s> surely it is the treasury which is acting in this way and which must take the responsibility <e> <s> if that is the case is it not clear that this is one further tactic of the government to starve the miners and their families into submitting to a policy laid down by this government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister know that i am perfectly aware of that fact <e> <s> and that his reply does not answer my question <e> <s> i was asking the noble lord whether he can provide a guarantee that following the visit next week of the south african prime minister freedom for the african national congress will remain as it is now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer to a previous supplementary question was not quite to the point <e> <s> is there not a difference between receiving the prime minister who is the apotheosis of the policy of apartheid and dealing with a foreign minister say in the course of normal diplomatic relations <e> <s> i believe that this is the first occasion since the war when general smuts was prime minister of south africa that a south african prime minister has been received in downing street <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for that answer may i ask her two quite separate questions <e> <s> first can she elucidate for the house exactly what action the south african minister of defence took in the court case which was i believe brought in the supreme court in windhoek by a number of churches in order to get the release of the detainees who they held were being detained illegally <e> <s> secondly does she agree that this country has a special responsibility towards detainees in namibia in view of the fact that it was her majestys government of the time which passed over the mandate of what was then south-west africa to the government of south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness confirm as is implied in her answers that the detainees in the mariental camp came from the raid on cassinga and therefore they were taken from a foreign country as cassinga is in angola and not in namibia <e> <s> can she tell the house whether a specific protest has been made by her majestys government or representations about the interference of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret the fact that this debate it appears is being used by certain noble lords for intemperate attacks on the government and state of zimbabwe and i believe that there is a great deal of hypocrisy being talked around this subject <e> <s> we have heard from noble lords who i know were silent when the allegations that they have mede this afternoon were being perpetrated by the ian smith government against black africans <e> <s> nor have <e>", "<cs> my lords i leave that intervention for noble lords to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interrupted after all <e> <s> the speech of the noble lord lord paget has done a disservice to the reputation of this country <e> <s> it has done a disservice to bishop muzorewa and it has done a disservice to those who are trying to preserve the rule of law in zimbabwe <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i should like to ask him quickly if that is the case why then was the reverend sithole gaoled before independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving me a minute or so at the end of our debate <e> <s> i should like to thank each of the speakers individually and mention his contribution but obviously there is not time for that <e> <s> but i thank everybody who has taken part in this debate <e> <s> i am sure everyone will understand if i particularly single out the noble viscount lord falkland who i am honoured to have make his maiden speech in a debate of this kind <e> <s> we not only hope to hear him again but we shall expect to hear him again on this subject <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house i beg leave to withdraw this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount tell the house whether the prime minister made any representations to mr botha regarding the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never tried to hide my opposition to the entry of great britain into the eec <e> <s> it is an opposition which is based on premises different from those of most of my fellow opponents on this side of the house and i should say different from those of all the opponents of that entry on the other side of the house <e> <s> it is an opposition based upon my concept of internationalism <e> <s> i would fully accept that mrs shirley williams one of the founders of the sdp was sincere in her concept of internationalism when she used that as her reason for supporting entry into the eec <e> <s> in my view she was wrong and certainly her views were not shared by the other members of the gang of four or by many others who have since joined the sdp <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i thank her for answering one of my questions <e> <s> i remind her however that i asked another specific question about what her majestys government were doing in the agricultural field in relation to the production of food in this country and the production of food in the third world <e> <s> is it not the case that this government are spending as much on subsidies to food in this country as on every other aspect of life in this country and that this subsidy is undermining the production of food in the third world and the export of that food to this country <e>", "<cs> and the prices my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords although this question refers to cars it refers also to british leyland <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister would care to repeat to the british leyland workers in bathgate and in leeds what he has just said <e> <s> could he tell us i will understand if he has not got the figures what is now the waiting time for the land <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister tell the house whether it is the case that in the instance of inmos the government invested public money in the development of microchips in this country when the private sector was not prepared to take the risk that the government have invested million in this company and that the company has now started to make a profit <e> <s> if that is the case is there any excuse for passing over these profits to the private sector <e> <s> should they not be kept in the public sector on behalf of the taxpayers who have paid this money and thus retain within britain the development of this important electronic device for the development of wealth production in britain rather than risking its going abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord gave the figures that he has just quoted from the report was he not aware that on only last wednesday in another place his right honourable friend the minister for information technology gave totally different figures including the figure of employed in newport and in bristol <e> <s> is he further aware that there has been a report that the american at t company has had its offer actually on the agenda of a cabinet committee and then removed by the minister for trade and industry <e>

on the important developments of the transputer for the late s <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer my question on the transputer which is an important question for the future of microchips in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin attempted desperately to hide from his supporters the real issue of this bill <e> <s> he tried to frighten them with the name of ken livingstone <e> <s> we on this side of the house have many doubts which today we share with many conservatives over the policies and attitudes of mrs thatcher <e> <s> according to the logic of the noble lord lord bellwin we should be trying to legislate to abolish the house of commons <e> <s> rather it is our intention to persuade the electors to reject her in an election <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount not aware that he is being less than fair in suggesting that this was just a one-off conference which lasted for a short period and that therefore it cannot be judged <e> <s> this is the fifth conference which has taken place since the government came into office and presumably it is the latest climax of the governments policy <e> <s> is not the noble viscount further aware that we have heard these pious hopes and platitudinous phrases five times since the government came into office and that nothing has happened except that unemployment has got worse and there have been a record number of bankruptcies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble viscount does not wish to be deliberately unfair but i would suggest that he is again being unfair to me in his answer to my question <e> <s> the statement referred to the objective of increasing official government aid whenever possible <e> <s> i am drawing the noble viscounts attention to the fact that this objective has been repeated six times and that each time it has been followed by cuts in aid <e> <s> can the noble viscount give us any assurance that the words of the statement

moved the amendments formally i intervene because quite unconsciously i hasten to say this immediately he concluded commons amendment no <e> <s> before i had had the chance to intervene following the

determine whether or not those houses designed for elderly people shall be available for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but the noble lord <e>", "<cs> has not answered a single one of my questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that the scheme was originally designed to help in particular small businesses which would not normally qualify for bank loans <e> <s> is he aware that every bank which has expressed itself on the new scheme including the co-operative bank which was the first bank to ask for its introduction has condemned it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister also aware that he was inaccurate in his interpretation of my first supplementary question <e> <s> i did not suggest that the banks had criticised the original scheme <e> <s> we are all aware of the success of the original scheme <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister now tell the house whether any bank has approved of the change in the scheme which has taken place this month <e> <s> is it not a fact as my noble friend has suggested from the front bench that this change is seen by the banks as too expensive and therefore as an obstacle to the development of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> i think that she has misunderstood <e> <s> i was contrasting constitutional progress with violence <e> <s> i was referring to those who are committed to constitutonal progress and who have rejected violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will agree that i must intervene here <e> <s> i said nothing about two members of the ruc <e> <s> i made a comment about an observation which had been made by a judge but i never mentioned the ruc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that according to the national institute the expected annual output growth of this country for this year and next year is per cent <e> <s> and that this is not sufficient to reduce unemployment <e> <s> is he further aware that the national institute has stated that only an expansionist policy can give the private sector the means to provide sufficient jobs to reduce unemployment <e> <s> if he does not agree with these findings what is the governments policy towards reducing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is serious in claiming that he believes in the governments policies and that those policies will bring down unemployment which is the story we have been hearing for at least three years why is it that unemployment continues to rise <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks to the efforts of my noble friend lord wells-pestell we are debating a motion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i quite understand that part of the philosophy <e> <s> i was about to address myself to it <e> <s> if this is the philosophy of the conservative party it comes back to what the noble lord lord cockfield had to say at the beginning of the debate about the necessity for wealth production <e> <s> we believe in wealth production but we believe in real wealth production <e> <s> i cannot see how members of the conservative party today can reconcile that philosophy based upon wealth production and the necessity for inequality to achieve wealth production with the record of their government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in his annual report to the home secretary sir kenneth newman expressed concern for the morale of people living in inner city areas particularly and picked out unemployment and other forms of deprivation as having a direct bearing on the crime rate <e> <s> what is the governments point of view on that <e> <s> do they accept that their economic policies are increasing the crime rate <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government therefore denying the assertion in sir kenneth newmans report to the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that he is misrepresenting both the wording on the order paper and the questions i have asked in supplement <e> <s> i have never suggested that removing unemployment necessarily removes crime <e> <s> i have never suggested that there is a direct link between unemployment and crime figures <e> <s> is the noble lord prepared to state whether the government recognise as sir kenneth newman does that the increase in unemployment and deprivation which results from the present governments economic policies has created a climate in which rising crime can be expected and has been seen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl who has answered my question five brief and simple supplementary questions <e> <s> first is it the case that the barratt solo flats which are being built in scotland contravene the regulations <e> <s> secondly is it the case that every application made by barratt to the secretary of state for scotland for dispensation has been granted <e> <s> thirdly is it true that last year barratt <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl the minister answered my first supplementary questions by pointing out that the regulations come under the local authorities <e> <s> is he aware that the applications were made to the local authorities and were turned down by the local authorities that barratt then appealed to the secretary of state for scotland and that on every occasion the secretary of state for scotland gave his dispensation <e> <s> is this purely a coincidence with the last three of the supplementary questions i asked <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon the noble lord lord molson stated that those who had opposed the government in the previous vote in committee stage had done so because they objected to the suspicion of gerrymandering in taking away power from the metropolitan councils and the glc and in some cases changing the political nature of those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is an all-party select committee and that its all-party membership found that in the days before the invasion of grenada her majestys government had <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that in this case the lack of intelligence was <e>", "<cs> my lords if her majestys government were informed in advance how did it come about that the foreign secretary less than hours before the invasion told members of the other place that no invasion was imminent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i for one moment draw to the attention of the noble viscount the leader of the house the fact that on many occasions including that which he mentioned the debate on the motion of the noble lord lord ezra a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the cleveland education authority as one example has already complained about receiving unsolicited material from the ministry of defence in support of nuclear arms <e> <s> is he further aware that it is at least reported that the ministry of defence has been conducting a recruiting campaign through an illegal radio station <e> <s> if that is correct is it not as well that children at school should be given another version or interpretation of the issue of peace and war <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a bizarre afternoon the climax of two months of fantasy <e> <s> we have been asked in this house and historians will find this very difficult to conceive to legislate for a hypothetical situation months hence plus a number of hypothetical situations which may materialise in between <e> <s> what kind of legislation are we being asked to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one brief question on this statement <e> <s> he included in his statement the assertion that this policy <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl is responsible for the welfare recruitment and numbers of the civil service can he tell the house what has happened to these over civil servants <e> <s> have they just been added to the dole queues <e> <s> has he any information as to what will be their future prospects and what are the prospects of young recruits into the service <e>", "<cs> my lords while supporting the amendments of the noble lord lord tordoff may i first make one reservation about the implications of his speech <e> <s> i think it would be a pity if it were to go out from this house to the public that noble lords simply use their cars to get from their homes to this palace <e> <s> indeed i am sure that many noble lords would agree with me that their cars are frequently used to visit educational establishments and industrial establishments to meet immigrants and to meet various lobbies <e> <s> one can also mention the number of metropolitan councils which over the last few weeks have asked us to go to meet them <e> <s> of course our travel does not compare with that of a member of parliament in his constituency but there is a substantial amount of travelling involved in the proper exercise of our duties in this house and the collection of material for the formation of views to be expressed here <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that since this question was tabled a number of revelations have been made elicited solely by questioning in this house and in another place and by certain organs of the press <e> <s> in view of those revelations will he answer two specific questions <e> <s> am i correct in understanding that the answer to my question is that the prime minister was informed of the change of course of the belgrano in november <e> <s> if that is so why was that not specifically referred to in the white paper published the following month and secondly why was it that the prime minister gave a completely contrary answer to a member of the public in the view of the nation as a whole during the general election more than six months after she had been told of the change of course <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that on th may in her answer in another place the prime minister asserted categorically that the conduct of the war was in political hands <e> <s> is it not also the case that since that time there has been a constant and premeditated cover-up of the facts of the sinking of the belgrano <e> <s> in view of the loss of life on the belgrano and the loss of life two days later in the retaliatory bombing of the sheffield if the prime minister did not know the course of the belgrano at the time that she ordered its torpedoing should she not have asked <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that in the second quarter of this year the increase in the number of people in employment was exactly one quarter of the increase in employment in the last quarter of last year <e> <s> will he confirm that the figures were roughly and <e> <s> if the noble lord confirms those figures how do they support the governments claim that there has been a recovery in this country and how do they support the noble lords claim that new people are being put to work <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be so kind

aware that this decision which is to be so bitterly regretted and will be regretted very widely in this country and in africa makes it virtually certain that the contract will therefore go to the dutch fokker company because the dutch government in contrast to our government now pay something over per cent <e> <s> of their gross domestic product in aid and have included aid in the fokker companys tender <e> <s> does the noble lord not recognise that this decision means fewer jobs for people in the aerospace industry in britain a loss of prestige in central africa and grave disappointment for the continued close relationship between zimbabwe and the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that whatever reservations some of us on this side of the house may have about the aid and trade provision this is a case where aid could be married with commercial interest in this country providing more jobs in this country and providing products which the zimbabweans want from this country if we will only give them the chance <e> <s> is the noble lord not conscious of the fact that such a decision will have repercussions throughout central and southern africa where we have a long and distinguished record of supplying aircraft and that as a result of this decision the british aircraft industry and british aircraft workers may very well be denied the opportunity over the next years to replace the aircraft which in the past have been provided from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that that statement will bring very grave disquiet not only to people in this country but to opponents of apartheid throughout the world

coercion has been or will be used to remove the three opponents of apartheid from our consulate in durban <e> <s> can he give an assurance that the british government will use all their influence with the government of south africa to ensure that the conditions laid down in the statement yesterday which are surely acceptable to any civilised society are met by the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords it is one thing to pass resolutions and make speeches it is quite another <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it is a totally different matter to deal with those who are personally involved in the opposition to apartheid <e> <s> would he agree that in the statements that he has made this morning there is a danger of revealing a very wide gap between words and actions <e> <s> do the british government consider these three opponents of apartheid to be political refugees asking for asylum or do they consider them to be intruders into the consulate <e> <s> will the noble lord further tell the house whether the british government are prepared to put what he has said about the reference to the united nations into action and not to wash their hands of it

noble lord assure the house that when the decision to which he has referred is taken or before that decision is taken he will draw the attention of his honourable and right honourable friends to the fact that as long ago as last february in a report prepared for the present chancellor of the exchequer when he was energy minister coopers and lybrand found that electricity was already being overcharged by up to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that last thursday his noble friend lord lucas in answering a question from me indicated that the government by refusing to give aid and assistance to a tender from british aerospace were losing both the contract for britain and the employment that would have been so provided <e> <s> can he tell the house whether it is not the case that british overseas aid provides employment in britain and can he say by how much that employment has been <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be so courteous as to answer the question which i asked and which was also asked by my noble friend lord oram <e> <s> why is it that he continues with this gramophone record saying that we cannot afford it and that we have to tailor our aid according to our resources when on the continent of europe in similar circumstances that aid has been increased despite the recession <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that last week i asked him about some figures concerning what he has again referred to as new employment over the past year <e> <s> may we assume that he is speaking on behalf of the department of employment <e> <s> if so has he had time in the ensuing week to look at the figures published by his own department which show that during the second quarter of this year the number in new employment is only one quarter of that in the last quarter of last year <e> <s> does this not show an underlying trend which is gravely slowing down the numbers placed in new employment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this question <e> <s> while one may welcome the announcement that he has made as to added assistance from the british government to the international population programme would he agree that in the long run the only way of limiting population growth is to raise living standards and in particular to reduce infant mortality <e> <s> is it not the case that in many developing countries where half of the infants die before they have reached the age of five it is simply impossible to put over the education for family planning and reduction until these figures are reduced which is a part of the increase in the purchasing power and living standards of the people of developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether the missing log contained the information which has caused

april of this year <e>", "<cs> i have asked for that one month my lords <e> <s> can the noble lord not provide the figures which his department can give him for the month of september <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister is dodging the question <e> <s> is it not the case that in the month of september our exports fell by roughly million and that imports increased by a like amount <e> <s> is it not the case also that in his budget earlier this year the chancellor predicted a billion surplus overall for the trade balance this year <e> <s> is it not the case that at the present time so far this year the deficit is running at a rate of million <e> <s> how does the minister equate those two figures <e> <s> is this part of the governments supposed recovery <e>", "<cs> really my lords the minister cannot get away with that <e> <s> the figures published in september expressly excluded the effects of the miners strike <e> <s> will he now answer the question of how the chancellors prediction of six months ago is being manifested in the present deficit whereas he had claimed that there was going to be a billion surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> does it not indicate that the government believe that the rich will work harder only when they get more money and the poor will work harder only when they get relatively less <e> <s> is it the deliberate policy of this government to widen the wealth gap between the rich and the poor <e>",

encouraged by me or not to purchase council houses or british telecom shares when as he has shown they are getting relatively poorer as a result of the economic policies of this government while the top per cent <e> <s> have grown relatively richer during the term of office of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking a question not about the last years but about the period from the time when this government took office in to the end of the last year for which the inland revenue give figures <e> <s> what happened during that period <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house whether the figure that she has quoted from her right honourable and learned friend indicates a reduction in real resources in the aid budget for next year <e> <s> if that is the case can she tell the house whether she agrees with her former government colleagues led by mr heath and mr pym who have stated that in their view overseas aid should be increased next year both in the interests of industry in this country and in the interests of humanitarianism in view of the growing famine spreading through much of the world and particularly through the continent of africa <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness be so kind as to answer my first question directly <e> <s> does the figure she has given the house indicate a reduction in real resources due to the impact of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords however the noble baroness may use the figures according to her own figures in the last year of the last labour government per cent <e> <s> of gnp was spent on overseas aid <e> <s> she did not tell the house what was the percentage of gnp spent by the present government this year <e> <s> is it not the case that that was around per cent <e> <s> substantiating the point made by my noble friend lord oram that there has been a very substantial decrease in aid since this government came into office <e> <s> may i refer her <e>", "<cs> to my original question <e> <s> does she agree with her former government colleagues that increased aid far from diminishing our economic resources would increase them and help to solve the present economic crisis in this country as well as abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords as this question refers to the taxpayer can the noble lord tell the house whether it is still the case that tax rebates for strikers are being withheld which means if that is so that miners families who are dependent on the soup kitchen are being deprived of money to which they are entitled accumulating from before the strike started <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord the chief whip <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister to answer the question which i asked <e> <s> is it not relevant considering that this question refers to taxpayers that the inland revenue apparently still owes money to strikers and strikers families <e> <s> is that not the case <e> <s> have these rebates not been withheld since before the miners strike started <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and at the request of the noble lord lord jenkins of putney who is unable to be here because of illness i beg leave to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of that very intelligent answer from the minister can he tell the house whether it is not the case that on st may the then secretary of state for foreign affairs stated publicly that <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the comments made by the ministers noble friend below the gangway regarding the signals received by the argentine navy would it not be in the interests of the government of parliament and of the public if the government were now to publish a full white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble viscount the leader of the house whose function i misunderstood at that point <e> <s> will the noble lord who answered or did not answer my original question explain why if his last answer is correct that it was the case that the government believed that the belgrano was a danger to the british task force the secretary of state for foreign affairs could say that no further military action was envisaged and why he and the attorney-general put forward their reservations and their doubts as to the action that was proposed to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that this is not a question of just one log book hut of six documents and that those documents were it is said officially delivered to the ministry of defence intact after the debriefing of the crew of the conqueror <e> <s> is it not also the case that his own secretary of state for defence publicly declared that the signals log was destroyed in the period up to february under the authority of the defence council <e> <s> if that is so

debate <e> <s> i hope he will be able to find a minute to answer the one point that i want to put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i warmly support the spirit of the question put by the noble lord lord cottesloe as one who i am sure along with many of your lordships has enjoyed the amenities of hampstead heath for many years <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl a particular question arising out of his answer <e> <s> if a number of borough councils in this case i believe three are to be responsible for hampstead heath who will decide whether such events as the excellent series of open air concerts

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble and learned lord for that answer <e> <s> may i also ask him whether it is the case that last june it was discovered that under certain secret regulations known as the l code officials of the dhss were being ordered to take action which was illegal in revealing information provided for the legal aid scheme to other members of the dhss who were not concerned with legal aid <e> <s> is it the case that those orders were then suspended that a rewriting of the code was ordered following the rayner recommendations and that the attorney-general stated that it was under urgent consideration <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord say that this is a sign of urgent consideration and can he assure the house that the new regulations will be published and the public reassured over this grave breach of confidentiality <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble and learned lord two further questions <e> <s> first so far as his understanding is concerned is it the case that the rayner recommendations will propose that the administration of legal aid is solely within the purview of the noble and learned lords own department <e> <s> secondly are there any plans to publish <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take the question one stage further with the noble and learned lord on his answer <e> <s> when he says transferred is it not the case that the administration of legal aid has always been under his department <e> <s> does he not agree that it should be quite clearly defined as under his department particularly in view of the fact that as long ago as the dhss ignored the views of his departments legal aid advisory committee that disclosure of legal aid information for any other purposes than legal aid administration was a criminal offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister whether it is the case that his ministry the ministry of defence has issued rules of engagement to those of the armed forces guarding nuclear sites which give them authority to shoot protesters if those protesters may be occupying or may intend to occupy nuclear installations <e> <s> in view of his original answer to me is it not the case that there may be a conflict of legal interest between those regulations and section of the criminal law act which lays down what authority may be given for the use of force in such circumstances <e> <s> i should like to have had a ruling or an opinion on this from the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> in answering my supplementary question would the noble lord the minister consult with his noble and learned friend on the woolsack as to

new process <e> <s> whereas previously premature babies were expected to die with the new process which needs new money there is now the opportunity to keep them alive <e> <s> will not the noble earl

standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the need to put down this question arose from the failure of the noble viscount the leader of the house to answer the same question in the second reading debate on the local government bill although i put it to him directly <e> <s> if it is the governments case that the upper tier of local government should be removed from the glc and the metropolitan counties and power returned to the people at a local level why does that not apply equally in the shire counties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite aware of that but that has nothing to do with the principle of removing the upper tier of local government <e> <s> so far as i understand it the government are making the case that on principle this upper tier should be removed <e> <s> therefore why not do so in the shire counties <e> <s> would it not have saved the government a good deal of embarrassment last week in the county council elections if the shire counties had been abolished indeed as much a saving of embarrassment last tuesday if this house had been abolished <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support the point which has just been made by the noble earl lord onslow and

division soccer grounds <e> <s> there are many soccer clubs in other leagues in amateur leagues or in no leagues which have stands which anybody visiting would see were fire hazards <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the first thing to say about this bill which as the noble baroness has just mentioned has come round for the third time is that on all sides of the house there has been a declared intention that it should not be taken to interfere with anyones customs abroad <e> <s> secondly we are all agreed that female circumcision of any kind is abhorrent to those of us who live in this country and should be declared unlawful <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down would she just answer one question <e> <s> has she read the criticism of the mental health clause in

leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another example of a question made necessary by the refusal of the minister to answer a specific point made by me in this case during your lordships debate on women on st may <e> <s> is it not the case that wives in this country whether or not they be british citizens have no right to secure their husbands entry from abroad whereas husbands have the right to arrange for their wives living abroad to join them in this country <e> <s> is this not a flagrant breach of the principle which the minister enunciated at the end of our debate on st may that the government are committed to equality <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it then that discrimination on sex grounds is necessary according to

convenience of the committee and i hope it will be of some assistance to the noble baroness who is to reply and who i know has had a long day if i follow the example of the noble lord lord kennet and add my remarks about the various amendments in his name my name and our joint names <e> <s> i make it plain that there is no intention in any of the amendments to allow female circumcision to continue by a side door <e> <s> on second reading there seemed to be some impression that that was the intention of those of us who objected to clause <e> <s> that has never been the case <e> <s> those of us who have been trying to remove that subsection are just as fervent in our desire to abolish female circumcision in this country as are those who sponsored the bill <e> <s> that is surely self-evident as it was the noble lord <e> <s> lord kennet who twice took the initiative to introduce a bill to abolish female circumcision <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord before he finishes to give the committee the benefit of his very wide knowledge of the central issue of mental health as it is included in this bill <e> <s> does he recognise that girls who have been brought up in a society in which female circumcision is the practice and the ritual and indeed in some cases the religion may very well suffer from mental depression if they are deprived of this operation <e> <s> we are all agreed that they should be deprived of this operation <e> <s> does he not see the difficulty of saying that this form of mental depression must go without an operation whereas the forms that he has been describing shall be allowed an operation <e> <s> does he not see that to many people this appears to be racial discrimination <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness tell us what loophole <e> <s> the noble lord lord richardson has said that it is not a medical loophole <e> <s> what is the loophole <e> <s> will the noble baroness find out <e>", "<cs> yes but last time not just on this side but on

something similar would not be acceptable to them <e> <s> i ask that because we have had it on the authority of the noble lord lord richardson that this phrase would not prevent the legitimate operations which they and he are anxious shall be preserved <e>", "<cs> in view of the statement just made by the noble lord lord kennet and in view of the fact that the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists was not aware of this amendment because it had not been tabled at that time i really find it difficult to accept that a college of that distinction would say that there are three words in the english language custom or ritual which are the only words that can be used in this bill as protection <e> <s> i should like to accept the assurance of the noble baroness that between now and report stage she will question them quoting the judgment of the noble lord lord richardson on this particular amendment <e> <s> as she has given me that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that there has been some concern about her

africa to connive at the present constitution and do nothing while we wait and see what happens in view of the fact that million of the million inhabitants of south africa are black and have no representation in that constitution <e> <s> furthermore when she is using her influence with the south african government is she prepared also to talk to the united democratic federation and to the

realise after the recent raids into botswana and the raid on cabinda that the words of her majestys government have no effect whatever on south african policy <e> <s> that is why i am asking what action the government intend to take <e> <s> can she tell us why last week at the security council the british government abstained from voting on the resolution which warned south africa of the movement towards economic sanctions <e> <s> can she tell the house why only yesterday at the special commonwealth committee meeting the british government stood alone against the whole of the rest of the commonwealth in action not words being taken against these invasions by south africa of international morality <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the south african administration in namibia before the new interim administration was formed was also illegal internationally and has been declared so <e> <s> the noble baroness in answering my first supplementary question said that the reason that the british government had abstained at the united nations was that they did not believe in economic sanctions <e> <s> is it not the case that the british government are now placing themselves in isolation from the rest of the commonwealth and in isolation from the rest of the security council apart from the united states of america <e> <s> if the british government do not believe in economic sanctions what action do they believe in bearing in mind the fact that words have been used for the past years with results that we can all see today <e>", "<cs> my lords i have every sympathy with the noble baroness who has sponsored this bill and who has spoken in moving the third reading <e> <s> i am sad that she has as it were changed sides since the bill of the noble lord lord kennet was before this house last year <e> <s> i recognise her sincerity in doing so and i know that her main purpose in sponsoring this bill in this house has involved really a choice of options perhaps a choice of evils and that she considered that it was more important to get any bill outlawing female circumcision on the statute book rather than to get a bill which could not be considered to have any overtones of racial discrimination <e> <s> i think she is wrong and i think she has been deluded by the government who have in fact used a form of blackmail in getting the bill pushed through this house <e>", "<cs> yes my lords by the government <e> <s> i believe as i say that although sincere she has been deluded by the government by a process of blackmail in which the government have said quite insincerely and with a good deal of misleading that they wanted the bill on the statute book at all costs <e> <s> they did not <e> <s> the government could have had this bill on the statute book months ago outlawing female circumcision <e> <s> the government would only accept a bill which was drafted in the form they desired and they would only accept a bill which was

"<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down <e>", "<cs> may i ask two questions <e> <s> i gathered by implication that the answer to the second question is no that the government have not consulted the london black womens action project <e> <s> but in the case of the first question on whether the government have consulted their own statutory body the commission for racial equality the noble baroness seemed to slide away from it <e> <s> the noble baroness said that the government had observed and considered its findings but i asked whether the government had consulted the commission after it had passed its judgment or are the government just saying we know better than our own statutory body set up to examine racial discrimination <e> <s> have the government consulted that commission <e> <s> can we have a straightforward answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount the leader of the house for that statement <e> <s> how is the house to express its wishes <e> <s> the noble viscount may be aware that when i last asked a similar question about the decline of the merchant navy there was all-party support for the proposition that there should be an investigation of some kind <e> <s> the majority appeared to favour having a select committee of this house <e> <s> can the noble viscount tell the house how we should express our wishes if as seemed to be the case on the last occasion that i asked this question there is general support for the appointment of a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that in answering this question the noble lord will not be misled by the degree of support that i received on my first question from his noble friends behind him <e> <s> may i remind him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is

noble lord tell us on how many of those dates the question related to the log of hms conqueror <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords answer to my first supplementary question contained a long list of historical dates <e> <s> can he say whether that was an answer to the question on the order paper <e> <s> my question concerned what had happened to the inquiry into the loss of the log of hms conqueror <e> <s> which of the dates that he reeled off related to the question <e> <s> i appeal to the noble viscount the leader of the house <e> <s> is it not a courtesy of the house that when a question is asked the answer should relate to that and not to other elements that have nothing to do with the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i must answer that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i must answer that as it is a personal point <e> <s> i sent an apology to the house that afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord whether or not it is the case that a demonstration model of the gun-carrying half-track vehicle the centaur has been sent to chile with a view to further sales <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take the opportunity of dissociating himself from the view of his noble friend who spoke earlier that if a repressive regime is to receive the weapons to exercise that repression it does not matter whether we supply them provided we get the market or whether somebody else supplies them and that we are guiltless because if we do not supply them then somebody else will do so <e> <s> will the noble lord also say whether or not there is any point in sending the demonstration model which i mentioned in my first supplementary question unless that demonstration model is to be taken up and supplied <e> <s> do the government contemplate giving a licence for the supply of the centaur <e> <s> if so do they not agree that that is assisting the repression of human rights which the noble lord has said in so many words the government deplore <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the chancellor of the exchequer has given a pledge that income tax will be reduced during the life of this parliament and as the government have found it impossible to collect sufficient money from north sea oil and the sale of national assets so far is it not the case that the word present which the minister used in his answer to my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon has a somewhat sinister implication <e> <s> is it not likely that <e>", "<cs> is it not likely that along with the sale of gas the government will need to sell electricity also as a public asset to secure the revenue to pay out the tax bonuses which the chancellor has promised before the next election <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the government assisted in setting up this council some three years ago with great fanfares for the purpose of assisting the british computing industry to sell its wares in the third world <e> <s> is it not the case also that this is a matter of only a year and is it not mean at this stage to withdraw it in view of the fact that the french pay out times as much as we do for the same purpose and the japanese times as much <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make another appeal to the minister <e> <s> when this is such a paltry sum a year is it not symbolic of the governments assistance to the computer industry in attempting to export its wares and train people to use them in the third world <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord and his noble colleague lady young have shown great stamina in constantly telling us what representations they have made what dialogue they have had and what criticisms they have made <e> <s> in view of the end product of all these words can the noble lord now tell us whether they have any action in mind in order to change the situation particularly between south africa and namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to give effect in the united kingdom law to united nations security council and general assembly resolutions on namibia to provide for controlling the entry into and the exit from the united kingdom of all aircraft travelling to or from south africa or namibia to impose duties and restrictions in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pay tribute to the noble baronesss personal involvement in the tragic situation in ethiopia <e> <s> perhaps i may ask her two questions arising out of her statement <e> <s> first is it not the case that the aid provided by this country by the government to relieve famine in africa is only aid within the already agreed aid budget and therefore has been taken from aid which was destined for other hungry countries <e>", "<cs> my lords all my instincts and impulses are to do everything possible to open government to open every institution of government and to give the public the widest and deepest possible opportunity of seeing how the government who are responsible to them are working <e> <s> i believe that the experiment as it has <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder if he would answer one question <e> <s> i did not want to interrupt his speech <e> <s> he stated during his speech that one of the virtues of this house is that a vote reflects the argument <e> <s> has he come across the case of a debate on a bill in this house in which every speaker except the government speaker spoke against the government and then the government brought in their dining-room vote and defeated the argument by people who had never heard any part of that argument <e> <s> if he has not i can give him a number of specific instances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this issue goes back to last november <e> <s> is he really saying that the royal navy has lost a valuable document and that the government have learnt nothing more about it since <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister telling the house that we had to wait from until this government were elected in before the royal navy lost a ships log <e> <s> is he now saying also that the inquiry has discovered some evidence which is now before the police <e> <s> the minister was a little obscure on this point <e> <s> he said that the matter is with the police <e> <s> does that mean that some discovery has been made by the inquiry which i believe the government set up which has now been referred to the police <e> <s> if that is the case presumably there is some evidence as to how the log book was lost <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl who opened the debate today stated that the basic policy of his government was to keep down inflation and to sustain growth <e> <s> i propose to take him on his own grounds <e> <s> as my noble friend lord barnett has already pointed out despite the fact that the major plank in the governments armoury when they tackled these problems six years ago was to reduce public expenditure that public expenditure has increased steadily throughout the life of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case so far as i can see the noble earl is simply twisting the words around <e> <s> if he said that he does not blame them then there must be jobs there <e> <s> then he is saying not that the unemployed are drawing unemployment benefit because they cannot find a job but that there are jobs there <e> <s> this is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> my lords so the argument is precisely the same that there are jobs if the unemployed want to take them or find it in their interest to take them <e> <s> i would contest that <e> <s> i would suggest that the noble earl comes round with me to the north-west the north-east scotland wales northern ireland the midlands and tells the unemployed what he has just told this house <e> <s> i regard this as insensitive a public attitude as was the decision of the government last week to ratify and apply the recommendations of the top salaries review body <e> <s> i understood that it was the philosophy of the government that ministers and members of parliament and all leaders in industry and elsewhere should give a lead in wage restraint <e>", "<cs> my lords i will only say to the noble viscount when he says that the nationalised industries now belong to the people that it would be more accurate to say that they now belong to certain people with sufficient money to buy shares to a very large number of institutions whereas previously they belonged to the whole people under the control of the elected government elected in order among other things to run industries and services which are for the national good and for the national benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is gas making a national loss is electricity making a national loss and is british airways making a national loss <e> <s> why does the noble viscount think that the government are trying right now to build up those industries <e> <s> it is so that they can sell them at the highest possible price <e>", "<cs> my lords may i appeal <e>", "<cs> my lords may i appeal to the noble viscount the leader of the house and urge that as this question concerns an action of mine i should be allowed to put a question to his noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> the amendment was my amendment <e> <s> those who went into the lobby with me were supporting me <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the government have already admitted that they have provided no new money for the famine relief in ethiopia or elsewhere and that all the money that has been provided has been transferred from one part of the oda budget including the contingency fund within that budget to another part <e> <s> does this not mean that some of the normal recipients of our aid are <e>", "<cs> my lords i was asking where the money has been transferred from <e> <s> will the noble baroness answer my question <e> <s> where has the money been transferred from <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct that the noble baronesss answer to the noble lord lord kennet indicates that money has not been switched from tanzania and particularly from hospitals in tanzania in order to fund relief work in ethiopia <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> i should like to point out that as it appears on the order paper there is a printing error in the question <e> <s> the word finding should read funding <e>", "<cs> my lords i was hoping that the noble baroness would be able to report some progress since th june <e> <s> can she tell the house what is the present position of negotiations what part the british government are taking in those negotiations and when she hopes complete agreement on the fund will be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness reaffirm the view of the government which she has stated to this house before that the inernational fund is one of the most cost-effective of all international organisations that its administration has been virtually without blemish that its administrative costs are extraordinarily low and that it is an organisation which the whole world should support if famine in africa is to be prevented in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree with the statement that it would have been preferable if ministers had volunteered a comprehensive statement on those events including much of the material which has been extracted from them so painfully over the last three years <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the statement i quoted in my first supplementary question was taken directly from the words of the majority report signed by her friends in another place and not from the minority report <e> <s> is it not the case that her friends in the other place also agreed that the request by members in another place and by one or two of us in this house for certain material was perfectly legitimate and that the government would have been wiser to give that information rather than to mislead us as they had done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness two specific questions <e> <s> it puzzles me that she has stated that two themes of the conference were equality and peace <e> <s> it is surprising that these issues were not related to south africa <e> <s> were there any delegations of women from south africa and what were the objections the british delegation had to the resolution condemning apartheid since it is at least arguable that the subject falls even more heavily on women than on men <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house a question of which i have given him notice <e> <s> the soviet union has unilaterally declared a moratorium <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not using the objection <e> <s> i was simply trying to question the noble viscounts ruling on the basis of the reason for my putting down the private notice question <e> <s> as i say the soviet union had unilaterally declared a moratorium on testing <e> <s> i awaited yesterday a statement from her majestys government in response to that <e> <s> it did not come so last night i submitted a private notice question in order to enable the government to respond to that move before the house rose <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the unemployment figures in this country which were published days ago are the highest for the oecd and are higher than those as a percentage of the labour force for italy france west germany and the average for the oecd <e> <s> can he tell us how it is that as unemployment has been rising so according to his figures has employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to elaborate on his first answer to my question <e> <s> i asked how it can be that there are more employed whilst unemployment is going up <e> <s> is not the answer that that includes the hidden unemployed referred to in the governments own labour force survey of and that they should be added to the total number of unemployed when the figures are published each month <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i unreservedly accept the guidance of the noble and and learned lord who sits on the woolsack particularly in view of the the news which i heard just a couple of hours ago about the action taken by the government <e> <s> therefore i shall not pursue this any further <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer the question which was put by my noble friend lord bottomley <e> <s> would it not be better if the ministry of overseas development were recreated and given an overall supervision not only of aid but of overseas trade so that it can work as my noble friend has pointed out both in the interests of the poorest of the world and also in the interests of developing trade with the under-developed countries and opening up their markets to firms in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords but what reasons have the government given <e> <s> the noble baroness did not give any reasons in answer to my noble friend lord bottomley <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords that of course is a matter of opinion <e> <s> i would not deny for a moment that there are many people in those countries who are relieved that sanctions are not being imposed <e> <s> after all we called upon zambia to impose sanctions in and zambia suffered for those sanctions <e> <s> but what did we do when we imposed sanctions <e> <s> we did not help zambia <e> <s> we knowingly allowed those sanctions to be broken by our own people sabotaging the efforts of the zambians <e> <s> the zambians suffered but they took their decision quite openly <e> <s> i would agree with the noble lord that there are some people in the front line states who are relieved but the front line states and the other members of the commonwealth and those of us who support this bill are not asking for total sanctions but i shall come to an answer to the noble lord if he will give me one moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i would simply refer the noble lord to the example of zimbabwe <e> <s> i was in zimbabwe along with other members of parliament months ago on the first parliamentary mission <e> <s> we unanimously found that in zimbabwe although some whites had left they had left voluntarily and that others were coming back <e> <s> we unanimously found in regard to race relations that miraculously after seven years of bitter civil war and years of domination by the white community under the new black government there was no racial revenge that racial harmony existed between government and <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a second reading debate which is normally based on the general principles of a bill <e> <s> most of the members who have participated in the debate have addressed themselves in that way <e> <s> as my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i thought that i had dealt in my opening speech with the question of the validity of sanctions <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes further evidence i suggest that she reads a new very extensive book published by the international institute for economic affairs in washington <e> <s> it is an examination of the use of sanctions on each occasion several hundred of them since the first world war <e> <s> i simply quote one statistic from that book <e> <s> according to that examination on per cent <e> <s> of the occasions on which sanctions have been used they have been effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord the minister confirm that his own department has admitted that there are concealed unemployed who do not appear in the official figure <e> <s> is it not the case that the changes which have been made such as the omission of these unemployed people who are not entitled to claim benefit leaves this country with well over million unemployed on top of the figure of million unemployed which the ministers department at present publishes <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a question of massaging the figures which the noble lord has tried to conceal in answer to my question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the unemployment rate in this country as a percentage of the workforce is the highest in the oecd and well above that of any of our major industrial competitors <e> <s> why is this so after six years of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government had taken the noble lords advice they would not have issued a statement within a few hours of the reports being published without having had time to examine it comprehensively as he says <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount the leader of the house why he needs to press this motion so that there is no chance for debate after second reading on the bill <e> <s> can he say at the same time how it comes about that the bill has been declared a money bill when it would appear from reading it to be a bill changing a treaty <e> <s> is he satisfied that this is indeed purely a finance bill rather than a bill which affects a treaty that we have signed and which asks for a change in that treaty <e> <s> if it is the latter then should this house not be enabled both to debate the second reading and if necessary divide on the bill and to go through the normal procedure of committee report and third reading stages <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount two questions <e> <s> the statement refers to violence and i understand that her majestys government have expressed their intention of refusing to meet mr oliver tambo the leader of the african national congress until he renounces violence <e> <s> do her majestys government consider president botha to be a man of violence <e> <s> if not in what way is he different from oliver tambo nelson mandela or any other members of the anc who have been forced into violence <e> <s> further do her majestys government not remember that they were forced to talk to joshua nkomo and robert mugabe who never pretended that they had not organised the violence in order to destroy the oppressive regime in rhodesia if an agreement in rhodesia was to come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that in this area of great natural beauty there is considerable public concern about each of the four options that british petroleum has publicised one by rail and three by pipeline <e> <s> there is concern for the amenities of the new forest and for the seashore around poole and portland <e> <s> can the minister assure the house that the conservation issue will be foremost in his mind and that of the government when they come to make a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords while not taking any side on the various options that have been put forward will the noble lord agree that although we all want to see employment increased in areas like this employment can also be lost if the environment is damaged as well as gained through commercial enterprises <e> <s> will he assure the house that in any public inquiry local opinion will be given full weight rather than as has been the case in some previous instances the power of large multinational companies used to influence a public inquiry and the minister who eventually makes a decision <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i use this formula because i did not wish to interrupt his panageric of the prime minister when he referred personally to me <e> <s> was the noble lord indicating i would hate him to go on record as saying something that he did not mean when praising the prime minister for handing over the campaign against argentina to the commanders that the prime minister handed over without any control to the commanders of the armed forces at a time when the foreign secretary was in washington seeking a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord passes from the south african issue from the point of view of clarification will he answer two questions <e> <s> can he say first whether he agrees that every citizen irrespective of skin colour has an equal right to participate fully in the determination of the future of their own community and their own nation <e> <s> secondly is he aware that the percentage of school enrolments and health facilities are far greater in zimbabwe zambia and tanzania than they are in south africa for the black population <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the percentage of enrolments in schools and the health facilities are far higher in zimbabwe zambia and tanzania to take only three examples than they are in south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the two maiden speakers this afternoon the noble lord lord forres and the right reverend prelate i would like to make a particular plea that the right reverend prelate speaks here often <e> <s> we very much need the voices of compassion so far as overseas aid and our links with the third world are concerned <e> <s> it is that theme on which i want to concentrate <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will wait for the rest of my speech i think he will see that i meet this point <e> <s> but in any case what i am doing at the moment is contrasting the governments pretentions of generosity in aid with the actuality of their constant reduction in aid <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look that up again because i think he is wrong <e> <s> it was introduced in by dame judith hart then minister for overseas development <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a similar question from me a week ago the noble lord said that there were other countries in the eec with a higher unemployment rate as a percentage of the workforce than existed in this country <e> <s> will the noble lord tell us which are those countries <e> <s> he muttered something about spain and portugal which are not in the eec <e> <s> is there a single country in the eec which so far as the workforce is concerned has an unemployment rate equal to that in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that those figures demonstrate that under this government the poor have got poorer and the rich richer particularly in view of the fact that according to a document issued by the noble lords department the rise in retail prices over that same period is per cent <e> <s> secondly can the minister explain how it is that if as his figures show the lower per cent <e> <s> of income earners have had increases in their pay less than the increase in retail prices he still maintains that the workers of this country are pricing themselves out of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i ask the noble lord to look again at the figures he has given to the house because according to my understanding of his own departments new earnings survey the figure since was not the per cent <e> <s> that he gave but <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that if the government are serious about the commonwealth accord which they signed and indeed the eec accord this will require much stricter control than in the past <e> <s> in view of the statements made by the prime minister in nassau about the degree of control which had been exercised by her majestys government previously is it not now necessary for example in the oil trade to south africa and in the supply of computers and other defence equipment to both the police and the military forces in south africa that the government should investigate seriously and should now be enthusiastic in seeking ways of fulfilling the obligations which they themselves have undertaken <e>", "<cs> my lords may i return to the two issues that i have raised with the noble lord and which have been raised by my noble friend lord cledwyn <e> <s> on the question of oil are her majestys government satisfied that although they have placed an embargo on north sea oil as the noble lord says that oil can be refined sold to others and find its way to south africa <e> <s> is that a serious effort to send what the government call signals to south africa and is it happening <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> answer the first part of my question on oil <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord also aware that within that plessey/marconi order there are contained computers <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord the chief whip is on business can he tell the house whether there are any plans for this house to debate the white paper that

with <e> <s> i would make an exception in the case of the right reverend prelate the bishop of lincoln and that of the noble lord lord fairfax of cameron with much of whose speech i agreed <e>", "<cs>

this country has in getting finance and in paying the interest rates on that finance i certainly cannot subscribe to his optimism over the value of the financial institutions of this country so far as financing our industrial expansion is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that on november st the national association of health authorities announced that health authorities in the country had had to postpone their planned developments because of lack of money largely due to the increase in pay

question standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the question was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that according to the oecd figures british committed aid over that six-year period fell by per cent <e> <s> annually whereas that of the oecd development assistance committee members increased by an average of around per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that only two other members of the oecd development committee reduced their aid over this six-year period by minuscule amounts whereas ours was declining by per cent <e> <s> a year <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree in relation to her last figure that aid provided by this government currently reaches only per cent <e> <s> of our gdp whereas when this government came into office it was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer the second part of my second supplementary question <e> <s> will she confirm that the government are presently allocating no more than per cent <e>

the heritage foundation financed by a number of american millionaires <e> <s> when she says that this is not a blow at the united nations institutions as such is she aware of the fact that that foundation about months ago came over to this country and conducted an intensive campaign among members of parliament and the media which apparently resulted in a series of articles and programmes hostile to unesco <e>", "<cs> my lords there are times when speaking in debates on southern africa it seems to me as though we are moving in a fantasy and this is one of those occasions <e> <s> i do not know whether it is hypocrisy or ignorance but the kind of terms that have been laid out by this unstarred question are totally unreal <e> <s> how many noble lords recognise that between and the soviet union sent five large consignments of arms and munitions to the south african government via bulgaria <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness who is to reply can bring us up to date on this <e> <s> i admit that my figures are somewhat out of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that they are and they are also used to protect the southern boundary of angola <e> <s> but my point is that the cuban troops and advisers went there first not because the mpla government wanted them there but because the mpla government was attacked by south african troops and angola was invaded <e> <s> they went as a response in order to defend a nationally sovereign state <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask whether she can clarify the governments attitude on two points <e> <s> first do the government believe that without any further pressure from outside or violence from inside the principle of white supremacy will be voluntarily surrendered by the present regime or by a white regime in the foreseeable future <e> <s> secondly in the governments policy towards trying to help to find a solution in south africa why do they take the attitude that the anc must renounce all violence when at the same time the government are prepared to speak to representatives of other organisations like unita and swapo which like the anc have had to adopt violence when their peaceful means have brought only further subjugation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly well aware of what the cbi forecast states <e> <s> i am more interested to know what the government are going to do about it <e> <s> does the cbi report which was drawn from the data provided by companies in this country and which forecasts that jobs will be lost in manufacturing in the next two years square with the analysis and forecast which one hopes her majestys government are now executing in view of the future of the economy of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the same cbi report the forecast is that next year the growth in exports will be only about per cent <e> <s> whereas the growth in imports will increase to more than per cent <e> <s> does this not indicate clearly that next year according to these forecasts there will be an even greater loss of employment and an increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not agree that after two months of investigation parliament is entitled to receive some news from the government as to how this investigation is progressing <e> <s> in view of the fact that twice this year the law lords

when the investigations are completed he will report to this house or will be prepared to answer a question in similar terms to mine this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords years ago i was engaged with the late and much lamented tommy balogh in trying to persuade kwame nkrumah that it was far more important to develop his northern region which is the main agricultural region than to build things like independence arches and stadia in accra <e> <s> we failed and we failed largely because nkrumahs system was already in the hands of the american combine reuther which was determined to pursue the volta river scheme with its electrification and its creation of a new industrial town in tema <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that this aggressive action against lesotho is part of a

representations is she not aware that representations have been made on similar occasions over many years without any effect whatever <e> <s> is it not now the case that her majestys government have abdicated the responsibility of taking any action such as has been mentioned by various noble lords this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that on th december last the secretary-general lord carrington criticised the policies of the danish government the greek government the opposition in this country and the opposition in west germany <e> <s> is it right that an appointed official of an international organisation should be criticising the policies of elected members of parliament of the states that compose that organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble baroness has either misunderstood my question or has avoided answering it <e> <s> may i put it in another form <e> <s> i am not criticising either the policy of the british government or the views put forward by lord carrington <e> <s> i am asking a different question <e> <s> i am asking whether her majestys government believe that an international official appointed as lord carrington is as secretary-general of nato has the right to express his own personal views against and in criticism of the views of the governments and the elected members of parliament of the organisation which he represents <e> <s> surely that is a perfectly fair and straightforward question and one which the government should take into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> can he explain how it comes about that after six years of a government that is supposed to be restoring the economy of this country manufacturing industry output has fallen during that period

has fallen by no more than per cent <e> <s> and that of france by no more than per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that british manufacturing industry is fitter because of the policies of this government <e> <s> how can industry be fitter if it is producing per cent <e> <s> less despite the fact that the government have had the advantage of the oil revenues during that period <e> <s> moreover the noble lord gave a list of the advantages which the government claim british industry is now enjoying but what he did not mention is that last year investment in manufacturing industry in this country was per cent <e> <s> lower than it was in when the government came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord did not answer my second supplementary question <e> <s> is it the case that last year investment in manufacturing industry in this country was per cent <e> <s> below that of <e> <s> does this hold out hopes for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the minister has consulted as i have the article in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister is apparently trying to minimise the difference in the effect of rpi on different sections of the community <e> <s> is he aware that according to this study when the government claim that the state old-age pension has been increased by per cent <e> <s> the real figure if this is weighted by the impact of inflation on pensioners is per cent <e> <s> does this not display a disparity that is a serious social menace <e> <s> is he further aware that in this analysis it is proposed in a quite friendly way that the government might very well monitor the effect of inflation on different sections of the community when determining their social security and pension rates <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that the actions of the south african government in invading and killing nationals of the neighbouring states of south africa including those within the commonwealth is indeed international terrorism <e> <s> if so will her government impose the same kind of sanctions on the south african government that she has listed to the house this afternoon have been imposed on the government of libya <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord ferrers put his finger right on the spot of this debate when he said that it was timely <e> <s> it could hardly be more timely when we see the whole relationship between government and industry in this country as a complete shambles <e> <s> it is in these circumstances that one welcomes the motion put forward by my noble friend lord gallacher <e> <s> just last week this government fell from

the statement he has made it clear to the house that there has been no mystery whatever about how this letter was leaked <e> <s> why then was it necessary to have an inquiry at all and particularly an inquiry which has pin-pointed a civil servant and given the civil servants career to say the least no advancement <e> <s> is it fair to pillory a civil servant in this way when all the facts were apparently known and no inquiry was necessary <e> <s> secondly can the noble viscount tell the house whether when the letter was leaked the solicitor-general was asked or informed about it before that leak was made and the letter was published <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the chief whip suggesting that because there is no precedent the publication of figures showing a record number of unemployed in this country should not be the subject of a statement <e> <s> if he is saying that and that there are no means for making such a statement in this house is that not further proof that

this country and in administration and who has had experience in the educational systems of three other continents i have spent most of my life very close to the world of education <e> <s> like my noble friend lord stewart of fulham i wonder to what extent this debate has been concerned with education or with the problems of education <e> <s> why is it that so many noble lords opposite have made their headline-attracting speeches and then gone home even before their minister can wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord answer two simple questions <e> <s> in the first place he says in his statement that these new initiatives are to consolidate already existing ventures <e> <s> can he say to what extent his already existing ventures in the inner cities have reduced unemployment in those areas since they were begun <e> <s> secondly we have been told on this side of the house consistently by a whole series of ministers from the government front bench that this government do not believe that they can create jobs <e> <s> has he changed his mind <e> <s> is he telling the house this afternoon that these new ventures which the government have cobbled together are or are not going to create any new jobs and reduce unemployment within the inner city areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister said in his original statement that the negotiations over austin rover are to come to an end <e> <s> most members of the house i believe welcome that <e> <s> can he tell us though what has changed since yesterday <e> <s> is it not the case as the noble lord lord thorneycroft has suggested that the minister has been influenced by the voices from another place and quite rightly so <e> <s> but how does it come about that the debate in the other place took place yesterday <e> <s> what would have happened if there had been no leak about these negotiations <e> <s> can he tell this house whether the government intended to pursue those negotiations if possible to a conclusion <e> <s> can he also tell the house where the leak came from which was the occasion for the debate on which apparently the government and particularly the department of trade and industry have completely reversed their policy <e> <s> what has happened since yesterday and why <e>", "<cs> my lords in his repeated defence of the honours system which i have heard him make on radio and television and which has been repeated this afternoon is not the noble viscount the leader of the house asking us to be a little gullible <e> <s> is it not the case that there is nothing unusual in members of this house or indeed other members of the political system promising to recommend that an individual be given a knighthood or indeed a peerage <e> <s> as regards mr bristow is it not the case that he is well qualified for it in view of this governments record on recommendations for honours in that not only is he a very wealthy man but he has also contributed substantially to the funds of the conservative party <e> <s> does that not qualify him in view of the number of honours that have been given in the life of this government to such members of the public who have been contributing to conservative party funds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given national figures <e> <s> is he not aware that in some localities the situation is very different <e> <s> is he aware that recently i visited yts schemes along the south coast and was told there that they were expected to conduct two-year programmes on a budget for one year and that this would mean a reduction in their mode b schemes and in some cases the complete closure of those schemes <e> <s> is it not the case as my noble friend has pointed out when local authorities are hiring and then having to fire instructors because of lack of money that this is destroying the whole basis of the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she will give a direct answer to the house to a direct question <e> <s> all government policy is based on assessment <e> <s> is it the assessment of this

successful in undermining apartheid <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord says that the government have power to discover who owns these shares why have they not used those powers before todays crucial meeting which will determine the future of that company <e>", "<cs> my lords even if the government do not make a practice of commenting on such stories will they accept that this is a piece of disinformation which has been either deliberately or carelessly planted in a well known journal <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord recall that last week in answering a similar question to that put by my noble friend lord bruce of donington this afternoon his noble friend said that i had misunderstood his statement and that the government did not have powers to reveal the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not yet answered the question put by my noble friend lord bruce of donington <e> <s> is it not the case that british leyland was taken over by the government originally when

government are concerned about these raids <e> <s> do they not utterly condemn them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness clear up a couple of points in her answer to me <e> <s> first is it not the case that it was the commonwealth heads of government conference which appointed the eminent persons group <e> <s> would it not now be quite consistent for the comonwealth representatives to meet immediately in this crisis in order to suggest that that group can no longer perform its task and that if it continues it would appear to be following her majestys governments line of appeasement of

offered any military assistance to three commonwealth governments being attacked by a foreign power <e>", "<cs> my lords while on business may i ask the noble lord lord belstead the deputy leader of the house a business question <e> <s> yesterday the noble baroness lady young made a statement on the south african agression against three commonwealth states virtually a declaration of war on the commonwealth <e> <s> during her statement she said that information was not yet complete because reports that she was awaiting had not been received and could not have been received at that time from

from the high commissioners concerned and when she is able to give us the full details that she was not able to give yesterday to make a further report to this house before we rise for the spring recess <e> <s> is it not even more important that this should happen when meetings of commonwealth states are taking place right now and when it has become clear this week that appeasement only

deficit in march plus the evidence given by many noble lords who have already spoken relating to the fall in the output of manufacturing over the past year show how ridiculous it was when the chancellor and following him the noble lord lord young claimed that we had easily weathered the fall in oil prices and sought to dismiss the findings of your lordships select committee on overseas

numbers of self-employed they estimate they have no firm figures on which to base the calculation and that frequently they have to readjust those figures at a later date <e> <s> on the second part of my question and the noble lord did not answer that question is it not the case that a large number of the new jobs that he claims to be creating are ones where the wages are well below the average wage and that the number of employed people below that average wage is increasing has increased since this government came to power and shows no sign of decreasing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble

the tourist industry itself estimates that per cent <e> <s> of the american tourists expected will not come this year which represents per cent <e> <s> of a quarter of all the tourists expected in

industrial countries mentioned while at the same time the rate of unemployment is also higher <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is constantly telling us about the success of the british governments

this would be accepted by the noble lords speaking for the government that defence and foreign policy are two arms of the same policy and that it is essential that they should be inextricably linked

interrupt him each time he referred to me will he accept from me three points <e> <s> the first is that nothing i said in my speech was anti-american <e> <s> i always linked what was happening in america with what was happening in the soviet union <e> <s> that is the great problem that nuclear weapons have now become offensive on both sides instead of being non-defensive <e> <s> secondly would he accept that to the hungarian to the czech and to the pole to say that there have been no conflicts in europe over the past years is to stretch credulity <e> <s> thirdly would he accept that the reason i used the example of the japanese invasion of manchuria and the italian invasion of abyssinia was that in both those cases which led directly to the second world war the failure was in those members of the league of nations who at that time could have stopped those aggressions before the second world war came and that now we are in the same kind of danger with similar conflicts which could lead to another world war <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure i am speaking for the whole house when i say that we welcome the return of my noble friend lord beswick to question time <e> <s> the

action of the american congress and administration with regard to nicaragua and in the discussion about foreign and defence policy to which she also referred have her majestys government responded to that policy decision which was reached about days ago <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike most noble lords who took part in the debate on friday i did not express good will regarding the foreign secretarys visit <e> <s> of course i have the utmost feeling of good will <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer the second part of my question as to whether the british government can assure the house that the mission will be completed before the commonwealth summit at the beginning of august and that it will not be used as a further means of delaying decisions at that meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether the government have reconsidered their opposition to the recommendations of the select committee on employment of another place which reiterated its proposals that the government should guarantee a job to everyone who has been unemployed for over three years and that there should be pilot schemes for the provision of employment to those who have been unemployed for more than one year <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not the answer to my noble friend lord ross of marnock <e> <s> over the last three years the long-term unemployed have increased by a quarter of a million <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house whether he is aware that the select committee to which i have previously referred rejected the criticisms of the government a select committee with a majority of conservative members and reiterated its demand that those who have been unemployed for more than three years have a right from the government to be offered a job <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that whenever he speaks of unit costs he seems to imply that unit costs are composed entirely of wages <e> <s> is he not aware that management and investment are at least of equal importance in unit costs <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that over the past six months while the unit costs in this country have been rising in comparable terms those in west germany have been falling although the wage levels in germany are much higher than they are in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount is going to reply to this debate may i ask him to elucidate one issue which he raised in his reply to my noble friend lord cledwyn <e> <s> when he says that the use of the guillotine in another place requires this house to spend much more time on a bill he is quite right <e> <s> but is it not an anomaly that the other place is going into recess

developing world <e> <s> is this not a sordid commentary on the outlook of the community in respect of its budgetary principles and its place in the real world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord answered me by saying that he hoped parliament would approve the revised budget <e> <s> does this mean that the government therefore agree with the cut that is being made in the revised budget for overseas aid and the great increase in the allocation for the cap <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this company milcolm electronics uk based at camberley in surrey has according to the chairman of grinaker enterprises which is a major south african electronics industry closely tied up with the south african military complex been licensed by grinaker enterprises to produce electronic equipment in particular military equipment in order to get around the ban on the import of south

matter took place during the soviet foreign secretarys recent visit <e> <s> on the second part of the question can she say whether the government will be observing the progress of the new attempt at a settlement in the middle east which is demonstrated by the visit to morocco of the <e> <s> prime minister of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords although i am glad to note that the noble baroness has taken heed of the wishes of mr gorbachev to withdraw from afghanistan may i ask her whether she will use all the diplomatic experience of the foreign office to make it as easy as possible for the russians to withdraw from afghanistan considering that our foreign office has such a long history of such behind-the-scenes negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name

noble baroness about the second part of this question <e> <s> she has answered me before about the british contribution to the international fund for agricultural development generally accepted as the

independent initiative in funding this organisation irrespective of the haggles and discussions that have been going on with the other donors and put this as a part of british government policy for long-term agricultural aid in the african continent <e>", "<cs> my lords only a few hours ago i was asking the noble lady in a two-hour debate a question concerning what the governments response was

appointment at three oclock <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness for leaving during the discussion on her statement and it may also be that i shall not be here for the whole of the winding-up speech <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness inform the house of the governments strategy so far as concerns the advocation of sanctions <e> <s> is the objective to express disapproval of apartheid which has been done in words many times or is it to reduce the power of the south african state to oppress its own citizens <e> <s> if the latter is the case would it be advisable for her majestys government to follow the lead of the american congress and greatly strengthen the sanctions that are to be imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord kennet i believe that there is something to be asked regarding that section of the statement which includes discussions on southern africa <e> <s> according to the statement the prime minister and the president discussed how to contribute to stability in southern africa <e> <s> in view of the fact that the american congress has taken a fundamentally different view from this government over the way of bringing stability to southern africa in relation to sanctions can the noble viscount tell the house what was the subject of those discussions how the president and the prime minister reconciled their opposing views and what they intend to do in joint action to bring greater stability to southern africa as is suggested in the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by adding my own personal tribute to that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he note as a matter of record that i did not talk about the decline of the british steel industry <e> <s> what i was speaking about was the overtaking first by the united states and then by germany of the british steel industry largely through better productivity <e> <s> i related that to the fall in the british percentage of world

if cuban troops were withdrawn <e> <s> have the british government any plans for safeguarding the sovereignty of angola or are the british government asking the angolans to dispense with what defence the cubans can afford them and leave themselves totally defenceless <e>", "<cs> my lords do the british government believe that assertion by the south african government in view of the fact that cuban troops were first asked to angola in order to defend angola against a south african invasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my

government <e> <s> of course i do not agree with all she has said <e> <s> i particularly disagree with her analysis of the decision to leave unesco and i was interested to note that she did not take up the issue of heritage which has been mentioned several times tonight <e> <s> that is an organisation which i believe received a congratulatory telegram from the prime minister in october on its tenth unniversay <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house what difference in principle the government see between using money to advertise the privatisation of the gas industry and

other side of the committee <e> <s> one of the disappointments of the debate has been that we have not heard any constructive criticism of the bill from the other side of the committee <e> <s> we have heard the noble lord lord elton talking about the disruption of the schools over the past two years <e> <s> i wonder whether when the noble lord was a minister and he was a minister at that time he would have maintained that if the same amount of money had been on the table two years ago there would ever have been the two years disruption <e>", "<cs> the minister has fairly stated the question that i asked <e> <s> what he has not done is answer it <e> <s> i asked where do the government find among teachers local authorities parents or the public any support for the bill and in particular for this clause which gives dictatorial powers to the secretary of state <e> <s> where is the support coming from <e> <s> what support can the minister quote in advancing his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this village one of the most beautiful in the country and of great historical importance is unique and that there is a great feeling among the residents as witnessed by organisations like the residents and ratepayers association and the fylingdales preservation society that the actions of the national park are liable both to spoil the vista from the top overlooking the bay and to damage the economy which i am glad to say is rapidly picking up as people move back to live in the village and start businesses there <e> <s> is this not a case in which a bureaucrat has been interfering with the wishes of the local residents as expressed at a public meeting

minister said should in any way reverse the decisions taken <e> <s> what i am asking the noble lord is whether he will look into this matter in view of the fact that strong opposition has been expressed by the local community by the local residents <e> <s> unfortunately his original answer did not take into account the fact that a public meeting was held and that the result as i said was a vote of to against the proposal and that far from taking that into consideration <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that the national park committee officer stated that it was an unrepresentative meeting and that no account need be taken of it <e> <s> all i am asking <e>", "<cs> all i am asking the noble lord is whether he will look into this question which appears to be a matter of a bureaucratic overriding of local opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister has added to his statement a number of comments of his own <e> <s> he made an electoral preface to the statement itself in that he claimed that unemployment had fallen over the last few months <e> <s> can he tell the house what the figures would have been and whether unemployment would have fallen if

is the noble and learned lord aware that the matter of national security cannot apply to those papers that were not published on st january <e> <s> as the papers published have revealed that the prime minister and the foreign secretary of the time both lied to parliament and that the british government colluded with israel and france national security cannot be used as an excuse for not publishing

concerned him personally consultation was taken with an impartial third authority <e> <s> can he tell the house who was the impartial third authority <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble and learned lord agree that in view of the disclosures that were made by those papers published on st january and the additional fact that it is well known that a large number of papers were not published

about the events of to occasions like the conduct of the falkland war the westland affair and now zircon there is a great danger that the public will lose and is losing confidence in the veracity of

institutionalised violence of which he speaks is actively and positively supported by the united states administration in the resources which it provides to the contras in nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords what i find funny is this government claiming that it was in the interests of peace and the right of sovereignty to supply arms to argentina and training to libya <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he has not answered the specific question which i asked him <e> <s> how does he explain the action of the british government on nd november at the world bank when they voted in

earth can the secretary of state count the self-employed who by definition are employed along with the unemployed who by definition do not have jobs <e> <s> how does he equate these two matters <e>

so <e> <s> is it not in order to reduce the number of unemployed that he is calculating <e> <s> is it not a gross misuse of his office that in order to take part in a general election campaign a statement of this kind is made in a city such as york where the employment rate as my noble friend has said is over per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to that point perhaps i may say that the question from my noble friend lord dean of beswick concerns the unemployed <e> <s> it does not ask about those seeking jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords a statement was made in york referring to the proportion of unemployed not to those seeking work <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords before addressing myself to that answer perhaps i may express what i believe will be felt in all parts of the house that is regret at the death of the noble lord lord crowther-hunt <e> <s> i speak personally about this matter because

such a question in view of the fact that the foreign office has publicly announced that it is making an investigation and that in any case we have a responsibility under the test ban treaty <e>",

remarkable feat for the oau to have existed despite <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not more important for her majestys government to pay greater attention to the training of british people in high technology where we have failed lamentably to keep up with many other countries of the world than to import americans to do the work which could be done by british people if there were sufficient training facilities for them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has spoken of wider markets jobs and over-production <e> <s> does this new merger have any plans to re-open the bathgate british leyland works which were shut two years ago because the nigerians were unable to purchase the lorry kits that were being manufactured at that plant <e> <s> he talked about over-production <e> <s> is

can he give the house any assurance that the work british leyland was doing to provide nigeria with the trucks it needed to save those lives will be resumed under this new arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords the first point to which i want to draw the attention of the house is that if this motion is aimed first at the labour party it is quite inaccurate <e> <s> the labour party does not stand for unilateral disarmament <e> <s> the labour party stands for the removal of british nuclear weapons for an increase in our conventional weapons and an increased influence in nato <e>", "<cs> my lords

clarify the position <e> <s> if one of the long-term unemployed goes through the restart programme and then does not get a job does he return as a member of the long-term unemployed or does he go back

friend lord jenkins of putney is a matter of the utmost urgency and importance not only to the people of this country but to the people of the world <e> <s> will he give the house the courtesy of an answer to the question as to whether the government believe that it is necessary in order to pursue their policy of deterrence to be able to obliterate the human race five times rather than once <e>",

of parliament was the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer to me the noble earl revealed the difficulty about mr patel and many other immigrants <e> <s> he had applied for permanent

noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finishes his speech will he correct one error of fact which i have pointed out to him before <e> <s> it is not the case that south africa is the only african country which can feed its people <e> <s> zimbabwe has been exporting maize for the past five years to its neighbours <e>", "<cs> like the right reverend prelate i urge the

supplementary question <e> <s> i asked whether it is the case that fewer than half of the organs donated voluntarily have been used <e> <s> perhaps i may also ask the minister whether he is now saying

the case that there is no channel of communication at present <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the sound economic policies of which the noble lord speaks have increased the unemployment numbers in this country by at least million and more probably by million <e> <s> is it not also the case that the reduction in the figures given for unemployed people is almost entirely due first to

that because this is a national non-party issue surely it would be far better while the government are considering their own views and before the white paper is produced for them to consider the views

house whether it is the case that over the past years cases of actual fraud have been reported to the ministry of defence police of which only two have resulted in prosecutions <e> <s> how does it come about that companies can defraud a ministry without being liable to prosecution as they would be in a normal commercial case <e>", "<cs> my lords far from my making an accusation of fraud is it

gives it a mandate to boycott south african goods or the goods of any other country this government have the right to say despite that election that that authority shall not be allowed to do what the electors have elected it to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the statement of the noble lord can he tell the house whether it is the case that there are about south african troops inside angola not only fighting against the angolan forces but also killing civilians and destroying crops <e> <s> can

noble lord agree that the united nations has decreed that no uranium uranium ore or uranium oxide whichever form the noble lord likes to take should be imported by any member of the united nations

is in line with the forecast made by the select committee of your lordships house on overseas trade some two to three years ago <e> <s> does he agree with his right honourable friend the minister for energy in saying that oil revenues which have bolstered the revenues of this government have been used to finance unemployment payments for the numbers of unemployed people which have been rapidly increasing since the government came into office <e>", "<cs> my lords if the british government were serious about what the minister has just said about the ban imposed at luxembourg three years ago

south african efforts to get round the embargo by converting offshore gas into oil <e> <s> is it the british governments view that the profits of british companies are more important than international authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misinterpreted what i said <e> <s> i said nothing about punitive sanctions nor any additional sanctions <e> <s> i asked the government quite straightforwardly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are many people in this country who disagree with the government on this issue and that this has been shown in liverpool

aware that british nuclear fuels has now admitted that a considerable proportion of the material that it handles comes from namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that british nuclear fuels

lord aware that people of all parties and of none will support her majestys government in any efforts that they can make at this eleventh hour to save the five men and one woman <e> <s> will he agree that in view of the fact that the judge who tried the case on appeal stated categorically that not one of the six was personally involved with the murder but that they were charged under what is called common purpose which is nothing more than being present in a crowd to execute them on that ground would be an act of barbarity <e> <s> can the minister expound a little further on the actions that her majestys government will take between now and friday <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most astonishing answer <e> <s> is the noble lord not aware that this contract was made in january on

and advertising for his department by three times <e> <s> if so will he tell the house why he thinks it right to spend taxpayers money on advertising for government party political purposes but not

option under the contract <e> <s> i am still asking whether that option has ever been taken up and if so when it was taken up <e> <s> does he agree that his answer on nd march was at least misleading

into this because it seems to me that this was a deliberate attempt to mislead the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the question <e> <s> if he had read mrs castles diaries and those of richard crossman when he answered my question on nd march did he pretend that there had been nothing to discuss in <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made what sounds to me like a very weak case <e>

lifetime of this government the gap between the top per cent <e> <s> and the bottom per cent <e> <s> of the population has widened considerably <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down she has given one or two anecdotes suggesting that the people in her area support the community charge as it is about to be applied to scotland <e> <s> would the noble baroness not agree that the disaster which beset the conservative party in the local elections last week in scotland was some reflection of the opinion which scottish people have of the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is time that her majestys government took a lead in this issue rather than following the lead of the united states particularly because her majestys government originally

world <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat technicalities that i have mentioned previously <e> <s> i am tempted to debate with the noble lord lord bauer <e> <s> however as he and i debated the subject on television last year i shall leave it at that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware when he talks about noble lords on this side speaking from yester-year that we are speaking from the year when there were not million people unemployed as the government admit but probably over million unemployed <e> <s> has he read the report of the select committee on overseas trade and noted that section of it which points out that one of the deterrents to the increase in manufacturing exports from this country is the low purchasing power of third world countries which are a market to which british exporters could turn their attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord two questions but he did not answer the second one <e> <s> will he have the courtesy to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord is not up to date with his figures <e> <s> the latest figure officially given for united kingdom development assistance is not that is for <e> <s> those are the figures for which i asked <e> <s> is the minister not ashamed at that answer when according to his own answer only one country in the dac spends less of its gnp on overseas aid than this country that country being ireland <e> <s> is that not something of which to be ashamed and how does it equate with the prime ministers statement two weeks ago in scotland that as the british people become better off so they share the fruits of their work with others <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he cannot have it both ways <e> <s> when the overseas aid budget was cut four times as heavily as other public expenditure the government said that they reluctantly did so because of the depression in the country <e> <s> the minister who answered an earlier question this afternoon claimed that there has been growth for the past eight years <e> <s> how is it that that coincides with a fall in overseas aid <e> <s> is the minister aware that in a poll taken last year per cent <e> <s> of those polled said they were prepared to pay higher taxes if those taxes were to be allocated to helping the poorer countries <e>", "<cs> my lords one can get more all-embracing than that by including my amendment <e> <s> that makes the subsection more all-embracing and makes it much more specific <e> <s> it gives a much clearer lead to those of us who believe that the future of the children of this country depends upon their understanding from an early age of their position in the world as a whole not just in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a short word in reply to the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> long before there was a substantial number of immigrants into this country from the ex-british empire we had a multi-cultural society <e> <s> there is no british culture there is a culture in northern ireland there is a culture in wales <e> <s> in parts of wales there is a separate language <e> <s> there is a culture in scotland <e> <s> all that has happened over the last years is that additional cultures have enriched the life of british society <e> <s> we were a multi-cultural society we are now and even wider multi-cultural society <e> <s> children in schools should recognise know about and understand the nature of our multi-cultural society <e> <s> this amendment would help them to do so and help their teachers to lead them in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble earl a question <e> <s> he did not answer a question that i asked during the debate in respect of my amendment <e> <s> will he answer it now in the context of the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord craigton <e> <s> the noble earl mentioned the governments concern regarding many subjects <e> <s> should not that be all subjects <e> <s> will he also answer this question <e> <s> do the government intend to give any guidelines any encouragement to all the working groups on all the subjects within the curriculum in order to bring to their attention the necessity of including a global dimension in their research discussions and reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say only one sentence in support of both these amendments <e> <s> if the government pass this bill so that it becomes an act we can all expect a brain drain of voluminous proportions from this country involving our best academics who will go to those countries where they can expect tenure possibly with the provisions as mentioned by my noble friend lord peston but where they can get tenure if they do their job according to academic standards <e> <s> do we wish to promote such a brain drain <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord one question <e> <s> he began <e>", "<cs> my lords it includes redundancy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question about the noble and learned lords terminology <e> <s> when he speaks of redundancy does he include as a reasonable reason for redundancy the dismissal of a senior member of staff and his replacement by a junior member of staff for the purpose of saving the difference in salary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not answer my question <e> <s> if the government have changed their forecast why <e> <s> why was it that in march the chancellor forecast a deficit of billion which has almost or totally already been reached <e> <s> how does what he has said square with his constant reiteration in this house and in the country that the country is booming <e> <s> our trade deficit last month was the largest in history <e> <s> is this not a reflection of the chancellor of the exchequers policy in the budget of reducing taxes for his rich friends who are now spending the money on imports rather than investing in the productive activities of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he still has not answered my question <e> <s> why in march did the chancellor of the exchequer make that forecast of billion which has already been achieved in june <e> <s> is that the way in which the government handle the economy <e> <s> has the noble lord read the report of the committee on overseas trade chaired by his noble friend lord aldington which forecast precisely what is now happening since the oil revenues began to decline <e> <s> is the noble lords idea <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lords idea of a boom one led by credit which will lead to a crash or a boom led by exports which the present figure shows are in decline <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the house appears to consider that it is an act of god that the house has been abused as it was last night <e> <s> it is not it is an act of the government <e> <s> the noble lord says that it is usual for this house to be busy at this time of the year <e> <s> we all know that <e> <s> however is it not the case that this year the government are trying to pour a quart into a pint pot and that we are the victims because of the excessive legislation the delays in receipt of that legislation and the use of the guillotine procedure in the other place <e> <s> those are the reasons why the practices of this house have been abused and why the personnel of this house have been abused as they were last night <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has suggested that we should not be retrospective <e> <s> that is very convenient for the government <e> <s> but surely history governs the present and the future <e> <s> the reason for the publication of the white paper is the failure in the past of section of the official secrets act <e>", "<cs> my lords does this statement not illustrate the arrogance and inconsistency of the prime minister and the government in respect of foreign affairs <e> <s> it would appear from the statement that the government wish to go into europe but only on their own terms just as they act in the commonwealth and at the united nations <e> <s> i should like the noble lord the leader of the house specifically to expand on that part of the statement which refers to the sharpeville six and the attitude to south africa <e> <s> is it not the case that the british foreign secretary stood on his own against the rest of the foreign ministers of the ec who wished to take strong action including both diplomatic and economic sanctions if clemency were not shown to the sharpeville six that he stood out against that action and that he had the communiqu altered solely because british policy so far as its attitude to south africa is concerned is out of step with the rest of the ec the commonwealth and the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords i was talking about action <e>", "<cs> i was not talking about words my lords <e> <s> words have been used for a long time about south africa and we have seen the results <e>", "<cs> i asked what action the government are taking <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked the noble lord what action the government are taking in the matter <e> <s> is the minister not aware that there have been appeals representations and diplomatic approaches for many years now and the only result has been increased oppression and brutality by the south african state <e> <s> is it the case that at the ec summit in hanover which took place a week ago it was only the british foreign minister who stood out against the desire of the rest of the twelve to warn the south african government that if the sharpeville six were executed they could expect an increase in economic sanctions against that country and possibly also diplomatic sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome what the minister has said about the representations that are being made <e> <s> however i have to repeat that representations have been made to the south african government for yearsthe only consequence has been that they have been ignored and that the oppression has increased <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the chief whip a further question on the same subject <e> <s> what is the governments intention as regards the motion that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords in the second reading debate three months ago i suggested that this was the most important bill introduced in the country this century and probably the most dangerous <e> <s> what i have seen and heard over the past three months has not in any way shaken that original impression <e> <s> indeed the way in which the government have dealt with this bill culminating in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned only having words to go on <e> <s> are this government not also just using words in welcoming the easing of relationships between the east and the west <e> <s> would not a gesture such as that which the noble lord lord jenkins has suggested of abandoning the use of the word enemy show that the government genuinely welcome the easing of tension between east and west <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put one point to the noble lord as a historian <e> <s> would he not agree that in the earlier part of his speech he was somewhat unfair to many of us on this side of the house of which in his earlier incarnation he was once a member who made a clear distinction between the value of marxism and the disgrace of stalinism but when we attacked stalinism this did not necessarily mean that we were supporting the pursuit of the cold war <e>", "<cs> my lords my first action in the political field was when i was a schoolboy collecting petitions for the league of nations across the yorkshire moors <e> <s> i found as a young boy what i now find as at least a mature adult that disarmament is an issue which is felt by every citizen in this country <e> <s> we find that at election time we find regularly constantly that it is a central issue for the british people and indeed for the human race <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that three years ago noble lords on this side of the house with the support of noble lords opposite and indeed noble lords from all parts of the house for months pressed the government to appoint a select committee to investigate the decline of the merchant navy and the decline in the number of seafarers <e> <s> the government have never responded to that request <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i believe that he is contradicting himself <e> <s> i believe that if he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the governments control of monetary policy has been completely abandoned <e> <s> is it not also the case that north sea oil revenues are rapidly dropping and that raw material prices are rapidly rising <e> <s> is that not a prescription both for inflation and for continuation and escalation of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the publication of the rover half-year returns demonstrates how a nationalised company can succeed <e> <s> can the noble lord tell the house just how much money the taxpayer has been saved as a result of the intervention of the european commission as against the taxpayers money which the government previously intended to pay on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister makes an assertion at the end of his answer which is certainly questionable <e> <s> is it the case that an official in his department a mr barry harding wrote a letter which included the following statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the height of hypocrisy for the government to claim that they are opposed to apartheid when one of their principal departments is deliberately encouraging and using taxpayers money to circumvent the sanctions with which they on paper agree <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister two questions <e> <s> if there are legal difficulties now why were they not foreseen and investigated before the department made such a fuss in february about how it was going to apply the cruelty label process <e> <s> secondly is it the case that representations have been made by the canadian government to protect their trappers that one of the factors which has influenced her majestys government is that they are trying to sell billion worth of nuclear submarines to canada and that the canadians also have an offer from the french which they are inclined to take if the british government do not play ball with them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would never accuse me of cruelty to him <e> <s> however he has not answered either of my questions <e> <s> if there are legal difficulties why were they not foreseen before his department announced in february that the trade descriptions act would be used for this purpose <e> <s> secondly is it the case that the canadian government have threatened not to enter into the deal for billion pounds-worth of nuclear submarines if this is carried through but have threatened to take up the french option which i believe is cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl in introducing the white paper told us that the objective of the government was to replace the notorious section with something better <e> <s> i propose to take him at his word and test out the proposals of the white paper on those grounds with particular reference to paragraph and related paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i should like to refer to the debate in this house on th march <e> <s> i do not propose to spend the time of the house repeating what was said then but if noble lords will refer to that debate they will see that i listed quotations and occasions relating to my questioning of the government on the matter of the belgrano in which a succession of ministers had misled the house and given me false answers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that there was no government attempt to discredit members of cnd in and <e> <s> is he further saying that no ministers were involved in such a campaign <e> <s> finally is he further saying that no civil servants including the prime ministers press secretary bernard ingham were involved in that campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that he has not seen the film but in view of the public interest that has been aroused by its content may i ask him either to look at the film or to obtain a script of it as it makes specific allegations allegations for which i am not in any way responsible <e> <s> this is a matter of public concern and i should have thought that the government would want either to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> can he tell the house now before we have to go to the library what were the main contents of that letter <e> <s> can he also tell the house whether the british embassy confirmed that a letter had been sent drawing attention of congressmen to the consequences of the proposed legislation on sanctions and that one of the items in that letter was a threat that united states oil companies would be frozen out of exploration in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister clarify his reply to me <e> <s> is he confirming that in this letter there was a threat or an implicit threat that if the legislation were passed through the united states congress then united states oil companies might be frozen out of exploration in the north sea <e> <s> if that is the case does he not agree that this is an intolerable form of blackmail against the elected representatives of the united states who were doing what they saw as their duty in bringing forward legislation to tighten sanctions against south africa <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has not answered the question that i put to him namely did the letter contain a threat explicit or implicit that should this legislation be passed through congress united states oil companies might be frozen out of north sea exploration <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister agrees with his noble friend does he also agree that even if nuclear power stations do not emit sulphur they accumulate large amounts of toxic wastes which are at least as dangerous as the greenhouse effect and that so far this government have had no sustained policy for disposing of those <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is telling the house that we can trust the government to continue their interest in the environment <e> <s> considering that from these benches for years now ministers have constantly denigrated the issues we have raised on cfcs the ozone layer and so on will he not agree i know he cannot commit himself that it is important that he should draw to the governments attention that the words which have been used by the prime minister will be judged by the amount of funding that is put into research on the environment and not just by rhetoric <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that before the recent election in chile the british government were strengthening the hand of the dictator general pinochet by supplying him with arms and selling him naval ships while the united states government were openly financing the support of the opposition to the general <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that to supply arms to a dictatorial regime is strengthening that dictatorship irrespective of whether those arms are used against the internal population <e> <s> does she not further agree that the united states has made it quite plain that it regards the supply of arms to chile as dangerously unbalancing the power structure in the whole of latin america <e> <s> in the light of the ministers previous answer can she tell us what signs she sees today of a return to democracy in chile despite the fact that general pinochet is still in power and apparently intends to remain so <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first why is it that the ministry of agriculture has refused to identify those herds that are undergoing this process of experimentation <e> <s> secondly is it not the case that it is not the injection of bst which may be dangerous but the fact that that injection into cattle reduces their immunity to disease and therefore they must have a whole series of further injections <e> <s> are the public not entitled to know what the effect of those further injections will be in both the milk and the meat which is now being supplied to it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with my noble friend on the front bench that this is a matter of consumer rights <e> <s> was he saying in answer to my first question that the law forbids the minister of agriculture identifying those herds which are now being injected with bst and if so surely it is time that that law was changed <e> <s> he said that there was no evidence that the further injections could be damaging to health <e> <s> that is not to say that they are not damaging to health <e> <s> before such experiments are launched upon the public surely the public has a right to know what is being injected into milk and meat and the right to have the choice of refusing it by having them labelled <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister is not suggesting that the government are pushing responsibility for the pollution of the north sea on to other countries while they are content with hosting conferences and having discussions <e> <s> will he tell us what the british government are doing about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house what percentage of government cars now use unleaded petrol since the budget reduced the price <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to put down a separate question <e> <s> if the minister does not know the answer can he not write to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin with a quotation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been waiting for this opportunity for years <e> <s> this may interest the right reverend prelates and i should declare an interest in that years ago i was <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the noble baronesss reply is it not the case that when uranium is imported under the euratom protection that uranium can be removed from code p and placed under code n <e> <s> is not the uranium which was imported it has taken me nearly months to extract that information from the government available for military uses if the government so want whatever their present intentions <e> <s> is it not the case that the government can use that uranium for military purposes if they so desire <e>", "<cs> my lords far from it not having been a matter of secrecy it has taken me six questions to elicit from the government that they imported the tonnes of uranium from namibia under the optional agreement not under the original agreement <e> <s> will the noble baroness tell the house quite clearly whether the tons that has been imported and is under the protection of euratom could in future if the government desire it be used for military purposes <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that both australia and canada have such little faith in euratom that when they export uranium they insist on bilateral agreements because they do not trust the safeguards which at present exist under euratom <e>", "<cs> my lords if it was imported for civil purposes only why was it imported under code n rather than under code p which is for peaceful purposes alone <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that following the last meeting of the agency the south african foreign minister boasted that south africa now has the means of building atomic weapons <e> <s> is it not further the case that the south africans have refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty <e> <s> does not their continued membership of the agency supply them with technological and scientific information which is valuable to them as regards the building of atomic weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister says that there is no firm evidence that south africa has atomic weapons <e> <s> is he not aware that according to very widespread scientific evidence

and scientific information to assist them to build nuclear weapons <e> <s> if that is the case why is the noble lord saying on behalf of the government that they approve of the continued membership

the age of in this country and those in similarly industrialised countries in europe namely france germany the netherlands and belgium <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the ministers first reply was misleading <e> <s> when he said that it was up to local authorities was he not contradicted by the noble lord lord renton who quoted correctly the statute that is being broken as these clinics are closed down <e> <s> will the minister not now rescind his original answer to the noble lord lord renton and admit that this is a government responsibility under statute <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps through the noble lord the government chief whip i may put a question to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> this afternoon in another place a private notice question has been tabled concerning the invasion of a church in manchester this morning by the police and the arrest of a sri lankan citizen in order i believe to effect his deportation <e> <s> is this not a matter of

make a statement to this house immediately after the private notice question has been asked in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that it was offered but is it not the responsibility of the government in these circumstances to make a statement on a matter of such very grave urgency to members of parliament who sit in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there were two accidents at windscale in <e> <s> the one to which i referred if the noble baroness has read the macmillan papers which were released at the beginning of the year she will know of it was an

lords is the minister aware that all the information to which i referred in my supplementary question as well as in my original question is drawn directly from the macmillan papers that were released at the beginning of this year <e> <s> is she further aware that it is stated in those papers that the object of the government was to prevent a public panic and outcry against the use of nuclear

environment was blocked <e> <s> and that <e>", "<cs> and my lords that the then home secretary rab butler wrote on one of the minutes of the noble and learned lord lord hailsham and this is a

cannot afford to move to the south-east <e> <s> what does he mean by reform of housing provision <e>", "<cs> my lords in the answer to a written question which i put down before christmas the noble viscount said that the universities funding council would consist of six full-time university academics one polytechnic director and six members with industrial or commercial experience <e> <s> i was asked to put down this question by one of the universities with which i am associated <e> <s> is the noble viscount satisfied that the council will not be dominated by commercial interests <e> <s> secondly how is it that no member of the council can rightly be classified as a social scientist <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount answer my second question <e> <s> why is there no social scientist on this important body <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount tell the house how many of the six representatives of commercial and industrial interests are members of companies which give subventions to the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case will the noble lord tell the house how the findings of the recent commonwealth heads of government meeting in harare regarding sanctions on south africa would be filtered through to her majesty <e> <s> do they come through no <e> <s> downing street <e> <s> the government were not represented in harare and are known

world to the developed world <e> <s> when he speaks of progress towards the united nations target of per cent <e> <s> of gnp in overseas aid is he aware that many countries such as the netherlands and scandinavia have exceeded this figure whereas under this government the figure has steadily declined from per cent <e> <s> years ago to the latest available figure of per cent <e> <s> it is probably even lower this year <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness inform the house of the cost to the consumer of carrying out the full programme that she has announced up to the year <e> <s> what will be the rise in price of electricity based on this process <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord keeps telling us about the number of years for which the chief executive has served <e> <s> if that is the case and he is so satisfactory why has he been sacked <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench suggested is that not in order to cover up what mr brooke knows has been going on in the westminster city council <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd spoke as a referee <e>", "<cs> i speak as an ex-member of staff of a football league club <e> <s> among other things i was also a referee of both codes along with the husband of the present prime minister <e> <s> i wish to answer directly the point made by the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> in doing so i wish to bring to the attention of the house an incident even more recent than that quoted by my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> he spoke of what happened outside and in the neighbourhood of the arsenal ground last november <e> <s> i wish to refer your lordships to what happened at old trafford a club with which i have been familiar for the past years <e> <s> this happened just two weeks ago <e> <s> it is an answer to the noble earl lord onslow and also a warning of what can and very likely will happen <e> <s> it is what many of the police fear will happen if consideration is not given to the way in which the bill is applied <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady lockwood has said all that i wish to say on the subject <e> <s> should like to ask the minister whether he has read the recommendations of the jenkins committee of <e>

the report and return on report with government proposals which outline the way they see the issues raised by my noble friends in the light of the recommendations made as long ago as <e>", "<cs> perhaps may assist the noble lord in his reading <e> <s> if he refers to section clause g of the report that will save him from reading the rest <e>", "<cs> my lords does that answer from the minister indicate that the cost of bringing water supplies up to ec standards will fall on consumers <e> <s> is that the reason why private water companies are now greatly increasing their prices <e> <s> has the minister read the comments made two weeks ago by mr michael swallow the director of the water companies association <e> <s> in explanation of the increase in charges before privatisation he had this to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand why the minister could not answer the second part of my supplementary question <e> <s> in his first answer he indicated that this process will cost a great deal of money <e> <s> is it not the case that the british government have been trying to avoid the ec regulations that should have been put into effect as regards water two years ago <e> <s> is it not now the case that either the government introduce their present bill which will then be declared illegal by the ec or the cost to the consumer of water is going to be very greatly increased as a result of privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that yesterday his right honourable friend the secretary of state told another place that it would cost over billion to put our water and beaches into a state which would satisfy ec regulations <e> <s> will he answer the question which i asked yesterday and which he said he would postpone answering until today regarding the governments attitude to the statement by mr <e> <s> swallow the director or the water companies association that under government policy shareholders profits must take precedence over consumer interests <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question which i asked him yesterday and which i asked him again this afternoon <e> <s> do the government agree with mr <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that the views of the west german government and of the british government on the so-called modernisation of nuclear weapons are completely opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister talks about the employers <e> <s> does he accept that it is a government responsibility <e> <s> will he give a clear answer to the question is it not a government responsibility <e> <s> as my noble friend lady lockwood pointed out the conditions of university staff have deteriorated by about per cent <e> <s> since <e> <s> is it the governments intention to restore the position <e> <s> it is those conditions which have forced the aut much against its will to take action against a stubborn government <e> <s> will he say that the government accept their responsibility to provide the funding necessary to restore the conditions of university teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether the suggestion made by the noble lord lord st john is a reality and whether there is a danger of a large multi-storey building being constructed near county hall <e> <s> if that is so does he agree that it will distort the whole of the south bank area which to many of us is a precious heritage and a social asset not just to london but to the country <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the figures which the noble lord has given us can he tell the house what percentage represents british investment and what percentage is foreign investment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell us why the united nations force is to be reduced from to about <e> <s> it was considered that was the appropriate figure at the time when resolution was passed <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that already before these elections take place there is mobilisation of pressure groups lobby groups and propaganda groups <e> <s> they are led by south africans and by the south african administrator general within namibia <e> <s> that could lead to a very ugly and probably unfair situation when the elections take place unless there is thorough supervision by the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell both sides of the house that cuban forces have never been in namibia <e> <s> cuban forces were in angola not in namibia <e> <s> the minister has not answered my original question <e> <s> why is it that a decision has been taken to reduce the forces from their original complement <e> <s> i think back to the time of the rhodesian election in <e> <s> i recognise that in namibia per cent <e> <s> of the population live in rural areas but per

amendment that was passed in committee on th february <e> <s> shortly after that to give one example i had a debate on television with the chairman of luton town football club who is a member of

nine-month-old son <e> <s> this is the right age to start to learn about football <e> <s> i am aware that dunfermline is in scotland and therefore does not come within the terms of the bill but as we are talking about the principle of exemptions i should like to know whether when i come to be pushing a pram with my great-grandson in it i should now be more likely to be pushing a pram at carrow road norwich he will need to have a membership card <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord graham of edmonton and the noble lord lord harris pointed out the minister in answering the debate mentioned what was in the governments mind on the question of exemptions <e> <s> he did not include the gender exemption <e> <s> is that a deliberate exclusion or one that he would now like to add to the list of possible i do not say mandatory exclusions <e> <s> is that in the governments mind <e> <s> are they considering it as he said they were considering the other categories that he listed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord campbell of croy both for introducing this motion and for his consistent work concerning the environment <e> <s> i shall confine myself to speaking from the third world point of view already mentioned by the noble lord and by other speakers <e> <s> the text of what i have to say is aptly contained in a statement made last july by the government of the ivory coast which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and as we have plenty of time perhaps i may ask him a question which will expand and i hope make more firm what i understand to be a firm commitment on behalf of the government which will be most valuable <e> <s> however first may i assure him that all the facts which i have used in my speech have been published <e> <s> moreover as the official secrets bill has not yet been enacted i am not liable for prosecution for repeating matters which have already been published <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case are the government preparing legislation now <e>", "<cs> my lords that answer puzzles me <e> <s> does the noble baroness remember that on th november last year she told the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house whether it is the case that when uranium is imported into this country the codification can be changed by the government of this country <e> <s> i know that she said that they have no intention of changing it but is it possible <e> <s> are they allowed to change it <e> <s> does it not destroy the governments argument as stated in both houses that no uranium has been imported for military purposes since if during the intervening period the uranium that has been imported can be used for military purposes should the government so desire <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the answer to my question <e> <s> will the minister answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been noted particularly by my noble friend lord mishcon and the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington that the debate is in effect about the tension between freedom and security and liberty and order but surely the only justification for security and order is to protect and defend freedom and liberty <e> <s> i admit that in our society apathy and indifference characterised by the constantly used phrase im not interested in politics is of more danger to democracy than is authoritarianism the concept of them and us <e> <s> i contend that the bill increases those elements that are debilitating to a democratic society <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves this point will he address himself to the fact that in the bill there are six designated areas which are absolute crimes and will not therefore be subject to jury decision on any question of public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will make that point quite clear <e> <s> if those cases came under the absolute prohibition of revelations would it not be the jury that would decide <e> <s> the judge would instruct the jury what to decide as distinct from the way in which matters were conducted in the panting case when the jury came to a decision despite the judges summing up <e> <s> in those cases of absolute prohibition must not the judge direct the jury to convict <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a year ago today as my noble friend has pointed out the budget forecast a trade deficit of about billion whereas that deficit has in fact risen to over billion for the year <e> <s> is that not the cost borne by industry arising from the increased interest rates <e> <s> is not that cost also shown in the smaller figure for exports from this country compared with the much larger figure for imports <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord seriously asking the house to believe that the government do not think that a billion trade deficit over the year is something to worry about <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment moved by my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon i must stress that i do not necessarily associate myself with his views as regards women and violence <e> <s> as a boy i remember going to a match where a woman was so incensed by a referees decision that she rushed across the ground and started to belabour him with her umbrella <e> <s> i should add that i was not that referee nor was it the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran because the incident took place at a rugby not a soccer match <e>", "<cs> as the minister referred to what i said will he tell the committee how a woman spectator will be any safer with an identity card than without one <e>", "<cs> my lords do the noble lords figures not show if i heard him correctly that the deficit with the european community is six times as high as that with the rest of the world <e> <s> does that not point to the lesson that it should be the objective of industry in this country supported by the government as it is to a much greater extent in other countries to widen the market and to secure customers particularly in the third world which is the market of the future and that could lead to a reversal of the deficit of which he has spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that british rail puts safety as a priority <e> <s> if british rail were to be nationalised would not profit be given priority over safety <e>", "<cs> my lords if british rail were privatised and private companies returned to the railways would it not be their duty to put profit before safety <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government agree with the delegates to the conference from china and india that as the developed countries have created almost all the emissions which have been attacking the ozone layer it is the responsibility of the developed countries to assist the developing countries in paying the extra costs that will be necessary in order to develop refrigeration free of cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer to me the noble lord said that one of the objects of the conference was to hear what the developing countries <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case as has been reported that the brussels commission is considering taking legal action to enforce the higher standards which the rest of the ec insist upon for drinking water <e> <s> does that not have a direct effect on the water bill now going through parliament <e> <s> will clauses in the bill have to be changed <e> <s> moreover is the minister aware that only yesterday his right honourable friend stated that it would take something like billion to put our drinking water into the cateogry which is insisted upon by the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the ec has set higher standards than those which are at present being insisted upon by the british government <e> <s> is that not the case <e> <s> if it is not there have been many false reports emanating from brussels as to the action which the ec intends to take to insist that our water suppplies so far as both nitrates and pesticides are concerned are brought up to its standards <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question put by the noble lord lord addington regarding norfolk is the minister aware that last week water supplies to norwich were declared not to be up to ec standards his honourable friend mr howard went to norwich to inspect the water <e> <s> it was categorically stated by an official that the water in norwich was not up to ec standards and was being affected by nitrates and fertilisers <e> <s> a statement was made that nothing could be done about the fertiliser element until there was a national policy <e> <s> when are the government going to observe a national policy in the light of the ec directives <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding energy efficiency can the noble baroness tell the house whether it is the case that the research being done into the provision of energy through wave power has now been abandoned and if so why <e>", "<cs> my lords in her reply to me was the noble baroness seriously saying that research into wave power has nothing to do with energy efficiency or with the greenhouse effect which she mentioned in her reply to the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that over the past few months there have been far worse outbreaks of violence in germany france italy and spain than there have been during the comparable period in this country <e> <s> that is long before the governments football spectators bill becomes an act of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord boasts about the proportion of capital goods that are imported

used to be made in this country but are no longer made here and are imported from abroad as a result of the decline <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord pym has illustrated the necessity for this amendment

saying that the government and ministers are always right that civil servants are always right in their judgment whatever fraud mistakes and misdemeanours they may perpetrate <e> <s> it seems to me

in the real world and are subject to the same pressures <e> <s> why can they be liberal but we must be secret <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house what is the governments policy towards the import of coal from south africa in view of the fact that many members of the ec are at present discussing a policy of banning the import of coal from south africa as part of their sanctions policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house whether british government policy this week has been under the control of the prime minister since her visit to windhoek last saturday <e> <s> during this week she has given uncritical support to the south african case and has shown her ignorance of the facts by stating to the other house on tuesday that all the relevant documents were available <e> <s> they were not <e> <s> the geneva protocol has not been published <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the united nations declares that it has no knowledge of the geneva protocol which is the only document mentioning the sixteenth parallel in angola <e> <s> is he further aware that the document that the prime minister said was available in the library the secretary generals reporthas now been declared classified <e> <s> finally <e>", "<cs> my lords finally is the noble lord aware that under resolution as interpreted by the secretary general of the united nations this year provision was made for swapo forces inside namibia <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord contradicted me in saying that there was no provision for bases for swapo forces in namibia <e> <s> is he not aware that the quotation that i gave which is taken directly from resolution and was quoted by the secretary general stated that swapo forces would be based in namibia under united nations supervision <e> <s> i do not know the situation but is it not very likely that as the secretary general has now suggested swapo forces both in northern namibia and probably some crossing the border were seeking out united nations forces in order to go to their bases to be monitored as was agreed in resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord answered my noble friend lord stoddart in relation to the report of the select commmittee of this house and said that some of the advice from committees <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has given the slight increase in market share <e> <s> if he does not have the figures can he let us know what the movement has been in trade between this country and latin america in real terms over the past decade <e> <s> when he is reading perhaps he will be re-reading the report of the select committee previously referred to perhaps he will note that there is a section that urges the british government to increase their support for trade in the third world in contrast with the great deficit that we suffer in our trade with the european common market <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister in charge of the bill has constantly reiterated the point that the bill has been brought forward for the sake of football <e> <s> football is an abstraction <e> <s> the people who play football and the people who go to football matches are not an abstraction <e> <s> they are real <e> <s> if the government are sincere in their objective to help football they will have to go beyong the football league and the football assciation in setting up an authority to run the scheme <e> <s> the football league and the football association may run the game but they do not run the hundreds of thousands of supporters who attend games every week <e> <s> if the government are concerned as they say they are about the safety of those supporters which i understand is the principal objective of the bill those supporters themselves should be asked about the way in which the scheme is to be run <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and as he referred to what i said will he address himself to these two facts <e> <s> first it is the football supporters who keep the game alive indeed it is their attendance money which keeps the game alive <e> <s> secondly is it not the case <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord address himself to the issue of the inclusion of representatives of the supporters about whom i should imagine from what he has said previously he is most concerned regarding hooliganism and who will be personally affected by the introduction of the membership card <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not the house which decided the question of whether women should be excluded but the committee <e> <s> the committee has now reported to the house <e> <s> therefore the house is entitled to discuss the issue not necessarily to force a division but to try to persuade the government

the movement of such dangerous materials on our railways <e> <s> one sees these trains regularly for example from hampstead heath <e> <s> what are the safeguards that the government place on such movements <e>", "<cs> my lords does that act not apply to the carriage of atomic and other waste <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the decision was taken by the secretary of state for scotland because as he said he was asked to do so by the scottish education authority and he did so without consultation with the governors or trustees of the college <e> <s> is the minister aware

scotland is to be closed and that scotland unlike england and wales will be left with no residential adult college <e>", "<cs> my lords may i probe the minister on his answers <e> <s> first on the question of finance is it not the case that there is a pledging fund still collecting money <e> <s> that will take some time if as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe pointed out it is allowed to sell part of the land valued at million <e> <s> secondly the noble lord talks about the wider access programme which i believe is being given million by the government <e> <s> is he not aware that that scheme has a quite different objective from that of newbattle abbey <e> <s> it is not a question of how many students are in higher education in scotland but what the prospect is for those students who <e>", "<cs> my lords having personally participated in every aspect of education from school to university in the few moments that i have to speak this afternoon i wish to concentrate on one aspect that i believe has not been dealt with so far during the debate <e> <s> it complements what my noble friend lord dormand of easington had to say concerning adult education <e> <s> i wish to speak about that subject not in the way that he did but in addition to what he had to say as regards the position of mature students <e> <s> there is an aspect of adult education which is a very precious heritage of this country <e> <s> it has made an immense contribution to the development of british culture but today it is being neglected if not destroyed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows on st april the prime minister was in windhoek <e> <s> on the same day the united nations released the south west african defence force to resume its attacks on swapo <e> <s> if the minister read the report of the adjournment debate which took place in the other house last night he will know that the personal evidence of mr paul boateng who recently returned from namibia was that

decision that was taken <e> <s> she was representing a member of the security council <e> <s> did she partake in any way in the decision that was made on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not fully answer my question <e> <s> i am aware of the fact that the united nations administrator took the decision on st april <e> <s> i asked whether the prime minister as a representative of a country which is a member of the security council took any part in that decision <e> <s> the minister now says that the south african forces will withdraw to base <e> <s> is he aware that at present south african forces are surrounding the bases where swapo forces are asked to gather and are threatening them <e> <s> two days ago they threatened to interrogate those who gather there with the result as was pointed out by mr boateng last night that many swapo guerillas will not go to those bases because they will not feel safe there <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall confine my remarks to the report on radioactive waste management <e> <s> i cannot do better than to start by congratulating both the noble earl lord cranbrook on his introduction of the report and he and his committee on presenting a report which i would describe as a valuable contribution to the public debate <e> <s> i emphasise the words public debate <e> <s> i shall refer later to what the noble lord lord sherfield who knows a great deal more about nuclear energy and the disposal of nuclear waste than i do had to say about the place of the public in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that correction but the noble lord spoke of public opinion as though it is ignorant <e> <s> of course we are ignorant <e> <s> we are ignorant of the technical side <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that point fully but it does not detract from the point that i was making namely that it is beginning to appear to many people as though there were a small cabal that considers that it knows and that it is its job this includes nirex to convince the public of its case <e> <s> i suggest that it is far too important an issue with far too great a timescale to leave to a handful of experts and politicians <e> <s> it is a matter that concerns every member of the community today and for many centuries hence <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not wish to interrupt the flow of the noble lords speech but before he sits down i should like to ask one question <e> <s> he talked about the demogogic aspect of general debate on the nuclear issue and the disposal of waste <e> <s> he asked who is the public to believe <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that within the scientific community particularly those connected with the nuclear industry there are various opinions each of which should be publicised so that the public can see that there is no single monolithic scientific attitude to these problems and that in the last resort the people must decide <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down although i know he is not responsible for this matter will he agree with me that as we have all been in agreement on the necessity for genuine education to the mass media it would have been appropriate if the debate had been televised <e> <s> will he further agree that this matter should be brought to the attention of the television committee of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords all or us who have participated either actively or as spectators in any sport felt deeply shocked and saddened this weekend <e> <s> i join in the condolences that have been sent to the bereaved in this disaster and in the appreciation of

assuring the house that the judicial inquiry will include an examination of what happened during the night following the disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two further questions for the minister <e> <s> first is it not the case that the british government agreed to the convention of which provided for legislation to be introduced by and for the clean-up process to be complete by <e> <s> if that is the case why have they not fulfilled their obligations under that convention <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may return to the ministers answer to my first supplementary question <e> <s> is it the case that the british government agreed to the convention of <e> <s> if so that puts out of order many of the supplementary questions that have been asked <e> <s> why have the british government not kept to their obligations under a convention which involved their participation and to which they agreed <e> <s> if the present considered opinion is not adhered to by the british government may not the government be taken to the european court by the european commission <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the second part of my question <e> <s> are we going to be taken to the european court if that order is not complied with <e>", "<cs> my lords before the bill becomes an act of parliament i think that we should put on record the distate which is felt in many quarters of the country as regards certain sections of the legislation <e> <s> some of us have tried to support the amendments which have been put forward at all stages of the bills proceedings <e> <s> indeed we expressed our fears on second reading <e> <s> the noble earl was totally frank with us when he said as he did only last week on report that the central objection we have raised is a matter of principle <e> <s> he repeated that argument this afternoon as indeed he did several times last week <e> <s> i think that that is a more frank description of the difference between the two sides in your lordships house than what he just said in moving the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> he said that we have differed on detail we have not differed on detail we have differed on principle <e> <s> moreover we still differ on principle <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he accept for the record a correction to the impression he gave <e> <s> the debates and the divisions on the libertarian amendments have been supported on all sides of the house <e> <s> will he be fair to noble lords on the other side of the house who have spoken as we have on this side on the question of public interest and who have voted as they have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords as a socialist i have always believed that the production process especially in a mixed economy needs the co-operation of government unions and management whether that management is in nationalised or private industries <e> <s> i do not expect the noble lord who will answer this debate to agree <e> <s> however i refer him to the much quoted select committee report on overseas tade <e> <s> that committee considered the contrasts between industrial activities in this country and in those of our major <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that encouraging answer <e> <s> as she says the european community has made these proposals and i believe that in france and germany they are already implemented <e> <s> is she aware that the chemical alar which is used on apples is being banned in the united states <e> <s> the united states environmental protection agency has said that there is an <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that a large number of the chain retail stores have already collected information on the effects of various pesticides and they refuse to give that information to the public <e> <s> i also wish to ask the minister about another pesticide tecnazene which is used on potatoes <e> <s> will the minister tell us why the government have dropped their original proposals to set limits for tecnazene the use of which in this country has been shown to be well above international limits <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon i oppose the bill in principle <e> <s> electricity like water telecommunications coal and railways is part of the commanding heights of our economy they should be owned and managed by the national community <e> <s> so far as concerns the bill itself i listened carefully to the opening speech made by the noble baroness lady hooper <e> <s> she made a particular point indeed i was glad that she did on the environmental issue <e> <s> it is on that issue alone that i wish to speak tonight <e> <s> i shall complement what was said by the noble earl lord swinton and by my noble friend lord stoddart of swindon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene for just a moment <e> <s> i realise that time is pressing but surely the minister is aware that questions on the environment have been raised by members from both sides of the house <e> <s> indeed they were very crucial questions regarding the global future <e> <s> can he therefore just encapsulate the governments policy their attitude and their philosophy towards that issue so as to help us in the later stages of the proceedings on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are constantly telling us about their great dramatic economic success success with a trade deficit of over billion a year and as the noble viscount has just pointed out now running at around billion and it looks as though the chancellor of the exchequer will again be wrong in his estimates last year he was per cent <e> <s> wrong with million people at least still unemployed with inflation now running at per cent <e> <s> and with interest rates on which the borrowing for investment depends set at per cent <e> <s> if that is success what do the government conceive to be failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two questions <e> <s> the first is is it the case that her majestys government are responsible for the waters within the three-mile limit around the channel islands where this container may well have sunk <e> <s> secondly when the minister speaks about the anglo-french team being satisfied is it satisfied that the leak of this dangerous pesticide cannot get into the food chain via absorption into the water and then its intake into fish <e> <s> is the team satisfied for all time when this incident is only one month old <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord admitted that neither he nor anybody else knows where the container is <e> <s> if that is the case why has the search been called off <e> <s> is there any truth in the fact that this area of the sea bed has been polluted by waste ever since the war particularly in that part just off guernsey known as hurd deep <e> <s> is it the case that the search has been called off for fear of disturbing what may be and i should like the noble lord to tell us whether he has any knowledge of this nuclear active waste which has been dumped there for many years and which is now on the sea bed <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that the prime minister intends to announce on friday at torness that there will be another to power stations built in the near future <e> <s> secondly is the noble baroness aware that research from the rocky mountain institute in colorado has shown as regards the greenhouse effect that energy conservation is seven times as efficient as the production of electricity through nuclear power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said this was not a matter for the government but it is a matter for the government because they have included the protection of the nuclear industry within their electricity bill <e> <s> the noble baroness also said that energy conservation will be taken into account <e> <s> may i therefore repeat this question <e> <s> is she aware that it has now been established by research that energy conservation is seven times as effective as nuclear energy for the provision of electricity <e> <s> in regard to the second part of my question concerning public inquiries will the noble baroness promise the house that for future public inquiries the kind of evidence now being collected by geologists on the seismic effect particularly in the irish sea basin will be available and open to consideration <e>", "<cs> there are two points arising from this amendment and both were mentioned by my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> the first the one with which he finished his introduction seems to be of paramount parliamentary importance <e> <s> it would surely be a mockery of the parliamentary process if the government did not listen to the debates in committee at report stage and on third reading regarding the requirements of parliament in respect of the person who is to be appointed to this key role <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness will recall that yesterday in part of an answer to a question of mine she stated that it was the governments intention to include energy conservation when i had referred to the protection which is given in this bill to the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> i should like the noble baroness to answer two questions when she comes to reply <e> <s> in her first speech she made a great deal of the governments concern about energy efficiency <e> <s> if that concern is sincere how is it that the size of the energy efficiency unit has been cut by about per cent <e> <s> secondly i wish to take up a point which was made by the noble lord lord peyton <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i greatly welcome the statement by the noble lord and the action of delay by the government <e> <s> however is this statement not a little tardy as the noble lord opposite has just said <e> <s> if as the noble lord told us english heritage has been advising the government for four to five months why is it only today when construction work was due to begin that the government have taken this action <e> <s> had it not been for the protests made by prominent figures in the theatrical and literary world would not the philistine element in the government which likes to see mortar and bricks built at a profit rather than <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome this amendment and thank the noble lord lord renton for putting it down and for giving us the opportunity yet again to debate the question of the environment <e> <s> it is also a great and very rare pleasure to be able to agree with almost everything that he said in his opening speech <e> <s> i shall refer to one reservation later <e>", "<cs> if i said that it was a mistake but i do not think i did <e> <s> it was certainly a false impression i an not suggesting for one moment that the production of electricity by atomic energy contributes anything like as much to the greenhouse effect as the burning of fossil fuels unless they are desulphurised <e> <s> i do not put forward that case for a moment <e> <s> but it is wrong to suggest that the production of electricity by atomic energy has no effect <e> <s> i am not saying that it does not have a much lesser effect than the burning of fossil fuels again without desulphurisation <e> <s> but it has some effect even if only minimal <e> <s> but added to that must be the great danger to our environment from the pollution caused by nuclear waste and the disposal of nuclear waste <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord answer one question arising from his speech <e> <s> when talking about the concern for price does he claim that the production of electricity by nuclear power is cheap and cheaper than other methods <e> <s> if he does i must point out that the claim has been widely questioned <e>", "<cs> in order to avoid the noble baroness getting up and down perhaps i may add a question <e> <s> she said at the end of her speech that the government are doing many things to assist the development of renewable resources <e> <s> she did not tell us any of the things that they are doing <e> <s> is it not the case that government funding for such activity has been cut <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has widened the issue beyond the question to the attitude of cnd to western defence in general is he aware that a leading member of cnd was invited to the soviet union to witness the destruction of some of its nuclear weapons and was told afterwards that cnd had played an important part in the agreement by which both the soviet union and the united states were reducing the number of their nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lords answer indicate that the government are prepared to support the call by the soviet union for international red cross observers to investigate the alleged atrocities whatever side they may come from <e> <s> is he aware that pictures have been shown on american television which indicate that a considerable number of swapo guerrillas were shot at short range in the face and that civilians suffered the same fate <e> <s> that indicates that they were executed rather than as had been agreed returned across the border into angola <e>", "<cs> my lords like the minister i do not know whether or not there have been atrocities <e> <s> but evidence has been produced which seems to suggest that there have been <e> <s> in those circumstances although i should be the last to denigrate the united nations is it not clear that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i unreservedly accept the apology of the noble lord <e> <s> however does he agree that the misinformation that he gave the house <e>", "<cs> misled us from the thrust of the question that i was asking <e> <s> does the noble lord remember that he added that i should ask the french about the presence of nuclear waste <e> <s> according to his colleague in the government the minister for armed services the french had been in touch with the ministry of defence <e> <s> i was asking and it is still a relevant question that when the search for this most highly toxic container was called off was there any suggestion that it was being called off for fear of disturbing the nuclear waste which we now know had been placed in that area by british governments between and <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister now aware that the sea beds around the channel islands are contaminated not only with nuclear waste which has been dumped there by british governments over years but also with conventional weapons and explosives which have been dumped there ever since the second world war <e> <s> will he inform the house whose responsibility it is to clean this sea bed <e> <s> will the government do anything to make those waters safer for the people living in that area and for the people who use transport across it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question that i asked him in my second supplementary question is he now aware that in addition to radioactive waste there has been the dumping of conventional weapons ever since the end of the war <e> <s> who will be responsible for cleaning up the waste that has now been dumped in this area across the channel <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house what is the present and projected cost of the united kingdom contribution to the peacekeeping force in namibia <e> <s> since the events of st april this year have the government considered whether or not that amount should be increased and the united nations force in namibia increased in view of the tragedies which have already taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister claims that the government are serious as regards energy efficiency <e> <s> can he tell the house how it is that they are engaged in cutting down the resources for the energy efficiency unit <e> <s> as my noble friend has just suggested will the minister accept that concerning the greenhouse effect energy conservation and renewable sources of energy are far better and surer methods of reducing the greenhouse effect than proliferating nuclear power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the first part of my question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the first question that i asked him <e> <s> how does he expect the house to believe that the government are serious concerning energy conservation when they are engaged in cutting down very severely the resources for the energy efficiency unit in their own department <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend lord barnett the minister said that the government believe that the bank of englands present situation is necessary to counter inflation <e> <s> when will it do so <e> <s> is it helped or hindered by government policy <e> <s> as the inflation rate is now rising does that mean that the government will again use the bank of england to raise the prime interest rate <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend lord peston i was somewhat surprised at the tone of the speech of the noble baroness which as he said was somewhat in the nature of a second reading speech <e> <s> but within that speech she uttered a kind of throw-away line on which i should like to tackle her <e>", "<cs> i welcomed the noble baronesss initial speech <e> <s> is she saying that the government intend that the renewable proportion of the non-fossil fuel requirement will start as it is today as a minimum and that they hope that it will expand in the future <e> <s> if that is right and if the expansion is successful as in other countries will it be at least theoretically possible for the whole of the non-fossil fuel percentage to be allocated to renewable sources without any contribution from the nuclear side <e>", "<cs> i wish to refer to the point made by my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> as the minister has mentioned the amendment of the noble lord lord norrie includes a reference to promoting energy conservation <e> <s> surely the committee is entitled to know the governments attitude to amendment no <e> <s> which relates to energy conservation and was accepted by the house <e> <s> the government have simply said that they are considering the matter but are we not entitled to know what the government intend to do about it in order to decide what our attitude should be towards lord nomes amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate that should not be taking place <e> <s> the government were rightly persuaded after the hillsborough disaster that it would be insensitive for parliament to be debating this question while the suffering was still continuing <e> <s> do they believe that the anguish which was caused by that disaster has disappeared <e> <s> if they do they are totally out of tune with public opinion <e> <s> public opinion will see this debate as grossly insensitive in view of the events of the last few weeks and the people who have suffered from them <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he will answer one simple and straight question <e> <s> he has described it as a framework bill <e> <s> if the third reading is passed and the bill is passed in another place and then as a result of the report by lord justice taylor it is seen that the bill is either irrelevant or dangerous what opportunity will this house have to change the bill <e> <s> it is on that issue that many noble lords believe that this debate should not have taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness two questions <e> <s> first what do the british government consider to be the supplying authority for the uranium which has been obtained by this country from namibia <e> <s> is it south africa or the namibian junta <e> <s> secondly is it not the case that if as the noble baroness has told me previously the government have no intention of using that uranium for defence purposes they have full power if they wish to take it to ask euratom to change that codification <e> <s> that would be within the regulations of euratom as i have no doubt the noble baroness is well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords do i take it that the answer from the noble baroness to my first question indicates that british atomic policy can be controlled by the south african government <e> <s> as she did not answer my second question is it not the case that although she has assured the house that the uranium already obtained from namibia will not be used for defence purposes the government have full power and authority if they wish to change that coding from n to p so that it is within the civil use of uranium alone and cannot be used for defence purposes <e> <s> is it not the case that it is only the uranium that this country has obtained from namibia which is codified as n and can therefore be used for defence purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has still not answered my question <e> <s> do not the british government have both the power and authority if they wish to ask for that code to be changed <e> <s> if they did so is it not already clear that the euratom authorities would welcome that request <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell the house whether it is the case that the cegbs application will be made on friday of this week and that only eight weeks will be allowed for objections to be addressed to the local district council <e> <s> can she also tell the house whether there is any firm intention of holding a public inquiry before any final decision is taken on sizewell c in the same way as at hinkley and in the case of the previous sizewell plant <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness satisfied that three months is sufficient for the organisation of objections in the area <e> <s> am i not correct in thinking that the period for wylfa b is four months <e> <s> is either three months or four months sufficient for local objections to be organised <e> <s> further to the point made by my two noble friends on the front bench would it not be sensible to delay any decision on sizewell c until the report of the public inquiry at hinkley is published <e> <s> obviously that has a direct bearing on whether or not there should be a third reactor at sizewell <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will answer the second question that i asked her which i am sure that she forgot <e> <s> will any decision be made on sizewell c before the report on hinkley is published <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up the point made by the noble lord lord gray of contin and contradict it <e> <s> in doing so i should like to support the noble lords lord ezra and lord shepherd in their introduction but i would go further than either of them <e> <s> i want the minister to come clean and direct on this matter <e> <s> as she knows i have been raising it every since consideration of the bill began <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord somers has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment of my noble friend i ask the noble baroness when replying to answer questions which i put to her together backed by some evidence that there is a growing disquiet among the public in places <e>", "<cs> that is democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down the question i asked was not how long the secretary of state has to give nor how long he has given <e> <s> i knew those answers and repeated them <e> <s> i asked the noble baroness whether she would consider extending the length of time from three months to six months <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the reply given by the noble lord which is apparently contrary to that given by his noble friend during proceedings on the electricity bill when i raised the same question and was told that there was no connection between leukaemia and nuclear installations <e> <s> i am delighted to know that the noble lord and i hope the noble baroness have read the comare report <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that the government have accepted the following quotation from the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord recognises that there is widespread public concern in this respect particularly in relation to the vulnerability of children <e> <s> during the passage of the electricity bill through this house i asked the noble baroness lady hooper whether the health costs were taken into account by the government when considering the cost of building new nuclear reactors <e> <s> can i take it that the noble lords answer to me this afternoon indicates that the government are now taking into account the cost of the research that is needed into this whole matter when calculating the cost of nuclear reactors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> i agree entirely with him when he said at the beginning of his speech that these defence estimates are based on the past and on past thinking and a lack of imagination <e> <s> i also agree with a great deal but not all of what he said about the new situation relating to nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> is it not the case that the house of commons defence committee has told the government that it is time that they made up their mind between the various options <e> <s> rather than telling parliament is it not a subject for parliament if not to decide at least to advise the ministry of defence on rather than to be told that a decision has been taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that although the government may believe that the people in the localities do not <e> <s> are the government not concerned with the weight of local opinion as increasing details emerge about the danger of leukaemia in particular to children in these areas as well as other dangers from nuclear installations <e> <s> will she also consider whether the government should not influence the local authorities whose time limit for objections to the planning application appears to be much shorter than that which is demanded by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness appears simply to have repeated her first answer <e> <s> is she not concerned about the local opinion among people who have to live in the vicinity of these power stations <e> <s> if that local opinion is expressed in an organised way to the secretary of state will he at least consider extending the time <e> <s> in view of the snide comments of the secretary of state this week concerning the various green organisations is it not essential that the representations of those organisations that represent objectors to the building of nuclear power stations in particular those at wylfa and sizewell should be given full weight before a decision is taken <e> <s> is it not essential that every effort should be made by the government to ensure that all such people and organisations representing them have a full opportunity to put their point of view before any decision is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not i who ask for an extension <e> <s> it is the local people <e> <s> will the noble baroness and the secretary of state not take notice of organised public opinion in that area <e> <s> it is public opinion that counts not my view <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that virtually the whole of the deficit is due to our trading deficit with the ec and that our trade with the rest of the world is in surplus <e> <s> is that not the real reason for the present and apparently continuing deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords when i expressed an intention to speak on this bill i thought that i might have to provide some byzantine way of introducing the single point that i wanted to make <e> <s> however the noble lord lord henley spared me that in the latter part of his speech <e> <s> he repeated and paraphrased what his honourable friend the under-secretary of state mr freeman said in standing committee a in another place <e> <s> it is worthwhile quoting what mr freeman said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for what he said <e> <s> if he is right and i do not know whether he is then he is simply reinforcing my case for new legislation <e> <s> but as i understood the answer i received from the noble lord lord skelmersdale although the conversation took place some time ago now it suggested that in law the individual had the right to donate organs and that relatives did not have the right to intervene but that that was however the general practice <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord can clear up the matter when he comes to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord said <e> <s> however i am not just talking about the donation of kidneys <e> <s> in fact i went into the matter legally and discovered that the only way in which one can donate ones body for medical research is to put that request in ones will <e> <s> again this is a legal matter and i wish to give the minister the chance to wind up the debate <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that he will be able to answer some of those questions <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be selling them <e> <s> that is what the bill is against <e>", "<cs> my lords on a different point in connection with the bill the noble lord lord trafford whom i also congratulate on his new position on the front bench will recall that when he was sitting on the back benches last week we had an exchange about the legal status of the donor card <e> <s> during the debate i was given two contrary answers as to whether the donor card has any legal enforceability or whether it is possible for relatives to interfere with the wishes expressed by the individual on the donor card <e>", "<cs> my lords i must take issue with the noble lord lord renton when he says that the government are to be congratulated and denies that there has been a u-turn <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady hooper is not on the front bench <e> <s> i wish her every happiness in undertaking whatever may succeed her task here <e>", "<cs> my lords

ezra whose amendments i unreservedly support is trying to make the power mandatory <e> <s> why is that important <e> <s> it is important as has been observed by no less a body than the energy committee of the other place in its sixth report <e> <s> i propose to confine myself to the relevant quotations from that report which was published last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to my concern that the government were not doing enough in the matter of energy efficiency <e> <s> did he not understand that this was the concern expressed by the energy committee of another place which has criticised the cutting down and apparently the future cutting down of the energy efficiency unit which the government set up <e> <s> it is not important whether i consider that the government are doing enough as regards energy efficiency <e> <s> the energy committee of another place with a majority of conservatives on it stated that it did not consider the government were doing enough <e> <s> the committee specifically criticised the cutting of the energy efficiency unit <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the question put by the noble earl lord halsbury regarding the warning that the government were given four years ago and the fact that the current deficit is even larger than the deficit which was forecast on the basis that the government continued with the economic policies that they were pursuing at the time <e> <s> is the minister aware that members of that committee were told by the chancellor that the fall in manufacturing would be more than compensated for by services <e> <s> how is it that the government have not changed their policy in the light of that warning from all sides of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord

contracts with atomic plants for the working life of each station <e> <s> is that the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the desire of consumers for this bill <e> <s> is he aware that the latest opinion poll shows that per cent <e> <s> of the nation is opposed to electricity privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer my previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house how much of our overseas assets were used last week by the chancellor in his abortive attempt to bolster up the pound <e>", "<cs> my lords let us have the truth in this house <e> <s> will the noble earl refute the allegation made by the noble lord lord wyatt that this conservative government or any conservative government had to repay loans that were given to the previous administration that is the labour government <e> <s> will he refute that allegation because it is untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords my point is not as to whether koevoet has been disbanded <e> <s> i believe that it has been officially disbanded but it is also widely reported that members of koevoet have been included in the police force that is now in charge of law and order before the elections <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble and learned lord on his side of the chamber the minister spoke of koevoet as being the preserver of law and order <e> <s> does he really believe

just not good enough my lords <e> <s> the noble lord has studiously ignored a whole series of questions from this side of the house <e> <s> if he is so naive as to believe as he said that his statement has nothing to do with electoral considerations will he tell the house why he would not listen nor would his right honourable friend in another place listen to the criticisms made during the debates and which now have been admitted by the government to be valid <e> <s> why did he not listen then instead of having to come back when there has been public outcry against it to alter that bill after parliament has passed it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that construction work is presently in operation on the building of a new road around coombwick wharfe which will be used both for the building of the new hinkley c point reactor and for the decommissioning of the magnox and agr stations already in existence <e> <s> if that is right is it not degrading and debasing the value of public inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a few more kind words and they are words of sympathy to the noble viscount on being thrown in at the deep end on an issue which we have spent many years debating <e> <s> however i must remind him that he has not answered my first question <e> <s> is it the case that a new road is being built around coombwick wharfe because the people of coombwick are very concerned about this matter <e> <s> is that road for the purpose of building the new reactor and for conveying the radioactive materials on the de-commissioning of the present reactors <e> <s> if

supporting the people of palau in maintaining the clause when the compact with the united states is concluded and the trust territory can become self-governing <e>", "<cs> my lords after that geography lesson perhaps i may return to the noble lords comment that the british government are concerned about the resolution of the dilemma <e> <s> which dilemma is he talking about <e> <s> is it the dilemma between the inhabitants of palau who wish to retain their nuclear-free constitution and the united states wish to change it <e> <s> if so where do the british government stand <e> <s> are

they have invented <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what the british government are doing following that conference in the form of legislation and in supporting moves by industry to find substitues for cfcs <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question asked by my noble friend lord rea does the minister agree that history shows that a deceleration of population growth only comes with an increase in standard of living and that that is especially the case in countries where a large percentage of children die before the age of five <e> <s> is there not a case for the government to

opportunity at some other time and in some other forum to debate the subject with the noble lord lord orr-ewing <e> <s> it was certainly with the active connivance of both the british and french that during the s hitler and nazism and mussolini and fascism became the danger to the rest of europe <e> <s> they were not so at the time when dick sheppard initiated the peace pledge union <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that thorp will be a major exporter but is it not the case that the viability of the thorp installation now depends on importing nuclear waste from other countries which will not process it <e> <s> is it not therefore the case that britain is becoming the waste bin for europe in particular germany and for asia in particular japan <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the contract with the west germans arrived at when planned reprocessing in bavaria was scrapped as a result of german public opinion being against it <e> <s> however great the profits the government or bnfl may make are those profits not being obtained at the cost of endangering the health of the people around sellafield <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the level of leukaemia among children in the sellafield area much higher than the national average <e> <s> will the noble viscount answer my question as to whether the germans turned down the plant in bavaria because of the opposition of german public opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords the scene in our planetary environment is that of a sea infested by sharks <e> <s> this bill would suggest that the government are fishing for them with a bent pin <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey and others have pointed out the bill is much more noteworthy for its omissions than for what is included in it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the secretary of state received the report last wednesday and that it showed that according to latest estimates sizewell b will now cost well over billion at prices compared with the figure the government gave in the past which was given to me by the noble viscount of billion also at prices <e> <s> is the minister further aware of the criticism being made by the all-party energy select committee of another place of the conduct of the department of energy in not monitoring the rapid steep rise in the cost of building nuclear power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount again advise the house whether the figure which i quoted and which has been widely quoted over billion is the latest estimate made by nuclear electric pic <e> <s> if it is despite what the noble viscount says regarding the cost of electricity will that not automatically increase the nuclear levy on the privatised companies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the greatest challenge to humanity over the next years is how the peoples of the developing world can reach a sustainable level of life without destroying the planet <e> <s> does he agree that as the industrialised countries are responsible for per cent <e> <s> of the pollution of our atmosphere it is the industrialised countries who owe it to themselves and to the rest of the world to help to finance the more expensive technologies which are required if the developing countries are not to follow the bad example of those of us in the developed world <e>", "<cs> my lords a little over years ago i was asked from time to time to advise an african president on what was happening in his country <e> <s> at the end of my visits i put forward a list of my observations but left the most sensitive to the end <e> <s> then i asked whether he had any idea of the population increase in his country <e> <s> he told me that he had not and i told him that it was - per cent <e> <s> he asked how does that bear on what we are trying to do <e> <s> i explained to him that at that time before per cent <e> <s> of his population was aged or under and that within years it would be over per cent <e> <s> taking into account the old people it meant that less than half his population had to maintain all the services particularly the social services for more than half the population <e> <s> i must add that he turned to me and said how do i convince my people to reduce the size of their families <e> <s> i have nine children myself <e> <s> i have not yet found an answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> if he is hoping to use his influence with the united states and is anxious about the abortion issue is he aware that every year there are about deaths among women from abortions and that per cent <e> <s> of those deaths are in the third world <e> <s> is that not an argument for increasing the supply and provision of population control measures in order to prevent back-street abortions which are now a feature of most third world countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two questions for the noble viscount <e> <s> first is he aware that on th april the secretary of state for transport declared to a conference held by the worldwide fund for nature that no substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles could be expected over the next years <e> <s> does that not suggest a conflict in policy between the department of transport and the department of the environment <e> <s> secondly will the noble viscount tell the house why the british government have chosen the year as a target for stabilising emissions whereas the rest of europe except for spain has chosen the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount says that the british government have asked the european commission to look at the matter <e> <s> is it not a fact that the environment commissioner has stated that the year is the very latest by which carbon dioxide emissions should be stabilised and that the british government have disagreed with him <e> <s> if the noble viscount is looking for means of improving public transport will he consider transferring the billion subsidy allocated to company cars each year to improving public transport facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a previous question the noble lord said that only one-third of the total crop is exported to the third world <e> <s> is the minister saying on behalf of the government that because of employment investment and profits in europe they are prepared to export this death-dealing tobacco and have it dumped in third world countries regardless of health or morality <e> <s> will the government come out firmly and say that is wrong and we shall do everything to stop it <e>", "<cs> my lords then should not the government make estimates in view of the fact that they have already taken nuclear energy out of their privatisation programme <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that the costs have become such a scandal that the national audit office has been asked to provide a review of those costs <e> <s> is he further aware that in one year alone british nuclear fuels estimate of decommissioning costs rose from million to billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is well aware because we have debated the matter before that there is a another side to the question of the use of nuclear fuel and the greenhouse effect <e> <s> the case that he put forward takes into account neither the nuclear waste which is produced by the nuclear industry nor the method of construction of power stations <e> <s> will the noble viscount tell the house in view of the figures and in view of the figure of billion which was mentioned when the national audit office was asked to undertake a review whether the government have put any money aside in order to defray those costs because as i understand it if that figure of billion is correct there is a necessity for a sinking fund of over billion now <e>", "<cs> my lords in his opening speech my noble friend lord williams of elvel referred to the two dubious activities of the department of trade and industry concerning the house of fraser and the rover deals <e> <s> we have never had any coherent answer from the government as to the currency deals that took place at the time of the house of fraser deal nor the visit to downing street <e> <s> that remains a sleazy mystery <e>", "<cs> my lords i am deliberately using the word deceit <e> <s> that word deceit will be confirmed by reference to the letters from the noble lord lord young to british aerospace which are in the library <e> <s> i have mentioned this before in the presence of the noble lord lord young <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not given notice before this debate because i have not had the opportunity <e> <s> the noble lord lord young has not been available so far as i know and i have made inquiries in the house <e> <s> however please let me finish <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord would allow me to finish the sentence <e> <s> i was pointing out that what i say now about the letters from the former secretary of state for the department of trade and industry i said in this house in his presence while he sat on the benches opposite when we were debating the rover deal <e> <s> i simply repeat the general point that this is an illustration of the reduction in the standard of public morality <e> <s> there is an open attempt to deceive parliament and the commission <e> <s> it is shown there in the library <e> <s> in previous years it has been the custom for anyone attempting to deceive parliament to resign <e> <s> that is our responsibility it is the responsibility of this house and of parliament as a whole <e> <s> i do not intend to make a speech about responsibilities we have to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords on reflection will not the minister consider that it is intolerably arrogant to state to this house that the agenda for the meeting was not worth the bother of a minister of her majestys government attending when other ministers of the allied states considered that it was worth the bother and that there was important business to conduct <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i remind the noble lord lord reay that we had a number of discussions when debating the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord three questions <e> <s> first why does he continue to repeat the canard which he has dragged up from the cfc debate about going it alone <e> <s> we are not talking about going it alone <e> <s> as outlined by the noble baroness lady robson certain countries in the world are setting the pace <e> <s> the question is whether or not we should join them and we are suggesting that we should <e>", "<cs> will the minister answer my other two questions <e>", "<cs> in common with my noble friend lord williams i have taken part in a number of debates on this subject <e> <s> i have only one question to ask the minister <e> <s> wind power has been dealt with by my noble friend and by the noble lord lord stanley <e>", "<cs> i really cannot let this go <e> <s> the noble lord said that he wanted to return to the amendment <e> <s> the amendment refers to renewable sources which include not only renewable sources but also wind power <e> <s> i was instancing another renewable source <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether i would like to put down a question <e> <s> i have put down questions <e> <s> i referred him to the debate on st february and also to what i said in the debate of last wednesday <e> <s> i have never had an answer from the government as to what their attitude was and is towards the invention of professor salter which was found to be successful and is being used abroad <e> <s> it was killed in in this country as a result of the false figures given for the price of nuclear power <e>", "<cs> my lords did i hear correctly that the noble earl mentioned the raising of speed limits in certain states in the united states and accompanied his remarks with the information that following the raising of speed limits the number of accidents also increased <e> <s> if so is that not an answer to those who would like to raise the speed limits in this country <e> <s> does he agree that it is an indication that we should lower the speed limit on motorways in this country both for safety and for more efficient use of petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> does he agree that it is of the utmost importance that there should be a clear separation between the exercise of political power and activities within the commercial world the main objective of which is the making of profit <e> <s> as four former ministers are now participating in some form in privatised industries which the government have privatised is this not derogating from that principle and allowing the commercial world the benefit of the inside knowledge gained from ministerial experience <e>", "<cs> my lords before we move to the next question i should like the noble lord to answer the question which i put to him <e> <s> does he agree that it is important for public confidence sharply to separate political power and ministerial access to commercial and political information from the use of such information in the private sector of industry <e> <s> in particular will he comment upon the negotiations which took place when the secretary of state for trade and industry announced that mercury would be given a licence and then less than months later the same secretary of state became chairman of cable and wireless which owns mercury <e>", "<cs> i do not know what the liberal benches have to say about the work of schumacher but i worked with him and i cannot understand how by the wildest stretch of the imagination the noble lord can drag in his name on this amendment <e> <s> it is totally irrelevant <e> <s> i am sure that if schumacher were here he would support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not answer my question <e> <s> is it the case that over the next five years several hundred of these flasks each of which contains as much radioactivity as the bomb dropped on hiroshima will be transported across the channel on roll-on roll-off ferries which the government themselves admit have safety defects <e> <s> if that is the case what is the governments atttitude and what action will they take <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount tell the house directly whether until new ferries are built these flasks will be transported on ferries such as those that caused the disaster at zeebrugge and harwich <e> <s> is it not the case that the government have stated that these ferries are unsafe but that they will be used until new ferries are produced <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask a supplementary question on the noble viscounts reply <e> <s> have these ferries been tested and passed by the government as being safe in the case of fire <e> <s> evidence from an engineering consultant suggests that these flasks are at risk from fire at sea <e> <s> the noble viscount will be aware that fire at sea is one of the gravest risks of sea travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for repeating this statement if only because it is in such direct contrast to the statements he has made to me and to the house in answers to recent questions on the subject <e> <s> the last time i asked him a question on the matter he said that the allegations of bribery and deceit were only to be found in my mind <e> <s> in that case my mind must have spread very widely through the newspapers of this country and those of the world today <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble viscount read the most recent report of the energy committee of another place and in particular has he read paragraph of that report <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount discarding the work of the energy committee of another place <e> <s> in addition to the paragraph that i quoted has he read paragraph which states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord two questions both of them echoing a point which my noble friend lord williams introduced but which was not really answered <e> <s> first why did the noble lord the leader of the house use the word cash in relation to the provision of aid to developing countries and when responding to the question concerning the oecd figures <e> <s> why did he not give the real change in overseas aid rather than the cash terms <e>", "<cs> my lords in all his replies the minister has said what is planned to be done <e> <s> can he say what has been done <e> <s> what have the government done over the past years towards easing transport problems which have grown enormously during that period for londoners and other people using the transport systems in london <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the answer he has just given raises another danger <e> <s> is he aware that ici and dupont in particular have been working on these alternative gases but as my noble friend lord clinton-davis pointed out they are no totally safe for the ozone layer and add to global warming <e> <s> in encouraging this research will the minister ensure that the government do not allow themselves to be persuaded by the strong commercial lobbies which have already produced misleading advertisements about such products being environmentally friendly <e> <s> will the government also ensure that the investment which companies have made in <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate has been a mixture of the depressing and the hopeful <e> <s> it has been depressing as regards those noble lords who spoke in voices of the past of course we were brought up to believe in the essential element of the military arm of the country and hopeful as regards those who have seen that on the horizon we are faced with possibly the greatest watershed in human history if we take advantage of it <e> <s> whether we do so depends to a considerable extent upon our attitude towards what is commonly called defence but what i prefer to call the military <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he clarify the answer that he gave me <e> <s> he said that the government will not interfere in the commercial interests <e> <s> does that indicate that they will continue to support the export of armaments from firms in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to preface what i have to say about the motion before us by expressing my very deep and personal regret for the tragic irony that in the week in which we have been recalled to discuss the subject which very much revolves around the united nations we have heard with deep sorrow of the death of lord caradon <e> <s> i was privileged to work with him in cyprus in west africa in the west indies and at the united nations <e> <s> i know that if he had been here today he would have made a valuable contribution to our deliberations <e> <s> i say that because above all lord caradon was a man who believed in the united nations who served our country to the utmost at the united nations and who leaves behind sorrowing people in many parts of the world including in particular the citizens of the third world <e>", "<cs> my lords what is different if we are looking at the validity of a moral crusade <e> <s> what is different on moral grounds now <e> <s> to many people in the world we appear to be hypocrites <e> <s> have there been any words of contrition that we and the west in general including the french and the germans gave the arms the financial power and the diplomatic support to saddam hussein when he was murdering his own people and when he was using these weapons of terror in iran <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister read paragraph of the inspectors report <e> <s> i refer to this sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the ministers answer i am aware that on balance the inspector came down in favour of the building of the plant <e> <s> however in view of the quotation which i gave are we not entitled to expect the secretary of state to protect the public on the basis of the evidence produced by the inspector in his report <e> <s> in addition can we not expect the secretary of state to protect the future of the industry in view of the statement made to the inquiry by professor ulph the economic assessor <e> <s> he said that there cannot be a satisfactory estimate of the capital cost and hence generating cost of hinkley c <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government chief whip is dealing with business may i ask him whether it is intended to hold a debate on the new environmental white paper before the end of this parliament or after the queens speech <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one question originally put by my noble friend lord bruce and repeated by others that the minister has not answered <e> <s> why is it if it is not for the convenience of the government at the tory party conference that the condition in the madrid statement of reducing our inflation rate to a figure approaching the average for our community partners has been missed out <e> <s> the minister has repeatedly talked about the inflation rate for different sectors being reduced but that surely is just a cop-out <e> <s> the inflation rate for the country is per cent <e> <s> how can that be equated with the statement made at madrid that we would not join the erm until our inflation rate had fallen to approximately that of our european partners <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the amendment i should like to refer as my noble friend lord mcintosh has done to the white paper <e> <s> i was perhaps privileged and certainly intrigued to debate sections of the white paper with the secretary of state just last week <e> <s> he is obviously a very uncomfortable man <e> <s> i sympathise very deeply with him because the publication of the white paper is a defeat for the secretary of state on virtually every factor that he has included in it <e> <s> he has been defeated by his cabinet colleagues <e> <s> at the meeting the secretary of state referred to us living in a plural society <e> <s> the answer to that is that he lives in a plural government and a plural party <e> <s> he has been defeated by the prime minister <e> <s> once again the prime minister spoke with one voice two years ago but when it came to action she shied away and apparently lost interest <e> <s> now that she has gathered the trophies she has lost interest in the practicality of this country and her government in this country giving a lead <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits clown a second time will she answer my second question <e> <s> does she recognise that unless carbon dioxide emissions are cut below the level global warming will inevitably continue at an exponential rate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not good enough merely to have sympathy with the terms of the amendment <e> <s> if we are serious about the worlds future and if we recognise what is now clearly established the relationship between the deterioration in the ozone layer and the use of cfcs and say that we are sympathetic but can do nothing all we are doing is to condemn the world and its population to extinction <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully endorse what the minister said at the beginning of his answer regarding the action of the united nations and we all applaud that <e> <s> do her majestys government consider that there are any circumstances other than for the defence of this country in which british troops could be deployed without the full sanction of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the minister did not answer my question when answering the noble lord lord dormand <e> <s> in his answer to the noble lord the minister repeated what had been said in another place regarding the authority which the united nations is alleged to have given to the use of british forces <e> <s> i asked the question do her majestys government consider that there are any circumstances other than the defence of this country in which british forces can be deployed without the sanction and full authority of the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that all the work in education and population control and i pay tribute to the increased percentage in our aid budget is overtaken by poverty <e> <s> history has shown that populations only stabilise when there has been a rise in the standard of living to such an extent that for example children do not die before the age of five <e> <s> the noble earl refers to the aim of the government being to approach the per cent <e> <s> target of the united nations <e> <s> how are they approaching it <e> <s> over the past years our aid budget has fallen from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> is that progress during the economic miracle <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to mention briefly the responsibility of local authorities in particular as regards the recycling of refrigerators <e> <s> i have mentioned before in the house the bird group of companies which can recycle refrigerators <e> <s> however it can only do so it has stated this to be the case publicly when legislation exists which imposes a duty of recycling on local authorities <e> <s> this is necessary as a result of the cost of the recycling <e> <s> the recycling of refrigerators is an important part of the recycling process because it involves the cfcs within the refrigerators <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the noble viscount did not mention estimates for the future generation of waste <e> <s> will he confirm that a recent reassessment by the department of the environment has shown that the estimates for nuclear waste at sellafield are over million cubic metres greater than had been supposed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount lord whitelaw addressed me across the house may i reply to him <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether he is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i was trying to do <e> <s> may i ask the noble viscount who answered my question whether he is aware that i have received correspondence from people living in the neighbourhood of sellafield who are very concerned about their health and the health of their children and the suggestion that there is no concern for anything other than jobs in cumbria is simply untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that britain france germany the united states and other countries assisted the iraqis by providing them with arms during their war with iran <e> <s> did that assistance include any form of nuclear technology or devices that could be used in the building of nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl recall that just yesterday he stated in answer to a question about iraq that it was essential that britain should retain its own nuclear weapons <e> <s> if that is the case can he answer the question asked by my noble friend lord jenkins <e> <s> what are the government doing not thinking but doing about implementing that article of the non-proliferation treaty which insists that nuclear disarmament is an essential part of that treaty <e> <s> what are the government doing about that <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount tell the house what are the present figures of manufacturing output for this year in comparison to those when the government took office in <e> <s> can he also say how those figures compare with those of our major competitors namely germany france japan and the rest of the oecd countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the matter but i asked the minister for a comparison between now and years ago in not between now and five years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that in the past quarter the volume of exports from this country fell by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an answer to my question <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that during the last quarter the total volume of exports from this country fell by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the minister to the front bench <e> <s> however i express some regret that my former combatant who is sitting near the woolsack appears to have left the fray <e> <s> the noble lord has missed the point of my question <e> <s> i asked him directly to separate from the figures with which he has been supplied the research and development money provided by the government for nuclear energy and that provided for renewables such as wind wave and thermal power and the other forms of renewables which the government have admitted are important in order to provide a variety of generating sources for electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister not give the simple breakdown of what rd money is provided for nuclear energy and what is provided for renewable energy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell his noble friend behind him that the scope for renewables far from being exaggerated has been greatly underplayed not least because renewables have been under the thumb of the atomic energy lobby <e> <s> i know that the noble lord has not had time to look at the matter that i am about to refer to in detail <e> <s> however will he look at what happened to the research in this country on wave energy that was carried out in but was then abandoned and taken up successfully by other countries <e> <s> will the minister look particularly at the work of professor salter of edinburgh university which has been in cold storage in this country for eight years and yet has been successfully employed elsewhere <e> <s> finally will the minister look at the figures he has given and ask himself and perhaps some of his noble honourable and right honourable friends whether this country is moving towards a bright and green future when it spends million on research and development in the nuclear field every year and only million on research into renewables <e>", "<cs> my lords the niceties have passed to and fro and i do not dissent from any of them <e> <s> i offer my condolences to the noble baroness who has been thrown in at the deep end here and who has conducted herself with intelligence at times with wit and always with great courtesy <e> <s> however we are dealing with a bill <e> <s> this is the time when we have the responsibility of expressing our opinions about the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord answer the question which the noble lord lord mayhew has just put <e> <s> in the statement the foreign secretary says that he made it plain that it was the continued policy of her majestys government to support self-determination for the palestinians in the occupied territories <e> <s> does that mean that the british government do or do not support the concept of a separate palestinian state <e> <s> further to that point i understand that the luncheon for the foreign secretary and the palestinian representatives was cancelled because of what the foreign secretary held to be a misrepresentation of what he had said at a meeting with a number of israelis <e> <s> that interpretation was broadcast on israeli television at nine oclock in the evening before the day of the luncheon <e> <s> can the minister say what the british diplomats in tel aviv and the foreign secretarys entourage were doing if they did not bring that statement to the notice of the foreign secretary so that he could contradict it if he had been falsely reported <e> <s> i ask the minister to answer those two questions <e> <s> does self-determination include the right to a separate palestinian state <e> <s> what were the details concerning the cancellation of the luncheon with the palestinian representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that point surely the minister should say either that self-determination includes the formation of a palestinian state if the palestinians so desire or else that e does not know the answer that he will find it and will then write to us <e>", "<cs> my lords that is hardly an answer to the question <e> <s> i am asking what is the governments attitude <e> <s> is it not the case that over the previous two years the wage settlement in the electricity industry has been well above the inflation rate <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that it is expected that in the next agreement it will again be well above the inflation rate <e> <s> is that not connected directly with the governments desire to privatise the electricity industry and avoid trouble while that privatisation is being conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not suggesting that the government are going to take part in a settlement <e> <s> i ask again what is the governments attitude <e> <s> they have expressed their attitude towards wage settlements in a large number of industries <e> <s> they have expressed their attitude towards wage settlements generally and have urged settlements to be kept below the level of inflation <e> <s> what is their attitude towards a settlement in the electricity industry in view of the fact that that is very clearly linked directly to the privatisation of that industry <e>", "<cs> my lords so now we know <e> <s> after all the hype all the rhetoric all the months of labour we find in the gracious speech the one tiny sentence <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will forgive me <e> <s> can she say why at the geneva conference last week the british government refused to agree with the rest of the ec members to make the year the objective for freezing and to promise that there would be cuts not just freezing by the year <e> <s> would it not be part of the governments attempt to put their rhetoric into practice if they agreed on those target dates with the rest of the european community <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will answer the middle part of the question to which he has not yet addressed himself <e> <s> is it the objective of her majestys government through the united nations to restore the particular regime that was in kuwait at the time of the iraqi invasion <e> <s> alternatively are there any moves to make a more democratic regime acceptable and for that regime to be reinstated after the withdrawal of the iraqi forces <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the noble earl somewhat ambiguous in his reply to my question <e> <s> who does he consider to be the rightful owners of kuwait <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the minister correctly he said to applause from the benches behind that manufacturing output had been at a record level in the third quarter of this year <e> <s> is it not the case that manufacturing output in the third quarter was down per cent <e> <s> on that for the second quarter of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that he was answering on behalf of the government <e> <s> may i sincerely ask him to look again at his figures and come back to the house when he has confirmed them <e> <s> as i understood the position he admitted to me that manufacturing output has fallen by over per cent <e> <s> in the third quarter over the second quarter of this year <e> <s> i understand that those are government figures not dependent on the <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures given by the noble viscount demonstrate that when the

is it not the case that since the abolition of the national dock labour scheme over dockers more than half the labour force have been declared redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords i return to the first question that i put to the noble viscount <e> <s> is it not the case as the figures he has given to the house show that the actual cost of the abolition of the scheme is five times the figure given to parliament by the government when the bill was debated <e> <s> is that not in line with the governments cavalier attitude towards statistics <e> <s> does not the noble viscount now agree that parliament was misled when the bill abolishing the scheme was debated in this house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of that <e> <s> does the noble baroness recall that on th november when she answered part of the debate on the gracious speech she said <e>", "<cs> my lords two points arise from the response of the noble baroness <e> <s> first the figure which she gave
