for example is weighed up and a proper balance established <e>", "<cs> is it in order for me to ask the noble lord who is speaking for the government about a matter of general principle <e> <s> in the course of his valuable remarks he mentioned an absolute sum which the government have in mind <e> <s> may i inquire whether the government propose with year after year of inflation to alter that

viscount lord eccles <e> <s> but i should like to give a personal explanation as to why if the committee is divided i shall vote with the government on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree in respect of the vessels to which he made allusion that in technical language they would be classified as unrequited exports <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree with me

financial situation and the benefits and losses accrued therefrom <e> <s> but there are i think a substantial majority of those of us who have worked in universities who regard this discrimination as morally shabby <e> <s> if i may be permitted to quote in one sentence the thought that goes through my head i should have been ashamed if in the mid-thirties when dr emminger did the london school of economics the honour of registering there i had had to say to him since you come from germany i am obliged to charge you a higher price than someone who comes from eton <e>", "<cs> my lords without in any sense subscribing to the pure milk of extreme monetarism i ask the minister to confirm my belief that no major inflation has taken place without an increase in the money supply <e> <s> may i ask him secondly to indicate the relation between the money rate of interest now proposed and the prospective real rate of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to make a brief contribution to this debate may i make things clear as regards two questions which i am not going to argue <e> <s> first i am not going to argue against any cuts in real grants to higher education in general <e> <s> in

present rate of inflation and the present rate of productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord confirm my impression that there are wide sections of restrictive practices which do not fall under the definitions in this bill and would he say whether or not he regrets their omission <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand the noble lord to say that he wishes all restrictive practices to be brought under this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that this country would be better placed if for the last few years it had had let us say the swiss system of national militia <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting but would the noble lord not agree that the property boom which arose at the time of the heath government was a direct by-product of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to disagree at all with the minister in the catalogue of reasons which he has just recited may i ask whether he would agree with me that there is a reason which has not been mentioned on either side of the house but which certainly contributes to the growing apprehension with regard to the volume of imports in general namely the probable over-valuation of the pound sterling which is a circumstance which is not due to either party and is partly due to the success of north sea oil and partly due to the inflow of capital <e>", "<cs> without entering into controversy at all on the noble lords main point may i ask him whether he can quantify the effect which successive attempts to control prices have had on the retail price index <e>", "<cs> as usual i am in complete agreement with the noble baroness that prices have risen but i submit that my question as to whether the price commission had exercised quantitative and significant restraint on the increase in prices which in my opinion has since the beginning of the seventies been due to both parties was very down-to-earth <e> <s> i think that the rise in prices on which the noble baroness and i are in complete agreement is due to factors other than the existence or the non-existence of a price commission <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree with me that the attitude of her majestys government would be substantially reinforced if the precise figures for which the noble baroness asked in her original question could be made available to the house in some sort of synoptic

excellent impartial and clear teacher <e> <s> i formed a friendship with him then and in spite of many differences of opinion on public affairs we remained intimately friendly until his death <e> <s> i am quite sure that he would wish something of the amendment to be part of the bill <e> <s> in the latter part of his life i am reasonably sure that he regarded the setting up of the land fund as being probably the thing in which he took the most lasting pride <e> <s> it seems to me that since we are all agreed or i hope we are all agreed that this was a good thing to do we should commemorate it in words which would commend themselves to the founder <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord please bring me up to date <e> <s> he referred to modern practice <e> <s> at what stage did that practice come into being <e> <s> is it not the case as the noble lord lord reigate urged that the trustees of the british museum are appointed by the prime minister <e> <s> is it not the case that the trustees of the national gallery are also appointed by the prime minister <e>", "<cs> i have no objection whatever to handbooks <e> <s> i agree with what has been said regarding the utility of the handbooks

hesitation with regard to the suggestion of the noble lord lord wells-pestell that this amendment be delayed until an agreed syllabus is devised <e> <s> i do not deny the desirability of some consensus in this respect but from my acquaintance with the literature i would have thought that it might be the greek kalends until a syllabus acceptable to the majority were elaborated <e> <s> in the meantime there are these horrific tendencies doubtless on the part of a small minority which are prevalent and of which examples have been quoted this afternoon <e> <s> to me the important part of this amendment which may or may not be capable of legal improvement is the suggestion that where deliberate sex education is given parents should be advised and should have access to the type of education contemplated <e> <s> that seems to me to be a subject which brooks no delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support the noble lord who has just spoken in what he has said <e>

regard to the administrative arrangements in whitehall that any particular minister need be informed as regards the implications of this all-embracing bill <e> <s> i am reminded in this connection of

secretary of the ministry of agriculture and saidall ministries of agriculture are a little bit of a racket arent they <e>", "<cs> my lords i deeply regret that i have lowered myself in respect of the noble lord lord cledwyn <e> <s> i do not intend to say anything in my defence save to point out that some of the deepest problems with which the world economy and the european economy are now confronted flow from the extravagant petting given to agriculture <e> <s> i speak and i am proud to do so as the son of a farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords in this difficult semantic problem i feel some considerable sympathy with the noble lord lord mowbray <e> <s> it seems to me that as regards legal documents and letter headings the national heritage memorial fundis a suitable title <e> <s> i cannot believe that in ordinary speech it will be referred to as other than theheritage fund <e> <s> but that does not seem to me to matter very much <e> <s> the important thing is the legal status and the letter headings <e> <s> as regards the letter headings on the whole i think that it is rather more important and conveys exactly what your lordships have wished to be the spirit of the bill throughout <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the existing ministerial hierarchy and the relationships of the persons concerned i am inclined to agree with what has been urged by the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton but i would ask the noble lord in his other capacity of being mixed up from time to time with the usual channels whether in the event of responsibility for the arts departing from the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster whoever he may be at the time an alteration could be made in the legal position nullifying this reference in the bill <e>", "<cs> that was not my intention my lords <e> <s> my intention was simply to ask whether if responsibility for the arts ceased to adhere to the chancellorship of the duchy of lancaster an amending bill could be rushed through in order that the rest of the measure should not be illegally orientated <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my complete agreement with the noble baroness lady macleod <e> <s> this

the doubts expressed by the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede <e> <s> on the other hand i cannot believe that it is in the minds of members of the government to do anything injudicious <e> <s> but in between those points of view there is surely a degree of ambiguity which if it could be surmounted would be an advantage to the bill <e> <s> in the end i would humbly submit that the word appropriate involves the securing of what is reasonably to be regarded as the maximum present value and it seems to me to be desirable that in some way or other that should be hinted at in the bill

of associations of producers and their rights in a free society <e> <s> i hope therefore that noble lords will bear with me if before coming to the specific object of the bill i allow myself to reflect a little on these fundamental issues <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree with me that the present height of the exchange rate is due to a complex of circumstances some of which must be regarded as favourable for instance the unexpected bonus of north sea oil and the natural expectations of investors at large with regard to that bonus <e> <s> would he further agree that on top of that there is a tendency to maintain or raise the present rate of interest which is more ambiguous in that it is caused by the attraction of hot money by the present height of the interest rates <e>
