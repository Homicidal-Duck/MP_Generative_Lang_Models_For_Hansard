["<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of state for social security and the disabled visited the peto institute in september last year and my honourable friend the minister of education and health at the scottish office also visited the institute in february this year <e> <s> the hungarian government propose to develop an international centre at the peto institute in order to meet increasing overseas demand and to spread the philosophy of conductive education internationally <e> <s> in december last year they put forward formal proposals for united kingdom collaboration in the international centre <e> <s> discussions on these proposals are continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords negotiations with the european commission on the draft directive which includes equalisation of pension age continue <e> <s> we shall of course have regard to the report of the select committee of this house which was chaired by the noble lord on <e>", "<cs> my lords following discussions with mencap we are looking again at the data from the opcs disability surveys in order to refine the global estimates quoted during debates on the noble lords amendments to the recent social security bill <e> <s> the opcs data show that there are about severely mentally handicapped people and the indications are that the definition adopted in his question will include a substantially larger number of them than the quoted in support of the amendment on mobility allowance during debates on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the institute of fiscal studies has produced figures which overstate the numbers with low living standards by assuming that those living in the same household do not share their resources <e> <s> in virtually all households the people living together are closely related <e> <s> it is unreasonable to assume that young adults living in the parental home or elderly relatives living with their sons or daughters do not share in the general living standards of the household <e> <s> by presenting figures on personal incomes the institute for fiscal studies has overstated the numbers with low living standards by approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady faithfull met with my right honourable friends the secretary of state for social security and the minister of state for social security on th october to follow up the agreement of my noble friend lord skelmersdale to a meeting with voluntary organisations representing homeless young people <e> <s> arrangements are being made for such a meeting which will take place shortly <e> <s> there are already arrangements for regular meetings between officials of the department and other government departments and representatives of the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords data for the financial year ending st march are not yet available <e> <s> in the financial year ending st march million in-patient cases were treated in nhs hospitals in the united kingdom <e> <s> the average daily number of available beds was <e>", "<cs> my lords expenditure on benefits for long-term sick and disabled people has increased in cash terms from billion in to billion in <e> <s> in real terms that is an increase of billion <e>", "<cs> my lords approximately existing pensioners immediately stood to benefit when the retirement pension earnings related rule was abolished on st <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security has said that the activities of the occupational pensions advisory service need to be funded more securely <e> <s> we are actively considering how best to achieve that <e>", "<cs> my lords the funds overall balance remains in surplus <e> <s> the government actuary estimates this as billion that is per cent <e> <s> of annual expenditure on benefits and twice his recommended minimum <e> <s> there is though a declining balance in the fund <e> <s> incentives paid to individuals to encourage take up of personal pensions amount to approximately per cent <e> <s> of fund income <e>", "<cs> my lords spending on social security has increased from billion in to billion in a real terms increase of per cent <e> <s> the estimated expenditure for is billion <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords this year million households are receiving rate rebates and million claimants in scotland are receiving community charge rebates <e> <s> housing benefit for rent goes to million tenants most of whom also receive rate or community charge rebates <e>", "<cs> my lords individuals who choose to take out a personal pension are made aware that the amount that they will receive at retirement is dependent on the level of investment return achieved by the companies <e> <s> after retirement part of the pension must be increased each year by the rate of price increases up to per cent <e> <s> if prices rise by more than per cent <e> <s> an addition is added to the individuals state retirement pension <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the policy of her majestys government to encourage personal savings which investors will retain for some time <e> <s> longer term savings of this kind help to reduce the level of consumer spending in the economy <e> <s> premium bonds can be repaid virtually on demand and therefore do not contribute to this aim <e>", "<cs> i was not going to intervene on this amendment <e> <s> i start by repeating as i believe members of the government always do our neutrality on the issue of abortion <e> <s> i take the opportunity of repeating that again this evening <e> <s> perhaps i may pick up on one or two points particularly those made by the noble lord lord ennals and then developed by the noble lord lord rea and the noble lord lord mcgregor <e>", "<cs> my lords a letter was sent to all dss offices on the day of the judgment advising social fund officers that the local office budget and the level of priority that might usually be met are only factors to be taken into account in reaching a decision and that the state of the local office budget is not the overriding factor <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state intends to issue revised guidance shortly which will take into account the courts decision <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting and enlightening debate and i am sure that all noble lords will join me in thanking the noble lord lord carter for giving the house an opportunity to discuss the subject <e> <s> in his speech he fantasised somewhat about the policies that his party would pursue should it ever be returned to office <e> <s> i think i should say that that is a very unlikely eventuality <e> <s> it is all too easy to make promises when in opposition and it is all too easy to gloss over the cost of that profligacy <e> <s> the difference is that unlike the noble lords party we have a record of action and achievement <e> <s> it is a record as i intend to point out in the few short minutes that i have of creating wealth and spreading it more widely than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords the contribution of the mortgage interest payments component to the annual rate of increase in the retail prices index in january was percentage points <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that government policies towards serps have the effect which the noble lords question suggests <e> <s> we have always attached a high priority to protecting the interests of elderly people and will continue to do so <e> <s> nevertheless we have recognised that not all pensioners have benefited from the growth in occupational pensions and have targeted an extra million towards million individuals the older disabled and less well-off pensioners on income support and housing benefit <e> <s> also in october last year we abolished the retirement pensions earnings rule so that pensioners can now draw their pension in full while continuing to work if they wish to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government draw on a wide range of information including demographic factors in considering the implications of the elderly population on the economy <e> <s> many other sources of valuable information including the general household survey the family expenditure survey and the occupational pension scheme survey contribute to the governments appreciation of this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of state for social security and the disabled announced on rd april that provided he could reach agreement with the funds trustees on a sensible limiting of the scope of the fund a further million would be made available for the current year <e> <s> this would bring the provision to million for - an increase of a third in the current years allocation and a more than sixfold increase in the resources originally envisaged for the fund <e> <s> my right honourable friend has had a preliminary discussion with the trustees following this announcement and is now awaiting their considered response <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lords lord winstanley and lord monkswell that we shall not be throwing away the valuable experience of existing members of family <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by apologising to the noble lords lord harris and lord bruce for the absence of my noble friend the paymaster general <e> <s> as noble lords are probably aware he is at the ecofin council today and sadly is unable to be here <e> <s> i should stress as my noble friends from these benches stressed earlier that all noble lords speaking from the dispatch box speak on behalf of the government <e> <s> the fact that my noble friend is absent is not necessarily relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords a tariff income from savings is taken into account when assessing claims for community charge benefit <e> <s> no income is assumed to be received for savings under <e> <s> for every or part thereof of capital between and a weekly income of is assumed <e> <s> the tariff income rules do not assume any particular level of interest on savings <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord ennals said this is our second opportunity to discuss more generally national health service trusts <e> <s> i say that it is our second opportunity because they were discussed to some extent and in some detail at second reading <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to treat fund holders differently from non-fund holders <e> <s> i see no reason why we should make special provisions for fund holders particularly as the government believe that the practice funding is likely to enhance the quality of service for patients <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can give the noble lord the assurance that he asked for <e> <s> perhaps i may begin by giving him some figures <e> <s> he mentioned his latest figure <e> <s> my latest figure for joint finance resources for - is million <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will give way it may be convenient if i intervene at this moment to put the governments case <e> <s> i hope to speak again at the end of the debate and reply to many of the points that members of the committee have made <e> <s> before i begin i should emphasise that amendments nos <e> <s> ah and aj are separate amendments and are grouped with amendment no <e> <s> al <e> <s> we are obviously speaking to the two together but it would not necessarily follow that if the first one were agreed to the second one goes with it <e> <s> they require separate decisions <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i did not catch the name of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government attach a high priority to protecting the interests of elderly people <e> <s> in particular the state retirement pension is uprated annually in line with the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of the headline rpi figure united kingdom inflation was per cent <e> <s> in april compared with an average of per cent <e> <s> in other oecd countries in march <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the amendment is probably just a probing amendment <e> <s> however i should say that i think it goes slightly further than i expect the noble lord intends in that as he receives payment for those services it would as worded have the undesirable effect of preventing a doctor using his practice leaflet to promote several of the services he provides to his own patients under the national health service such as health promotion clinics and other services <e> <s> i am sure that was not the intention of the noble lord but i thought it would be worth pointing that out in replying to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government have made very clear their policy on joining the exchange rate mechanism <e> <s> there has been ample opportunity to discuss the policy in this house and in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have nothing to add to what i said on the third reading of the social security bill <e> <s> we are still considering the implications of a judgment that is unclear <e> <s> i should also emphasise that individual schemes should seek their own legal advice on each schemes individual circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments and reasons be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords the war pensions scheme provides for pensions where there is reliable evidence which raises a reasonable doubt that a condition is caused or aggravated by service or that death was due to or substantially hastened by service <e> <s> it is accepted that the evidence raises such a doubt in the case of participants in the united kingdom nuclear weapons test programme who have contracted leukaemia excluding chronic lymphatic leukaemia or multiple myeloma the condition from which mr fazackerley died <e> <s> any claim to a war pension by such servicemen or their widows is therefore likely to succeed <e> <s> consequently a review of decisions on claims for war pension as a result of the coroners decision in the case of the late mr walter fazackerley is unnecessary <e> <s> i am pleased to advise my noble friend that a war widows pension has been awarded to mrs fazackerley <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble kinsman mentioned his fear that he might be hanged if the motion were defeated <e> <s> i remind him of a historical fact of interest <e> <s> a forbear of mine was ennobled in order that he could preside over the trial of a forbear of my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> sadly the trial resulted in the hanging of my noble friends forbear <e> <s> i hope that my noble kinsman will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> the government have no plans to authorise hiv tests on surgical patients without their consent <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already recognised the moral and compassionate arguments mentioned by mr justice ognall through their ex-gratia payments totalling about million <e> <s> this money has been made available help all hiv-infected haemophiliacs and not just those involved in litigation <e> <s> we are committed to keeping the needs of all those infected haemophiliacs and their families under review <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement on the up-rating of social security benefits being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for social security <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> ah my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there are no simple means by which an individual national government can resolve uncertainties to which particular european court judgments give rise <e>
