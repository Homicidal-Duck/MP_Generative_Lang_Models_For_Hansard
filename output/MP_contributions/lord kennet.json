follow not only the last speech by itself of which i think much more will be heard in the ensuing weeks but to follow both the last speech and lord hill-nortons because when a great sailor and a great

i cannot believe that even the shipping industry itself would disagree with very much that has been said this evening or indeed in our last debate on sea mismanagement or in either of the other two debates which the noble lord lord buxton has initiated <e> <s> if it had disagreed with what was said no doubt it would have found noble lords to voice its disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> <e> <s> my lords the noble lord has actually left the point i had in mind and i should be very grateful for an opportunity to interrogate him <e> <s> he said that

only one that has ever been deployed on the soil of this country and it was dual key <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl was exemplary in his brevity in introducing this bill and i think we all recognise that the search for brevity has compelled him to refrain from mentioning some of the background of united nations politics which must affect the judgment of the government and of parliament

should like to say a few words before the minister contributes his last word <e> <s> would not the noble lord lord campbell of croy agree that the fact that the american legislation which was passed

declaration of the legal position of the group of which simply says that they will not recognise any such legislation as we have before us now <e> <s> it has already had that effect <e> <s> they deny the validity of the american german british <e>", "<cs> the argument that it is a mistake to believe that the political interests of the developed and developing worlds are contrary is one which we fully accept <e> <s> of course they are not contrary they are complimentary and they must work together and serve each other <e> <s> but it seems to me that that argument would tend towards supporting the passing of the amendment and not having an artificially low rate of levy on national legislation in the meantime <e> <s> it is not an argument for antagonising the third world which is what this bill is going to do and what the american legislation has already done <e> <s> i listened hopefully to hear whether the minister was going to say that he would give it another thought or talk to anyone else about it but he was quite categorical that he was not <e> <s> that being so i think i will ask my noble friends to join with me in opposing what is proposed by the government and in passing this amendment if we can <e>", "<cs> i think it both wise and charming of the minister to revert to his usual ways on this one <e> <s> will he remember while he is thinking about it and talking about it to his colleagues that the prisons are bursting at the seams and will he resist all temptation to rectify the balance by making the directors of the companies liable to imprisonment

inappropriate to the present political juncture and i can save the house and myself a great deal of time by saying that i found the speech of the noble lord lord mcnair extremely constructive well-thought and well-judged <e>", "<cs> my lords before we say goodbye to the bill could i make two or three remarks to the government about it <e> <s> this is a bill which many people think the

lords in view of the fact that seven years work has been put into the draft treaty by nations and that it is not only deep sea mining which is at stake but everything which is done at sea in view of the obvious damage to british interests if it does not come into effect and in view of the fact that the commonwealth groups consist of both developed and undeveloped nations and that the leadership of the undeveloped nations in this conference seems to have devolved upon singapore a commonwealth country would the government go one step further and now give to the house in public a favourable aye to the idea of a commonwealth initiative to be mounted in the first place by canada britain and singapore to bring the new american administration <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the plea made by the noble lord lord melchett i rise for one minute because the noble baroness lady white took us back to the remote days of when it was my responsibility to present the countryside act to this house <e>

with everything that has been said in this last and most pleasant function of the house before christmas <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper

weapons are highly strategic to those upon whom they may land <e> <s> can the noble viscount undertake that in their publications and official utterances from now on the british government will use the new nomenclature namely identifying the system by range <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a couple of specific questions about the inquiry <e> <s> can the government yet tell us whether there will be expert assessors on the engineering and nuclear side sitting with sir frank layfield <e> <s> if so are the government in a position to announce who they will be <e> <s> that question is not of course intended to be in any way derogatory to the inspector of the inquiry <e> <s> my second question is about the admissibility of evidence at the inquiry <e> <s> will it be permitted to raise the question whether a pressurised water reactor is in fact the best type to use as opposed to an advanced gas-cooled reactor <e> <s> thirdly will evidence based on matters concerning the accident at three mile island in the united states be admitted bearing in mind that this is the only major accident which has ever happened to a pressurised water reactor and therefore the only one relevant to the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two questions on the cap <e> <s> can the noble lord say what would be the size of our deficit in three or four years time if the refund was phased out as we are trying to avoid <e> <s> is it still of the same order of magnitude as when the trouble started <e> <s> would it not be possible to cast these differences between ourselves and the others less in terms of britain <e>", "<cs> once thrice and nine times before doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness the leader of the house <e> <s> my last question was about the council taking parliament to court within the first two years of its directly-elected life <e> <s> it would be worth going a long way to avoid that if it can be avoided <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government confirm that the united states have postponed indefinitely the opening of the other set of disarmament talks on strategic arms reductions <e> <s> if so will the noble lord most urgently convey to washington the opinion which i hope is the opinion of this house that if that postponement is other than temporary and tactical a very great deal would be lost to mankind <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount confirm <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that at present there are no american nuclear weapons in this country and that if the geneva talks on intermediate range nuclear missiles come to a fortunate conclusion it may be possible that there never need be <e>", "<cs> my lords my question was related to missiles <e> <s> i think the house is aware of the aeroplanes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord in a position to give the house any news of the probable date when the strategic arms reduction talks will begin <e> <s> which have been delayed by the united states as a result of events in poland <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were legislating i should have to declare an interest but even though we are not i shall tell your lordships

house in london opening and my pitcairn cousins coming in <e> <s> they seemed to me very large which was natural because i was very small and very numerous which was natural because it was a small house and i think there were seven or eight of them and very black which was also natural because i think they were the only coloured people i had at that time seen in my familys house in london <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend i wish to associate the social democrat peers with what has been said <e> <s> we salute in lord butler not only the founder of our education system but also the master <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are being both careful and clever in this negotiation and in their presentation of it <e> <s> it seems to me that good negotiation has led to an advantageous deal particularly as there is the prospect of much more work for this country than there was in the polaris programme and a much higher proportion of the work will be for both american and british forces <e> <s> for this the government would be congratulated if we wanted the product <e> <s> however advantageous though the government cannot be congratulated on a deal which obtains a product which we do not need <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of the equipment budget at the peak is pretty high <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i have got the custom of the house wrong <e>

this vertical proliferation with a vengeance <e> <s> is it not time for governments to cease acting unilaterally in the political sense in these vast defence purchases and to take i do not say other parties but the house of commons into their confidence at an earlier stage which was not done on this occasion thereby decreasing the risk of inflicting cancellations at a later stage which can only be unwelcome to the armed forces <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say anything to the house about the soviet attitude towards the united nations study of the possibility of the reduction of military budgets on both sides <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government look again at their own wording in this statement perhaps later today <e> <s> will they put themselves in the position of a british firm and see whether the sentence british firms must decide what action they should take and <e>", "<cs> my lords the social democratic party peers would like to join those who have already congratulated the noble lord lord belstead on his new appointment and we wish him well in that office <e> <s> may i ask whether the government are aware that leaving aside the question of failures of intelligence appreciation before the invasion we on this bench fully support the action which has now been taken by the government <e> <s> we agree that the aim must be to regain for the falklanders the right of self-determination which they have always enjoyed until this invasion <e> <s> do the government agree that the way to achieve this is to seek that combination of external forces acting upon the argentine authorities which will induce them to withdraw their troops with the smallest amount of renewed bloodshed and if possible with none <e> <s> do the government think that a contingent of united nations observers to supervise that withdrawal during which the british task force could stand off would be a useful arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords history is often written behind our backs and that which is written behind our backs is not always bad <e> <s> whatever the outcome of the confrontation with argentina itself there has already been a bit of good history written in the

will thank him no less for his own careful and extremely constructive speech <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would be so very good as to say something about one point which has been mentioned in the debate but which he did not touch on namely the international red cross <e> <s> is it not the case that article of the fourth geneva convention would allow the international red cross if invited by the relevant parties to set up safety zones in a zone of combat which may or may not be a zone of declared war and to administer those zones <e> <s> and is it

countries backed us first and have undertaken visible economic sacrifice in so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords today we lament our dead as yesterday we lamented theirs <e> <s> would the house be about right in thinking that the number of dead on both sides is now approaching one-quarter of the number of the falkland islanders and that the number of fighting men down there whose lives are at risk is about ten times the number of the falkland islanders <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister aware that we on this bench are in sympathy with all that he has said <e> <s> the destruction of the luxembourg compromise can only be a sad day for the community <e> <s> are we not right in thinking that it does mean that the nightmare of many of those who strongly favoured british membership of the

hoping that we shall hear from him often again on this subject and on others both wider and narrower <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government confirm the mass of evidence that alcoholism is now the most rapidly-growing social problem in this country that it is alcohol that causes alcoholism and that therefore there is no shred of justification for taxing alcoholic drinks on any basis other than their alcohol content <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this rumpus very briefly at statement time last week i shared the view then being advanced by the noble earl lord ferrers for the government that what had happened was very dreadful and a great danger and i think that we both used the term that we faced a nightmare <e> <s> however after a time for reflection i have come to the conclusion that this country probably has much to learn from the episode <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the noble lords idea <e> <s> i just wanted to clarify how he saw it and as i understand it it is then to be a gloss on a gloss <e> <s> it is a better way of working the luxembourg compromise which was a better way of working the treaty <e> <s> i think that with that explanation it is easy to endorse <e> <s> if this is followed it will be a commonsense way of proceeding and it will make eruptions like those of last week less likely and for that reason i think it should be examined in a very positive frame of mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on answering so many of the great mass of questions asked by the previous two speakers <e> <s> i have only two one of which is rhetorical and i will put that first <e> <s> is it not clearer every day that the only wise course in this world at the moment is to obey the relevant united nations resolutions and that argentina must withdraw from the falklands and israel must withdraw from the lebanon <e> <s> secondly may i ask the leader of the house to comment on the distinction between unconditional surrender which it seemed to me the leader of the labour opposition was accusing the government of demanding and simple departure <e> <s> is there not a great distinction between on the one hand putting up a white flag seeing your soldiers rounded up having them processed put into different clothes and taken away in the enemys ships which is surrender and in the case of the simple departure sailing away in your own ships in your own uniform in your own time and in a dignified manner <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches associate ourselves with what has been said about the loss of life on this occasion and of course respect the reasons why the government do not wish to specify in any detail the extent of what appears to have been a rather grave setback <e> <s> the noble viscount is always very generous in giving the house information about what are strictly foreign office affairs as well and <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government tell us whether any of the existing obscenity laws affects cable

government to return any prisoner of war until the cessation of hostilities but that astiz was returned before the cessation of hostilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord describe to the house what then is the status of the heads of agreement between the united kingdom and guatemala of

will the government undertake not to withdraw the british garrison in belize until both we and belize are absolutely certain that belize is safe <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord draw a distinction between appropriateness and certainty of safety <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government look again at their proclaimed unwillingness to have our independent nuclear forces considered in any of these disarmament talks in view of the fact that in a year or twos time the british and french independent nuclear deterrents taken together will amount to no less than one-quarter of the number of warheads of the american nuclear deterrent forces <e>", "<cs> my lords in considering the new fishery agreement will the government remember that this long and tragic saga came about because the existing countries adopted a common fishery policy which was unacceptable to us just before we joined <e> <s> will the government draw the obvious moral that the new common fisheries policy ought to be acceptable to spain and portugal both major fishing powers so that when they join they do not have to wait years to get something they can accept

convention which would legitimate such an action on their part <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say which of our cocom partners is resisting liberalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say anything about whether the government share the hope which i think is universal throughout the house that the reported interview has been correctly understood in this question and that yasser arafat means that that he will continue to mean it and that all the other people in the plo will continue to mean it <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked whether the noble lord shared what i assumed to be the general hope in the house that the interview was genuine and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government note that venezuela also claims that trinidad is draining off venezuelan oil under the seas

layman and as a recent member of the redundant churches fund to which i should add by way of sketching in the background that my wife is a current member of the redundant churches advisory board <e>

unlikely without progress in the other and that both concern this country crucially <e>", "<cs> my lords while the whole house will clearly wish to join the government in their good wishes for the

indemnity has been issued to back a bis bridging loan and since the amount is just about equal to the amount of mexican capital which has left that country in the last year or two for the purchase of

taken it upon himself which he need not have done to defend the imf in this matter will he take a look at tanzanian history and see whether the government really think that tanzania is a worse bet

all could the leader of the house be a little more specific about relations between the new falkland islands development agency and the falkland islands company <e> <s> after all as the noble lord lord cledwyn has told us the falkland islands company is a minor part of a large conglomerate which has twice been asset-stripped and is not even quoted on the market <e> <s> it is therefore i take it quite easy for the falkland islands company not to respond to overtures to purchase land on the open market and on the open market is the phrase used in the governments statement <e> <s> it is in fact easy for such a minor part of a <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the statement also among the social democrat peers <e> <s> we think that on the whole it is a sensible statement <e> <s> two questions arise immediately <e> <s> the first concerns the stockpile <e> <s> if we have learned from the falklands campaign something which we did not know before about the importance of stockpiles is that something applicable only to campaigns such as the falklands <e> <s> is it not also applicable to operations in the nato area and in the latter case is the million increase in the stockpile to apply only to the falklands circumstances and why-is there no corresponding nato increase <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government consider the following proposal for breaking the deadlock on data forget all about our present differences on how many men each side has pull an equal number out of the hat which undoubtedly will be below the number on the lower side agree to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it was on th july that we said we would watch with interest the continuing development of this titanic struggle between the two great traditional parties one entrenched at central level and the other entrenched in some of the most powerful local authorities in the country <e> <s> todays instalment has been a breathtaking one <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord the minister to give the house a few more details of how many authorities are going to suffer from the holdback at the higher rate at the p rate equivalent <e> <s> can he tell us what kind of authorities they are <e> <s> it would also be instructive for the house if we could be told what political colour those authorities belong to how many labour how many conservative and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is so <e> <s> how does the minister know that the holdback is going to be million <e>", "<cs> i do not want to burden the noble earl with too many questions but i think it would help the committee to come to a conclusion about what it thinks about the amendment before it if he could answer one more which arises out of sub-paragraph and sub-paragraph of paragraph that is the two subsections on either side and which is part of the question of the status of the commission <e> <s> however if the noble earl thinks that the question would be better put on the later motion that this be schedule to the bill i will repeat it then <e> <s> the question is this <e> <s> how is one to reconcile the statement in sub-paragraph of paragraph that <e>", "<cs> the answer given by the noble earl lord avon shows that the commission is being launched upon the legislature without very much thought behind it <e> <s> may i say with all modesty that i do not think many governments modest in my criticism though i intend to be would think of launching a <e>", "<cs> we support the noble baronesss amendment <e>", "<cs> we too obviously support this amendment <e> <s> it stands on its own feet as good reasoning <e> <s> i would not go quite as far as the noble lord lord sandford in his uncritical enthusiasm for the role of local government in the preservation of our heritage <e> <s> he asked many pertinent questions about where should we be if it had not been for the city council and the county council in york <e> <s> one might equally ask what would the coast of cornwall have looked like had it not been for the cornish county council <e> <s> what for instance would the future of beverley have been if there had never been such a thing as the beverley district council <e> <s> what would the centres of for example worcester poole or peterborough look like now if it had not been for the interventions of the relevant local government units in the past <e>", "<cs> before the movers of this amendment make up their minds what to do may i urge upon them that they should lean in whatever way they think best <e> <s> we have here a very detailed list of the qualities which are to be represented on the commission namely archaeology architecture the history of architecture the preservation or conservation of monuments or buildings tourism commerce and <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is formally withdrawn may i ask the noble earl whether that is what he is saying <e>", "<cs> i would like to enter a word of caution <e> <s> here we come to the beginning of a series of amendments which continue with increasing tempo through the rest of the schedules and which tell the commission how to run its own business <e> <s> it seems to me that the sole advantage of this commission is that it will be conducting its own affairs free of the whitehall undergrowth and free of the sometimes deadening hand of ministerial and treasury control <e> <s> it seems inconceivable that the commission would not want to have outside committees to advise it <e> <s> if the secretary of state puts the right people on the commission and if we cannot trust him to do that we should not have a commission at all then they should be trusted to decide what committees they want <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment for the reasons given by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> i strongly endorse what the noble lord lord montagu said <e> <s> it is because of the impenetrability of schedule that obviously it was necessary to table the amendment if we had been able to understand the schedule the amendment would never have arisen <e> <s> and as what is incomprehensible to your lordships is probably incomprehensible to everybody would it not be wise to let the amendment stand or for the government to give an indication that they view it favourably as a possible improvement on the clause which will then be readily comprehensible to everyone <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl also bear in mind one other point that i think he did not mention just now <e> <s> it is the possibility that the commission itself might train craftsmen or finance their training where they are to be employed other than by the commission <e> <s> they might be employed by a local authority county trust or other body <e>", "<cs> in order that the commission have the power to do and to sponsor research i think it is essential that we should have the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that we on these benches think that now that france and germany have a fully-fledged and formalised arrangement for bilateral talks including defence it is extremely appropriate that the government should have bilateral contacts with france such as he has described <e> <s> can the noble viscount say anything to the house about the possibility or desirability of the two governments discussing together the dovetailing in time of their nuclear submarine patrols so that patrols go to sea under a joint anglo-french plan rather than without any pre-arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any code of practice that requires drivers to slow up when they see a bank of smoke on the road ahead <e>", "<cs> answering to this amendment the noble earl lord avon laid a good deal of weight on the possibility of publishing a guide <e> <s> he referred also to a forthcoming amendment amendment no <e> <s> to be moved by the noble lord lord sandford which it is true would throw further light on the definitions of the purposes of the proposed commission <e> <s> what it does not do is positively state the powers and duties of the commission <e> <s> it does not say anywhere that the commission shall have the power to do certain things or that it shall do certain things in certain circumstances <e> <s> in common with the noble lords earlier amendment which was an excellent one amendment no <e> <s> deals with the commissions general purposes and so it does not help <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving us a foretaste of possibilities to come if not of certainties <e> <s> can the noble earl say anything about the possibility of even now drafting a short clause giving the powers and duties of the commission because neither of the amendments of the noble lord lord sandford do that <e> <s> they simply set out the commissions general purposes <e> <s> it seems to me that it should not be beyond the wit of man to do what i ask <e> <s> if the noble earl will say that he will take a look at the possibility of drafting a positive clause between now and report stage then our present delays may disappear <e>", "<cs> i shall read those cloudy words with great care in <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the council of ministers in the position of any cabinet which has submitted its budget to the duly elected legislature and has seen its budget rejected <e> <s> must it not therefore take the step that any ordinary cabinet would take namely to devise another budget and resubmit it <e> <s> if it cannot agree on what should be in the second budget the government may remember that quite recently the rule of majority voting in the council of ministers was revived when it was revived it was done at our expense and it is surely not beyond the wit of man to imagine a coalition of members of the council who could simply vote down using the treaty of rome the minority which would oppose a sensible budget which the parliament desires which the government desire and which we on this bench desire <e>", "<cs> in supporting the remarks of the noble lord lord sandford i would ask a minor question about the amendment <e> <s> it states many good things that the commission should do but the one thing it does not state it should do is to conserve listed buildings and ancient monuments in england whereas the original clause stated exactly that <e> <s> i do not think i have overlooked anything but the single use of the word conservation seems to have gone out with the bath water <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak in favour of the word may <e> <s> it could be that the promoters of this amendment would also consider this <e> <s> the point of listing in the case of buildings is that once a building is listed nobody is allowed to destroy or harm it without permission <e> <s> i do not think there is anything in the bill i cannot be sure because i cannot understand the schedule which suggests that the new commission will have any function in advising the secretary of state on refusing or granting permission to demolish or harm historic gardens or landscapes <e> <s> it may be that the actual listing should not be begun until it is proposed to give such a power to the commission or to the secretary of state advised by the commission <e> <s> i do think there is a case for putting in a may clause now if only so that we do not have to come back and legislate all over again when it is judged that the time is ripe <e>", "<cs> the redundant churches fund receives a block grant to cover it for i think five years then it is left to get on with its work and it spends the money over the five years as it thinks fit not indeed on the acquisition of buildings but on their maintenance once acquired <e> <s> they come free to it and i imagine that in this case equally the buildings will come free to the commission <e> <s> no doubt their maintenance will cost some money but i do not think that the secretary of state would wish to have control over this or that little expenditure of to maintain historic buildings whether church or lay <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl will be so good as to look at that again in the light of this information <e>", "<cs> am i correct in thinking that in the light of the extra information that i was able to give him the noble earl is prepared to look at the possibility of deleting the secretary of states control in this respect if not in others <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i disagree with what the noble earl lord avon said about this being a major change in planning legislation <e> <s> i think that that is an exaggeration <e> <s> it is a minor change in planning legislation <e> <s> it does not affect who may give permission for what or when or on what grounds <e> <s> that is what i would call a major change <e> <s> it simply changes the area in respect of which certain people have to be informed about planning applications <e> <s> i would call it a minor change <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> they are really dealing with separate points and therefore i should prefer to deal with them separately <e>", "<cs> it is true that it would place a burden on local authorities if the amendment were adopted <e> <s> but if it is not adopted a burden is placed on the commission and that burden is the burden of looking at the roughest headline of an application and trying to guess whether it is about something on which they should have a view and then on the basis of that guess writing to the local authority asking for the authority to send them material which will enable them to decide whether they should have a view about it <e>", "<cs> those are hard words and will cause disappointment among those who expect great things of the commission <e> <s> i shall withdraw the amendment in the hope that we may have some contact with the noble earl between now and the next stage when perhaps a middle course can be drawn <e>", "<cs> is this not precisely the sort of place where the insecurity of the schedule comes out <e> <s> i understood from what the noble earl read out from the notes on clauses for the first time with colossal effort that under this provision there will be three parties the local authority the commission and the secretary of state or their representatives <e> <s> it seems that they will be charging around in a given piece of countryside near an ancient monument saying to each other does it appear to you to be reasonable that this bit should come into our ownership because it does not appear to me to be reasonable that it should <e> <s> does it appear more reasonable to you that it should come <e>", "<cs> what are the governments plans for the tower of london <e>", "<cs> i feel sure that the committee will wish to congratulate the noble lord on a piece of textual archaeology in which he unearthed the meaning of this amendment by reference to a text which refers to a text which refers to a text <e> <s> only he had the resources to burrow so deep as to unearth the meaning <e> <s> with those comments i should like to support both building and monument being added to land in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder how many noble lords now regret that we did not get rid of the whole thing and insist upon a positive statement before we embarked upon this textual archaeology which we have been doing <e> <s> however we did not do so <e> <s> i will only remind the committee that we should consider once again whether it would not be better to do so at the next stage unless the government give us the clear positive statement of the powers and duties of the commission which has been requested on so many occasions before we reach the next stage <e> <s> i do not wish to press the deletion of this schedule <e>", "<cs> we can all sympathise with the noble earls plight <e> <s> but if when it landed on his desk instead of saying ok i will do my best he had said i am not going to move it i am not going to present that to the house of lords i am just not going to do so is it not possible that within three weeks his departmental lawyers and the parliamentary draftsmen would have produced a positive clause which the whole house desires <e> <s> that is just a thought with which to leave the matter <e> <s> i shall not press the deletion of the schedule <e>", "<cs> i am a romantic about the royal commission and i believe i perceive that most members of the committee will be romantics too <e> <s> it is a freestanding instrument of scholarship very small unprotected by any university unprotected by any research council unprotected by

have survived <e> <s> i remember from years ago when i was looking after these things in the government an excellent paper by sir nikolaus pevsner outlining how he thought the royal commission could finish its allotted task within years instead of the years which at the current rate of progress it would take <e> <s> i am glad to say that that paper was not adopted either by the royal commission or by those in the government who could have funded the royal commission to finish the job within a shorter period <e> <s> let us not legislate about it in any way which is not wholly welcome to the royal commission itself <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beswick has just said there is still a role for the totally independent and the very small in matters of research of this kind <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that no case has been made out for decreasing the power of parliament in this matter <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord strabolgi will persevere with his amendment especially since we know that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> i agree with the last point and as usual when you have a load of nonsense it is best not to change the original title of the load of nonsense <e> <s> surely common usage says that there are three nations in britain the english the scottish and the welsh <e> <s> this one covers one of the three nations and so it is quite correct to call it the national heritage bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord recall the complete quotation from mr andropov of which the question of the noble earl lord alexander quoted only a part <e> <s> the quotation was as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask only two questions <e> <s> can the deputy leader of the house tell us anything about the meaning of the phrase laid before the house in the statement <e> <s> the statement said that the national measures <e>", "<cs> my lords may i apologise first to the noble lord lord mayhew for having missed his speech <e> <s> that i did so was due to a misunderstanding about when this debate was likely to begin <e> <s> the negotiations which are the subject of this question are now being conducted in public <e> <s> this means that mr andropov believes that he now has a better case than president reagan and that i think is probably the reason why he has taken the step which is not very common in moscow of switching without of course any declaration that he is doing so from private or secret negotiations to public negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords and i from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble earl on two points especially since the leader of the house is now back in her place and i believe missed the first point <e> <s> i do not know if the noble earl is right to say that it is years since we did not have either the secretary of state for defence or a subordiant minister in the defence ministry in this house <e> <s> i expect he is right and it is an occasion which should not pass unremarked <e> <s> we all wish lord belstead the best personal good fortune and success in holding the two posts because i understand he is to be number one spokesman for both the foreign office and the ministry of defence <e> <s> my main worry is whether that is fair to the foreign office <e> <s> the advantage of having a qualified foreign office minister in this house of some seniority as a minister of state is that he can buzz around the world a bit more than can his opposite number in the house of commons <e> <s> but if he is now to take on the number one responsibility for the ministry of defence as well that will restrict him <e> <s> that is probably a pity <e> <s> still we shall see how it works out and perhaps it will turn out to be temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of weapons reductions were the government given any notice of the dismissal of mr rostow and mr starr and of the appointment of mr adelman <e> <s> are the government acquainted with mr adelman <e> <s> indeed is he acquainted with western europe <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister of state indicate that he knows as well as the rest of us that last time there were american nuclear missiles on british soil a conservative government in which the noble lord lord duncan-sandys was the defence minister insisted on a physical dual key arrangement <e> <s> could the minister say why he thinks it is unnecessary this time <e> <s> lastly could the minister say what reason he has to think that people will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very wide interest in this country and beyond in the outcome of contacts between the british government and morocco as a result of the failure of the delegation to include london in its earlier tour <e> <s> can the government tell us why it is that news of the success of those discussions is expected to come from morocco rather from this country or from both countries simultaneously <e>", "<cs> my lords we have to remember what this bill is about <e> <s> it is if i understand rightly simply about people sending each other information about other people who do not want them to <e> <s> if the people to whom the information relates do want people to send each other that information then there is no need for this bill and there is no need for the convention and after all that is something that people have always done and will continue to do <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to join with those noble lords who have already congratulated the noble lord lord franks and his colleagues on an extremely clear and well-organised report and to say that i too am delighted to see the noble lord lord carrington back among us at least i was until he started to leave the chamber and to say how much i share his pleasure in the fact that the franks report has in its appendix conclusively nailed some of the more unpleasant rumours that were going around <e> <s> i am sorry to have to tell the noble lord lord carrington that i shall have more to say about his speech in a minute but it will be in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i be so bold as to interrupt before the noble baroness leaves the question of the endurance <e> <s> is the noble baroness under the impression that any member of this house this evening or indeed to my knowledge anywhere else before has been suggesting that the government intended to send a signal to the argentines that they could invade when they withdrew the endurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in seeking further information on the point and bearing in mind that what we are talking about is the provision by which appointed inspectors are allowed to exercise the secretary of states power to override the decisions of elected representatives on local councils may i ask the minister to say whether the government consider it satisfactory that statistics should not even be collected on the number of times they do so compared with the number of times when they allow the democratic decision to stand <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government content not to be aware at present of how many times out of the appointed inspector is over-ruling the democratically expressed wishes of the people of a given planning authority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government this time take care not to discuss doing anything which they do not intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government this time take care not to discuss doing anything for instance ceding sovereignty which they do not intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government asked the united states to link their arms deliveries to guatemala to an undertaking by guatemala to abandon its wrongful claim for sovereignty over part of belize <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister of state aware that the only two examples of press advertising from the late s to which he has referred and to which the publics attention was directed when inquiring from the ministry of defence this morning relate to straightforward accounts of government defence policy more of a recruiting nature than of anything else which could not possibly have been objected to by any party in parliament at the time and that that is a very different situation from the use of government funds on a matter <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister of state agree that that is different from the spending of government money on presenting one side of an argument that is now a matter of acute party disagreement in parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords may i point out that ombudsman has three syllables whereas conservation heritage commission has <e> <s> this is of course the difference and if anybody could find three syllables for this one how grateful the house would be <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i think that the whole house has paid the greatest attention to what the noble lord lord charteris has said <e> <s> but he said in his first intervention that he did not want to be dog in the manger about it which i suppose to put it in strictly statutory terms <e> <s> was not an overwhelming objection <e> <s> i should like to add that if we are going to effect any change it should be a change towards the shorter form heritage commission rather than towards heritage conservation commission which is almost as unsayable as the existing title although it contains fewer words <e> <s> so i would urge the house to go for heritage commission now <e> <s> i think that within a very few months of its coming into operation the slight difference in the range covered by on the one hand the national heritage fund and on the other hand the heritage commission will become quite familiar to all those who are at all concerned with these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to confine my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> a that is the amendment to the amendment <e> <s> if the house continues to discuss amendment no <e> <s> i shall probably be forced to say what i think about the governments new amendment as a whole at this stage but let us try to keep it in order if we can <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot make out why the government should think that the people will think that a cabinet minister of this party or that is a more suitable manager for royal palaces than the commission which we are setting up <e>", "<cs> my lords before the amendment is accepted or rejected i wonder whether i could follow the example of the noble earl lord avon by going a little wide of the particular amendment which is before us and making a remark about amendment no <e> <s> as a whole which was agreed to with such exemplary speed immediately before we rose for dinner <e> <s> if any noble lord thinks that i should not do so at this moment i hope he will let me know otherwise without any objections from the house i shall proceed for a couple of minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the arguments most persuasive <e> <s> is it not the case that what is proposed <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls answer was directed chiefly to assuring the house that the commission have a sufficient right to advise <e> <s> nobody doubts that <e> <s> my amendment is directed to ensuring that the commission are informed of the existence of a particular case in all the categories concerned where their right to advise is exercisable <e> <s> the noble earl has run through a number of cases where he tells the house that under the bill the secretary of state already has a duty to inform the commission that a specific case has arisen where they have the right to advise <e> <s> i followed him closely and i shall look at that in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i raised the question of why it was that the redundant churches fund did not have to get the secretary of states approval to accept a redundant church but that the commission will have to get the secretary of states approval <e> <s> if i remember correctly i have been made aware from correspondence with the noble earl or at any rate i have been made aware in one way or another that the reason why the government make the distinction is that the redundant churches fund gets a five-yearly grant allocation and is left to spend it over a five-year period in accordance with its own discretion but that the commission is not going to get that and therefore cannot be allowed the same discretion to do what it thinks fit with redundant churches <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is showing a most implausible innocence in this matter <e> <s> does he really think that the beverley district council would go anywhere near the commission unless it was compelled to <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it would force the beverley district council to seek the commissions advice on any application for planning consent within a metre radius of any building from

authorities which will do all they can to ignore and tacitly to deceive the commission <e> <s> that should be recognised on all sides of the house a tiny minority but it is partly to look after the case of that tiny minority that such legislation as this is needed <e> <s> on the question of sending in supporting documents and so on improving the sending in of forms i am more than prepared to accept what the noble earl said and will beg leave to withdraw the amendments to see if we can come by drafting to a less onerous form of words that is less onerous on the local authorities though the government will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that in common sense a man is more likely to share his weekly pay packet with his wife if he has pound notes in his pocket than if he does not have pound notes in his pocket <e> <s> before going further with the proposal of cashless pay will the government make sure that they have up-to-date statistical knowledge of the number of wives in the country who do not know what their husbands earn wish that they did and fear

ago when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister of state agree that almost all those who are informed and concerned about this matter believe that the government are to be congratulated on so

wide discussion in parliament and among people <e> <s> would they make a statement at some time which could serve as a trigger for a public discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords when did a british government last approach the other principal arms exporting countries of the world with a view to a mutual self-denying ordinance that they would not flog weaponry around the place to less developed

leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be desirable if they did do so in view of the fact that the dual key system for the cruise

closely related to the question namely the cost to the united kingdom of a custodial force to give us a physical dual-key arrangement in connection with the united states missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords

name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i could ask the noble lord the minister to answer the question <e> <s> have the government consulted with the speaker of the house of representatives of the united states on whom the decision would devolve if for any reason the president or the vice-president were unavailable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister why he himself would consider it inappropriate i quote his word to inquire into the arrangements for the american decision to launch these missiles from british soil in the event of nos <e> <s> and in america being out of action at the time when the crisis came <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord soames has been repeatedly and rightly thanked for choosing this motion at exactly the right time with reference to the timing of the williamsburg conference <e> <s> i should like specifically to endorse his idea about how to construct the agenda for that conference the idea of having papers saying what each member of the conference wants the other members to do seems to me to be an ingenious idea which i hope will turn out to be productive if it is used <e>", "<cs> my lords most speakers in this debate and indeed in the house of commons have not it seems to me made enough of the fact that we are seeking to permit the privatisation of an industry which has been nationalised since <e> <s> that is longer than most of our nationalised industries by a long way <e> <s> there was a pretty confused situation before <e> <s> the simplicity which was imposed then under the banner of public enterprise has not served the country badly <e> <s> this is not to say that the bill is wrong or that i urge that it should be thrown out but simply that we should look at all the things it does and ask whether it is really necessary to have a change since unnecessary change merely unsettles an industry <e> <s> clearly i expect that in certain respects it is necessary but there are one or two others where one may raise doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords would the secretary of state accept that the implication of the finding of the franks committee that the government had no reason to expect an argentine invasion at the beginning of april is that they did have reason to expect an argentine invasion at some time thereafter <e> <s> would the noble lord also agree that even two months before an invasion is no time to be selling million worth of goods to the enemy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that while some years ago the use of nitrate fertilisers dramatically increased agricultural yields the evidence now is that greatly increased doses of nitrate fertilisers produce only very small increases in agricultural yields <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in using these extensive opportunities will the government concentrate particularly on two problems <e> <s> what is to happen during the period between the time when the united states achieves a space-based beam weapon system against incoming ballistic missiles and furnishes one to the soviet union according to the united states expressed intention and ourselves and americas other allies around the world achieving it a period during which they will be protected and japan and ourselves will not be protected <e> <s> the second problem is this <e> <s> given that everyone knows that the development of such a system will take at least or years will the government press president reagans administration for their present timetable on disarmament talks <e>", "<cs> my lords may i by leave of the house quote the president of the united states <e> <s> given the presidents statement that the elimination of the threat of strategic nuclear missiles by this system <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the present position of the government towards the proposal for the european disarmament conference which the leader of the house has just mentioned and which has in the past been more associated with france than britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that such proposals have been widely published in the american press in the form of the alleged decision recently taken by president reagan to sell off the weather satellites to commercial enterprise <e> <s> if the american government do proceed with that decision will our government in collaboration with others similarly placed be in early discussions with the united states government about the probable cost of data from weather satellites if and when they are commercialised into private possession <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to be able not only to thank the minister of state for repeating the statement made in the house of commons but also to welcome the content of the statement <e> <s> we on these benches think that it is an excellent statement <e> <s> there is only one place in it where words from the bad old days stand out like scar tissue where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put a complicated point clearly enough <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the government might be thinking of compelling the oil companies to sell lead-free petrol <e> <s> at present the government are not allowed by community directive to compel them <e> <s> are the government thinking of asking the community to change that directive so as to leave the government free to compel the oil companies to do this just as they are free to compel them to do various other things <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister of state not agree that curiosity on the part of the british people and parliament about the cost of such a force as is outlined in the question would also be a valid requirement for the information not only the conditions that he laid down himself for a valid requirement for information but also a simple wish to know on the part of our own people and our own parliament how much it would cost <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government tell the house whether they have in so many words asked the americans to agree to the system of dual control described in the question now before the house and whether the american government have in so many words refused to do so <e> <s> if not why are the government so reluctant to give the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> first of all may i say that the fact that i am speaking from my usual place in this house does not mean that this bill is in any sense a party measure <e> <s> it is obviously a matter on which each individual should form his or her conscientious opinion <e> <s> i am glad to see so far as i can judge from the list of speakers and from what i have heard that the bill will have pretty full support from all parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall detain the house only a minute longer as i think that the noble baroness lady jeger has said most of what i would have wished to say <e> <s> as is very often the case the house has brought forth a wealth of background knowledge and experience about this horrible matter it does so whether or not the matter under discussion is horrible <e> <s> but the amount of background that has been filled in today has been very marked <e>", "<cs> my lords was not the hiroshima bomb which put japan out of the war strategic to japan <e> <s> if it was in what sense are larger weapons now aimed at europe not strategic to europe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state say when either of these two ships was last in a british port for refitting <e> <s> was it not in january at portsmouth <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins for putting down his unstarred question and for his initial good intention about being non-contentious and confining himself closely to it <e> <s> i shall speak on an even narrower front then either of the noble lords who have spoken so far that is solely about the joint control of the cruise missiles <e> <s> i think that beforehand the house will not need me to repeat that i do not go along with lord jenkinss broader view of natos defence policy which i conceive to be more or less the official view of the labour party at the moment but that we on these benches go along much more closely with a view which we think is better considered <e> <s> that is the view expressed by the labour front bench in this house and which we hope to hear expressed again this evening the official labour view being of course that russia should become the only country with nuclear weapons in europe <e> <s> with this we cannot agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord would allow me to ask him a question which is asked in a most constructive spirit <e> <s> why did mr macmillan buy the thor missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he be so courteous as to answer another question <e> <s> has he noticed that he has failed to address himself to the two questions which i asked or has he a reason for failing to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords that was not the question i asked <e> <s> i know that it is customary only to ask questions but may i repeat the question with the leave of the house <e> <s> how much would it cost us to have a dual key arrangement without buying the missiles <e> <s> that is a different question <e> <s> i should like to have an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree with what i think must be the general feeling of the house that we are grateful for having had an excellent telephone message service for many years that we all understand that when a new system is introduced there are bound to be teething problems but that there has been a sharp and measurable drop in efficiency since the new form of service was introduced <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that his last answer but two about the british thermonuclear force being a deterrent of last resort for this country constitutes a change in the arrangement whereby it is assigned to the supreme allied commander europe <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister of state confirm to the house that the government have never proposed to the united states that there might be a dual key without our buying the missiles <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord hunter of newington is of course the reason for this bill in broad terms the bill exists to prevent precisely that which is described in his amendment <e> <s> but i wonder whether it is fair to the courts to move these words into the bill <e> <s> let us just think what might <e>", "<cs> the bill as drafted does of course create an offence and in order to put it beyond doubt that that is a criminal offence it does provide a penalty on conviction <e> <s> the amendment only increases the penalty on conviction <e> <s> we may want to do that in order to express a greater abhorrence of the practice concerned than would otherwise be the case <e> <s> we may want to do it because we are trying to put it beyond doubt in the wake of the act which has not been applied to those who have committed these atrocities in this country <e> <s> in that case we should want a prison sentence <e>", "<cs> the question is not whether all those convicted should or should not be sent to prison but whether the courts should have available to them prison sentences to be imposed on those whom the courts consider it appropriate to deal with in that way <e> <s> i was very disappointed that the government were not able to tell us what to do <e> <s> i am even more disappointed that i am not able to tell the committee what to do <e> <s> the committee is full of wise heads and many strong arguments have been advanced on both sides <e> <s> on this occasion when the arguments are so closely balanced it would seem to be a time when it would be logical to have a division <e> <s> but i must say that i rather hope that there need not be a division for a reason which i think will be obvious to all of those who have heard the debate <e> <s> although the measure is a non-party one it is not absolutely clear that it is a non-sex one as it were <e> <s> so if those who are against the amendment are able to accept that it might be inserted in the bill at least at this stage i should find that a very happy outcome <e>", "<cs> yes i should have made it clear that i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would be so courteous as to allow me to intervene <e> <s> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i had completely forgotten that the two psychiatrists referred to in the sub-paragraph were dealt with in the same amendment <e> <s> no indeed they are not <e> <s> i am right and the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> the two psychiatrists are in fact referred to in amendment no <e> <s> and at the moment we are on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks fit i hope that we can clear the position of a surgeon and the question of physical health under amendment no <e> <s> before proceeding to consider the question of mental health under amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> will that be acceptable <e>", "<cs> what about sex change operations <e> <s> sex change operations are usually the other way round they usually make women out of men and so the surgeon is cutting bits of men and not bits of women <e> <s> i do not know whether that meets the noble ladys difficulty <e>", "<cs> i have to confess that i have not grasped the force of the noble ladys doubts <e> <s> perhaps the noble lady would formulate her worry more clearly <e>", "<cs> i think that is the case <e> <s> if we are to tackle the difficult question of so-called sex change operations in an amendment in committee to this bill which is for another purpose let us first be clear that there is no such thing as a sex change operation <e> <s> there are artificial constructions which can be made in the person of a man and on the person of a woman which will help them to live as if they belonged to the other sex but in law and in biology they remain of the original sex <e> <s> all right they are called sex change operations for short <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> let me attempt to do so <e> <s> let us suppose that i walk into a surgery and say my right arm hurts i ask you to remove it the doctor says this is bad news and he causes me to be subjected to every known physical test and finds that there is nothing wrong with my right arm <e> <s> he may then say you have a delusion and i say it is not a delusion it is pain <e> <s> he may then say it is phantom pain <e> <s> it would indeed remove the pain if i removed your arm <e> <s> would we not think that the surgeon who forthwith proceeded to do so would be very wrong if he had not consulted a psychiatrist before doing so <e> <s> of course any sane qualified surgeon would consult a psychiatrist in such a case <e> <s> of course he would <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked me whether i agreed with him <e> <s> the answer is yes i do <e> <s> i entirely agree with him and i notice also the governments unhappiness about having those two psychiatrists on the scene and that is why i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord what he would think far enough <e> <s> this simply allows the surgeon to do this operation like any other operation so long as it is in a sterile place <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak at this point on what we should do next given that standing orders are suspended the election is coming up and so on <e> <s> i had thought that if the bill went through the committee stage without too much trouble and i think it has gone through the committee stage without too much trouble and has been improved it would be right to bring it before the house on report and remaining stages either tomorrow or the next day <e> <s> as i sense that that is the wish of the committee that is what i intend to do <e> <s> i shall be in touch through the usual channels about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord spoke of a request <e> <s> from whom did the request come for this united nations force to which we contribute <e>", "<cs> my lords frankly is the noble lord not confusing the united nations force in the lebanon with the recent quadripartite american <e> <s> french italian and british force <e> <s> could that not be the explanation of the apparent confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house why it was that in mr macmillan thought the national interest required him to buy the thor missiles in order to attain a dual key <e> <s> last week in debate the noble lord lord belstead said he did not know <e> <s> have the government now found out and reflected on it <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not mistaken in saying that every prime minister since has been satisfied that the agreement on joint control is sufficient in view of the fact that mr macmillan when prime minister spent many millions of pounds on buying thor missiles in order to have a physical dual key as well as the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the recent answer to a parliamentary question in the house of commons which showed that this country was the only country to have carried out announced nuclear weapons tests in the world in the last two or three years can the government fill in the gaps by saying something about unannounced nuclear weapons tests which have been carried out by other countries in the last two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the government are perhaps making a molehill out of a mountain <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather late <e> <s> i have spoken to the front benches of all the other three parties in the house and to those individual lords who i know are interested in the bill <e> <s> all are agreed that it would be equally convenient to take it tomorrow <e> <s> if the government chief whip would be kind enough to signify his assent i propose not to move that the report be considered at this moment but to move it tomorrow as last business <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that this consignment of poison is reported to have left italy in a lorry with a right-wing italian senator sitting beside the driver will the government take special care to investigate the cabs of all lorries arriving at our ports to see which right-wing legislators are sitting beside the drivers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask how the government would reconcile that reply with their stated policy of encouraging social and housing mobility with an eye to the industrial regeneration of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord rea covered three topics in the course of his remarks <e> <s> i am not sure whether the house wishes me to follow them through but unless anyone is against it i will address myself to all three topics in the three amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is what the noble lord has in mind that and that alone would be covered by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> of course would cover any kind of depression or any kind of subjective judgment by any gp anyway <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the amendment though i shall not recommend the house to accept it <e> <s> in his opening remarks <e>", "<cs> no it is not a waste of time as noble lords will find if they are courteous enough to hear me out <e> <s> in his opening remarks the noble lord lord rea asked why should the normal operations of doctors and surgeons be subject to increased scrutiny simply because a few cowboy gynaecologists do something abhorrent <e> <s> the reason why they should be subject to increased scrutiny is that a few cowboy gynaecologists and surgeons do something abhorrent <e> <s> among those who do these operations are qualified people and it is in order to prevent qualified people from doing them that i have drafted the bill so that it has a few teeth in it not very many but a few <e> <s> if there were no qualified persons doing these operations it would not have been necessary to have a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of the amendment is to remove all the teeth from the bill and to make it merely a declaratory one <e> <s> i was giving the reasons for desiring to keep in the teeth <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lord i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the opportunity to say so of course i acknowledge the objective truth of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> but there was the usual gap between first reading and second reading and there was the usual gap between second reading and committee stage <e> <s> the noble lord has personally been most courteous to me throughout <e> <s> i have been in touch with him throughout <e> <s> but it is the case that the government have not been able to give me any very firm advice on what to do let alone to provide any formulations of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i was content to make my remarks on this motion as the noble lord lord trefgarne was to make them on the motion before it i do not really see the distinction <e> <s> i should like to set it on the record that though i am grateful for the personal courtesy of the noble lord lord trefgarne i regret that the government have not been able to give any constructive help to the formulation of the bill so far <e> <s> of course it will not become law when it goes out of this house and if it is to become law it will be necessary to reintroduce it in the next parliament <e> <s> i hope that the labours of the house on the three stages that we have had will not prove to have been wasted and that the bill will be in a better condition than it would have been had it not been carried forward to concluding its passsage through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i associate those who sit on this bench with all or almost all that has been stated <e> <s> it is a pleasure to be able to put on a party hat and to be nice having worn a non-party hat and been rather nasty just now <e> <s> i agree with all that has been stated about the service given to us by the staff <e> <s> it has been beyond praise throughout the parliament <e> <s> i wish all noble lords on all sides of the house a very pleasant election campaign although not of course equal wishes for success <e>", "<cs> my lords all those who would go along with the noble viscounts last words must take comfort from the last part of the statement which spoke of the progress that is being made towards a general financial settlement of the structure of the community <e> <s> can the government now accept it as a stated aim to get into the position where they can abandon the language of british refund <e> <s> this is a phrase that occurs several times in the statement as though the community were a kind of shop that has not given satisfaction <e> <s> once the finances are straight we can abandon that kind of talk altogether and may we hope that next year the phrase british refund will not appear in government speeches or government statements <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this bench must reserve our position about the lord chancellors new description of us as mountaineers until we have looked into the possibility of an implied analogy with the mountain in the french convention of because i am not sure whether we should accept that or not <e> <s> in the meantime mountain or plain the alliance parties of course will share his satisfaction in the improved standard of life of the people in his lifetime and in all our lifetimes and will regret only that it has not been as fast as the improvement in the standard of life of comparable people in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords does the fact that today the government have come to regret and disapprove of <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to prohibit female circumcision <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government agree that we already have negotiations and that what we now hope for is a solution in time to prevent the deployment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches also agree with the statement and are glad to learn of the steps that are being taken <e> <s> would the government accept that in finding a way out of this dangerous moment three things might with advantage he borne in mind <e> <s> first mr maurice bishop seized power by force from his predecessor sir eric gairy and he did so because the latter was a corrupt tyrant and all human experience suggests that it is difficult to get out of a vicious circle like that once you have got into it <e> <s> secondly whatever the political colour of the governments of the caribbean may be it is difficult to say that one of them must not have a long runway and thereby attract tourism when all the others do and that is not a reason for intervening in their affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking for the alliance a moment ago the noble lord lord gladwyn asked if the minister of state could confirm that the sole purpose of the multinational force was to help to put an end to the fighting to keep the peace to separate the combatants <e> <s> the minister of state then got up and said i can confirm that the purpose of the force is to help the lebanese government to reassert its control over the country <e> <s> can the noble baroness really not see the difference between the two <e> <s> i do not want to push her at this moment into taking one side or the other but may i point out that there is a growing tendency on the part of the british government to say that the purpose is to protect the present lebanese government and to help it to assert its control <e> <s> is there not a danger here <e> <s> is it not obvious that the quickest way to help the lebanese government to assert its control if it really came to the pointwould be to land very large armies and to drive all the factions back out of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords given that the house will remember that at the time of the abortive united states attempt to rescue their hostages in tehran it was believed that there had been no prior consultation or warning and in view of that will the government undertake to review the operation of the agreement which the noble baroness has just mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement says that the american action was taken in response to an invitation from the organisation of east caribbean states <e> <s> are the government in a position to give us the terms of that invitation or at least to say whether that invitation made reference to what is now said to be the united states prime concern namely the safety of united states citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss last supplementary answer was not quite clear <e> <s> did she say that no written communication had been received from the organisation of east caribbean states before yesterday evening and if so does that mean that a written communication has now been received <e> <s> has any communication or any copy of any communication from that organisation as such come to the knowledge of her majestys government <e> <s> if so can the government please tell us what was in it since

lord cameron has just said <e> <s> however i should like to put in one separate remark before i come to it and that concerns the lebanon <e> <s> yesterday at statement time it seemed to me i said it at the time but i want to say it more clearly now that the noble baroness lady young on behalf of the government displayed a certain confusion about the purpose for which our small force was part of the multinational force in the lebanon <e> <s> is it on the one hand to give general support to the present lebanese government or is it on the other hand to help to keep the peace and to separate factions which might otherwise fight <e> <s> we must realise that there is at least a potential contradiction between the two <e> <s> the two aims could very easily come into conflict and we must know why our forces are there if they do come into conflict <e> <s> for that reason i beg the government in common with a broad swathe of congressional opinion in the united states to be precise to be prescriptive <e> <s> why is it there <e> <s> what are its orders <e> <s> parliament should know <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble baroness for that clarification of fact <e> <s> will the government should they have the opportunity do <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that half the battle would be won if he could persuade his right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment to instruct his inspectors to stop overturning refusals by local planning

<s> i await with interest the answers to the numerous questions asked by the leader of the labour opposition to which i regret that i have to add one or two more <e>", "<cs> my lords so many noble lords have comments to make and yet the noble baroness was so clearly right when she said that now is not the time to debate the matter <e> <s> i wonder whether i may suggest that the usual channels should examine the possibility of our holding a debate tomorrow especially in view of the fact that we shall not now be taking the equal pay amendment regulations tomorrow afternoon as had been expected <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a debate in the british parliament and consequently about what the british government ought to do and what they have been doing <e> <s> it looks to me as though so far the conduct of the government can be divided into two phases the first phase during which they did nothing at all when they should have done much and a second phase in <e>", "<cs> my lords

grateful to all those who have spoken and delighted that the bill in a suitably amended form is to get a fair wind from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that since i tabled this question which was itself a follow-up to an earlier question in may i have had a helpful letter from the noble lords colleague mr whitney saying that whereas earlier the soviet government refused to disclose anything about these maritime zones to us or to any other government they have now formally told our embassy in moscow that they are working out base lines around their territorial waters which would of course generate airspace zones above <e> <s> will the government inform the soviet union that we expect these base lines to be fully in accordance with international law that is to say that they will not enclose bays of more than nautical miles across and also will they inform them that we will not recognise any so-called historic seas on their arctic coast except the white sea <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an interim report and we are very glad to see that it does in fact report signs of movement towards our point of view in these important matters and about time too given that it is the report of the sixth of only seven meetings that are to be held by the special council

agree that the time to discuss the operational deployment of the cruise missiles is not yet but when we know the final position of the two sides at the geneva negotiations which is not yet known and

negotiate with them if it is would the government think it possible to make modest advances by obviating negotiations altogether and proceeding by simultaneous unilateral declarations as described in

obviously right that any suggestion as to a un force must come from the lebanon could the noble lord not go so far as to say that if it did come we and the united nations would agree to the

north pole either would it not be a good thing if the civilised nations soon began to think about an international treaty to conserve the environment of that antipode <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords was not that extensive reference in practice confined to the governments action in privatising one or two shipping interests or enterprises <e> <s> does the noble lord

nothing has happened for a long time now might be the moment for the united kingdom to take a more active role in the contact group especially in view of the fact that the united states which as the noble lord has just told us has been taking the lead so far has given the south african government the excuse for the delay over the past four or five years by suggesting to them the linkage with the withdrawal of cuban troops in angola <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take note that the words used by the noble lord lord hatch were riot verbatim from the report which he cited <e>", "<cs>

chemical disarmament the only real rational goal <e> <s> in the meantime should there not be a system of nato political release for chemical weapons as there is for nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> my

paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the point that this research will push forward the frontiers of technology in a very large number of fields which in the future will be the centre of weapon systems

useful control known as end-use certificates to arms exports to the united states given the lengthening list of countries into which that country is running armed rebels and the increasing likelihood

possible cruise missile deployments <e> <s> in doing so why is he confining himself only to the range of the current generation of cruise missiles and allowing for no possible extension in the future

he does not why should it be worthless if we do it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl passes on from that point will he comment on boxer reagans offer to teach boxer gorbachev how to improve his defence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the soviet zero-zero option for inf in europe is for the dismantling and the destruction of those forces

states <e> <s> that would indeed be so if they had only been withdrawn but if they had been destroyed that distinction would not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will thank the minister for that very general statement <e> <s> however has she nothing more to say about the quite concrete announcement made two or three weeks ago by chancellor kohl in the bundestag to the effect that germany would be seeking an increased german-french-british contact on these matters <e> <s> have they done so and is that to come about <e> <s> subsidiary to that will the government agree that the present inevitable disarray in washington is a reason for more collaboration between the european nato countries rather than less <e>", "<cs> my lords given that the fact remains that chancellor kohl told his parliament that he would be seeking improved extended or whatever it was contacts with britain and france on disarmament and on military matters can the government state whether any approach has been received from germany in this sense <e> <s> if so what answer has been made to it <e> <s> if not is it the

the treaty forbids testing <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard the turkish cypriot case ably pressed in the first two speeches in this debate <e> <s> my original intention was to be as evenhanded as possible in this sad affair <e> <s> however after listening to the last two speakers i admit to the temptation to take some time presenting the greek cypriot case that is the

is quite an unusual sensation at least for me and perhaps for most of your lordships <e> <s> i do have to relate that fact to the regrettable fact that there is not a single conservative speaker

open to the government to draw it further out than miles rather than closer in under that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments intention later on to introduce provisions through the

easy to understand that <e> <s> is it the governments opinion that soviet defences are likely to be the stronger or the weaker if the reagan administration were now to confirm every comma of the abm treaty and cancel their sdi initiative <e>", "<cs> my lords i have probably said this before and i ask the houses pardon but i am going to say it now <e> <s> i think it is not within the normal customs of this house that any member of the house whether a minister or not should refuse to give way to a former leader of the house <e> <s> i regret that it happened and i think many members of the

baronesss department take care that the ministry of defence does not conclude the debate prematurely in the wrong direction <e> <s> did the government notice in <e>", "<cs> yes i am quoting something which is germane to the question <e> <s> it concluded <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness think again before endorsing the mistaken belief of the noble lord lord chalfont that mr gorbachev

control <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the tower commission reproduces as an annex to its

government further aware that there are quite circumstantial reports of blowpipes being in the hands of jonas savimbi and his forces in angola <e> <s> if any of these reports are right where do the government think the missiles came from other than from the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister of state fully appreciate that my original question was not intended to cast doubt on her word or that of the united states government that no blowpipes had gone to the contras <e> <s> it was to ask if in view of the presence and free operation for some years of colonel north in the white house basement no doubt unknown to the state department it would not be a wise precaution to apply no-transfer agreements to the united states as we do to so many other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords peace is something that sometimes happens and we all want to continue to happen <e> <s> war which also sometimes happens is something we all want to prevent <e> <s> as war studies in our

government still completely untroubled by the prospect of patents for new varieties of plants that may be of world-wide importance for many generations to come passing into the hands of private commercial enterprises which are not responsible to the united nations to the world food organisation or even to the government of any country <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister anything to say about patents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not an obvious course to suggest to a friendly power that when there is a dispute or when there is likely to be a dispute about the interpretation of a treaty to which they are a party and to which although we are not a party is yet of the very highest importance and interest to us they should have recourse to this world institution which has been there for many decades and which exists for the purpose of solving such disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fallback suggestion would the government consider pointing out to the united states that the convention on the interpretation of treaties which they have not signed but which nevertheless codifies existing customary law says that a treaty means what it says according to the common interpretation of the words in it and that if that is a difficulty it means what the negotiators meant it to mean when they signed it <e>", "<cs> my lords by far the greater part of this bill is concerned with precisely who and at what <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i correct a mistake that he made <e> <s> he said that this country did not sign the convention on the continental shelf <e> <s> we did sign it <e> <s> moreover we were the first country to sign it <e> <s> there is no ambiguity either in the wording of the treaty or in the fact that we are bound by it <e>", "<cs> my lords to round this off it is clear that there is confusion with the convention on the law of the sea <e> <s> that is the one that we did not sign <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl finishes blaming me for the drying up of north sea investment single-handed does he agree that to ask a cabinet minister to judge fairly between conflicting claims on the public purse and the public wealth is not automatically to ensure a victory of the weakest over the strongest nor would one wish a victory of the weakest over the strongest just balance and justice <e>", "<cs> my lords it states in the bill at clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a mistake to say that mr gorbachev has delinked progress on sdi from progress on disarmament in general <e> <s> is it not correct to say that he has delinked progress on sdi only from progress on intermediate-range nuclear forces and that it remains firmly linked in the russian mind with progress on strategic offensive nuclear forces and not only in the russian mind but in the nature of things <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the noble lords question <e> <s> no i do not know of any nation that is demanding complete removal <e> <s> the question of whether any nation demands it is totally irrelevant to the effect of my amendment which as the noble lord will observe merely writes into the bill the very guidelines which he is praising <e>", "<cs> if i may for convenience take up the last point first it seems to me that the noble lord has advanced a point which does not speak against the amendment at all <e> <s> if the department looks at the international regulations which are in force and finds they have nothing whatever to say about the matter then they will have taken them into account and that is that and then they go on under subparagraph <e>", "<cs> it is quite a familiar situation for a committee in either house of parliament when somebody argues that the government are doing the right thing and that the government are even taking the lead in doing the right thing <e> <s> what need is there to lay an obligation

to do the right thing or perhaps i should say even less likely to do the right thing <e> <s> this is the reason one wishes to spell things out in legislation <e> <s> i therefore believe that it would be good to carry these words into the bill <e>", "<cs> we see how important it is to be crystal clear about consultation and about who is prepared to consult whom and when <e> <s> i note that and the

brought up during the minutes of debate which we have had <e> <s> many complicated new legal points appeared for the first time and the one thing which did not happen was an amendment <e> <s>

being tremendously sharpsighted about what is going on behind the scenes or are affecting to be not tremendously sharpsighted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that all these matters may happily be put behind us as soon as we and the western european nations have made up our minds what to do about the soviet-american proposal for the elimination of intermediate and shorter range nuclear weapons <e> <s> does that not depend solely on the ability of our governments to come to grips with the fact that all these things hang together and also the fact that we must consider conventional disarmament and chemical disarmament at the same time <e> <s> it is not a very complicated proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords given that we are talking about the removal of american and russian weapons

haemophiliacs and also with the comments of the noble lord lord ennals in praise of the government scheme <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister a question in almost the same terms as that asked by the noble lord but phrased in a different way <e> <s> it is clear that the haemophiliacs who contracted aids in this way deserve the best form of government financial help and i avoid the expression

"<cs> my lords i should like to start with some observations about language <e> <s> for centuries the whole area of human reproduction has been bedevilled by the obscurities of language which we impose upon ourselves generally between one or another moral course to wrap up the truth <e> <s> we are now familiar with the euphemism termination of pregnancy meaning abortion <e> <s> we have recently become familiar with another euphemism selective reduction of pregnancy <e> <s> that applies when a researcher puts back into the uterus three four or even more ova which have been fertilised

would involve a vast increase of expenditure on smart and brilliant weapons designed for actually fighting wars in europe <e> <s> indeed it looks as though they are celebrating the signing of the inf treaty as ushering in the age when fighting wars will become possible once again <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not then the best opportunity to commence <e>", "<cs> my lords as the soviet union has

dreadful subject to the attention of the house year by year <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to comment on the rather more grim interpretation of that figure namely that the yearly new cases are dropping so dramatically because there are so few left to get it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question on that point <e> <s> are we to take it that in the view of the government and their advisers the desirability of widespread routine screening for a disease is in inverse proportion to its gravity that is to say the more serious the disease the less we need to

forty years ago when i was a very junior officer in one of the secret services and for the first time the names of the heads of those services their addresses and telephone numbers and so on began to be published i suggested that it might be a good idea if each service was divided into two parts one which was visible to the public consisting of two or three people with good manners and a nice bottle of sherry in the front office who were accessible only on confidential terms the rest being the operational side which remained totally unknown to everybody <e> <s> it seemed to me that that was the safest way to save the bacon of those services from undue publicity at that time <e> <s> the proposal was turned down for the very interesting reason that the senior officers did not think

saying that there had been no necessity for that <e> <s> my argument is that it represents lost value both in the west and in the east <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of the conventional imbalance perhaps i may say that he will of course have studied the iiss report as will my noble friend lord mayhew and know that the point of the report was not to say that the numbers were in balance but that though the numbers were out of balance in favour of the russians yet the modernity of the forces was in our favour <e> <s> although we had fewer deployed they were on

future and the absence of all structured thinking in natos general plan for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that many members of the house will be interested in whether he can answer the second supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> that question was if i remember rightly whether the minister would be good enough to convey to the secretary of state the objections which have been raised in many quarters in the house about the lack of a consultation document <e>", "<cs> my lords can we seek to get beyond always speaking of

engagement <e> <s> can he also say between which members of such a force would those difficulties be most pronounced <e>", "<cs> my lords does the appearance of the chief british sdi official and a principal israeli sdi official at the same conference in washington symbolise an undesirable and growing high-tech military alliance between this country and israel which whatever it is to the united

chairmanship <e> <s> difficult questions of this nature could be referred to it <e> <s> it would then come up with wise advice about what governments could do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has a great sense of constitutional propriety <e> <s> will he allow to pass without comment the opinion of his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that there is a better case for holding a referendum when members of the house of commons are free to vote according to their consciences than when they are required to vote as they are told by their party whips <e>", "<cs> my lords few would wish to join issue with the government that the time may not yet be ripe to return general sikorskis remains but would the minister agree that the present time is at least less unripe than it was when the prime minister met general jaruzelski last june <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that at least in this quarter of the house and i believe wider than that there is wide agreement with the supplementary question asked by the noble viscount lord montgomery of alamein <e> <s> is it not a thoroughly good development that this time we have been able to get past the starting post of the negotiations without everything blowing up in our face as happened last time <e> <s> many of us would ask him to convey to our negotiators our congratulations on their skills <e>", "<cs> my lords on

they will endorse <e> <s> but perhaps i may ask what the leader of the house is doing coming here and pretending that the south africa story was not a disaster <e> <s> i imagine that most members of the house will have seen the prime minister on television a couple of days ago saying with a strange exultation in her voice <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether or not the appointment of junior hospital doctors is improving <e>", "<cs> my lords our new session opens during a kind of crisis in the governing party <e> <s> there is more to that crisis than the prime ministers style of

noble lord agree that no noble lord has spoken today against research to aid the infertile <e> <s> some noble lords of whom i am one have spoken against research for any purpose infertility or any

said that there were too many quangos and asked whether we could have fewer quangos in the world <e> <s> it has occurred to me and perhaps also to the government if not no doubt they could think about

lords in helping the romanians to set up a multi-party democracy which seems an extremely good idea will the government be careful <e>", "<cs> my lords in opening the debate the noble lord lord callaghan spoke of the absurdity of a frontier between two halves of a german confederal state which would have short-range nuclear weapons on either side of it <e> <s> that would indeed be a great absurdity <e> <s> perhaps we should also remember the project for a lance replacement system of longer range and greater explosive power <e> <s> would the government not be well advised before

in nato wants that except the prime minister so i am glad that it has not been mentioned today and i hope that it will not be mentioned from now on <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards democratisation i am happy to tell the government how pleased we are that they appear to be taking the advice that we have been extending to them over the past five years namely that it would be both possible and desirable to go further than they originally intended <e> <s> the noble lord is obviously right when he says that it is up to us to decide what to do now <e> <s> during their negotiations in beijing will the government bear in mind that the chinese government have really forfeited any right to lay down the law in the light of the events of last june <e> <s> that is a question of common morality <e>", "<cs> my lords what do the government think can be done on the other side of the equation that is looking towards countries which are richer than us and perhaps less conscientious and whose imports of tropical timber constitute a greater part of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> it seems to me that he has not sufficiently or properly answered the principal question of my noble friend lord jenkins <e> <s> perhaps i may rephrase it <e> <s> if ministers were for years misled by officials about the existence of a dirty tricks project in northern ireland how can we know that they are not still being misled by officials about the existence of a dirty tricks project at national level in britain <e> <s> is it not obvious that this question cannot be answered by the two extremely narrow inquiries being carried out <e> <s> the government repeatedly rest on the phrase that no evidence has been found to suggest that anything has happened which is worse than what has been admitted <e> <s> is it possible for either of the two inquiries which are now going forward actively to seek evidence for instance by calling on evidence from officials who are now retired instead of passively glancing through the papers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister take this opportunity to comment on a story in this mornings newspapers to the effect that conservative members of the european parliament want the funds for building up democracy in eastern europe to be sent exclusively to parties of the centre right <e> <s> is the story true <e> <s> if it is true will the government dissociate themselves from that intention in favour of sending funds impartially towards the construction of democracy itself which comes first <e>", "<cs> this has been a shorter debate than i expected <e> <s> perhaps we can have a longer one later <e> <s> i fully took the force of the points made by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> nobody knows what an embryo is in law <e> <s> it was to start the process of helping our society to make up its mind that i introduced the amendments <e> <s> i was surprised that the noble and learned lord did not refer to any of the four cases which simply illustrate the confusion which the good americans and good australians have fallen into for lack of a statutory definition when they come to deal with the nitty-gritty of everyday life between people who are at odds <e>", "<cs> i have little doubt that the present state of british law in this matter is inadequate to cope with this new technology <e> <s> whether to propose a remedy to that is itself a foolish activity or whether it is only my answers that are foolish i am not sure <e> <s> however i do not believe that the americans are much more foolish than we are <e>", "<cs> i rise to say briefly that i agree with the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> having considered all that has been said in my view there can be no objection to removing the word <e> <s> indeed it would achieve the same purpose <e> <s> now that such a situation has been imagined and i would not like to judge whether the noble lords imagination is macabre why should we not remove the word <e>", "<cs> the noble duke the duke of norfolk read out the provisions in the bill now before the german bundestag <e> <s> we should be grateful to him for that it was most useful <e> <s> the most reverend primate the archbishop of york then denounced them as inadequate <e> <s> i think he may have missed the provision which said that nothing shall be done to an embryo except for its own good <e> <s> that would in itself nullify the most reverend primates fears about the effects the provisions might have <e> <s> it is a detailed point <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord comes to reply to the amendment perhaps he could say a word to help the english <e> <s> i have in mind particularly amendment no <e> <s> further down the marshalled list <e> <s> roughly speaking it would give the right to any person conceived by ivf to know as much about his or her own identity as the state knows <e> <s> if the noble

the amendments we are discussing are passed <e> <s> it would be extremely helpful <e> <s> i have in mind the following question is this perhaps the first occasion on which a basic human right has been urged in this house under the guise of an amendment to the law of succession to scottish peerages or is it only a small tidying up matter referring to scottish peerages <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord a question about the future handling or discussion of the bill in the chamber <e> <s> he said that he expected that we would come to the general question of the right of access to information at a later stage in the bill <e> <s> we now have a rather full chamber and it would be interesting to know whether i am right in thinking that we shall come to that discussion under amendment no <e> <s> which we plan to take today <e>", "<cs> i understand the reasoning behind the bill as drafted but will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor tell us of any precedents there may be in english or british law for parliament to direct a court to find that someone has done something unless he can prove that he has not <e>", "<cs> before dinner we discussed an amendment which sought to put a d on birth certificates to show that the registered father was not the true biological father <e> <s> the committee rightly thought that that should not be pursued because it amounted to publishing the information and broadcasting it to the world <e> <s> it would be thrust on the attention of the owner of the birth certificate <e> <s> this amendment takes us into quite different territory <e> <s> we are considering what is the correct response for the state to give to an adult who is asking for information which the state has <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will bear with me for a moment <e> <s> i do not want to lean on the point for obvious reasons <e> <s> however i have seen reports the validity of which i have not tested that the swedish experience was indeed as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor indicated but that following the reduction in the number of donors immediately after the change in the law the number of donors coming forward has picked up <e> <s> i have also seen it reported that there has been a similar experience in france <e> <s> there was an immediate drop in the number of donors but it has since picked up again <e> <s> i do not want to lean on the point because i do not have chapter and verse to quote which might seem to contradict the noble and learned lord the lord chancellors source <e> <s> perhaps there will be an opportunity on another occasion to go into the matter more fully <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can bring the committee back to the subject of the bill and to the territory within which it will apply <e> <s> no doubt frivolous prosecutions are a great danger in many spheres <e> <s> for that reason we are all fairly accustomed to the institution of dpp only crimes <e> <s> that is a special class of crimes which are considered so sensitive to somebody that the citizen must be deprived of his normal right of taking out a private prosecution <e> <s> that right must in those cases be confined in the hands of the dpp <e>", "<cs> knowing one other act in which this provision exists seems to me to be an insufficient basis on which to ask the committee to decide on this matter <e> <s> as the noble baroness said she is sure there is a list <e> <s> might it not be advisable to withdraw the amendment for the moment and introduce it at a later stage when that list is before us <e> <s> we shall then see in full the company which we are sending this bill to join and see what status the government intend the bill to have <e>", "<cs> that will be too late <e>", "<cs> not content <e>", "<cs> not content <e>", "<cs> my lords the house should be extremely grateful to my noble friend lord raglan for introducing the question <e> <s> his speech came from deep and wide experience of the subject <e> <s> it had the added and uncommon advantage of pulling no punches <e> <s> he also went into detail where necessary <e> <s> i do not remember having heard a better speech

that these matters were under consideration and could not be commented on by the very party who had to decide them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall vote for the amendment for exactly the reason given by the noble lord lord jakobovits and the right reverend prelate the bishop of london <e> <s> i shall do so because it will tend to reduce the number of fetuses allowed to die under experimentation and

i shall take them in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course in the hands of the house in this matter as in all others but reviewing the bill is precisely what i am doing and i have only one or two more points to make <e> <s> i hope that the house will bear with me while i make them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that it is not in the bill but it was used in the warnock report and in discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i have made most of my points <e> <s> only a few remain <e> <s> the house decided not to address the question of whether an ivf embryo is a person or a chattel despite the fact that it has already tied the courts in knots in australia and the united states <e> <s> a bill lacking foresight is bad law

do the government remember after all these years years that the non-proliferation treaty is in the nature of a compact between the haves and the have-nots <e> <s> while the have-nots agreed not to obtain nuclear weapons the nuclear weapons powers including this country agreed to proceed to multilateral nuclear disarmament <e> <s> is it realistic to expect everyone on the other side of the fence

population there will have been four major public inquiries in two years into development proposals <e> <s> does the minister not agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not suggesting that the secretary of state should pay an announced visit to a place where the result of a public inquiry was pending <e> <s> however can the minister say what would prevent him from taking a look <e> <s> he need not tell anyone that he is coming <e> <s> the secretary of state will then begin to understand what the issue is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what steps the government are taking to build up and isolate stocks of cattle which are known to be free of bse <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government recognise that it is possible that a european central bank could be created without the participation of this country <e> <s> what likelihood do they place on such an institution being located in london <e> <s> what relationship do the government see between a european central bank whether or not it includes britain and the proposed east european development bank <e> <s> would it not be a pity if britain were excluded from a european central bank in view of the likely preponderant role of that bank in setting up financing and collaborating with the east european development bank <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the leader of the house <e> <s> is it not the case that the soviet constitution permits constituent republics to secede and has permitted that for decades <e> <s> are we therefore discussing not whether lithuania has the right to secede but what is the best and most peaceful way to do that <e> <s> given the fact that the first action the lithuanian government took after proclaiming its secession was to ask all lithuanian soldiers in the soviet army in lithuania to leave the soviet army and join a national lithuanian army it would have been extremely difficult for moscow to do anything except what it did <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not sensible for the government to continue thinking about the proper location of a reunited germany in the scheme of things <e> <s> is it not asking a bit much of the soviet union that it should agree to a united armed germany in nato <e> <s> should we not consider for a moment what we would think if the cookie had crumbled the other way and there was a proposal

minutes commenting on the speech of the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves his last point when he said that only nuclear weapons can deter any aggressor from an attack does he agree
