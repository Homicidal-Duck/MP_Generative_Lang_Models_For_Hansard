["<cs> my lords since industry is the field in which my own experience lies i hope that the house will permit me to contribute to the debate in that area leaving my noble friend lord simon to talk later about matters in the broader economic field <e> <s> i should like first to welcome the priority given in the gracious speech to the objective of controlling inflation <e> <s> if i cannot wholeheartedly extend that welcome to include the means proposed for achieving that objective that is the pursuit of firm monetary and fiscal policies it is not because such policies seem to me to be without significance quite the reverse but rather that they will not in my view themselves provide the solution to this intractable problem <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches would like to join in thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for the clear way in which he has explained to us the terms of this order <e> <s> we have noted that it has been the subject of wide consultation within the engineering industry training board on which sit representatives of both engineering employers and engineering unions <e> <s> we have noted also that it has received the approval of the manpower services commission and i should like to endorse the praise which has already been given to the chairman and members of the engineering industry training board in this connection and also to the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to join in thanking the noble lord lord melchett for having introduced this motion <e> <s> it seems to me to be especially appropriate that one bearing such a name should be the person calling for an industrial strategy which has the full support of both sides of industry <e> <s> i did not know that the noble viscount lord trenchard was going to refer to the first lord melchett but it was of course he who more than years ago initiated the renowned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for the whole house in saying how glad we are to welcome back the noble lord lord parry and in thanking him for the way in which he has introduced this important debate <e> <s> i share with him a love of that part

there and we visit it every year without fail <e> <s> i have little direct experience of the service sectors of industry however they may be defined but i am quite sure that the noble lord lord parry is right to call our attention to the vital importance of those sectors to the health of our <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the courteous custom of the house to thank the noble lord who introduced the debate for having done so <e> <s> i must confess that i thought that on this occasion i would find it rather difficult to do so in view of the fact that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter instead of putting forward a motion for papers which could later have been withdrawn so framed his motion as to give me at least the impression that he was seeking to oblige us to welcome not only the governments determination to reverse the decline in our economic strength and competitive power a sentiment with which i am sure we would all agree but also the means adopted to that end <e> <s> in doing this in my view he acted maybe unwittingly in a way which was almost bound to call forth the retaliatory response which it in fact invoked from the main opposition party and has placed me certainly speaking from the liberal benches in something of a dilemma <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble viscount lord trenchard for having repeated this statement <e> <s> like the noble lord lord melchett we are glad it has taken the form of an oral rather than a written statement so that we are in a position to ask at least some general questions <e> <s> we realise of course that the government are permitted to make substantial reductions in their overrall subventions to industry in one form or another but there is clearly room for marked differences of opinion as to the extent and the timing of action to be taken in various ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to join in thanking the noble viscount lord trenchard for having repeated this state <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those expressions of sympathy so far as they go <e> <s> but is he aware that his inability to give a somewhat more positive reply will be a disappointment to many people who are seeking common ground on which to improve our economic and industrial performance <e> <s> is not the need for an educational process of this kind one of the few matters on which there is a consensus among elements in all political parties and between many employers and trade union leaders on which we could build together <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one more supplementary question <e> <s> is it not essential for the government to give a lead in this matter immediately if it is to have any effect on pay negotiations in the near future <e> <s> without such a process how are we to avoid increased inflation more bankruptcies and even higher unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the procedural niceties which here apply i understand that we are now talking to the first order that is the one dealing with the handling of redundancies although with the leave of the house and like the noble earl lord gowrie and the noble lord lord mccarthy i shall if i may speak to both of them <e> <s> we on these benches would like to thank the noble earl for the way in which he has explained to us the reasons why these orders are being introduced <e> <s> he will not expect me to go along with all that he had to say there was not very much regarding the general point he was making at the start on the governments economic policies <e> <s> however it may be that on behalf of my noble friends there will be more to be said about that by my noble friend lady seear when we come to deal shortly with the governments statement on the economic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will be glad of this opportunity to debate the governments regional aid policy generally and we are grateful for the additional information that the noble viscount lord trenchard has given concerning the governments thinking on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt and i thank the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> does he accept the general point i was trying to make that the more open the criteria are made to scrutiny the more likely they are to be accepted and will he further accept that although i shall be very glad to receive the letter from him it would serve a much more useful purpose for the nation as a whole if these criteria could be made more widely available <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords even if the subsidy is as high as million a year would it not be very hard to find another subsidy of the same amount which gave the same value for money in terms of our influence in the world at large <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in congratulating the noble earl lord erne and the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw on their maiden speeches <e> <s> if i may say so i particularly admired the evident compassion i suppose it was predictable with which the noble baroness spoke <e> <s> i want to speak on that part of the motion which deals with the need to improve industrial relations in the health service and i approach the subject with considerable diffidence because i have absolutely no experience of these matters in the service itself <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement which like the noble baroness lady birk we very much regret <e> <s> we are not without <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for his clear explanation of these two orders <e> <s> i do not propose to revert to the situation a year ago when i seem to recall playing some small and i am sure wholly emollient part in the proceedings <e> <s> nor i think is it appropriate to revert to the debate that we had more recently last july on two other orders concerning employment protection and unfair dismissal and affecting small employers one increasing the qualifying period for unfair dismissal and the other reducing the compulsory period for consultation with trade unions in the case of certain redundancies <e> <s> on that occasion on balance my noble friends and i supported the government because of our over-riding concern for the welfare of small businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> i had not intended to intervene but i did not realise that the discussion would centre so largely on inflation and counter-inflation <e> <s> perhaps i should have foreseen that that would happen <e> <s> however would the noble earl agree that one relatively uncontroversial way of at least seeking to contain the problem would be to go for what i believe the west germans call concerted action making use perhaps of some such body as the existing national economic development council seeking to find by agreement between the government employers and trade unions or their representatives some agreed means by which wage increases could be limited so that they did not exceed to the very considerable extent that they do now increases in productivity <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems a long time since we began <e> <s> from these benches i should like first to join other noble lords in congratulating the three noble lords who have made their maiden speeches in this house this afternoon <e> <s> they have all come to us with a fine record from another place and we hope that their counsel will be made as freely available to us now in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl accept that in the light of recent judgments and events many of us welcome his recognition that there is an urgent need for parliament itself to make clear what immunities should apply in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> lord kaldor for having introduced this motion <e> <s> i do not for myself feel that there is need to dwell on the last part of the motion for we may all readily agree that if only we could solve our basic economic and industrial problems then the economy would grow the standard of living and the level of employment would rise and we should be in a better position to defend ourselves <e> <s> as to the governments policies i suppose that a great many of us anyway would agree that inflation remains public enemy number one and that the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to join in thanking the noble earl for having repeated this statement <e> <s>

unemployed young people <e> <s> we welcome also the maintaining of the community industry scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords does it not follow that the primary responsibility for solving this problem rests with ourselves and not with the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment which has been moved by my noble friend lord avebury <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that it was only yesterday that the parliamentary under-secretary of state for education mr neil macfarlane said that he and other ministers were constantly disturbed by the discrepancy they found going around the country between the number of people who are unemployed and the number of vacancies for skilled workers <e> <s> i suggest that the government have a glorious opportunity here to alleviate the problem of unemployment and at the same time to deal with this mis-match within the labour market <e>", "<cs> my lords we are coming to the end of this debate and the questions which are uppermost in my mind are these has it been justified <e> <s> what purpose has it served <e> <s> and what practical benefits will it bring <e> <s> i should like to go along with the noble lord lord mishcon in some of the things he has said about it but i honestly cannot <e> <s> i do not feel that there has been much justification for it nor that it will prove to have served any very useful purpose <e> <s> it must be the fourth or fifth debate on the present governments economic and industrial policies that we have had since they <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness does not really think me to be so arrogant a person as she seems to be making out <e> <s> the distinctive point about the liberal party policy which may not amount to a miracle but which is sorely needed as i tried to indicate resides in this point our problems are now so deep-seated and intractable that neither of the major parties will be able single-handed to solve them and it is only when we are prepared to come together that we shall have a hope of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for that compliment <e>", "<cs> i am rather sorry that the noble lord lord lee of newton has framed this amendment in the way he has <e> <s> my noble friends and i sympathise with the view that the neb should retain two of the three functions that the amendment deals with and about which the noble lord lord lee has just spoken <e> <s> we believe that the board should retain the power to promote or assist the reorganisation of industry as he has suggested <e> <s> we have consistently expressed the view that the board should be able to continue its work on as broadly agreed a basis as possible irrespective of the political complexion of the government of the day <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all those who have spoken in this little debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord lee of newton to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to the noble lord lord gore-booth for their support <e> <s> i was frankly depressed by the contribution of the noble lord lord shinwell <e> <s> if and in so far as it is that union members do not want the sort of thing that this amendment seeks to achieve then i suggest that that is largely why we are in the mess that we are in <e>", "<cs> i shall not follow the noble viscount down that particular road <e> <s> i endeavoured to look knowledgeable while he was speaking but i do not think that any contribution that i can helpfully make will touch on that technicality <e> <s> we should like to support this amendment if indeed i have properly understood its general purpose <e> <s> from the quizzical look from the noble viscount i am beginning to wonder whether i have <e> <s> however let me proceed <e> <s> if i make any errors or have any second thoughts they can always be remedied in the division lobby later should the amendment be pressed that far <e>", "<cs> as one who has just given evidence of support to the labour opposition by voting with them on the last amendment may i endeavour to mediate <e> <s> i must say that for our part for i think i speak for my noble friends as well we feel that what the noble viscount has just said is not unreasonable <e> <s> it seems to follow on what we have just done <e> <s> we have had a vote on the principle involved and have gone our separate ways <e>

relevant copy of <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether before the noble viscount replies i may intervene in an endeavour to make progress in a generally acceptable way <e> <s> if i may latch on to something which i understood the noble lord lord bruce to say earlier <e> <s> he wished to reserve to himself the right to revert to the question of the amounts of aid to be given when perhaps tomorrow we come to the very important clause which deals with regional development grants <e> <s> i was not quite sure to what the noble lords were going to lead either in relation to any action he might feel like advising his noble friends to take in relation to this amendment or indeed precisely what he would have in mind for tomorrow <e> <s> i always listen with the greatest care to what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has to say and i was impressed by what he said as always <e> <s> however i wonder whether he and indeed other noble lords of the labour opposition might feel that the better place in which to resolve this question of principle in regard to amounts of aid might be under clause rather than now <e> <s> certainly if that was their view subject of course to the way in which the debate on clause might proceed i think they are likely to find a sympathetic response to their views from these benches <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot really get very excited about this clause <e> <s> as i understand it the government now wish to remove from the national enterprise board the power to provide technical assistance to countries overseas and leave it to the overseas development office to deal with the matter <e> <s> when the power was given to the national enterprise board under the industry act i think it was acknowledged by the spokesman for the labour government at the time that this power was in the nature of an experiment <e> <s> i think also i am right in saying that it has not yet been used <e> <s> i can therefore understand the governments view that the power should be concentrated in the hands of a single agency and not of the neb <e> <s> on the other hand just because it has proved to be of such little significance in practice and in order to minimise the area of disagreement between the political parties as to the powers of the board i personally would not mind very much if the national enterprise board was left with this particular power <e>", "<cs> our first reaction from these benches is also to support the idea underlying the amendment which has just been moved <e> <s> i see no reason why we should not join with the noble lord lord lee of newton in supporting it <e>", "<cs> we debated at some length last july what i understand has now become the content of this clause <e> <s> i then spoke and we on these benches voted against making cuts in regional aid of as much as million out of million over as short a period as the next three years <e> <s> i suggested then that it might have been better to adopt a more gradual approach to the problem not simply to limit the extent to which there was disagreement between the political parties on this sensitive subject but also to enable the government to see what effect their policies were having on investment profitability and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl for not being present when he began his explanation of this order but may i join the noble lord lord blease in thanking the noble earl for the clear way in which i heard him explaining the part of the order that i was <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of merely making statements of condemnation as advocated by the first questioner would not the government also be well advised to encourage activities aimed at obtaining a clearer understanding on the part of trade union members that improved living standards are more likely to be achieved through continuity than through disruption of production <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have joined in this discussion and i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington and to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for their support <e> <s> i was interested of course in the observations of the noble lord lord campbell of croy because although i did not name him he was as he has acknowledged one of the conservative peers who were involved in the episode to which i referred in <e> <s> he asked the noble viscount how far the machinery that was then instituted had been activated <e> <s> he has not as yet received an answer <e> <s> but i would like to say that it is not of course that machinery that i am seeking in this amendment to activate it is as i was seeking to say something very much more general and more modest <e> <s> in particular there is no reference in the amendment as i also indicated to any specific items of information which might in themselves have given rise to controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house would it be helpful to the noble lord lord robbins if i sought to suggest to him as we value so much his contributions that he phrase what he has to say in the form of a question to me before i sit down <e> <s> is that of help to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like from these benches to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for the clear way in which he has explained the principles of this bill involving as it does such a complex subject <e> <s> i recall speaking in the debate nine years ago to which the noble lord lord mccarthy has just referred on behalf of my noble friends when the industrial relations bill of an earlier conservative government was introduced into this house <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord donovan whose renowned royal commission had reported three years earlier spoke immediately after me and i have found it instructive to read again what it was that lord donovan then had to say <e> <s> i quote from col of the <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lord lord shinwell i hope that on this and other amendments we can confine ourselves to the substance of the amendments with which we are dealing rather than speak on more general matters which the committee may agree are better dealt with when we consider the question whether a particular clause shall stand part <e>", "<cs> those of us who wish to speak must do so as individual members of this committee and i should like briefly to do that on the basis of such industrial experience as i have had <e> <s> in this matter it seems to me that the secret ballot will prosper more by way of encouragement than compulsion so there can be no possible grounds for a feeling on the part of trade unions that their leadership is being undermined <e> <s> i know that the noble viscount lord colville of culross claimed that there was no compulsion about this but i respectfully suggest to him that in so far as a particular number or proportion of the workforce affected by potential industrial action may express the wish for a ballot then as the noble lord lord underhill correctly said ballots there must be and to that extent the position is surely a mandatory one <e> <s> i will not say the purpose but certainly an effect of this new clause is understandably to take away power from union leaders in certain circumstances and give it to people on the shop floor <e>", "<cs> to put it in another way which i hope may be even more succinct is not the noble lord seeking to deny these rights to people who while neither in employment nor having the offer of a job are nevertheless seeking one <e> <s> surely that is the effect of what he is trying to do is it not <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like first to join in thanking and indeed congratulating the noble lord lord schon on having selected as the subject for this debate the need in the national interest to increase our productivity substantially <e> <s> he could not in my view have chosen a matter more vital for our future <e> <s> i particularly liked the way in which he treated this concept of us and them <e> <s> how right he was to suggest that we have somehow to get into the way of thinking of all of us as being together and of them as being our international competitors <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment because of its close association with amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall shortly come and with the principle of which i very much agree <e> <s> i do not intend to say more than that on the amendment which has just been moved except that i wonder whether i may make what is really a procedural point at the start of what looks like being a very lengthy committee stage of the bill for this week <e>", "<cs> i would like to speak in favour of this amendment <e> <s> although what i said earlier on on a procedural point may appear to have application to this amendment too there are in my view special reasons for its inclusion now in much the same form as it appeared in another place <e> <s> may i take this opportunity of thanking the noble lord lord wedderburn for the gracious way in which he received what i had to say on the procedural point <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with what the noble lord lord howie of troon has said <e> <s> on the other hand i can almost hear the noble and learned lord the lord advocate saying in reply that if special situations such as those with which this amendment is concerned are included in the bill as affording reasonable grounds why people should not be excluded from union membership then the bill will become cluttered up the noble and learned lord has already used that phrase once this afternoon with a whole host of other situations calling similarly for special treatment <e>", "<cs> at second reading i made plain that we on these benches were not altogether happy about the way in which under this bill companies were to be treated differently depending simply on their size however that may be judged the number of people employed and so on <e> <s> we have for a long time advocated that more needed to be done for the encouragement of small businesses but as i pointed out then it is often the employee in a small firm who is more vulnerable and in need of protection than others <e> <s> if therefore i have understood this clause and this amendment correctly i think we have some sympathy with some of the points at least that the noble lord lord balogh has just enunciated <e>", "<cs> the noble earl will understand that my concern is solely with these words <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps it is the turn of someone from these benches <e> <s> i should like to make plain at the start in the plainest possible terms that i and my noble friends detest the illiberal philosophy underlying the imposition of the closed shop in its most pitiless form <e> <s> i assure the noble marquess and the noble and gallant viscount lord de lisle that they could not feel more strongly on this than i do <e> <s> i recall the seething anger i felt against the tyranny of those responsible in for the dismissal of people who had been faithful employees of british rail for many years <e> <s> the question of the closed shop as i see it is indeed a matter of conscience and in what i say i shall speak only for myself my noble friends are quite capable of expressing their own opinions if they wish <e>", "<cs> we have made such good progress that perhaps the noble earl will not take it amiss if i say a few words now <e> <s> i suggested earlier that as an alternative to further immediate legislation on the closed shop it would be better to operate through the code of practice that is promised by the secretary of state <e> <s> i cannot think of a better subject for inclusion in that code than the question raised in this amendment of how best to review the support for existing closed shops <e>", "<cs> in view of the remarks made by the noble earl concerning the attitude of the liberal party would he accept that in certain orders which we debated last november i speaking for my noble friends anticipated the employment protection legislation which is now being introduced <e> <s> i said that in my view in terms of rights such as those we are now discussing there was not really a case for distinguishing between firms simply on account of their size and i think i am right in saying that nothing that the noble baroness said at second reading on this bill differed from what i have now said <e> <s> i do not want to make a great meal of this <e> <s> we shall come to the employment protection clauses a little later but in view of what the noble earl said i felt that i should say something on those lines just to put the matter straight as i understand and recollect it <e>", "<cs>

noble lord lord mccarthy has said but i do not think i should let this go by without registering that point of view <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord mccarthy in what he has just said <e> <s> i am not sure that at one oclock in the morning when challenged by the noble earl lord gowrie i was altogether coherent in endeavouring to show why it was that despite our support for small businesses we could not go along with the government in this regard <e> <s> if i may try just once more it is that we do not see why simply because there are distinctions in the numbers of people employed in different firms there should be different rights <e> <s> i do not propose to say more than that now but our position seems to us to hold good in respect of this amendment and therefore i support the labour opposition on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i do not think the noble earl really meant it but he gave me the impression that he thought that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that i was most interested in his comments about pay settlements in the public sector more particularly in the public services and we must all hope that if guidelines such as those he has outlined are introduced they will indeed work <e> <s> but has he any ideas which he would like to put before us as to how they might be enforced should that regrettably become necessary in the face of union opposition in for example the utilities to which he referred <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the noble lord lord mccarthy at least to the extent that our feeling is that the provisions of this clause are on the face of them retrograde if only because in moving as the government propose from fixed to so-called rolling periods they appear to be widening

sufficiently plain <e> <s> i fully understand why it is that the government have introduced this provision in <e>", "<cs> i am not qualified to debate with the noble lord lord wedderburn some of the legal niceties to which he has referred but a certain sense of filial piety obliges me to rise to my feet <e> <s> it was in that my father was first returned to another place as liberal member for rochester under the administration of campbell-bannerman <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to and i recall from the celebrated correspondence in <e>", "<cs> my understanding of the effect of leaving out these words is that people not involved in a dispute but working for someone else at a different place could be forced to join not necessarily the union involved in the dispute but another union

banter about the so-called all-party group to which the noble lord lord orr-ewing referred <e> <s> there is in your lordships house another group the industrial study group of which i have the honour

from these benches i should like to thank the minister for having repeated this statement <e> <s> i do not think i can thank him for much else <e> <s> it is a harsh statement and in my view inadequate to meet the present situation <e> <s> as i said in response to the statement made last week on remedial measures for areas affected by the steel rundown we on these benches accept the need for the restructuring of the steel industry and therefore i think i can fairly claim that we have already shown our willingness to approach this problem in a positive way <e> <s> but as i have also made plain before the government have a very heavy responsibility to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that action should not be taken at consett that results in intolerable social strains for that single industry town and its fine workforce <e> <s> has the british steel corporation considered inviting the trade unions to examine with them whether there is any economic basis perhaps even including some reductions in pay that would enable consett which is still potentially profitable retains

to honour at consett the undertaking that has been given to give all this summers school-leavers training or other work opportunities by next easter and also to make places available under the scheme to all young people who have been unemployed for more than months <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble viscount will be aware that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not one of those who in committee spoke on this particular amendment <e> <s> but like the noble earl lord dc la warr who i see is about to take his place i feel some sympathy for what the noble lord lord mccarthy had to say on the last occasion and i took comfort from the response of the noble lord lord lyell at that time <e> <s> i think that i see the distinction between expulsion and what the noble lord lord mccarthy called lapsed membership <e> <s> as i have said to that extent i feel some sympathy with what the noble lord has had to say and i <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i supported the amendment to which the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton referred <e> <s> i did so because i very much agreed with the principle that trade union procedures should be exhausted before complaints were laid before tribunals in much

supported the first reason given by the noble lord lord howie of troon as to why this clause should not be included in the bill and i shall therefore say no more about that <e> <s> however i wish for

programme <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any prospect of employers being given relief <e> <s> i ask this in view of the fact that as the noble earl has indicated they are precluded from giving skilled training to young people by the higher rates of pay that they are required to give to apprentices in particular during the last year or two of their training <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble baroness agree that it might help to avert action of this kind if the government were to enter into consultations with representatives of employers and trade unions aimed at establishing agreed long-term arrangements for pay determination on a much wider basis than those which are required to deal merely with ambulancemen or for that matter ambulancemen policemen and firemen <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we cannot support these amendments <e> <s> we take an entirely contrary view to that of the noble lord lord ponsonby in feeling that the extensive changes in the duties and powers of the

annual operating costs <e> <s> the money is needed as the noble viscount lord hanworth has said to finance generous severance payments and also inflation-protected pensions which people in industry

continue to feel that there is a continuing place for the law in terms of the operation of arrange <e>", "<cs> my lords is it still the governments view that legislation on the closed shop should be directed towards remedying identified abuses of the existing law rather than immediately outlawing the closed shop altogether <e> <s> in that connection since our debates on this subject six months ago have there come to light any further cases of employers making it a retrospective requirement that their employees should be trade union members <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree that it would be helpful if in the normal process of collective bargaining employers and trade unions were to agree that there should be a gradual reduction in the percentage of the adult rate now paid to apprentices and to young semi-skilled and unskilled workers <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to allay public anxiety on this matter will the government consider whether there is any practical way of making more widely available information such as that in the scott report on the relative value of index-linked pensions to their recipients <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches wish to join in thanking the noble lord lord wolfenden for the clear way in which he introduced the debate and for my part to say how grateful i am to him and the members of his committee for allowing me to join in the discussions on this crucial matter <e> <s> i am glad also to associate myself subject to one important qualification to which i shall return with the conclusions reached by the committee and expressed in the final paragraphs of the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have this opportunity to make it plain to the noble lord lord mccarthy that the whole tenor of my remarks was intended to be directed to the proposition that the law should play as little a part in all this as possible <e> <s> i hoped i had made it plain that there was one exception to this in my view namely that the time had now come when consultative committees should be set up in companies over and above a certain size and that the employee representatives on those committees should have the right to be consulted about certain specified matters <e>", "<cs> my lords whether in future industrial training is to be done under statutory boards or by voluntary arrangements if programmes such as the <e>", "<cs> my lords in the gracious speech and again in the words of the noble baroness lady young this afternoon the utmost importance is attached to the maintenance of progress in reducing inflation by the pursuit of firm monetary and fiscal policies and the hope is expressed that this will be assisted by further reductions in the level of wage settlements <e> <s> that goes to the heart of the matter and i accept that a reduction in the rate of inflation should have the highest priority <e> <s> on these benches our disagreement with the government concerns the means adopted to achieve that objective <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a number of policies to one of which i was about to refer <e> <s> on others we are working and i can assure the noble earl that when the time comes there will be a full programme of policies set before him and the electorate at large <e> <s> prominent among the policies of the alliance indeed will be a more representative electoral system <e> <s> it will be aimed at bringing to a halt at last the unending shifts in economic and industrial policy which in recent years have done so much damage to our country <e> <s> it is not a soft centre option but our greatest national need that ground should be marked out on which people of any political persuasion and of none can come together in a common endeavour to solve <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness the leader of the house for having repeated the statement <e> <s> the statement does not say so but we are of course concerned as is the noble lord lord peart that the governments decision in this matter appears to run counter to the conclusions reached less than months ago by the all-party treasury and civil service committee in another place <e> <s> we are much more concerned about the damaging effects that this somewhat precipitate announcement may have on the morale of civil servants <e> <s> we note that the staff of the civil service department are today being told of the details but we should like to know what consultation there was with the civil service unions before the decision was taken <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to thank the noble baroness lady david for introducing this debate <e> <s> i do not intend to engage in the ping-pong match that has been going on between the government and opposition front benches <e> <s> the subjects of education and industrial training are far too serious for that <e> <s> but i do wish to speak on both of them as far as i can from personal experience <e> <s> perhaps i may introduce a lighter note into the debate for a moment <e> <s> i must say that the remarks of the noble lord lord elton about his noble friend lord trenchard reminded me rather of the first lines of the old music-hall song thats my brother silvest <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord ferrers for having repeated this statement <e> <s> we have noted the decision to increase to in the number of places on the community enterprise programme <e> <s> but since this is the only programme catering for the long-term unemployed whose number i understand is expected to rise next year to more than million we cannot be satisfied with the extent of the provision made for them under the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate referred to a large employer <e> <s> is it the intention that under the new training initiative more financial help should be given to large employers willing to give training to more skilled people than they themselves will later be able to employ <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be for the convenience of the house if we now resume our debate <e> <s> from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord beswick for having introduced this motion and in doing so to give him a large measure of support <e> <s> next i must apologise to him to the noble lord lord cockfield and indeed to the house in general for the fact that i shall have to leave before the end of the debate in order to fulfil a long-standing engagement elsewhere this evening <e> <s> i think i can claim that this is the first time that i have misbehaved in this way so i hope that for this once i may be forgiven <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly on that part of the motion which calls attention to the need for a better educated working population <e> <s> in doing so i shall cover ground which has not so far been covered in the debate <e> <s> i hope what i have to say will not be thought irrelevant at least it may have the merit of bringing a change of air so to speak into the house for a short time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support my noble friend lord thurso and others who have spoken in support of the amendment that he has moved for the reasons that they have given <e> <s> i speak as someone who for many years has been a supporter of and indeed has held some office in the scout movement <e> <s> i know that that movement is concerned lest the traditional freedom which scouts have enjoyed to engage in processions of the kind that have been talked about should be impaired <e> <s> i mind less about the identity of the authority which should be involved though i have sympathy with what the noble lord lord howie of troon has just said in relation to this being localised so far as possible <e> <s> i very much hope that it will be found possible for traditional processions of the kind that have been spoken about to proceed unless it is that some specific reason can be advanced by the appropriate authority why they should not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i speak for the whole house in thanking the noble lord lord molloy for having introduced this motion <e> <s> if i may say so i particularly admired the humanity and humility with which he related these complex problems to his own experience <e> <s> if he will allow me to say so i was just a little sorry that since this short debate covers such a very wide area each of the two parts of the motion was not more evidently related to the other <e> <s> but in his speech the noble lord lord molloy has made plain to us the connection in his mind between the two parts of the motion and in my own contribution i shall do what i can to link the development of new technology about which like the noble lord i feel a certain humility in talking at all if not to youth unemployment alone at least to unemployment in a wider and more general sense <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i hope that he will forgive me for intervening in this way for there is so much on which i agree with him <e> <s> i do not want to cross swords with him but rather seek a point of clarification <e> <s> i was naturally very interested in what he had to say about the institutional framework and the superficial difference at any rate between himself and me on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords do not these exchanges demonstrate the need for a pay policy which caters not only for employees in the national health service but for those employed in public services generally <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not greatly to be regretted that in the absence of any general arrangements for determining pay in the public services and when certain public servants have recently been awarded relatively high increases in their salaries there appears to be no means by which this particular dispute can be referred to independent arbitration <e>", "<cs> my lords we are drawing nearer the end of this debate and like others i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord kilmarnock for having introduced it <e> <s> at one time i thought that we were all going to be of one voice <e> <s> but some of the more recent contributions have clearly been dissentient from the general body of opinion that this task group report is to be welcomed <e> <s> as regards the noble lord lord spens and to some degree the noble lord lord parry i might have had somewhat more to say in answer to their criticisms were it not for the fact that in my view at least what they had to say has largely already been answered by the noble lord lord roberthall <e> <s> i do not think that i can usefully add to the comments that he made except perhaps to say how very much i agree with what it was he had to say right at the end namely that this report has something to offer us that is constructive and in that respect at least offers perhaps rather more than and i do not want to introduce a controversial note some of the policies of the present government leading as they have done not i am sure deliberately but in their effect to larger scale unemployment among young people <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to consider suggestions as to how through appropriate legislative means still more share ownership schemes can be encouraged <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if we now return to the discussion on the employment bill <e> <s> from these benches i should like first to join in thanking the noble lord lord cockfield if not for the temper of his speech at least for the clear way in which he explained to us the provisions of this bill <e> <s> speaking on behalf of my noble friends on the employment bill i expressed the hope that once certain identified abuses had been remedied there would be no need for further legislation until there had been a period for digestion in which the bill could be given a chance to work <e> <s> that was said in the belief that if our industrial relations law is to be effective it must command the widest possible support including particularly that of the general body of trade unionists and also because in our view legislation of this kind does nothing positively to improve human relations in industry <e> <s> i see no reason to depart from that basic position <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i was at pains to say the opposite that in the case of clause we on these benches were happy that that clause should take immediate effect <e> <s> what i had to say in regard to deferment until after the general election related to clause of the bill and the application of secret ballots more particularly in the case of existing closed shops <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered the possibility of permitting disputes in the health service such as this to be submitted to some form of independent arbitration because as he rightly says the government in the last resort are the pay master the government as it were being permitted to refrain from accepting the outcome of the independent arbitration subject to an affirmative resolution by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> at second reading i made plain that we on these benches support in principle the secretary of state being empowered to compenstate the individuals to whom the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton has referred <e> <s> however on the face of it to us it seems reasonable that when the secretary of state is taking powers to disburse what are potentially large sums of money i think that on this point i cannot agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter without reference to industrial tribunals that are available for the purpose or even without necessarily having to consult anyone else then as the amendment proposes there should at least be some obligation on him to give reasons for the decision that he has reached and to publish any report that might have been made by the person appointed by him under schedule <e> <s> while there might be doubt as to the practicality of ascertaining as is suggested in the next amendment the opinion of the former employer and the trade union which may earlier have been involved i have considerable sympathy with the principle that the secretary of state should be made more accountable for the decisions that he makes in this matter <e>", "<cs> i simply want to say briefly from these benches that throughout the period from to we have consistently argued that grounds for unfair dismissal should include not it is true deeply held personal convictions but conscientious grounds as well as grounds of religious conviction <e> <s> it is for that reason that we shall vote for this clause standing part of the bill <e>", "<cs> like the last two noble lords i should like to address myself to the principle involved here <e> <s> at second reading i made it plain that as liberals we find the whole concept of the closed shop objectionable in principle and we were therefore sympathetic to any practicable restriction on its operation <e> <s> indeed speaking only for myself i went on to say that experience in large-scale industry led me to think that statutory periodic reviews of closed shops at this juncture might prove ineffective <e> <s> it was with that consideration in mind that i then suggested what the noble lord lord houghton has just referred to namely that at the committee stage it might be helpful if instead of merely being reminded that the balloting provisions would not come into force for another one or two years we could be assured that they would not operate until after the next general election <e>", "<cs> i shall resist the temptation to dwell on what the noble lord lord hatch said except to say that what was said by my noble friend lady seear was entirely consistent with the remarks made by my honourable friend mr cyril smith in another place <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock sought to justify the attitude taken in your lordships house on this point in relation to what was said in another place <e> <s> i suggest that the easiest way of finding out quickly how the alliance will vote is to enable the vote now to take place and i sense that that is what the committee wish to do <e> <s> i hope that red herrings because i do not think they are much more than that such as that introduced by lord hatch will not be proceeded with further either now or later or we shall find ourselves here until three oclock tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur for the clear way in which he has explained this order <e> <s> i am ashamed to say that i was not even aware of the background which led to the postponement and to the movement of the order today <e> <s> perhaps like the noble lord lord underhill in this somewhat complex situation i do not feel as well briefed as i should be on this subject <e> <s> but like the noble lord lord underhill i am grateful for the clear explanation which the noble lord lord glenarthur has given about some of the questions raised yesterday <e> <s> on the face of it what he said appears to clear up any misunderstandings there may have been and subject to anything further that the noble lord lord glenarthur may have to say in response to the outstanding question raised by the noble lord lord underhill i think i may say that my noble friends and i are content with the order that has been placed before the house <e>", "<cs> it is significant i suggest that two of the most respected organisations in the country dealing with industrial relations namely the institute of personnel management and the industrial society both have expressed disquiet about the effects of these high levels of compensation available through the special award <e> <s> the institute of personnel management feels that they will offer too much scope for exploitation by unscrupulous individuals who may be attracted by the money the industrial society has expressed similar views and the same point was exposed very clearly in the discussion initiated by the noble lord lord mottistone last week when he referred to the special difficulties that could arise within the shipping industry in that connection <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would help if i were to suggest to the government that there is a case for them to stay their hand for the moment on this particular amendment if i have understood it correctly until such time as we have been able to debate and decide on this same principle of vicarious liability in relation to clause and subsequent clauses so that there might not be need this evening to press this particular point to a division as might otherwise be the case <e> <s> the matter might be left open until that time <e> <s> when we are clearer as no doubt we shall be as to the decision of principle which as a committee we shall take in due course on those later clauses it might then be possible to come back to this at report stage in a way that we might all find more generally acceptable <e>", "<cs> i had something to say on this clause at second reading that it would effectively enable employers to dismiss strikers selectively <e> <s> i think on reflection perhaps it would have been more accurate for me to have said that the effect of subsection appears to be to reduce from perpetuity to three months the possibility of an employer being open to legal action for selectively re-engaging <e> <s> but is it not <e>", "<cs> at the beginning of this discussion i think i can say that i had a completely open mind on this point <e> <s> until now we have been discussing union membership agreements <e> <s> this clause has to do with union recognition requirements <e> <s> i must confess that i was a little concerned as to the reason why this new clause was being suggested <e> <s> i felt that it might indicate some feeling on the governments part that union membership should in some way be discouraged <e> <s> however as i understand it an abuse has been uncovered in which certain local authorities or a certain local authority is seeking to exclude from lists of tenderers firms which do not recognise trade unions <e>", "<cs> i am just a little troubled about this matter as i endeavoured to indicate in our second reading debate <e> <s> i do not quarrel at all with what the government as i understand it have in mind in seeking to alter the law in relation to trade disputes in principle <e> <s> but i am a little concerned as to how far their proposals may work in practice <e> <s> to that extent therefore i have if not sympathy with what the noble lord lord mccarthy has just said some understanding of the noble lords position <e> <s> i wonder in particular as he does whether the proposed legislation takes sufficient account of trade union structure as it actually exists and whether it takes sufficient account of how far union officials possess in reality and are actually capable of using the powers that they are assumed in this bill to have <e> <s> i wanted to say that at some point and it may be that this is the most appropriate point at which to say it <e>", "<cs> i wish to <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord jenkins will be patient he may hear one now <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with the general expressions of view there have so far been but i have some reservations on grounds not of principle but of practicality about the making of secret ballots before major industrial action mandatory at least at this stage in our development <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that although i have a great deal of sympathy with the objective of this amendment i have very little sympathy with the immediate mandatory means by which it is sought to achieve that objective <e> <s> as the consultative document on trade union immunities published last year pointed out the whole question of the removal of immunity from industrial action taken in breach of collective agreements is inextricably bound up with the further problem of whether it is feasible to make agreements legally enforceable contracts <e> <s> for the reasons given in the green paper i fear that there is a great deal of education needed before negotiators are sufficiently convinced of the desirability of such arrangements for them to become workable in this country <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to all the noble lords who have contributed to this interesting and i think useful discussion and for the general if somewhat limited welcome it has received <e> <s> i do not really think there is very much danger of rushing into legislation <e> <s> as i sought to say it is now more than five years since the bullock report on this subject was published and there is pressure from europe upon us to do something <e> <s> at second reading i said that really i was not fussy about the wording of this and we could perhaps work it out together <e> <s> for example there is nothing sacrosanct about the date of st september to which i referred <e> <s> i had hoped that it would be seen that there was nothing rigid in this system but rather that one of its aims was to be as flexible as possible while requiring some progress to be made <e> <s> the intention is certainly to build on the best practice that there is in this field <e>", "<cs> i too would like to encourage the government to respond as positively as possible to the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord bellwin for repeating the statement <e> <s> the situation is indeed a grave one as the statement says <e> <s> it is one in which in our view the long-term interests of the community must prevail and to that end we feel bound to support the british rail board in their decision to give <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches should like to join in thanking the noble lord for having repeated the statement <e> <s> we join also in urging the health unions now urgently to reconsider their case for taking industrial action as the statement puts it <e> <s> we hope too that they will now accept the secretary of states offer to have talks about improving arrangements for their pay in the future <e> <s> as is well known we have long considered that there is an urgent need to establish agreed long-term arrangements for pay determination covering not only nurses or even all those employed in the health service but the public services as a whole <e> <s> is the noble lord aware i am sure he is of our belief that it is only in this way that particular categories such as health service workers who now feel unfairly treated can be expected to renounce industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate which i think has been worthy of the subject matter <e> <s> i do not want to detain your lordships for very long and i think it would be fair to say that i endeavoured to anticipate in my opening remarks a number of the arguments which have been adduced against this amendment <e> <s> but a number of points have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> we are good friends and i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury if he will forgive me for saying so seemed to come very near to being complacent in this matter <e> <s> i can only say that if he has been engaged throughout the years of his distinguished industrial connections with only those firms which have good employee involvement policies he must have been very fortunate <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i should respond briefly to the bait put before me by the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> but it will be brief <e> <s> i think that he is stirring the pot <e> <s> i think that he is wasting the time of the house in that we have better things to do than argue on this point <e> <s> briefly on behalf of my party i have made it plain that we oppose the closed shop in principle but we have some reservations on practical grounds concerning the operation of the ballots <e> <s> it is for that reason your lordships will remember that we put forward certain amendments which were designed to reduce the percentage of support required before an existing closed shop would retain protection <e> <s> we made it plain that we prefer the government way of approaching this method however by that kind of ballot rather than by the trigger <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl however agree that although as we understand it he has openly said that he and his party are out to clobber certain public authorities in the closed shop area there are also cases in the private sector of employers who on the grounds of race or colour may find it possible to make people redundant for example <e> <s> are there not cases of injustice of that kind which it is fair to treat on a par with those he mentions in relation to public authorities in another connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble earl lord ferrers for having made that statement <e> <s> we are glad that the government have accepted the principle underlying the amendment which i moved last week and which the house accepted as being appropriate for inclusion as the first clause in the bill <e> <s> however i do not at first sight see why the government say that they consider it might be more appropriate to incorporate the wishes of the house in an order made under the companies act rather than in the present bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that my noble friends for i think i speak for them as well and i cannot support this amendment in its present form <e> <s> it is of course deplorable as the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith has understandably reminded us that industrial action should be taken in these circumstances as it is now being taken by people who are employed in occupations that are vital to the immediate support of life <e> <s> but we do not think it is feasible to operate legal sanctions and despite what the noble lord lord mottistone has said and subject to what the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has to say i think that inherent in this amendment are legal sanctions <e> <s> we do not think it is feasible to operate such sanctions against the ultimate right of individuals or groups such as those concerned in these disputes to withdraw their labour <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure if after discussion of this amendment certain noble lords opposite will be more or less disappointed with my noble friends and myself for i think that i shall be speaking for them too <e> <s> in any case what we say will continue to be determined not by the esteem in which our words are held by noble lords opposite but by what we think <e>", "<cs> my lords i can never be quite sure at this time of the night whether i actually said what i intended to say but i think that what i said was that i found it difficult unreservedly either to support or to oppose this amendment <e> <s> that is not to say that if this amendment is pressed to a division i shall sit on the fence <e> <s> i shall find it hard to make a judgment but a judgment will no doubt be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the whole house will be grateful to the noble earl lord ferrers for the wax in which he has so clearly explained the background to this amendment <e> <s> i am also most grateful for the kind remarks he has made about me personally <e>", "<cs> my lords since it seems to me that this amendment may be pressed to a division i think that i owe it to the house to say just a word or two <e> <s> i find myself with those who feel that this clause is not an appropriate vehicle in which to seek to introduce points of this nature and i hope i have made it plain in this house before now that i am all in favour of trade unions and of consultation with them <e> <s> with those few words however i must make it plain that if there is a division i shall advise my noble friends not to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl lord ferrers has already remarked from these benches we have given the government broad support on many of the more contentious provisions of the bill <e> <s> i have in mind those concerning the closed shop trade union immunities unfair dismissal complainants being enabled to joint unions in dismissal proceedings commercial contracts being made void in so far as they require employment of union labour only and so on <e> <s> we have done that despite the difficulties which in my view some of these proposals might well produce in practice because we have felt that they are reasonable responses to identified abuses of the employment act <e>", "<cs> my lords in their funding plans do the government aim to bring the university grants committee into closer relationship with the structures now being set up to deal with higher education in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that what he said initially on this subject at this crucial moment should he directed primarily towards ensuring that in the vote on thursday and friday the miners reach a responsible decision <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for having repeated this statement <e> <s> we cannot rid ourselves of the suspicion that what on the governments own showing should be a commercial proposition is prompted as to its timing at least in part by political considerations <e> <s> does this not invite a government of a different political complexion to resume control over this great national asset <e> <s> indeed only a few minutes ago did we not hear something from the noble lord lord scanlon to that effect <e> <s> would this not then prove to be a further instance of that continual swing from one industrial policy to another which has done so much damage to british industry over

sufficient to give the increasing number of long-term unemployed who may seek their guidance adequate counselling <e> <s> we are of course glad that to enable a fair comparison to be made of past and future unemployment figures are today being published on the new basis covering the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government still feel the same about the findings of an arbitration body if

gone on a long time but is the noble lord able to give us briefly any information about the development of the open tech which i think was not among the agencies to which he referred when replying to

endanger life or limb from withdrawing their labour if they are determined so to do <e> <s> i do hope that in saying that i shall not be accused of caring more about the right to strike than about the right to live because that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a body as influential and impartial as the institute of personnel management which has wide knowledge and practical experience in these matters has as i understand it expressed grave reservations about the <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government satisfied that the reduction in the number of civil servants is being achieved on a sufficiently selective basis <e> <s> for example is there not a strong case for there being as many people and perhaps even more in the employment service division of the manpower services commission in order to counsel the increasing number of long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure it is right that thanks to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter we should be having this debate now as part of the consultative process on the green paper before the government make up their mind what legislation if any they should introduce or i suppose more probably what should feature in the conservative party manifesto for the forthcoming general election <e> <s> come to think of it the debate may prove equally helpful to liberals and social democrats should the alliance be called upon to form the next government <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest as pro-chancellor of the university of keele which is one of the seven referred to in this question <e> <s> is it not in fact the case that these universities are to suffer retrospective penalties for exceeding in the year student intake numbers that were not specified as targets to which they would be required to adhere <e> <s> is it not also the case that in their evidence to the select committee in another place the ugc stated that if these numbers were exceeded they would wish to discuss the matter with the university concerned and that no such discussions took place before these penalties were imposed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that the information in his possession is not the same as that in mine <e> <s> is it not also the case that the university grants committee have threatened to impose further penalties for the year without deeming it necessary to indicate the number of admissions to be aimed at in that year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i should have been accused of exercising sinister delaying tactics <e> <s> i had hoped that in my opening speech i had made it sufficiently plain that i think there is need for the law in relation to the payment of wages to be changed <e> <s> it simply is the case that i do not think it right as i also hope i made plain that a consultative exercise having been embarked upon the house should today agree in principle to the repeal of the truck acts without thought of there possibly being need for something to replace them and before taking account of the views expressed during the course of consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords despite or perhaps all the more because of the exchanges of an hour or so ago i should like to join in wishing all members of your lordships house a happy easter and a good rest <e> <s> may i associate those of us on these benches with what has been said about the debt that we owe to the staff of i this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that in the written answer to which the noble earl has just referred the government set out among other organisations ministry of defence civilian establishments including the royal dockyards and the royal ordnance factories which are considering offering places under the youth training scheme <e> <s> may i ask the noble earl whether the government are satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if i may respond it may be that there was a slip of my tongue <e> <s> if so i apologise and i am most grateful to the noble viscount for drawing the attention of the house to it <e> <s> i did indeed mean what he is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all who have joined in this brief debate <e> <s> i am disappointed by the ministers response and as this is such an important matter i am anxious to make sure that i have fully understood what he said before determining what i should invite the house to do <e> <s> i understood him simply to say that british shipbuilders subsidiaries will be required to report progress on employee involvement as now laid down by the employment act but that in the case of the british shipbuilders corporation itself although he has the expectation as i acknowledged in my opening remarks that bs would take action of the same kind in reporting progress in their annual reports that is no more than an expectation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for those comments but i am not satisfied <e> <s> i made it plain that i was moving the amendment not primarily because of what it could do in the corporation as such but as an indication to those responsible in all nationalised industries and in the public services indeed in the public sector generally that more needed to be done in this direction <e> <s> the minister did not say anything to satisfy me on that count <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the noble earl for the way in which he has explained the draft revised code to us <e> <s> in my view this is not the time to debate once more the provisions concerning the closed shop which now form part of the act <e> <s> during the passage of that act we gave the closed shop provisions broad support because we felt that they were reasonable responses to identified abuses of the act and because as liberals we find the whole concept of the closed shop repugnant in principle and are therefore sympathetically disposed towards any workable restrictions of its operation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just a few words about the bill at this stage <e> <s> for reasons that i shall not rehearse now my noble friend lord simon on behalf of my noble friends opposed the bill in principle at second reading as your lordships know <e> <s> we sought to introduce one or two amendments for one of which i was responsible and the noble lord lord trefgarne will not be surprised to be reminded that i regret very much that the government did not feel able to accept the amendment concerned with the subject of employee involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord molloy sits down will he accept that when my noble friend lord ezra advocated as he did a policy of controlled expenditure on our infrastructure and said that wherever possible purchasing should be achieved through british suppliers he also made it very plain that this should in no sense be done at the expense of british competitiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that although government legislation aimed at achieving further so-called privatisation is largely an area within which section of the employment act will apply there will remain a large part of the public sector that is excluded from the relevant section of the act <e> <s> does he further agree that in the public sector there is often a much greater sense of difference between us and them than is the case in many private companies and that it is entirely desirable that this difference be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the way to solve complex problems like unemployment is not to set up more and more commissions but to join in making use of those that already exist particularly since in the case of the manpower services commission it is already representative of employers trade unions and education <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for having repeated the statement by his right honourable friend <e> <s> at this stage i propose to offer only two general observations on the governments legislative proposals <e> <s> the first is that in all the areas covered by the proposals we are satisfied that abuses of union power or of the existing law have been identified and the case has therefore been made out for introducing further legislation <e> <s> at the same time it is important in our view that changes in the law should be of such a kind that they have the support of the general body of trade unionists and therefore have good prospects of proving effective <e> <s> on this score we shall study with particular care the proposals concerning secret ballots before strikes on which in our debate last march on the governments green paper i expressed certain reservations on grounds not of principle but of practicality <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for repeating the statement although i support the noble lord lord bruce of donington in what he had to say as to its timing <e> <s> we have always acknowledged the need for rationalisation of this countrys basic industries including steel so long as due regard is paid to the effect on the people involved <e> <s> moreover although we have no greater love than the govenment for cartels as good europeans we recognise that problems of the kind which have now arisen are best dealt with on a community basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not spoken to this order but if the noble lord is to make a written response to the noble lord lord mccarthy would he be kind enough also to send me a copy of any reply he makes so that we on these benches may be aware of the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be grateful to the noble lord lord jacques for having introduced this motion <e> <s> it will not be possible for anyone on these benches to speak after the noble lord lord dean of beswick has made his maiden speech and so i should like to say how much we are looking forward to hearing him <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the pay of apprentices is fixed at too high a proportion of the adult rate and that this has contributed to a reluctance on the part of employers to train young people for skills <e> <s> is it not desirable that as negotiating opportunities arise we should aim to move closer to the west german system where the pay of trainees is substantially lower than adult rates <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord gowrie for having repeated this statement <e> <s> in this house we have our differences over employment legislation <e> <s> indeed during the passage of the employment bill as it then was my noble friends and i actually voted against the selective dismissal of strikers following industrial action one of the issues in this dispute <e> <s> but a law to which we on these benches in general subscribe has been enacted concerning secondary picketing and it covers among other things this very point of selective dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join in thanking the noble lord lord gray of contin for having repeated the statement <e> <s> i have little to add to what i said in response to the statement upon the dispute last week when i spoke on behalf of my noble friends and allies <e> <s> we share the regret expressed in the statement that it has not been possible to reach an agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> when my noble friend lord harris of greenwich tabled his unstarred question last week i must confess to having had some doubt as to whether it would be opportune for it to be asked today <e> <s> this was because in my experience it has proved to be a sound maxim that during the course of an industrial dispute it is generally best that people who are not aware of all the relevant facts should say as little as possible in case unwittingly they make its resolution more difficult <e> <s> it seems to me <e> <s> however that in the light of the events at warrington during the past two nights the question is asked in a timely way <e> <s> if i may i commend my noble friend on his prescience in putting the question down for today <e> <s> from what my noble friend said it is clear that he has gone to great trouble in obtaining as much first-hand information as possible about this dispute and its origins <e> <s> i should like simply to support him by contributing a few words from the liberal side of our alliance and in so doing to respond as other noble lords have done to one or two of the points made in the discussions so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that the management of change and in this case of contraction calls for special skills and qualities of leadership <e> <s> if graduates of the required potential are not coming forward in sufficient numbers to achieve the governments objectives what is being done to identify the reasons and to put things right <e>", "<cs> my lords while acknowledging that this is a question that would confront any government of whatever political complexion may i ask the noble earl whether he agrees that so far as young people are concerned the heart of the unemployment problem has shifted from school-leavers to those aged between and <e> <s> is he satisfied that the recent government announcement of a target of filled places in the community programme which is to run i understand for a further two years from october is a sufficient response to the problem of the people as he has just told us who have now been unemployed for more than months one in four of whom are aged under <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble viscount lord long for having explained so clearly the terms of this order <e> <s> we find ourselves in general sympathy with what the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede has just said about it but having said that like him on behalf of my noble friends i find the terms of the order acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords following the point made by my noble friend lady seear will the noble viscount also note that in cheshire where i live there were vacancies last month in youth training schemes and unemployed people aged between and who were not eligible under the relevant regulations to fill those vacancies <e> <s> will the government or the manpower services commission consider what further action can therefore be taken to bridge the difference between those two figures which no doubt reflect the position in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady young for having repeated this statement <e> <s> clearly the government are taking a very serious step this afternoon and like the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos we shall need to give it further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the basic question in this debate is whether at gchq the freedom to belong to a trade union and let me say that i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter in that i do regard that as a basic right and liberty can be reconciled with the need to safeguard national security <e> <s> it is a matter of judgment and the government have reached the conclusion that such a reconciliation is not possible <e> <s> moreover it must be acknowledged that with the exception perhaps of the noble lord lord trefgame those of us who are speaking cannot be privy to all the factors which led the government to take their decision <e> <s> we can speak only on the basis of the exchanges that have occurred in parliament during the last two weeks and such other information as we have been able to glean for ourselves <e> <s> i wish that in a matter having such serious implications for our country there could be more objectivity than has been shown by some of those who have already written and spoken on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the introduction of the youth training scheme brought about an end to the scheme under which craft and technician trainees were previously funded directly by the manpower services commission <e> <s> can the noble lord the minister assure the house that under the new arrangements there will be no reduction in the number of young people undergoing effective training to become engineers craftsment or technicians <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that the number of places available under the community programme represents in the governments view an adequate response to the increasing number of people aged between and who have now been unemployed for more than months <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support particularly of paragraph <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is he saying then that if some means could be found of introducing a statute which obliged companies generally to adopt consultative procedures that would have his sympathy <e> <s> if that is so it is very reassuring and comforting to a number of us on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to those noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> my noble friend lord grimond has very considerable knowledge of and sympathy with the whole concept of employee share ownership as he made abundantly plain <e> <s> as was perhaps apparent from his remarks i know that knowledge extends particularly to what is aimed at in the case of co-operatives <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord weinstock for the degree of support that he felt able to give to this amendment <e> <s> i am grateful in particular to the noble lord lord cockfield for what he has said and for his agreement as i understood it not simply with the spirit of this amendment but that it should be possible on the flotation of the company at least for effect to be given to something on the general lines of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as chairman of the council of a university and for years until recently i was chairman of the governors of a college of higher education <e> <s> it is easy enough to agree that there is the need for change in higher education <e> <s> the difficulty is that views as to what changes there should be differ sharply depending on the interests of those who express them <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for having repeated this very serious statement <e> <s> i need hardly say that we deeply deplore the violence and disorder culminating in the death of mr jones which occurred in nottinghamshire last night and this morning <e> <s> as the statement says the mass secondary picketing which has been taking place is in breach of the criminal law and our first concern must be to give our full support to the police whose duty it is to enforce that law on behalf of us all <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in congratulating the noble lord lord forte on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is always a pleasure and instructive when someone like the noble lord is able to address us from a background of up-to-date industrial experience <e> <s> like others who have spoken i am sorry that there was no consultation between the government and the manpower services commission nor consequently between the commission and those mainly concerned before the major decisions referred to in the white paper were taken <e> <s> i can only hope that this omission will not prove damaging to the implementation of the proposals contained in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords could we not simply agree that the closure of coal mines increasingly has social as well as economic consequences and that a settlement of the current unhappy dispute may well depend eventually on finding some reconciliation between those two considerations <e> <s> may it not therefore be wise as the noble viscount lord tonypandy has already suggested to bear that point very much in mind when asking questions <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason why the need for action in the short term as the noble earl has suggested should preclude the possibility of a more thoroughgoing examination of higher education as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the promise of some special measures to provide alternative <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone has asked for support and if the house will forgive me as i have not once spoken during the course of this bill until this almost last moment of the third reading i should like to say just a word in support <e> <s> i am sure that it is true that in some cases the cost to individual businesses of the rating of these warehouses can be crippling <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mottistone and my noble friend have said the loss of revenue to the government is relatively small and i should like to add my voice to those who have urged the government even at this late stage to accept this amendment if they possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the severity of the problem of unemployment among young people can the noble earl assure us that the government will give sympathetic consideration to any recommendation that may come from the manpower services commission to extend the eligibility for entry into the youth training scheme to more young people aged <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble and learned lord lord denning in what he has said <e> <s> as the committee will learn from later amendments i am not necessarily opposed to the principle of indirect as opposed to direct elections for the principal executive committees of trade unions <e> <s> but as i understand it this amendment seeks only to place proposals before trade union members for their consideration <e> <s> it makes no provision for the exclusion of part i of the bill by means of secret postal ballots nor does it make provision for electoral arrangements once adopted to be reviewed at periodic intervals to see whether the union members agree that they should remain in being or be altered to conform with the governments proposals under clauses and of the bill <e> <s> for those reasons i am afraid that i too am not in a position to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am glad to follow the noble lord lord campbell of alloway if only to say that i hold him in respect for the objective way in which he approaches these matters <e> <s> i am glad to confirm that in the past in my opinion he has shown every sympathy with trade unions and their role <e> <s> i want to express our sympathy with the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord howie of troon taken together with amendment no <e> <s> on which he spoke previously <e> <s> this amendment covers nearly all the points that my noble friend lord aylestone and i had in mind in tabling amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall shortly come <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> i cannot accept and i hope that this was plain from what i said at the beginning that this particular amendment limited as it is is at variance with our general support for clauses and <e> <s> it covers a number of points that have been dealt with in earlier discussion namely secret postal ballots the possibility of there being indirect elections for the principal executive committees of trade unions and the possibility of there being a degree of option at any rate allowed to trade unions within the very strict limits imposed by this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl able to tell us how many gchq employees declined to accept the payment that they were offered of to give up their rights to belong to a trade union <e> <s> can he tell us further of that number how many are still employed in the same occupation at gchq <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this brief debate <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord lord denning whose powerful support has been most welcome <e> <s> i thank also the noble lord lord renton for his agreement at least in principle to what this amendment has in view <e> <s> other noble lords have spoken in its support <e> <s> even the noble lord lord mccarthy whose opposition to it was i suppose predictable seemed to express some qualification shall i say to that opposition <e>", "<cs> the difficulty of the committee lies precisely in the point mentioned by the noble earl lord gowrie as i understood it that we do not yet know what the governments response is going to be to the major amendment in the name of the noble lord lord beloff which was accepted by the committee the other night <e> <s> like him i wish that we did not have to waste any more time and that we could proceed to a discussion on whether or not clause should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what the noble earl lord gowrie had to say in relation to the amendment moved last week by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> when he says that he hopes we shall take it on trust from him that the government are giving their earnest and immediate consideration to the matter i for one am prepared to give him that trust <e> <s> indeed i have some sympathy with him in the predicament in which the government now find themselves <e>", "<cs> on the second reading of this bill i said that my noble friends and i endorsed the principle underlying part ii of this bill <e> <s> by that i meant that wherever feasible ballots should precede strikes <e> <s> but we were seriously concerned that the effect of clause would in practice be to encourage more unofficial industrial action in the form of walk-outs working to rule going slow and so on <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he talked of speaking to two amendments <e> <s> i may have missed his first words but was he speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i too am concerned about this point in subsection <e> <s> it is plain from the wording that loss of immunity can apply not only to the action of a trade union but also to that of a local union <e>", "<cs> i think i can see what the government are after in this subsection in providing that if industrial action takes place more than four weeks after a ballot is held then immunity will be lost <e> <s> but i fear that things may not work out quite as the government seem to think <e> <s> pay negotiations often take place not between people representing large organisations or many employers on the one hand and large numbers of employees on the other they take place in smaller units too <e>", "<cs> i rise only to confirm what the noble earl has said to some degree that the arrangements for ballots under part iii are as i understand it very far from being the same as those in the earlier parts of the bill <e> <s> when we come to consider this matter at a later stage i suppose it would not be inappropriate to consider even stricter interpretations or arrangements for the holding of ballots <e>", "<cs> i was not seeking to make any points at this late stage save to add to what the noble earl had said in relation to the point made by the noble lord lord wedderburn that the arrangements for ballot in part iii were the same as in earlier parts of the bill <e> <s> they are very far from being that <e>", "<cs> i cannot be expected to take responsibility for what may or may not have been agreed between the tuc and the government but i have to say that i support this amendment so far as it goes <e> <s> my doubt is whether if there is to be this basic change in the check off system it goes quite far enough <e> <s> as a matter of principle why should not the levy be deducted from an employees pay only if as in the case of other deductions the individual concerned has indicated positively that that is his wish <e> <s> i hope that the committee will not construe this as being an anti-trade union attitude on my part and that that has been sufficiently demonstrated by what i said on part ii of the bill <e> <s> it must also be apparent from the terms of amendment no <e> <s> to which we shall soon be coming <e>", "<cs> this amendment seems to have come from behind in a late run so to speak to overtake amendment no <e> <s> in the names of my noble friend lord aylestone and myself <e> <s> my noble friend spoke to amendment briefly last night in introducing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the amendment which the noble lord lord wedderburn has just moved covers much the same ground as our amendments but it goes further as the noble lord has acknowledged in requiring political donations by companies to be made only from a separate political fund and that shareholders should have the right to contract out of that fund <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene i did not move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was certainly contrasting it with the amendment which is now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that at this critical juncture in the coal dispute speedy and imaginative action of the kind referred to in the question asked by the noble lord lord chelwood might prove a decisive factor in encouraging a return to work by many miners who may now be wavering in their support for this strike <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join the noble lord lord underhill in thanking the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> we greatly deplore the very serious situation that has arisen and join with the government and the noble lord lord underhill in saying that we very much hope that the parties concerned will quickly reach an accord which will enable normal dock working to be resumed <e>", "<cs> my

matters as i feel sure he is <e> <s> i can only express the opinion of a layman in these matters for what it is worth and no doubt this will form part of the debate which i hope will now take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise simply to ask the noble earl whether there is anything to be lost by the government accepting the point that has been made by the noble lord lord wedderburn so that it can be shown that they are even-handed in their approach to this matter and will not brook interference or constraint from any quarter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with the reply of the noble earl <e> <s> as my noble leader lady seear i do not think that i have had occasion to call her that before in the house said in the case of the debate on contracting in the liberal and social democrat alliance cannot be held responsible for the agreement which it seems the government have reached with the tuc covering this matter as well as the matter of contracting in <e> <s> however at this time of night i see no point in taking the matter further and therefore with great reluctance on what we see as a matter of principle i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord aylestone has already spoken to the principle underlying this amendment in moving amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in our view there needs to be a much more even-handed approach as between contributions made by individuals to trade unions and those made by companies to a political party <e> <s> we know very well that there are differences between the two cases particularly in the scale of funding and in the degree of regulation of companies that already exist <e> <s> it is simply that we consider that there is an urgent need to find ways to finance political parties that are different from and fairer than those that now exist <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear the noble earl lord gowrie say that this amendment was closely related to amendment no <e> <s> and indeed inspired by it <e> <s> in adding my name to the later amendment in the names of the noble earl lord de la warr and the noble baroness lady cox i had in mind the point that the trade unions should be given every encouragement to apply themselves as soon as possible to the work involved in compiling registers of names and addresses of their members for to many of them the task will be unfamiliar and may appear rather formidable <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches our attitude to the bill is much as it was on second reading <e> <s> we agree with the proposition that every five years a trade union member should have the right to vote by a secret ballot in the election by all the voting members of the principal executive committee of his union <e> <s> in this matter our differences with the government have centred around the question how the statutory machinery needed to make more extensive use of a postal ballot can best be established <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the number of people on the community programme represents less than per cent <e> <s> of those who have been unemployed for more than months and that even in the case of those aged under the corresponding figure is only per cent <e> <s> will the government consider making further provision under the community programme in some other way for this unfortunate group particularly in the case of young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his reply but is it not objectionable in principle that deductions should be made from an individuals pay handed over to a trade union and then given to a single political party unless the individual concerned has first indicated positively to his employer that that is his wish <e> <s> also why should shareholders have to tolerate any part of money they have invested in a company for the development of that company being given to a particular political party again without their express consent <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say this respectfully to the noble viscount the leader of the house will he understand that as with our present unfair electoral system so with the funding of the political parties the inequity that is inherent in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not deplorable that if it had not been possible at short notice to table this question there would throughout the week have been no statement at all

legislation designed to give members of the national union of mineworkers of nacods and of the british association of colliery management the opportunity under suitable independent supervision and in full knowledge of the offer available to them from the coal board to vote in a secret national postal ballot on whether they wish the formula for settling the dispute produced by acas last friday to be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble earl at least acknowledge that attempts were made earlier in this week through the usual channels to obtain a statement from the government on this matter and that that attempt was unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not inevitable that in order to remain internationally competitive and to do this by continuing to improve productivity there will continue for some time to come to be a decline in employment in manufacturing industry particularly in large-scale organisations <e> <s> but does not this accentuate the need to focus attention increasingly on measures designed to increase employment in such diverse units as co-operatives enterprise trusts community businesses and science parks <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell

us to see how his remarks this afternoon amount only to a redistribution of funds when as i have understood him overall it amounts to a reduction of million <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not particularly deplorable in addition to the point already made by several noble lords about the research councils that at a time when a sub-committee of your lordships select committee on research and development is considering what more can be done to advance the cause of education and training for new technologies we now hear that there are to be reductions in the grant given to educational research to adult education and to the micro-electronics programme <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord barnett i am sure that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was right to bring together in his motion the

last tuesday by the secretary of state for the environment of substantial cuts in capital expenditure by local authorities <e> <s> these are a further heavy blow to the construction industry and i

friend lord diamond does the noble earl agree that there is now a very strong place as a last resort in disputes affecting if not the public sector generally at least those public services that are vital to the support of life or the stability of the state for agreed binding arbitration by a single independent body whose findings could be overturned only by resolutions to that effect by both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord lucas for the clear way in which he has introduced this bill <e> <s> we too are

profit-sharing and employee shareholding which elicited responses from altogether employees in companies <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am not sure whether i am permitted to

mcgregor of durris i should contribute very briefly to the discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to clarify the procedural question is it in order for a humble back-bencher to ask the noble

other members of your lordships house in response to a statement should merely ask questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak on this occasion having taken no active part in the

vocational education initiative referred to in the statement even though at the time it was introduced we deplored the absence as we saw it of adequate consultation before it was actually introduced

noble lord lord beswick in relation to the procedure to be followed in responding to ministerial statements <e> <s> i say this because i have a question down asking the leader of the house whether he

consider that the present arrangements for corporate political funding as much of the conservative party by business interests as of the labour party by trade unions are equitable in the effect that

noble lord agree that there is an even greater problem in terms of us and them in the public sector of industry than in the majority of private companies <e> <s> if he does will he say whether the government propose to take action to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be thought impertinent of me if in my contribution to this important discussion i refer to a debate that i had the privilege of introducing in your lordships house as long ago as <e> <s> it was on a motion that called attention to the need for agreed action aimed at increasing the esteem in which industry was held in society particularly among students <e> <s> at that time i had just been appointed pro-chancellor and chairman of the council of one of our newer universities <e> <s> it is one in which there were then no courses in applied science <e> <s> i was nevertheless startled to learn that only about one in of those who had graduated the year before had gone into industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that my question was prompted by exchanges that took place following a recent ministerial statement in which i was involved the outcome of which was that the correct procedure to be followed on such occasions was not recorded in <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness forgive me if she has finished her sentence <e> <s> i do not know whether it is for me to say but is the chairman intending to say anything about the title to the bill <e> <s> for the sake of form that should perhaps be done should it not <e>", "<cs> i think this might be the appropriate moment for me to offer a word of support on this amendment <e> <s> at second reading i said that if in its early stages some project should result in a deficit i hoped it would be possible for the financial and accounting provisions of clause to be interpreted in such a way that no unduly harsh penalties were incurred either by individual members of staff or collectively by the educational establishment concerned that establishment perhaps not being very experienced in commercial enterprises <e> <s> i added that in facilitating the establishment at a university with which i am connected of a company embarking on certain business activities it had been found necessary to make special financial arrangements to cover this <e>", "<cs> very briefly i should like to support the even-handed nature of the concept underlying this amendment that is that in the same way as a deficit is to be charged in the first instance to any general fund set up by an authority to exercise its functions under the bill so any credits should be applied in furtherance of educational activities in the establishment involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> for my part i have learned much from noble lords who have spoken and that is hardly surprising in view of the great experience that has been brought to bear on the subject from all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords briefly i should like to support all that my noble friend lord sainsbury has just said <e> <s> perhaps i can best do this and at the same time reinforce some of the strictures that have been made by the noble lord lord wedderburn by asking the minister a question <e> <s> is it not the case that under existing legislation only a very small percentage of people who have been dismissed within a year of engagement have even taken their cases to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> indeed if he is able to can the noble lord tell us what the proportion has been <e> <s> do not the figures for which i have asked constitute insufficient justification for this amending legislation and therefore will it not be perceived for little if any gain as tipping employment legislation further in the direction of employers and against those whom they employ <e> <s> therefore in that respect as my noble friend lord sainsbury has just said will it not damage rather than improve industrial relations generally in this country <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment and in so doing it may be for the convenience and even i suspect at this hour the relief of the committee if i speak also to amendment no <e> <s> ad which covers much the same ground but takes the argument advanced by the noble lord lord mccarthy a stage further <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble baroness lady cox for having repeated this statement not as the noble baroness lady david has already said that it tells us very much <e> <s> we are happy to endorse the emphasis placed in the green paper on the need for higher education to become more responsive to changing industrial and commercial circumstances and on the importance of close links between higher education and business <e>", "<cs> briefly may i say that it will not surprise the committee to learn that i find myself much more in sympathy with what the noble lord lord plummer had to say than with what the noble lord lord campbell has just said <e> <s> if i may i should like briefly to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord winstanley <e> <s> i am equally happy to support the amendment in the name of the noble lord lord dean <e> <s> in my view broadly they both seek to achieve the same purpose <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether satisfied if i may so put it with what the noble earl lord gowrie has just said <e> <s> the committee will recall that the principle on which i sought to base my amendment was that reorganisation of local government should not on any account be used as a means of obliging the long-serving and dedicated people of whom i was speaking to continue to exercise the same levels of skill and diligence at a reduced level of pay or under less favourable conditions of employment than they were enjoying <e> <s> the committee will recall that the intention was that the amendment should apply only insofar as the jobs to which the people concerned were going were reasonably comparable with those in the old situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word about this new clause for it is the clause to which the noble earl lord gowrie referred briefly last night when my noble friend lord winstanley put forward an amendment seeing the need for early retirement schemes and enhanced pension benefit <e> <s> my noble friend was sufficiently impressed then with what the noble earl had to say to feel that when he had been able to read <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been intrigued by one word in particular in the motion of the noble lord lord thorneycroft calling attention to the process of returning some public sector activities to the private sector <e> <s> i am referring to the word some because it raises the basic and highly controversial question of what those activities should be <e> <s> in my contribution to the debate which your lordships will be delighted to learn will be brief i should like to suggest that if we are to achieve the important <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in its report for the civil service commission said that its recruitment experience suggested that a higher proportion of the most able undergraduates were unwilling to enter the civil service <e> <s> does he accept that the reason most often given by candidates for rejecting appointments was uncompetitive pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say that it seems to me as a somewhat dispassionate observer on this occasion that perhaps the amendment which the noble earl lord swinton has moved amendment no <e> <s> is to be preferred to amendment no <e> <s> earlier moved by the noble baroness not simply because it goes a little wider in seeking to meet the points which she raised earlier but because if i may say so i find it rather more intelligible than the amendment moved by the noble baroness <e> <s> i say that with all respect but i hope it may mean that when as she said she proposed to do she comes to reconsider her amendment no <e> <s> with a view to determining whether or not she should come back to it at third reading my opinion for what it is worth may help to ensure that she does not raise it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in their annual report for the advisory conciliation and arbitration service offered their help and advice in dealing with the criteria to be adopted in determining pay in the public services and the procedures which might be followed in case of disagreement <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that although long stops i think i am right in saying do not normally feature among the fielders on a cricket field

response to the noble lord lord renton i did not say that i was proposing to move this amendment at third reading <e> <s> what i said was that i was prepared to wait until that time before deciding whether to pursue matters such as those covered by this amendment <e> <s> that is my answer to the noble lord lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should say one further word in defence of myself <e> <s> with respect to the noble viscount the leader of the house i did not say on tuesday night that i was proposing to move this amendment today <e> <s> that will be evident from a reading of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should just like to say a few words if only in response to the invitation so to do by the noble lord lord thorneycroft though perhaps he will understand in view of what transpired earlier why i do not propose to enter into the discussion on the merits of the amendment which has now been moved by the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> may i say simply that i had not understood that the noble earl lord gowrie had said through the usual channels that he would be in a position to give a definitive answer today particularly on the matter of compensation which has been my main concern in these exchanges <e> <s> may i also be allowed to say that on these benches we have the interests of staff very much at heart <e> <s> that certainly applies to me <e> <s> i hope

noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> the suggestion of the noble lord lord sandford as your lordships will recall was that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to deal with the substance of the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mccarthy and the response to it made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> on a number of occasions in this house i have gone out of my way to say that there should be a reduction in the percentage of the adult rate payable to young people <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy has said that to some extent in the last few years there has been a relative reduction in that pay <e> <s> it may even be that it could go further in the interests of this countrys competitiveness <e> <s> in that sense i concede in degree the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords i take it from what the noble lord the minister says that he will be kind enough to let me have that information also not as a representative in any sense of those speaking from these benches but as someone coming from them <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government prepared to give consideration to the cbis proposed building improvement programme designed on a costed basis to enable private contractors to give temporary employment to long-term unemployed in the areas worst affected by high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord recall that many large companies with good training records run yts schemes for social reasons and do not afterwards employ many of the young people involved <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the difficulties that some of these companies are reported to be experiencing in submitting for audit their schemes to the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord bancroft who speaks on the subject of this debate with a knowledge experience and authority which must be unrivalled in your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will understand if among such a distinguished list of speakers i deal only with the relationship between the government and the civil servants in the relatively narrow field of industrial relations in which i feel qualified to speak <e> <s> that will involve reference in particular to the controversial matter which has been touched upon already of whether civil servants employed at gchq should enjoy the right to belong to a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords in his first reply to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby the noble lord referred to the governments policies for creating jobs through enterprise <e> <s> will the government provide for the training of long-term unemployed particularly those aged under under the expanded enterprise allowance scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords following that response will the government publish information on a regular basis in the department of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join in thanking the noble baroness for having repeated the answer to the private notice question in another place <e> <s> we are greatly relieved that the government have now decided that gchq employees who rejoined their unions after receiving the in compensation for loss not of union membership but of employment protection rights should not be dismissed <e> <s> however i should add in view of what the noble baroness said that we think it would be deplorable if those employees or any who after january remained in their union were to suffer any other penalties such as fines or demotion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that there are a good number of large companies that have needed no prompting to second executives to local enterprise agencies <e> <s> indeed faced with the need to reduce the number of people that they can themselves employ if they are to remain internationally competitive have not such companies actively taken the lead in promoting agencies in the localities in which they operate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that britians top companies might make an even greater contribution to export earnings if we were able to join the european monetary system and thus achieve more stability in sterling exchange rates particularly in relation to the german mark <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that it is important in this house at this crucial time that we should say nothing which would encourage members of the prison officers association to carry on with this industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the secretary of state for that honest answer so far as it goes <e> <s> however does he agree that a clear link has been established between industrial training and success and that adult training in this country has been shown to compare most unfavourably with that of our main competitors <e> <s> indeed is he aware that the chairman of the manpower services commission recently went so far as to say that compared with those competitors our adult workforce emerges as a bunch of thickies <e> <s> does the noble lord accept ministerial responsibility for this alarming situation and if so what beyond the exhortation of which he has just given us a good example does he actually intend to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord recall that the authors of a recent report commissioned jointly by the manpower services commission and the national economic development office put forward a number of proposals aimed at stimulating <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak on that part of the motion which calls attention to the case for greater investment in education at all levels and in doing so to speak on higher education particularly in universities <e> <s> it may be appropriate to add that for the past years i have been a pro-chancellor and chairman of the council of one of our smaller universities and before that i was responsible for education and training in a large industrial undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the noble lords response to the criticism that the governments proposals fail to make adequate provision for employees to receive information on matters of concern to them as employees or to be consulted when decisions affecting their interests are taken <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness bear in mind that some of us are in fundamental disagreement with the premise underlying the question of the noble lord lord hunter of newington <e> <s> we feel strongly that there are sound economic industrial and social reasons why there <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for the clear way in which he has explained the order to the house and has told us why it is necessary to seek parliamentary approval for it <e> <s> we are glad to know that representatives of both employers and employees support the amount of levy proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that those of us who have been pressing the government to make additional financial provision for the universities in a way which means that expenditure can be maintained on level real terms fully accept the need for the universities if this is done to play their part in continuing to implement and build on changes that are needed for example in <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the amalgamated engineering union has at last accepted that apprentice training should be carried out on the basis of standards to be achieved rather than time to be served what plans do the government have to build <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the secretary of state for having introduced this bill <e> <s> as he says it is in three parts and i can best express our general attitude to the bill by dealing with each of those parts in turn <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps odd that i rather than a representative of the government should ask this question but is it not the case in the matter of cashless pay that it is not possible for an employer unilaterally to require employees to accept cashless pay if they have previously been paid in cash <e> <s> if they do so they will be in breach of the employees contract of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord undertake at least to give some further consideration to the representations made by a number of noble lords relating to the effect of the retail price index particularly on the lower paid <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl go a little further than he has done and accept that in view of the very considerable difficulties which some students in higher education are now experiencing it is highly desirable that the consultative exercise and the comprehensive review to which he has referred should be carried out and the governments decision made in time for that decision if approved by parliament to operate before the year if at all possible <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i speak now with leave to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am in the hands of the committee <e> <s> i had understood that there was a measure of agreement that this was the procedure which should take place <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord trefgarne would help us on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> it was worked out and that is why i said at the outset that it was my intention to speak to these amendments rather than at this stage to move any <e> <s> like the amendment which has just been moved by the noble lord lord wedderburn the amendments to which i referred perhaps for the convenience of the committee i should just repeat that they are nos <e> <s> and are aimed at ensuring that deductions from wages are reasonable but they set about the task in a way different from that proposed by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for what he said <e> <s> i thought that i had made plain at an earlier stage that we are anxious i believe that i speak for most perhaps all noble lords on this side of the committee and for a number on the other side that something should be written into the bill upholding the principle that has been enunciated this afternoon <e> <s> i wish both to move and to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> there is a widely-held view that any deductions for cash or stock deficiencies are outmoded and should be replaced by better management and better methods of control <e> <s> i think that was one of the points that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon was making <e> <s> my fear is that incompetent management may seek to hide that incompetence at the expense of the employees <e> <s> under the bill it is possible for poor management to make deductions from wages rather than carrying out sound practices such as for example moving employees thought to be responsible for deficiencies in cash or stock from one shift to another <e> <s> our aim in the long term should surely be to get employers to accept that it is their responsibility to establish procedures under which their employees are protected from what may be the misdeeds of others rather than taking refuge in penalising people who may not themselves be at fault <e>", "<cs> i should like a little more clarification from the noble lord lord wedderburn because i do not altogether understand the significance which is attached in this amendment to the distinction between an express and an implied term of contract and i must admit to being something of a layman in these matters <e> <s> if for example there is a collective agreement which sets out say a disciplinary procedure that could lead to pay being withheld and that would surely be recognised would it not <e> <s> by any court or tribunal as a valid implied term of the employees contract <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i feel obliged to say that in the light of the discussion which took place over the first amendment relating to the need as i saw it for deductions from wages to be fair and reasonable and in order to be consistent i must oppose the question that this clause shall stand part of the bill even though as the committee will have seen i have reservations about a number of amendments tabled thereafter <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> it seems on the face of it to offend against natural justice if the course advocated by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is not followed <e> <s> at an earlier stage i indicated that i think we want to reach a situation as soon as possible where there is no need for deductions from wages but we rely instead on better management practices and methods of control as the noble lord lord graham said <e>", "<cs> i should like very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> an employer should surely not need a period as long as months from the time when he should have established a deficiency until he makes a deduction from wages <e> <s> three months is quite long enough and i look forward to hearing from the minister that he agrees or if he does not why <e>", "<cs> is that not almost an accident of timing <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the general point made by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> it seems reasonable that a period of notice should be given and that there should be some even-handedness between the employer and the employee in the matter <e> <s> i wonder whether there is any prospect before the noble lord lord wedderburn determines what he should do about the amendment that the noble lord the minister may hold out some hope that he is willing to give further consideration to the matter before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am not sure if what i have to say would not be more appropriately said on the following amendment but i shall say it now to save the time of the committee <e> <s> it seems to me that the most important provision in this whole clause is really rather harsh to say the least <e> <s> as i understand it the limited protection that there is for employees against <e>", "<cs> at second reading of the bill i said that it was questionable whether compensation to the employee should be limited to the deduction from his wages made by the employer or on the other hand extended to cover loss of pay for time taken off work in preparing for the hearing of the case attending the tribunal itself and recovering expenses for travelling less than the distance of six miles for which allowance may as i understand it presently be made <e> <s> in this amendment the noble lord lord wedderburn has instanced some other losses that the employee might sustain <e>", "<cs> at this time of night i shall use only a few words <e> <s> i should not like the secretary of state to <e>", "<cs> i feel obliged to speak briefly to this amendment <e> <s> as i explained at second reading my noble friends and i are very much in favour of repealing the truck acts and extending cashless pay <e> <s> in our view that will bring about greater security savings in manufacturing costs and most important will make a substantial contribution towards the elimination of differences between the employment conditions of manual workers and those of white-collar staff based on social distinctions which became outdated long ago <e> <s> against that background i am reluctant to see any restrictions placed on the extent to which cashless pay may be made <e>", "<cs> this proposed new clause has the same objective as one which was moved by my honourable friend the member for colne valley in discussion of the bill by the standing committee in another place <e> <s> as i began to say on the last amendment it seems to me important particularly in the early stage of the operation of this legislation a point made by the noble lord lord graham in moving the amendment that an employee should have the statutory right to choose the particular financial institution to which his cashless pay is paid to him <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> as amendment no <e> <s> implies young people aged under are now largely taken care of by allowances under the youth training scheme <e> <s> at least that is what i thought until i read in the press this morning i hope that indirectly the noble lord the minister will have had some notice of what i am about to say that ministers are considering plans to abolish legislation restricting the hours and times of work of young people aged between and and that the government are seeking the views of the manpower services commission on the proposals <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must join the noble lord lord mccarthy in registering a protest about the tabling of this amendment <e> <s> as he fairly said it was available to us only this morning <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne has apologised for that and he has explained why it is that the amendment has been put down <e> <s> the concept lying behind this was not available to us when the bill was debated in principle at second reading as the noble lord lord mccarthy has said <e> <s> there has been no consultation about it <e> <s> what is now said and i too have in my hand the minutes of the relevant standing committee appears to be at variance with what the under-secretary of state said on that occasion <e> <s> it is unfortunate to say the least that we are required to take a decision on this today at such short notice <e>", "<cs> i did not really expect to hear anything else from the noble lord so i can hardly claim to be disappointed <e> <s> if i may respectfully say so i thought that part of his brief was scarcely relevant to the amendment <e> <s> however it is only one of a series under clause that we are now debating <e> <s> i do not want to be constantly driving members of the committee in and out of the division lobbies <e> <s> if we are to have a vote it may be that it would be better to take it under the question whether clause should stand part of the bill but that procedure should not be taken as an indication of satisfaction with the governments response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot add much to the sum of the knowledge of the committee <e> <s> i do not understand this provision either <e> <s> the minister gave every indication that he did but i am not quite sure about that <e> <s> in my case i think that it has to do with in part the complexity of the amendment and in part no doubt with my slow wittedness <e> <s> but it seems to me important that we should have an opportunity to study closely what the minister has said and will again be saying in a moment read it in <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> i am impressed by the argument that the united kingdom is apparently almost alone among european countries <e>", "<cs> i should like to support that and to ask that a copy of any letter going to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this is i believe the only amendment at this stage that refers to part iii of the bill <e> <s> with the agreement of the committee i should like to widen the discussion a little to take account of the philosophy underlying this part if only to save having a further debate on clause stand part if that is acceptable to the noble lord the minister in particular <e> <s> at the same time i wish to support what the noble lord lord wedderburn has said and to amplify his remarks by way of another example <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it from that reply that the secretary of state accepts that there is an urgent need to obtain a more general awareness of the relationship between pay rises and investment and of the beneficial effects which an improvement in productivity and reduction in unit costs could have on job creation <e> <s> if he does will he and his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer make use of the national economic development council whose meetings are attended by representa-tives of government employers and trade unions as a forum in which that educative process can be developed so that as far as possible the deliberations of the council are made known to the public at large <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all the noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and for the powerful support given in particular by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i may do so also i believe on behalf of my noble friends <e> <s> it arises as the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton says from a somewhat similar amendment that he moved in committee and that suffered from the defect that it did not cater for the situation where it was the employee rather than the employer who gave notice of termination of the employment contract <e> <s> that is remedied in this amendment which is limited to providing that recovery by the employer of the entire wage on the last pay day is inadmissible if the employment is terminated by the employer in an unlawful way <e> <s> surely that must be right in principle <e> <s> as a layman unpractised in the law i am impressed by the argument the noble lord has adduced that in this respect the bill is not in accordance with a fundamental principle of the law of contract <e> <s> with all this in mind i trust that the minister will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord <e> <s> lord mccarthy has said this again is an amendment modified to take account of the response made by the minister to a rather wider amendment moved by the noble lord lord mccarthy in committee dealing with the same principle <e> <s> we support this amendment <e> <s> many of the people we are here considering as we have said throughout this bill on a number of issues are unorganised they are without protection from trade unions and they work in occupations where labour turnover is high <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what the noble lord lord wedderburn has said i hope that the minister will agree to look at this again <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee my noble friend lord sainsbury and i opposed the government amendment that the number of independent people on wages councils should be increased from a maximum of three to no more than five <e> <s> we did so largely because the amendment had been made available to us as the noble lord lord mccarthy has just said only a few hours before we were required to take a decision on it and also because what the noble lord lord trefgarne said in its support in committee appeared at first sight at least to be somewhat at variance with what the under-secretary of state had said in standing committee in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment indeed i am a signatory to it <e> <s> in committee the government case against permitting a wages council to fix a minimum period for annual holidays and minimum pay for such holidays was that that would enable wages councils to continue to make complex orders which is a point already referred to by the noble lord lord mccarthy more particularly in relation to remuneration <e> <s> there is certainly nothing complex about this amendment which would enable wages councils to fix only a minimum period of annual holiday <e>", "<cs> my lords after what the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton has said i do not believe that there is much of substance that i have to add <e> <s> what there is i said largely in offering support to the noble lord lord mccarthy when he moved a somewhat similar amendment amendment no <e> <s> relating to part i of the bill <e> <s> i should not however like this moment to pass without indicating to the house that the amendment enjoys the support of those on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the principle underlying this amendment <e> <s> in committee i opposed part iii of the bill on the grounds that people continue to be made redundant in large numbers and that the effect of this part of the bill must be either to make overall redundancy payments smaller or add to costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> at present there is nothing in the bill to stop an unscrupulous employer from deducting the entire wage on the last pay day whatever the circumstances under which the employment is terminated and whether or not the deduction is fair and reasonable provided only that the action is covered by the contract of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was discussed on report i said speaking on behalf of my noble friend lord sainsbury and myself that i thought that the government needed to give the house a good deal more information than they had as to why they had increased the number of independent members on wages councils to a maximum of five <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the noble lord lord trefgarne whether he will respond to the point of substance that i made <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may be pleased to know that at this stage of our proceedings i do not intend to make a long speech but there are a few things that i should like to say <e>", "<cs> my lords weeks may be shorter than the average period but is not a delay of weeks much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the chairman of the manpower services commission has acknowledged that a considerable number of these voluntary training organisations are not up to scratch in various ways will the noble lord accept that we on these benches welcome the guidelines which the government and the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that a claimant who has been looking after an elderly or disabled relative and who has himself been unemployed for a long time should not be disbarred from unemployment benefit if he fails to make alternative arrangements immediately and does so only after a reasonable period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state confirm that there are now waiting lists of long-term unemployed who are anxious to remedy their lack of the basic skills referred to in the original question <e> <s> does his encouraging answer to the noble baroness lady carnegy indicate that the government are willing to provide any additional resources that are needed to meet the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken in this short debate i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady turner of camden for having asked this question and for the way in which she has done so <e> <s> our discussion seems <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble viscount lord long for the clear way in which he introduced these orders <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i always listen to what he has to say with great respect especially on this occasion because more than any other noble lord his is the name most closely associated with the subject of this bill <e>", "<cs> at second reading i acknowledged that those of us who were critical of the governments approach under this bill must be prepared to say what alternative suggestions we had to offer <e> <s> as i saw it there were three possibilities <e> <s> one was to establish an independent pay review body such as those now available to doctors nurses and to other people <e> <s> the second was to establish a national joint council composed of representatives of government local authorities the teachers organisations and people representing the interests of voluntary schools <e> <s> therefore in response to the noble lord lord mcintosh i recognised that as a practical possibility at second reading <e> <s> the third possibility which i then mentioned was a development of the second one namely to provide that a dispute should be referred to <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have contributed to this debate <e> <s> at the outset i made it plain that at this stage we are putting forward the proposals in general form as a matter of principle <e> <s> one of the advantages of taking that course of action is that it enables what has actually happened this afternoon to take place namely many questions have been asked and views have been expressed <e> <s> we should like to take those views into account and at this stage i simply reserve our position with the view of possibly bringing forward some other amendment on report based on the principles we have just been discussing <e> <s> therefore i shall not detain the committee further and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government proposing to take any further action to ensure that those who will be responsible for giving the counselling in the additional interviews that are now to take place under the restart scheme and for the long-term unemployed will themselves receive adequate training in counselling <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> i moved an amendment in committee which was a precursor to this one <e> <s> it was criticised on a number of counts and i eventually withdrew it for further consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that when i came to consider closely the precise terms of the motion that has been introduced by the noble lord lord mccarthy today i had some misgivings <e> <s> this was partly because i never look forward with pleasurable anticipation to discussing statistics but it was also because as the noble earl lord halsbury has just reminded us questioning however justifiably the accuracy of statistics relating to a subject as emotive as unemployment can so easily evoke the kind of pitched political battle to which we are accustomed at question time <e> <s> we had an example most recently only last monday but in my experience it does not always enable the house to be seen at its best in general debate <e> <s> i hasten to add that on the whole i do not think that has happened this afternoon and i for one have learned a great deal from a number of the speeches that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the secretary of state for making this statement <e> <s> it is long detailed and in some respects potentially controversial <e> <s> we therefore wish to give it the closest examination before arriving at a considered conclusion <e>", "<cs> from these benches i feel it incumbent on me to make a few comments on the amendment <e> <s> i have listened carefully to what the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn have said and also to the ministers initial response <e> <s> with all respect i do not think that an adequate case has been made out for the inclusion of the new clause in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate gives me the opportunity to say a few words about the need to encourage the development of a form of part-time working which can not only provide job opportunities for qualified married women looking after young children but also alleviate unemployment generally <e> <s> i am referring to the practice known as job sharing which the noble baroness lady platt in particular touched on and on which i should like to speak at rather greater length <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state take this opportunity to confirm that in his view the great majority of people who are unemployed far from pricing themselves out of jobs are only too anxious to find suitable employment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that many of us who for various reasons opposed the sunday trading bill in the form in which it was presented to the house last year nevertheless accept that there is a need for the law in its present form to be tidied up <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state acknowledge that if the government had adopted the policy advocated by the alliance parties three years ago to extend the application of secret postal ballots in the election of members of union executives there might have been even fewer disputes in <e> <s> does he agree that the incidence of industrial disputes is due as much or more to the quality of management as to that of trade union leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for the clear way in which he has explained the order and for telling us why it is necessary to seek parliamentary approval for it <e> <s> it is good to know that both employer and employee members of the mechanical and electrical engineering construction industry sector committee have unanimously agreed to the levy which is applicable in that sector and that the proposals were subsequently approved by the engineering training board without dissent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like

lord tell us a little more precisely how the level of british productivity as opposed to its growth compares with that of other industrial countries <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that a further reduction in interest rates with its consequential beneficial effect on the sterling exchange rate particularly in relation to the german mark would greatly assist our major companies on whose exporting performance our overseas trade balance in manufactured goods largely depends <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for having introduced this debate and thus enabling the house to take part in the consultative exercise now proceeding on the green paper <e> <s> my noble friends and i are looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble lord

supervision for elections to their principal executive committees and these should extend to the distribution the receipt and the counting of ballot papers <e> <s> the chief officers of unions in our view should also be required to submit themselves for reappointment at regular intervals either by the same electoral means or at the very least by the votes of members of principal executive committees who have themselves been properly elected <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state in a position to tell us how many long-term unemployed people have so far been helped back to work

governments proposals under clause <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mccarthy has reminded us under the trade union and labour relations act unions and employers associations already have to make an annual return to the certification officer and keep proper accounting records which provide a true and fair view of their affairs <e>", "<cs> i rise only to support the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> i wish to support her in opposing this clause <e> <s> i feel that it should not stand part of the bill for reasons which she has given and which were confirmed by my noble friend lady seear earlier in the afternoon <e> <s> in our view there is a distinction between the election of members of principal executive committees as will become plain when we discuss the next amendment and the sort of civil servants and professional advisers to which this clause relates <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong if after this great debate there had been no contribution from these benches <e> <s> therefore i should like to repeat what i said on earlier occasions namely that my noble friends and i are clear that trade unions should use the full postal voting procedures under independent supervision for elections to their principal executive committees and that that should extend to the distribution receipt and counting of ballot papers <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed that the noble earl has not found it possible to accept the <e>", "<cs> i share many of the concerns which have been expressed by the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> this may be a convenient moment at which to express my misgivings more generally about the clause as a whole <e> <s> on second <e>", "<cs> i realise that it was perhaps unduly optimistic of me to ask the government to withdraw this clause <e> <s> however i hope that the minister will recognise that there is very considerable concern about this clause in the minds of employers and unions who will have to operate it <e> <s> although he may not be able to enter into any firm commitment tonight for reasons that we all understand i hope that at least he will feel able to say that the government will give consideration to the kind of difficulties to which the noble lord lord wedderburn has already given expression and which i have tried to adumbrate on behalf of those who will have to operate the clause <e>", "<cs> i wish to concur with what the noble lord lord mccarthy has said <e>", "<cs> if among other things the noble lord lord wyatt is saying that we should do better without this commissioner at all i for one am happy to agree with him <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness says that it is for the employers to lead <e> <s> however does she not agree that the essence of leadership is that people should follow <e> <s> are not people more likely to follow in this case trade unionists if they are able to participate in the consultative and decision-making process <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have taken part in our exchange <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale for his response to the remarks of the noble lord lord campbell <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord said in effect the amendment does not say that the amount of the allowance should be determined after consultation with the commission alone it says that it should be determined <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i must support this amendment because on these benches we think it wrong that under clause the government have widened the definition of industrial action so that it will no longer mean action that is in breach of the contract of employment but will cover any strike or industrial action taken by people who have employment contracts <e> <s> i have said often enough that in my view it is desirable that in the field of industrial relations the law should strike a balance between the interests of employers on the one hand and employees and their representatives on the other <e> <s> the position in this country unlike that in other countries is that there is no collective right to strike and if there is a strike the employment contract is not suspended but is judged to be broken <e> <s> therefore the scales are already heavily weighted against the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support this amendment because it is consistent with the amendment that i moved in committee to which the noble lord lord mccarthy referred which sought to negate the governments proposal that individual union members should not be disciplined by their union if they refuse to take part in industrial action even when that action has been endorsed by a prior secret ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mottistone indicated amendment no <e> <s> is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it may therefore be for the convenience of the house if i speak to my amendment now <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i mean clauses to of this bill if it becomes an act <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to remind the house that for long we have advocated that trade unions should use full secret postal ballot procedures in electing members of their principal executive committees <e> <s> it should be done under independent supervision and that independent supervision should extend to the distribution as well as to the receipt and counting of the ballot papers <e> <s> we are glad that with this amendment the government have at last come round to the same view and are happy that this independent supervision should also include the production of ballot papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very impressed or reassured <e> <s> i am disappointed to say the least first at the suggestion that there should not be a period of three months in which people can have some opportunity to digest what is in this clause <e> <s> i am the more disappointed when that suggestion has the support of somebody with all the commercial and industrial experience of the noble lord lord carr of hadley speaking also as a former secretary of state for employment <e> <s> as i understood what the noble lord lord trefgarne said this clause is to be treated like any other and guidance may be given on it along with others <e> <s> the amendment seeks clear guidance for employers employees and their representatives on the meaning of the clause given its complexity <e> <s> for that reason it should be singled out <e> <s> when it comes to translating all this into action on the ground i fear that the results may prove deplorable <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i made it plain at an earlier stage that we are opposed to the widening by the government of the definition of industrial action which is contained in subsection of clause and is applicable to subsection and therefore to this amendment <e> <s> for that reason alone i cannot commend this amendment to my noble friends <e> <s> however the provision goes much deeper than that as has already been said by the noble lord lord mccarthy and indeed by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to support both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they seem to me to be potentially good examples of how the house can best exercise its revising function <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not quite sure and perhaps i should have endeavoured to find out precisely what lay behind this amendment but now that i have heard that its chief objective is to ensure that the new training commission like the manpower services commission before it to read again from the relevant section of schedule of the employment and training act should <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the matter rather differently from the way in which the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord campbell of alloway see it <e> <s> i should like to give the amendment a cautious welcome at this stage in the hope that in the end it will go at least some way towards meeting what i had in mind at report stage <e> <s> your lordships will recall that at that time i moved an amendment which provided that section should not come into force before the expiry of three months after the secretary of state had published guidance for employers employees and their representatives explaining how the provisions of the clause should operate <e> <s> by those best qualified to judge three months was considered to be the minimum period for guidance to be assimilated by those who will have to operate the clause if it is to have any chance of proving workable <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord trefgarne gave me the opportunity to ask him a question before he sat down <e> <s> as i understood what he had to say he did not quite give me the assurance that i was seeking <e> <s> perhaps i may put the matter to him again <e> <s> i asked that the government should treat the very real difficulties that employers and trade unions will face in operating clause as a highly relevant factor in determining the date on which part i of the bill including in particular clause will commence <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be what the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls thinks but i suggest that it is not what this amendment states <e> <s> the amendment refers to the voting paper <e> <s> the question that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has raised very properly is whether this provision extends to the back of the voting paper or to an attachment to the voting paper <e> <s> the noble lord lord trefgarne suggests that it does <e> <s> i am quite clear that the amendment says nothing of the kind <e> <s> the amendment is therefore flawed and this house has no business to pass it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches are not much happier with the bill as it leaves the house than we were when it arrived <e> <s> the pattern normally followed before the introduction of new legislation to industrial relations is that a consultative paper is first published account is then taken of the views of interested parties and thereafter the bill is brought forward <e> <s> in this case a green paper was produced but the government have taken little or no notice of the responses made to them by employers and trade unions <e> <s> i suggest that clause affords a good example <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware he is because i told him so just now <e> <s> that i own a small property only half a mile from these chalets <e> <s> will he accept that some of the static caravans which the developer now proposes to replace with permanent buildings have in my view and i mean that literally disfigured this lovely coastline far too long <e> <s> rather than being replaced they should be removed altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be even briefer than the noble baroness <e> <s> from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord dundee for the clear way in which he has explained this order to us <e> <s> like the noble baroness we have no objection to its passage <e>", "<cs> greatly daring and fearing the lash of the chief whip again perhaps i may support what the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee said <e> <s> he asked why amendment no <e> <s> was allowed to precede amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord the deputy chairman responded by saying that amendment no <e> <s> was wrongly billed in the sense that it should have related to page line <e> <s> however if one looks at the text of the bill it is plain as i read it that it is line <e>", "<cs> my lords on a related point will the secretary of state agree that listed public companies should be encouraged to provide their employees with a short form of their annual report and accounts <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord irvine and speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which stands in my name and is in the same group of amendments <e>", "<cs> in supporting amendment no <e> <s> b i too should like to apeak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which are grouped with it and appear under my name <e> <s> as the noble lord lord irvine of lairg said if the words contained in lines to of subsection in clause and the corresponding words in clause are not omitted from the bill they could result in a schools governing body making an employee redundant at the expense of the local authority even though the authoritys policy is that there should be no redundancy or only redundancies that are voluntarily accepted <e> <s> thus agreements that have been freely negotiated between local authorities and their employees that there should be no compulsory redundancies can be undermined <e>", "<cs> as someone who until recently was the chairman of a university council i support the amendment <e> <s> i had thought that it was now normal practice that in higher education institutions there should invariably be two student representa-tives <e> <s> i certainly found it helpful in my experience and i very much hope that the government can withdraw from what seems to me a retrograde step in permitting at this stage only one representative <e>", "<cs> although firmly in favour of representation by industrialists i incline to the view expressed by my noble friend lord grimond that on <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether satisfied <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for what he has said about those who were recruited to the ilea in the belief that they were to be accorded favourable treatment <e> <s> as regards those who did not have that belief my information it may be wrong differs from that of the noble lord in that they are not in the same position as the general body of employees <e> <s> for that reason i am disappointed at what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government considered offering tax rebates as regards the expenditure incurred by companies for research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords when the subject of employees rights was discussed in committee the noble lord lord trefgarne made two comments which i believe to be of significance <e> <s> first he said that on report the government would bring forward an amendment requiring that before any order was made by the secretary of state under what is now clause to modify enactments conferring rights on employees there should be consultation with local authority employers trade unions and bodies representing the interests of the governing bodies of voluntary schools <e> <s> as my noble friend lady seear has already observed it is a matter of great regret that that amendment has not been tabled and that we are not able to discuss the matter in connection with these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords first i support what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has said and in doing so i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and which stand in my name and are grouped with his amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise only to say that think the criticism of the noble lord lord morton of shuna of the governments amendment is entirely justified and deserves some support from these benches <e> <s> it seems to me that here is yet another example of the secretary of state taking to himself altogether excessive powers in this case in relation to the appointment of senior management <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the assurance that the noble baroness has given that there are to be further discussions with the relevant bodies about this <e> <s> from what she says it sounds as if there is every hope that the particular category about which i am concerned will be treated in the way that i had hoped <e> <s> on that basis i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the rather lowly capacity of president of a youth club in cheshire where i live which is a registered charity i should like very briefly but strongly to support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> i have nothing of substance to add to what has already been said so cogently by other noble lords who have spoken in favour of the amendment <e> <s> all i would say is that i think that it may well be that the fate of this amendment will determine whether or not the particular club of which i speak survives <e> <s> i therefore join with other noble lords in strongly urging the house to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to support the amendments <e> <s> the case for them has been so well presented by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure the house that in dealing with ballots on industrial action affecting different places of work the wording of the code will be less difficult for managers and trade union representatives to understand than is the section of the employment act which relates to that matter <e> <s> in the light of his response to the noble baroness lady turner may one take it that the requirements of the code in its final form will be no more prescriptive than those of the act <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly but strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> speaking on behalf of my noble friends at the second reading of the trade union bill i said that we considered there was an urgent need to find fairer ways of financing political parties in this country <e> <s> in committee i tabled an amendment which if it had succeeded would have had the effect of delaying the operation of part iii of the act dealing with trade union political funds until such time as alterations had been made to the companies act much in line with the amendment that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has proposed <e>", "<cs> my lords despite what the secretary of state has said about the past three years according to statistics prepared this month by his department the united kingdom share by value of world trade in manufacturing industries is still very much lower than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government pay due regard to the views of members of the cbi that wages councils can fulfil a useful role in the sectors in which they operate and that a sector-by-sector review is to be preferred to wholesale abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that before the possible abolition of the dock labour scheme there should be full consultation with interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for increasing the quantity and quality of trained engineers and technicians has been so well presented already that there is no need for me to dwell on it for long <e> <s> the most serious aspect of the shortage is the effect it is having on the capacity of an increasing number of companies to develop new products and to raise manufacturing output <e> <s> demand for graduates in engineering industries and other sectors is i am told on a strong upward trend <e> <s> on the supply side the outlook is worrying <e> <s> additional places provided on engineering courses are not being filled <e> <s> applications for them have been going down and wastage from some university courses has been estimated at per cent <e> <s> or more twice the average for university courses generally <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to accept for the record since he mentioned me in this context that i had nothing at all to say about <e> <s> in fact i very much agree with him that it is skill requirements for the long term rather than the short term that are important <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord acknowledge that although the improvement in productivity of manufacturing industry in the united kingdom is undoubtedly welcome we start from a very low base and still have a long way to go before we can match the productivity levels that some of our major industrial competitors overseas have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl for the clear way in which he introduced the orders <e> <s> they follow the usual pattern and my noble friends and i have no objection to them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy has so convincingly questioned whether the code of practice in its present form by failing adequately to distinguish legal requirements from good practice will improve industrial relations that i am in danger of being repetitious <e> <s> it is surely significant however that the four bodies which are best qualified to express an opinion namely acas the cbi the tuc and the institute of personnel management are unanimously critical of draft code on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to understand from the ministers reply to the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood that there is a prospect of her majestys government treating the years between and as a period of education and training for all <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief and join in thanking the noble earl lord dundee for the clear way in which he has explained the orders <e> <s> they provide as he said for increases in compensation for unfair dismissal and in redundancy payments under the employment protection act of about per cent <e> <s> in every case <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady turner of camden has said this is less than the current increase in the rate of inflation and much less than the average national increase in earnings <e> <s> like the noble baroness i think the government might have been rather more generous in their conclusions than they have been to the employees concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords in this matter do not our major exporting companies desire a stable exchange rate particularly in relation to the german mark <e> <s> may not the difference between a rate of marks to the pound sterling in december compared with marks in december have made all the difference between success and failure in striking deals of great potential value to this countrys balance of trade <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that my noble friend lord meston is unable to speak for himself on this matter <e> <s> i understand that he has been detained unavoidably in court in oxford <e> <s> perhaps i may on his behalf thank the noble and learned lord for what he has been able to do to meet the point made by my noble friend at an earlier stage <e> <s> like the noble lords who have spoken namely the noble lords lord mishcon and lord renton i hoped that it might have been feasible to deal with this matter in a more positive manner than has been found possible <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a drafting point about which i too shall be interested to hear what the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has to say <e> <s> on behalf of my noble friends perhaps i may thank him for what he has been able to do in this amendment to meet the representations that we made earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak for i played no part at all in the passage of the bill <e> <s> on these benches we are in general agreement with the contents of the bill and are happy that it should now pass <e> <s> i join the noble lords <e> <s> lord underhill and lord teviot in thanking the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for the courteous way in which he has piloted the bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble earl lord dundee for the clear way in which he has explained the regulations <e> <s> we have no comment to make and on behalf of my noble friends i am happy to approve the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches have no objections to offer to the contents of this order but i have given the noble earl notice of a question that i wish to ask that is related indirectly to the order <e> <s> i ask for your lordships indulgence if i take a few moments to explain <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say on behalf of those of us on these benches how grateful i am for the sympathetic remarks that have been made by the noble lord lord skelmersdale and the noble baroness lady turner concerning my noble friend lord banks <e> <s> as the noble lord said there has been some slight improvement in my noble friends condition but he is still seriously ill <e> <s> i know that the whole house will join with me in expressing the hope that he will soon recover further <e> <s> i know that he has earned the respect of noble lords on all sides of the house <e> <s> perhaps it is not too much to say that his knowledge of social security matters is unrivalled among us <e> <s> i shall gladly see that the kind remarks are passed on to him <e> <s> i am sure that he wi be greatly cheered by them <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by thanking the noble baroness lady turner of camden for the sympathetic remarks she made about my noble friend lord banks <e> <s> he is indeed an expert in the matters we are discussing and would have undertaken very much better than i the task i shall now endeavour to perform <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the second part of the question that he was asked by my noble friend lord ezra relating to who should bear the cost of cleaning up such beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords we will all wish to study carefully the response of the noble earl lord dundee to the points that have been raised in this short debate <e> <s> i must confess that my first reaction was one of disappointment <e> <s> he was correct to say that we have been talking about attitudes especially those of the government in relation to their behaviour <e> <s> if i may so with respect to a large extent the minister in his response was deploying the very attitude that i and other noble lords have criticised there there my friends there is no need to worry everything is under control <e> <s> there are a number of things upon which we do not disagree very much <e> <s> however you must understand that in these matters the government know best and no other approach is the right one and thank you very much <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord brabazon for having repeated the statement which hardly comes as a surprise <e> <s> we take a rather different view of this matter than do the labour opposition <e> <s> as the statement indicates the dock labour scheme was designed to remedy the ill effects of old-style casual working and the chaotic conditions of employment that existed in the docks years ago <e> <s> however in todays conditions it seems to us that the scheme has outlived its usefulness as recent events in grimsby and aberdeen have clearly demonstrated <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord mccarthy on the presentation of his case <e> <s> i do not think that it will altogether suprise him in view of our differing reactions to the government statement earlier this month about their intention to abolish the dock labour scheme that i am unwilling to support his contention that before proceeding with the dock work bill the government should refer to the monopolies and mergers commission the allegedly restrictive labour practices in docks covered by the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to support the concept underlying the bill which was so lucidly introduced by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> if there is one person in your lordships house who has shown that she is very far from being geriatric it is the noble baroness <e> <s> she has demonstrated how frequently advertisements for job vacancies specify an age requirement and particularly that they state the person required should be aged between say and <e> <s> that obviously has a highly damaging effect on women in particular for that is the very period when large numbers of women are out of the labour market bearing and rearing their children <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure us that it is only considerations of national security that prevent the government from locating more defence establishments and thus establishing more jobs in parts of britain other than the south of england <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that for better or worse now that the governments legislation affecting industrial disputes is in place it is essential that the government should adopt an even-handed approach between employers and representatives of employees in any particular dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords when the statement announcing the governments intention to abolish the dock labour scheme was repeated in this house on th april last i made it plain that my noble friends and i considered that in todays conditions the scheme had outlived its usefulness <e> <s> again when on th april the noble lord lord mccarthy asked the government in his unstarred question whether before proceeding with the dock work bill they would refer to the monopolies and mergers commission the allegedly restrictive labour practices in the scheme ports i dissented from that proposal and said that in our view the present arrangements should now be brought to an end <e> <s> that remains our position <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be more specific as regards what special provisions are being made to adapt the governments training arrangements to the needs of redundant miners in these areas <e>", "<cs> it may save the time of the committee if i outline my general attitude to this amendment and indeed to a number of other amendments relating to clause of the bill <e> <s> essentially it is that in keeping with subsection the dock labour scheme should be brought to an end as soon as possible and that means at the time that <e>", "<cs> the theme running through all these amendments is that provision should be made for arrangements now applicable to registered dock workers under national or local agreements to continue during the transitional period between the date of the passing of the act and the date when the national dock labour board is dissolved <e>", "<cs> i shall endeavour not to disappoint the noble lord lord mellish too much <e> <s> on the face of it i accept that it is an amendment that merits sympathy <e>", "<cs> but wait my lords <e> <s> it is clearly an attempt to meet the criticism expressed by a number of noble lords of whom i was one at second reading that it is one thing to do away with the dock labour scheme and another to put nothing in its place <e>", "<cs> the first thing i should say is that i appear to have misread the amendment for which i apologise <e> <s> i shall read it out in the way that i thought it was written <e>", "<cs> at first sight this amendment seems to me eminently reasonable for it is not immediately apparent why under subsection the board may dispose of any of its assets for a consideration less than the market value <e> <s> it also appears reasonable as proposed in amendment no <e> <s> that the property of the board and any income derived from it should be applied to purposes which benefit the scheme ports and the people employed in them <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee <e> <s> the amendment appears to be reasonable and i have sympathy with it <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will look upon it in the same way <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government take account of the view that it is the tightness of the existing law binding union leaders that has prompted the recent unofficial action on the underground and in the docks <e>", "<cs> my lords this has certainly led to a longer debate than i had anticipated <e> <s> i am grateful to everyone who has taken part particularly to the noble baroness lady turner of camden for her support and to the noble lord lord callaghan with all his experience of the docks in cardiff <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord mellish although i am bound to say that his earlier remarks about the liberal party as he put it were not perhaps best calculated to win friends and influence people on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the noble lords concluding words <e> <s> certainly he led me to believe that he thought that i and my noble friends were in favour of perpetuating the scheme whereas we are not <e> <s> we are anxious that the scheme should be ended as soon as possible <e> <s> however as we see it there is something to be said for acting in a way that makes it a little more acceptable to the dockers <e> <s> at a difficult time when they are taking a ballot on possible strike action it might be made a little more acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i said that we need a national strategy for our ports that takes account of the impact on them of the channel tunnel <e> <s> i added that such a strategy would not emerge spontaneously from the operation of market forces but had to be initiated by the government <e> <s> on the other hand amendment no <e> <s> sees that development as a function in the first instance of the dock labour board <e> <s> on that score alone i am afraid that i cannot support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have considerable sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i supported the noble baroness lady turner in committee in her contention that for the avoidance of doubt the substance of what the minister in another place said in standing committee about the disposal of assets should appear on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mccarthy said one of the amendments that was moved and negatived in committee sought to impose on the board a duty during the transitional period to ensure regularity of employment for dock workers <e> <s> i opposed the amendment on the grounds that under modern working conditions fears of a return to old style casual work were exaggerated <e> <s> there were other reasons why i opposed the amendment <e> <s> i shall not repeat them now as there is no need <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mccarthy i hope that the government will clarify the terms of the subsection <e> <s> the minister did not do so adequately on report although as the noble lord said he may not have fully understood what the noble lord was seeking <e> <s> if the amendment were confined to cases which were not of a disciplinary kind i should be wholly sympathetic to it <e> <s> for instance as the noble lord has said if someone were to fall sick during the relevant period and on that account were to be dismissed and subsequently re-engaged it would seem inequitable that he should lose his entitlement to redundancy pay <e> <s> however in drafting the amendment so that it could apparently cover even cases where someone is dismissed because he has gone on strike i am troubled lest dockers should be placed by statute in a position different from that of all other employees <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches our feeling about the bill as it leaves the house is very much as it was when it came here so i shall be brief <e> <s> we have made it plain throughout that in todays conditions the dock labour scheme has outlived its usefulness and should now be brought to an end <e> <s> we continue to feel that in keeping with normal practice the government should have given other interested parties an opportunity to express their views before determining the precise arrangements under which the scheme was to be abolished <e> <s> but on the motion that the bill do now pass we must consider the position as it now is and not as we would wish it to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the governments reluctance to accept one or two of the criticisms of their legislation by this ilo committee <e> <s> however as regards the general question of what is called the social dimension would it not be more productive if instead of denouncing the concept as a whole the government aimed to persuade positively our partners in the community that for example in the matter of employee involvement we should follow the practices of our best companies <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems plain that the directions which the secretary of state may give under clauses and may be of very considerable consequence <e> <s> therefore it seems to me reasonable that he should be required to lay a copy of any such directions before parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had occasion to use evening primrose oil for medicinal purposes <e> <s> like the noble lord lord carter i wonder why it was not included in this order <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case i feel like a fish out of water <e> <s> i shall therefore content myself <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that one of his successors as chairman of the manpower services commission and also the chairman of the training commission as it then was both criticised a number of non-statutory training organisations for not promoting adequate training in their sectors <e> <s> should not the government therefore accept some responsibility for ensuring that training reaches an acceptable standard in all companies particularly those in the engineering sector <e>", "<cs> my lords is there any reason why the third reading of this bill should not be postponed until the overspill period when the relevant facts will be available as i understand it and when suitable legislation could be brought forward during the current parliamentary session <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for the clear way in which he has presented the bill to the house <e> <s> we support the first part of the bill which gives women more equality of opportunity in the fields of employment and training <e> <s> we do not think that that will result in a return to the time when women were sent unwillingly down coal mines <e> <s> it should instead give the increasing number of women who are now happily taking higher education courses in engineering and who are at present unable to follow a career in mining the opportunity to do so in future <e> <s> that seems to us a most desirable development and i have no doubt that my noble friend lady seear will have more to say later on that part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply so far as it goes <e> <s> does he agree that the white paper is written as though the only people in need of training are those in industry and commerce <e> <s> there is hardly a mention of what needs to be done in national and local government <e> <s> i suspect that most of the training there is cognitive rather than experiential <e> <s> would not all public services benefit greatly from the use of trainers experienced in helping to manage change in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that answer depressingly negative <e> <s> would it not be more productive if instead of denouncing the charter as socialist and even marxist the prime minister in particular were to give a positive lead in seeking to adapt it to conditions in this country <e> <s> is it not a fact that in the matter of employee involvement so far from insisting that workers should sit on company boards the key sentence in paragraph of the charter states <e>", "<cs> earlier today my noble friends and i went along with amendment no <e> <s> proposed by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> it proposed that no order made by the secretary of state removing restrictions on the employment of women and young persons should come into effect until there had been consultation with the health and safety commission and the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> it was also proposed that some months should pass before clause should take effect <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness in what she has just said <e> <s> i accept that much of the legislation relating to the employment of young people is now out of date but i do not see that as a reason for sweeping it all away nor despite what the noble lord lord strathclyde said earlier today <e>", "<cs> as i put my name to the amendment perhaps i may speak to it briefly <e> <s> the amendment seeks to maintain the right of people working in firms with fewer than employees to <e>", "<cs> this amendment as has been said proposes that the acas code of practice as interpreted by various court cases which followed its publication provides a reasonable legislative framework for determining when a trade unionist should be entitled to time off <e> <s> in my view it does <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness has explained to the committee the qualifying period for the right referred to in the clause has by the governments measure become the same as that applying to complaints of unfair dismissal <e> <s> the government treat the matter merely as a technical change <e> <s> however it is not good enough to regard it as a tidying up exercise particularly when one remembers that this government raised the qualifying period for unfair dismissal to two years <e> <s> in my view this is another example as was last years employment act of the way in which a bill works to the advantage of the employer and to the disadvantage of the employee <e>", "<cs> i did not but i am happy to agree with the findings of the law society on this matter <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the amendment in so far as its aim is to draw attention to the actions of employers that by the expedient of setting up what may be a number of associated companies can claim successfully that they are being subjected to secondary action in a way that i do not believe the government intended in their earlier legislation <e> <s> that was the situation as the noble lord lord wedderburn has reminded us which obtained in the celebrated dispute at wapping <e> <s> there have been other similar instances <e> <s> it may be that that point will be better dealt with in the bill that we are promised in the next session of parliament when it may be possible to deal in greater detail with the whole question of secondary action but like the noble lord i shall meanwhile be interested to hear what the minister has to say on the matter <e>", "<cs> i shall speak very briefly to the motion of which i have given notice <e> <s> employers with fewer than employees are at present entitled under the act to rebates on their statutory redundancy payments which they can recoup from the redundancy fund to which they have contributed <e> <s> my noble friends and i were not happy when earlier legislation confined payment of redundancy rebates solely to those very small firms feeling that they should be of more general application <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mccarthy for supporting me in persuading the minister to explain the reason why the government have included this clause in the bill <e> <s> i am not altogether satisfied with the explanation that he has given relying as it does so much simply on the sums of money involved <e> <s> however we have more important clauses in the bill to discuss <e> <s> having succeeded at least in getting the minister to offer some explanation as to the reasons for including this clause in the bill i do not now propose to pursue the matter further <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the noble baroness <e> <s> in addition it may be worth adding that the british institute of management feels that it would be better if the present system of informal discussions were retained those informal discussions which often now take place before a tribunal goes ahead rather than have the formalised structure set out in the bill <e>", "<cs> i shall try not to detain the committee unduly because i am conscious that we have now reached the dinner hour <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate particularly the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton who denied that many <e>", "<cs> i am not very convinced by that answer <e> <s> my understanding is that more than a few months can elapse in cases going before a tribunal and i am not at all happy that no undertaking can be given that interest will be paid <e> <s> there are a number of other points on which i am not satisfied as must be plain to the committee <e> <s> in the circumstances a good way of introducing the dinner break would be for me to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> paragraph c of the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words in support of this amendment <e> <s> in committee the noble lord lord strathclyde said that there would be substantial costs in extending child care payments across the board <e> <s> it is partly with that in view that my noble friend deliberately confined the amendment so as not to cover all married women returning to work at any time after bringing up their children but only those who return to work after pregnancy <e> <s> it is therefore a limited amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee the noble lord lord strathclyde said that he was sure that we could return at report stage to the question as to whether it was reasonable to require employers where necessary to provide transport for young people in particular girls at night <e> <s> in opposing the proposal at that time he rested his case very largely on the contention that the people concerned could exercise a choice as to whether or not they took a job where transport was not provided <e> <s> in response my noble friend lady seear said that in some small towns no job market operated between a girl of say years and an employer who controlled one of the few employment opportunities in the area <e> <s> in this bill the government are relaxing the conditions for night work <e> <s> it is up to them therefore to ensure the safety of these young people at night <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this short debate the noble baroness lady turner and particularly the noble lord lord monson from the cross-benches and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the debate has been an interesting one <e> <s> i am always a little troubled when i hear that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter admires the good intentions of my noble friends and myself and fear that something pretty damning may follow <e> <s> on this occasion if i may respectfully say so the noble lord treated the matter in a very balanced way seeing the pros and cons of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords if it could be placed in the library for the benefit of other noble lords that would be great <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i recall that the stated purpose of the present statutory provisions on this subject was to aid and improve the conduct of industrial relations <e> <s> i did not see how the governments proposals in clause could be justified within that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i have put my name to the amendment but in supporting it i shall be even briefer than the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i shall resist the temptation to follow the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes in what she said about payment of interest on deposits <e> <s> as she herself began to acknowledge that is better dealt with in the next amendment <e> <s> in committee i moved an amendment to leave out subsections and of this clause <e> <s> i submitted that the way to eliminate the considerable amounts of time and money which could be spent in dealing with frivolous and vexatious cases at tribunal hearings was not to authorise orders requiring payment of a deposit but to improve the effectiveness of pre-hearing reviews <e> <s> that is just what this amendment seeks to do <e> <s> for that reason i shall support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord campbell of alloway for their support <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mccarthy said there may not be many such cases but there will be a small number which take a significantly long time to resolve <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see much point in the government thinking about the matter if they have no intention of doing anything in this regard <e> <s> it seemed to me that the minister relied very much on the kind of defence which he put forward on the last occasion namely that the amounts of money involved are small and therefore it would not really cost a person very much to forfeit such a sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some experience of training in a large industrial organisation <e> <s> in supporting the amendment i should like to say that in my experience training cannot be carried out satisfactorily in a company unless it has the support of employees and their representatives <e> <s> the amendment is modest <e> <s> it does not as the noble baroness lady turner has just reminded us ask for any powers to be given to bodies representative of employee interests but only that they should be consulted <e> <s> the bodies concerned need not be trade unions they could well be works councils or committees <e> <s> that proposal i welcome <e> <s> the essential point is that if training is to be effective it must have the consent and co-operation of the people to be trained or it will fail in its purpose <e> <s> i gladly support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw the amendment but not because i am satisfied <e> <s> on the last point that the minister has made yes i am concerned with the position of professional trainers <e> <s> equally i am concerned not necessarily with the interests of trade unions although it seems to me that they have done a good job in a number of cases before these industrial training boards but certainly with the interests of employees and their representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to take part in this debate in company with such distinguished speakers <e> <s> from these benches i am delighted to support the bill which was so ably introduced by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> i hope to help in providing him with the all-party agreement which he said he is seeking in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord assure the house that in reaching their decision the government will take full account of the views of bodies which are well able to give them advice for example the institute of personnel management <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that we on these benches have no love for the pre-entry closed shop a matter that features prominently in this survey <e> <s> if i may speak more generally is it not about time that the government began to think less in terms of continuing restrictive legislation and more about the need to encourage greater co-operation between management and employees and their representatives in the workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finally takes his decision if i may intervene would it not be better rather than pressing his amendment at this stage after such full discussion in committee and report if the argument having been advanced on both sides it were left for another place to reconsider the position <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady seear explained in her characteristically forthright way the view that we take of the bill as it leaves the house <e> <s> i wish to add only a few words on the subject of industrial training not so much concerning the substance of the measures that the government are introducing as the manner of their introduction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is intolerable that ambulance workers should inflict suffering on the community through industrial action or be constrained by unwillingness to take it <e> <s> therefore is not the way out for the government to provide sufficient resources to enable their pay to be determined fairly under a non-strike agreement either by arbitration or through the award of a comparability study <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join in thanking the noble earl for the clear way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> i may have missed something in another place because from what the noble earl said i am not sure of the significance of the date of st march <e> <s> will he confirm that that means that the hotel and catering industry training board is to be wound up on or before that date <e> <s> i am not altogether clear why the amount of the levy is as much as per cent <e> <s> i would be grateful if the noble earl would elaborate on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am on parade and from these benches i should like to reaffirm my support for the bill which the noble lord lord campbell of alloway has now revived <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord renton i am glad that the ambiguity to which the noble and learned lord lord brightman referred earlier has been picked up by the committee <e> <s> i had a word today with the noble lords lord campbell and lord mccarthy on this point <e> <s> i am relieved to learn as no doubt are other noble lords that it can be put right at report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that on th december last the certification officer said that the federation set up to replace trade unions banned from gchq could not be recognised as an independent union because it was subject to the approval of the director <e> <s> how does he reconcile that statement with the governments earlier reported claim that genuine trade unionism is allowed at gchq <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that in asking this question i am not seeking to intervene in the current unhappy dispute <e> <s> that would not be helpful <e> <s> will she confirm that the chief executive of the national health service has proposed that the staff and management sides should undertake a joint review of the ambulance service salary structure in which no preconditions would be set <e> <s> does this mean for example that if arbitration or a review body is ruled out at least some flexible system such as that now being introduced in parts of the civil service may be used in future to determine the pay of ambulance workers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred earlier to the whitley council <e> <s> although management representatives are in theory free to negotiate with the staff side of the whitley council is it not the case that in practice settlements can be reached only with the prior approval of the secretary of state or even the treasury <e> <s> are there therefore not three sides to these negotiations rather than two <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to thank the minister for the way in which he introduced the order <e> <s> it is clear whether we like it or not that the government are intent upon dissolving the co-operative development agency <e> <s> however the support of my party has been so keen and prolonged notably by my noble friend lord grimond that i do not feel i can let this occasion pass without comment <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the amendment <e> <s> should it not find favour with the noble lord lord strathclyde i shall support the amendment to be moved in that eventuality by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government recognise that if legislation on industrial relations is to be effective it must strike a fair balance between the interests of employers and those of employees and their representatives <e> <s> when can we expect legislation in this field to be followed by the government making positive moves to encourage greater co-operation between management and employees <e>", "<cs> my lords before i say anything else may i apologise to the house and to the noble lord lord strathclyde in particular if i have to leave before he has replied to our discussion <e> <s> in mitigation i can only say that this is the second thursday in succession that we are debating during the dinner break an industrial relations matter and this time at very short notice <e> <s> i have to catch a train home tonight so as to be in cheshire tomorrow morning <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join in thanking the noble earl lord caithness for the clear way in which he has introduced this bill <e> <s> the matters with which it deals are in some respects complicated and i am certainly not expert in them <e> <s> however it is plain that the main provisions are in clause and that many of the other clauses are concerned merely with matters of a technical nature or designed to tidy up existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords in this short debate i am anxious to say nothing that might make it harder for a settlement of this unhappy dispute to be reached <e> <s> i would go further and say respectfully that in my experience it is rarely if ever helpful for people without close knowledge of all the factors involved to intervene in industrial disputes <e> <s> that goes for politicians such as ourselves as much as anyone else and the course the discussion has taken tonight supports my view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness was kind enough to refer to what i said about the chief ambulance officers <e> <s> would she be prepared to go so far as to say that there may be some merit in the suggestion that i put forward that the management side might be willing to leave for future talks the whole question of a pay formula <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested but not altogether convinced by the exposition of the noble lord lord mccarthy or should i call it perhaps a rationalisation of the labour partys position on the closed shop <e> <s> but i do not propose to follow him down that road except to say that the opposition of my party particularly to the pre-entry closed shop is well known <e> <s> i think there is no need for me to elaborate on it now <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the motion that the bill do now pass and renew my congratulations to the noble lord lord campbell on having obtained support for it from all sides of the house <e> <s> like him and like the noble lord lord mccarthy i hope that the objective of the bill can be met by an amendment to the employment bill now in standing committee in another place when it comes to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister go a little further and agree that it would be highly damaging to this countrys interests if the governments decision to convert the engineering industry training board into a non-statutory organisation were to result in any reduction in the financial support that we receive from the european social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords irrespective of the legal position and given the unsatisfactory history of balloting in the union and its earlier unwillingness to permit the electoral reform society to conduct or supervise the poll would it not be wise for the general secretary of the transport and general workers union to refer the latest malpractice without delay to independent investigation in the interests of the unions members and of the trade union movement as a whole <e>", "<cs> on second reading i said that it must be recognised that the elimination of <e>", "<cs> at second reading i said that my understanding was that although the working party on the funding of the teachers superannuation scheme had reached agreement on how the scheme <e>", "<cs> i too am concerned that there has apparently been no consultation with interested parties about the effect of the clause on the rights of re-employed members of local government superannuation schemes <e> <s> if that is the case i hope that the minister will be able to give us a satisfactory explanation as to how that has come about and will tell us what he proposes to do about it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord dean determines what he will do about the amendment perhaps i may say a few words <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment seeks not only consultation but agreement on employment terms and conditions <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that before a scheme can be introduced under this section there should not only be consultation but that the terms and conditions of employment should be agreed by the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords since as i understand it no planning permission is required before this unsightly transmitter is erected is there any prospect of some independent means being used to balance the interests of national defence against the disfigurement of st davids head <e>", "<cs> it would be wrong for discussion on this important amendment to be concluded without some contribution however brief from these benches <e> <s> i have no experience of local government nor of health administration <e> <s> nevertheless i have listened to the debate and taking into account the difficulties raised by the noble baroness lady young in particular i find myself wholly in sympathy with the principle of ring fencing for the funding of community care which underlies this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for his reply <e> <s> however does he accept that the national audit office reported recently that the training of white collar civil servants was too often subordinate to more immediate pressures on manpower <e> <s> does he also accept that it cited the high level of cancellations in respect of college training courses and referred to the limited role allowed to departmental training officers <e>", "<cs> my lords the lord privy seal in his reply to me said that at this stage i would not expect him to comment in more detail on the report of the national audit office <e> <s> however will he go a little further and acknowledge that the matters to which i referred are of such significance that they require constant monitoring by the government quite independently of anything that the national audit office may have to say upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow up that question <e> <s> does the minister agree that one way to mitigate the effects of redundancies in the construction industry particularly those affecting young people would be to restore to the citb at least temporarily the financial assistance formerly made available to it for youth training <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the secretary of states speech has served to fuel damaging newspaper speculation such as that in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord strathclyde for the clear way in which he introduced the bill <e> <s> on these benches we welcome the provision which makes it unlawful to deny employment to people because they are trade union members or because they are not but we regret that the bill in our view fails to do anything positive to improve industrial relations and we fear that the proposals to amend the law relating particularly to unofficial industrial action will result in further legal disputation rather than contribute to the peaceful resolution of disputes <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in thanking the noble baroness lady blatch for introducing this order <e> <s> at this time on a friday afternoon i do not propose to discuss the findings of the interim advisory committee in detail but rather to take the opportunity briefly to say how we on these benches view the present situation regarding the pay and conditions of teachers generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the motion tabled by the noble viscount lord caldecote is so framed that it enables us to debate the merits of the governments policies on industrial relations over the past years and where we differ from them to make our own suggestions for the future <e> <s> one of the advantages of general debates of this kind is that we can approach matters in a more constructive frame of mind than when we are confronted with specific bills of a controversial kind <e> <s> that is my aim today <e> <s> i am only sorry that the noble viscount did not choose to do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him a question <e> <s> i think he said that the governments proposed legislation on unofficial action would have the effect of solving disputes in which such action occurred <e> <s> does the noble lord accept that it remains to be seen whether the legislation will have that effect <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have two points to make <e> <s> i appreciate that he may not be able to deal with them today and if that is the case perhaps he will write to me <e> <s> however i asked first whether the government would consider the introduction of a code of practice relating to negotiating procedure agreements <e> <s> secondly i made the point that the government needed to do more to fulfil their responsibility for training especially in the management of people in the public services which would include national and local government <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i shall be brief <e> <s> in this question the noble lord lord dean of beswick has asked whether the government are satisfied that the present powers of the health and safety executive are adequate to safeguard those working on the channel tunnel <e> <s> accordingly i have tried to get a closer idea of the nature of the conditions which need to be safeguarded <e> <s> that they are dangerous is clear from the fact that up to last month as the noble lord lord dean said there have been six deaths on the british side of the channel compared with two on the french side <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord acknowledge that the key sentence in the social charter relating to employee involvement states <e>", "<cs> my lords on a related question is it the case that training and enterprise councils have complained of inadequate funding and asked for greater freedom of operation and more control over their budgets <e> <s> do the government agree that these councils should have more autonomy in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is no doubt as the minister has stated but do not actions of employers such as those the noble baroness has mentioned make a mockery of the first sentence in the employment bill that we are to discuss next week namely that it is unlawful to refuse employment to a person who is or is not a member of a trade union <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i must agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the concept of fairness has no application in this case <e> <s> there are distinctions to be drawn between professional organisations and trade unions as the noble viscount lord caldecote said <e> <s> he instanced the example of chartered engineers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this short debate and particularly to the noble baroness lady turner of camden for her support <e> <s> it is fair to say that in my opening speech i anticipated a number of the criticisms that could be and have been made about the amendment <e> <s> that includes the point made by the minister that someone who has a complaint concerning his past trade union activities has his <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness understands my difficulty with the amendment is its insistence as i see it that even in companies which do not recognise trade unions the employer has to accept that in matters concerning any dispute or grievance employees should have a statutory right to be represented by a union official <e> <s> as i see it it is one thing that in such cases an employee should have what might be called a prisoners friend <e> <s> it is another that that friend should even in non-union firms necessarily be a union official <e> <s> with respect i suggest that that is to go further than may be reasonable in the circumstances <e>", "<cs> as i see it amendment no <e> <s> deals with a different matter of principle which i had supposed we would discuss at a later stage <e> <s> however if it is the general wish of the committee that the two sets of amendments should be taken together that is acceptable to us <e>", "<cs> i am now rather confused <e> <s> it seems to me that there are two distinct matters here <e> <s> the first concerns the form of words of amendment no <e> <s> which was questioned by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> in questioning it he referred to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i wish to speak to the substance of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> since we are now speaking to both amendments perhaps i should speak to that amendment now <e>", "<cs> i can be very brief <e> <s> i have already made it plain that my noble friends and i fully support the governments decision after years of the step-by-step approach initiated by the noble lord lord prior whom i am glad to see in his place to bring the pre-entry closed shop to an end <e> <s> on the basis of that principle i would very much like to support the motion that the clause stand part <e>", "<cs> as a liberal democrat i can well understand the feelings which prompted the noble baroness lady turner of camden to move this amendment <e> <s> i never had much love for the activities of the organisation to which she referred namely the economic league which conveys information to employers about the alleged activities of potential recruits to their employment <e> <s> that feeling dates from a time about years ago when it fell to me to ensure that the two people who were representatives of the league and who regularly sought to address employees of the company for which i then worked were kept in their proper place that is outside the factory gates <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord wedderburn has reminded us clause has the effect of making all secondary action illegal <e> <s> he told us what the governments position was in <e> <s> the governments view is that there have since then been abuses <e> <s> the question therefore is whether the mischief that has occurred since is sufficient to justify this new measure <e>", "<cs> my difficulty with this amendment is that it clearly means that it would no longer be possible except with the consent in a ballot of the majority of employees in a relevant bargaining unit for an employer after due notice to withdraw from a procedural and collective bargaining agreement <e> <s> surely it should always be open to both parties to such an agreement to do just that <e> <s> i sympathise very much with the case presented by the noble baroness but not so much that i feel able to subscribe to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am in something of a dilemma concerning the motion of the noble baroness that clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> the committee may recall that at an earlier stage i felt obliged to oppose or any rate not to support which i suppose amounts to the same thing either amendment no <e> <s> or amendment no <e> <s> two of the main amendments concerning secondary action under the clause <e> <s> on the other hand i very much agree with the noble baroness that it is important that there should be even-handedness between employers and employees <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had made my position absolutely plain <e> <s> the noble lord had not altogether dispelled my fear that in order to escape employers in that situation might seek to set up separate companies in order to defeat what would then become secondary action <e> <s> noble lords opposite may disagree but i am entitled to express that view which i consider to be important <e> <s> in effect i have supported the government on a number of <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and if the chairman will allow me i want to make my position plain on one other point <e> <s> the noble lord said that in this i was supporting the labour party <e> <s> i am not supporting the labour party <e> <s> i did not say that i would vote with the labour party <e> <s> i said that i did not find it possible to vote with the government <e>", "<cs> as these are the first amendments dealing with potential union liability for unofficial industrial action i should say that in my view clause will do nothing to improve this countrys industrial relations <e> <s> it may well create more difficulties for management by prolonging procedures for resolving disputes <e> <s> that in turn may provoke employees to take more unofficial action rather than less <e> <s> there is a further danger <e> <s> the governments aim in introducing this clause is to curb such action <e> <s> however my fear is that it may have the reverse effect in that unofficial action will escalate into major official disputes legitimised by a ballot <e>", "<cs> in my view subsection a b of clause goes over the top <e> <s> a trade union official may be a member of a group which unbeknown to him decides to organise industrial action <e> <s> he may not even be present at the meeting at which it is decided to take such action <e> <s> nevertheless he may be held responsible for the acts of the group unless his union goes through the whole process of repudiation to which we shall come in a moment <e>", "<cs> i am naturally sorry that the noble lord lord wedderburn did not feel able to support this amendment <e> <s> there have been a number of amendments which he has moved today with which i have disagreed and therefore he is quite entitled to take the view that he has <e> <s> in any case my aim here as i hope i made plain was to test the words of the minister in another place <e> <s> i have taken the view that the notice as it stands and as it will stand if the governments amendments are accepted is altogether too stark <e> <s> i believe that is the word i used <e>", "<cs> i too must briefly protest <e> <s> far from doing anything to improve this countrys industrial relations clause may alas have the reverse effect from that intended by the government in that it may provoke employees to take more rather than less industrial action <e> <s> i am not sure that i can agree with the noble lord lord wedderburn that clause is the worst clause in the bill <e> <s> i believe that that distinction may apply to clause <e> <s> however i must join with the noble lord in saying that it is a bad clause <e>", "<cs> i too have read subsection a as meaning that in future a union would be precluded from lawfully recommending that its members should engage in industrial action <e> <s> if so that is a major departure from present practice <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will be able to remove any doubt and assure the committee that the subsection as it stands is not unnecessarily restrictive <e>", "<cs> i too welcome the governments belated decision to accept the basic principle first put forward by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway last year and supported by noble lords in all parts of the committee including a number of distinguished law lords <e>", "<cs> i support the principle underlying the amendment <e> <s> i know that it will be said that our system of industrial relations under which trade unions are granted certain legal immunities is different from that in other european countries which operate on a basis of positive rights <e> <s> however increasingly as evidenced by the social charter and its action programme and the proposed european council directive on worker participation there will be need for our arrangements to come more closely into line with those operating elsewhere in the community <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not convinced me and i do not believe he has convinced many members of the committee <e> <s> i am grateful to all members of the committee who have taken part in the discussion and for the support that the amendment has received <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for having the courage to say what he did <e>", "<cs> there has to be a period of one working day between the notice of repudiation being given in that way and the time when people need to be aware of that repudiation and can therefore consider or reconsider their position <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord should take that view <e> <s> we are at the committee stage and are debating the issue as a matter of principle <e> <s> i should have thought that it was for the government spokesman to indicate whether he is prepared to reconsider the matter before i take a decision <e> <s> my decision may differ depending on his answer <e>", "<cs> i am thoroughly unconvinced by that last reply <e> <s> the period of grace to which the noble lord referred is the period between written notice of repudiation and the time when people on the factory floor need to be aware that they are taking unofficial action <e> <s> the amendment has nothing to do with that <e> <s> the amendment calls upon the government to accept in the interests of elementary justice and sound personnel practice that before employees are instantly dismissed they should be entitled at least to a warning <e> <s> i believe that they are entitled to much more but they should at least have that <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord has said it attempts to deal with the vexed question of whether a collective refusal to work on grounds of perceived danger to health or safety constitutes unofficial industrial action <e> <s> in another place argument on the point ended in deadlock each side contending that the law was clear on the matter <e> <s> however from what i have heard tonight it appears to be anything but clear <e> <s> at no time in another place did the minister give chapter and verse for the governments view that such a refusal does not amount to industrial action <e> <s> the amendment seeks to put the matter beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> it does not <e> <s> the noble lord speaks of a remedy being to go to an industrial tribunal <e> <s> is it not the case that if somebody engages in what in the view of the employer is unofficial action whether or not in the view of the employee or employees taking that action it is on grounds of perceived danger to health and safety the employer has it within his power instantly to dismiss that person or those persons <e> <s> the possibility of their going to an industrial tribunal cannot then arise <e>", "<cs> clause provides for a senior trade union officer based let us suppose in london to do his best to give individual written notice of repudiation of unofficial industrial action without delay to every union member whom the union has reason to believe is taking part or might otherwise take part in that action <e> <s> according to clause those taking part in the action will need to be aware on the following day that their action has been repudiated by their union or they will lose their claim for unfair dismissal if they continue with their action <e>", "<cs> there is not much more that i can say on this objectionable clause that has not already been said <e> <s> however perhaps i may put on record that if in future it is to be open to employers to single out for dismissal individuals taking part in unofficial industrial action i do not believe that they should be entitled to do so without having to justify their action before an independent arbiter <e> <s> in my view that is an elementary principle of justice <e> <s> i am strongly opposed to the governments action in departing from that principle in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords in one of his replies the minister referred to employment training <e> <s> as he knows the application of employment training has come in for much criticism recently <e> <s> are the government satisfied with the present position in relation to et <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness said the amendment aims to bring into the open the covert activities of the economic league an organisation for which from earlier experience i have precious little respect <e> <s> particularly suspect is the way in which the records of the organisation are compiled manually and thus escape the scrutiny to which if they were computerised they would be subject under the data protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wedderburn said in committee we had some discussion on an amendment which sought to delete subsection a b of clause <e> <s> i supported that amendment on the grounds that it was unreasonable for a union unless it went through an elaborate procedure of repudiation to be held liable for the actions of a single member of a group which perhaps unbeknown to the local union official had decided to take industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for this amendment <e> <s> if unions are to be obliged by law to go through the whole complicated process of repudiation then they will be burdened with administrative and logistical problems <e> <s> they may also have to incur quite heavy expenditure <e> <s> i believe that there are good reasons for asking the government to fund some of the expenditure involved <e> <s> indeed that is what the amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> it is significant that in its briefing memorandum on the bill the british institute of management also thought so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not very strong on expenditure of any kind <e> <s> however a virtue of the matter seemed to me to be that in moving the amendment the noble lord lord mccarthy was not seeking to cover all expenditure he was seeking to cover only the expenditure which applied where more than people were involved <e>", "<cs> my lords at risk of repetition i must reaffirm briefly that in our view clause will do nothing positively to improve this countrys industrial relations and performance <e> <s> on the contrary i fear that it will create more difficulties for management by prolonging procedures established for the purpose of resolving disputes without recourse to industrial action <e> <s> in turn that may provoke employees to take more unofficial action rather than less <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to the view expressed by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> in committee i moved an amendment to the effect that an employer should not be permitted to single out for dismissal an employee who was taking part in unofficial industrial action without first giving that individual due warning of the consequences of continuing that action <e> <s> i further said that in my view it was an offence against natural justice that such a dismissal could take place under circumstances in which the individual would have no right to claim unfair dismissal and the employer would not have to justify his action before an industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i have the agreement of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> therefore i have tabled the amendment to allow three days rather than one within which the operation can fairly and reasonably be expected to be completed <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i find it difficult to understand why these two matters are as the minister put it distinct <e> <s> i shall need to look carefully at what he said <e> <s> however at first sight i find it difficult to understand his response to the point i made that under clause as i understand it notice of repudiation must be given in writing and not by word of mouth <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty about speaking to such an amendment is that practically everything that there is to be said about the clause has already been said <e> <s> since however as i said before it is more objectionable than any other clause in the bill i shall merely say that i feel that in practice far from helping disputes to be settled peacefully the clause may well result in explosive situations which have the opposite effect <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord renton sits down he has done me an injustice <e> <s> first the clause is not primarily about unofficial action <e> <s> the main objection that my noble friends and i have as well as the labour opposition concerns the way in which it gives powers to employers to single out for dismissal individuals taking part in unofficial action <e> <s> that is the guts of the clause as i understand it <e> <s> i do not believe that employers should be empowered to do this without having to justify their action before an independent tribunal <e> <s> it is unjust that it should take place <e> <s> i am more strongly opposed to the governments action in departing from that principle than i am to any other single element in the bill <e> <s> that is why i have taken this attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seem to be getting on very well with the noble lord lord renton this evening <e> <s> i have long felt and said again as recently as last month in the debate on industrial relations initiated by the noble viscount lord caldecote that it is high time the government gave a lead in promoting the introduction revision and rationalisation of procedures aimed at resolving disputes between management and employees more quickly <e> <s> in contrast to the current bill that would be a positive contribution to the improvement of this countrys industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords at report stage i moved an amendment to the effect that industrial action should not be treated as unofficial before the end of the third working day after the day on which the action was repudiated by the union <e> <s> having studied the ministers response in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the bill leaves this house our attitude to it on these benches is much the <e>", "<cs> my lords i first wish the noble viscount well on what i believe is his first appearance at the dispatch box as the minister responsible in this house for dealing with employment matters <e>", "<cs> my lords what are the government doing to improve the quality and effectiveness of the pre-hearing reviews that take place prior to industrial tribunal hearings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that for once i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> in my view abolition of the dock labour scheme has been amply justified by the improvement in productivity and in our industrial performance that has followed <e>"]
