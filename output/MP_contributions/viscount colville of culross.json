["<cs> my lords i think i am the last spokesman from the back benches this evening at least i hope i am so i shall touch upon only one subject but having been with my noble friend lord boyd in zimbabwe-rhodesia during the period of the election i was very much struck by one thing <e> <s> immediately after the reiteration by people in every quarter of the country black and white in town and in country that they wanted the war to cease the next thing that they said showed a touching faith in what they believed would be the ensuing conservative government a faith that we would at last be able to do something to bring an end to their atrocious problems <e> <s> if i can do anything to assist my noble friend lord carrington in that direction i shall be only too satisfied to have tried and perhaps since i think our debate may be studied in salisbury and in other parts of zimbabwe-rhodesia as well as in this country a few people may also listen to what i hope will be words of goodwill from myself towards <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord gladwyn may have been mistaken in his recollection <e> <s> but there are two domestic mistakes that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true but from the point of view of day-to-day command they are bound as a matter of law to do what the prime minister says <e> <s> it is spelled out in express terms in the constitution and if anybody wants to look at it one of the places is section <e> <s> i conclude that after months for reasons beyond the control of those in zimbabwe-rhodesia though perhaps not sufficiently foreseen by them there are these deep and serious misunderstandings about the constitution which we shall have to tackle <e> <s> at the same time i very much take the point made by my noble friend lord home and my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness has touched upon this matter it is true to say that professor parry was not there and that it is easy to detect several serious errors of law in what she has written <e> <s> i am afraid that i do not think that she entirely understood the constitution <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> i did not say those that have no strike rules but those that have no ballot rules <e>", "<cs> i do not think i shall be the most popular member of the committee if i attempt to answer all the points that were made <e> <s> i would just say this to the noble lord lord underhill and to my noble friend lord de la warr i think i could quite quickly darn the ribbons which they seem to have detected but if they are interested i shall reserve the pleasure of doing so until i can do it in private afterwards <e> <s> for instance the question raised by my noble friend of there being no other remedy in the county court was simply an attempt to avoid a breach of statutory duty which would get the trade union into court in tort in another fashion from that from which it is normally immune <e>", "<cs> as the fourth noble lord to talk about the format of this clause other than on clause stand part i cannot be out of order <e> <s> may i suggest to the noble lord lord mishcon that the first priority is to make sure that nothing is done in this bill that will prevent rapid consolidation <e> <s> that is the primary thing that we must hope for <e> <s> there have already been substantial changes to the general rate act which was itself a consolidation act <e> <s> after this bill goes through i think we cannot wait for another version of that <e> <s> the second thing i would suggest to him is that whereas it is comparatively common to write in new sections or subsections into existing statutes the use of different type faces has been reserved so far for what i consider to be the most valuable of all purposes that is the construction of a keeling schedule whereby the new text with the amendments highlighted in the usually heavy print is set out in a schedule to the bill so that one can see the complete new text as it has been amended in the legislation there and then <e> <s> that is not a device very often used by draftsmen not as often as i would like to see <e> <s> if we introduce too many different forms of type face however the value of that particular exercise which is great when it is done may well fall away <e> <s> i would hope therefore that he would be satisfied with the expectation of early consolidation <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is perfectly right <e> <s> it is probably the result of my hand writing <e> <s> if i may consider the matter rapidly on my feet may i suggest a manuscript amendment to insert the word of instead of or when i come to that <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend answers that understand entirely what has happened and it would be very unfair of me to ask the noble lord lord ponsonby about some of the details of the amendment he has put down <e> <s> but as a person who from time to time indeed not altogether infrequently has to use these parts of the town and country planning act i should be interested if one looks for instance in page of the marshalled list at the new subsection of the proposed inserted new section b of the town and country planning act to know why one cannot ask for the grant of planning permission <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry but i have to disagree with my noble friend lord drumalbyn <e> <s> i can think of a number of cases where i should have been all too pleased to have had an opportunity to correct quite inadvertent facts and omissions in an inspectors report which led to subsequent litigation and was of no great advantage to anybody <e> <s> the difficulty is that it is not just a matter of the applicant and the local planning authority <e>", "<cs> that is what i complain about <e>", "<cs> if you do not consult all the parties who have been allowed under the discretion given to the inspector at the inquiry to correct all the facts that they said they had adduced at the inquiry you will simply have trouble compounded <e> <s> you will simply have to allow all the people who have had their say at the inquiry to join in this procedure <e> <s> there is no alternative <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to keep disagreeing with my noble friends on this side of the house at least in the text of what they say but i think that my noble friend has a point <e> <s> if it cannot be met by this amendment and i think that the argument is overwhelmingly against it could my noble friend on the front bench consider this <e> <s> it is very easy to spot list a building because it is under threat or because some event in the locality has required the department to have a good comb through their list and add about per cent <e> <s> more because some threat is seen <e> <s> when it comes as it will do or may do in due course to the question of getting a listed building consent for an alteration or a demolition that is the time when one can <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to prevent my noble friend lord bellwin from answering at once but when my noble friend lord mottistone moved this amendment or an equivalent amendment at the committee stage i stayed silent for the very good reason that i have been involved professionally in the main cases that have given rise to the amendment that he has put down <e> <s> therefore for the very good reasons that this house lays down i cannot discuss those <e> <s> nevertheless i very much hope that the government will be very careful before they fall for the invitation that has been put forward in this amendment not least because they have said that for the moment there is to be no revaluation at any rate not until an order is brought in we know not when <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies may i put to the noble lord lord mishcon a problem on both amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> on amendment no <e> <s> i know of four cases where the question what and when was the planning permission has been before the courts <e> <s> in two of them the courts have held that the document which was purporting to grant the planning permission was completely invalid and void in the one case because the officer had written exactly the opposite of what the committee had decided and had granted planning permission when they had refused it and in the second case which was the famous supermarket in south wales where the clerk of the district council purported to grant a planning permission when he had neither the authority of his district council nor of the county planning authority which actually ought to have been seized of the matter in the first place <e> <s> in both events the courts overruled the apparent effect of the document but they would not be able to do i think without great difficulty if the document was conclusive evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it was in that the law commission produced their paper no <e> <s> on this topic as usual a well-researched document based upon wide consultation and containing at the back a draft bill with notes upon it <e> <s> they did their usual excellent job and i am happy to say that the current chairman of the law commission has written to me saying that he is glad that at last this work is coming off the shelf and on to the floor of parliament <e> <s> i am also immensely grateful to her majestys government for the assistance that they have <e>", "<cs> my lords the welcome that has just come from my noble friend is not wholly unexpected <e> <s> none the less it is agreeable <e> <s> as for the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones it is particularly comforting to know that he has not been able to find any serious defect in the bill <e> <s> perhaps i could deal very quickly with his three points <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reminded that the occasion to which the noble lord refers was the passage of the criminal justice act when we had a flee vote on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> all i need say is that i am wholly convinced by the argument of my noble friend that this would be an improvement to the bill <e>", "<cs> if it would help the simple answer is yes the common law offence of forgery is being abolished <e> <s> it is being replaced by a new statutory set of definitions of which the bill contains the whole detail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords for no fee <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a long time since i was the chairman for a brief period of the joint consolidation bills committee but during that period and indeed beforehand when i was an ordinary member i appreciated very distinctly what an exceptionally important job was done largely by the parliamentary draftsmen in the process of consolidation of the law <e> <s> i do not wish to depart in any way whatever from the comments which have been made by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in saying that this sort of innovation is something that one should certainly look at with benevolence <e> <s> the existing systems are fraught with difficulty <e> <s> perhaps the last time there was a paving bill for a general consolidation that i can remember was the process which concerned land drainage which was a particularly technical and barren if not and which would be the wrong word subject for such a matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put down my name on the list <e> <s> i also have to apologise as a fairly recently co-opted member of the sub-committee for the fact that i was able to put in i am afraid very few attendances because of various preoccupations at home and overseas <e> <s> nevertheless it is a subject with which i have had some professional concern in the past and i suppose i ought to declare an interest in that it is possible that i may have a professional concern with it in the future <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might use this opportunity to ask my noble friend lord belstead about certain words in this subsection which are going to turn up again in various other places in the bill in other words to seek from him some information which may be relevant to some later amendments <e> <s> they are the words if the secretary of state is satisfied <e> <s> there are two points about this <e> <s> first the noble lord lord hunt has spoken in terms of the anxieties that the bill creates and this has been a theme that has run through everything that has been before the committee today <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to the noble lord but i am differentiating between the places where they occur and am trying to find out what is the justification for having them here as opposed to having them in clause <e> <s> the second point i expect the noble lord lord gifford will be taking this up at length is to know what the effect will be of having these words in when in the ultimate it is intended that the courts should have the final say <e> <s> supposing the secretary of state certifies that he is satisfied is the minister sure that the courts will definitely be able to go behind a certificate of satisfaction of that sort <e> <s> there is a good deal of case law under all sorts of legislation which suggests that there is at least a danger that when one uses a formula of this sort it cuts out any jurisdiction in the courts if the secretary of state simply says that he is satisfied <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i understood from reading reports about this matter in another place that the government were not anticipating that it would be done by way of judicial review in one of the senses of prerogative orders but that it would be done by an application for a declaration <e> <s> therefore it may be possible to go into rather more of the facts by way of appeal on fact as it were than perhaps the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord lord gifford allow me a few words before he decides what to do with his amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble and learned friend to have one more look at this point <e> <s> i fully take the point that there may be cases where the secretary of state does satisfy himself on the basis of information which might fall short of proper proof required in a court of law <e> <s> similarly it is useful to have a signpost covering to whom it is that one should apply <e> <s> both of those could be perfectly well supplied with the words on application to the secretary of state without saying anything about satisfying him <e> <s> one could simply provide that the first application was to go to the secretary of state which means that the first decision would be his <e> <s> if it is a more lenient decision than might have been obtained in a court of law then so much the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house doth agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house doth agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i am very much obliged to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i shall of course look this up he has given me the reference so that i may do that <e> <s> of course if he is right that completely meets the point and perhaps he would allow me to pursue the matter further with the necessary book <e>", "<cs> no not in this connection <e> <s> the question of judicial review which i wish to discuss in another amendment is specifically not intended to deal with the discretionary decisions <e>", "<cs> there are no provisions in the bill and that is just the trouble <e> <s> i find the greatest possible difficulty in supporting the amendment that was gently advocated by the noble lord lord mishcon because when you get into this area of discretion i can see some of the difficulties which my noble and learned friend lord rawlinson and my <e>", "<cs> i imagine it would be the wish of the committee just to finish this amendment before we take the statement and i will do so very quickly indeed <e> <s> as one footnote to the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter i would say that the difficulty about getting the courts to come to the interpretation that he foreshadowed as did also my noble and learned friend is that you have a sort of anisminic type case where the difficulty is such that it is only in this house that the matter is finally resolved <e> <s> that is an extremely expensive way of doing it for the sake of two or three words in the bill which would save all that trouble <e> <s> on the main point i understand perfectly well the scope of the undertaking that had been made earlier by the front bench about the secretary of states being satisfied <e> <s> what i had hoped to do in this amendment was to deal with some of the mechanics of the way in which judicial review works and i have welcomed the support of the noble lord lord mishcon on this <e> <s> i think everybody agrees that there is a real problem here <e>", "<cs> whatever may be the effect on any other member of the committee my noble and learned friend has thrown me into a certain amount of confusion <e> <s> i would have tended to suggest <e>", "<cs> may i say to my noble <e>", "<cs> what we are dealing with at the moment as i understand it are the acts of discretion like naturalisation and a number of others in the bill and it is really because of my interest in the appeal procedure that i ventured to say a few words to the noble lord lord pitt and those who support him because i am a little unhappy about the way in which his amendments are drafted and it would be less than consistent of me if i did not say so <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble and learned friend for this series of amendments which he has put down <e> <s> i think that i need add very little to what the noble lord lord gifford has said on this matter <e> <s> i am in an unusual alliance with him on this occasion <e> <s> i should like to consider the question of appeal-ability in connection with my much later amendments which certainly will not be reached today because i am still not entirely certain how the courts would look upon a claim that the various criteria of entitlement had been fulfilled when as my noble and learned friend has said the secretary of state in practice had found that he was not satisfied on that point <e> <s> but this is certainly a clarification <e> <s> it must make life easier for those who wish to test their rights and certainly nothing that i would wish to say this evening would do anything other than welcome it and encourage the house to accept this amendment and those that go with it <e>", "<cs> my lords it merely requires your lordships to look for a moment at clause which states that <e>", "<cs> i was attempting to be as brief as i could my lords and i had dealt with the point in committee <e> <s> there is in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be very brief <e> <s> may i first deal with the points raised by my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e>", "<cs> my lords i want first to thank those of your lordships who have been so kind as to support me and who have adduced a number of weighty arguments in favour of having this matter clarified <e> <s> if that does not entirely include my noble friend lord campbell of alloway may i say to him that i had no intention of trying to introduce a general reform of the entire system of the courts in great britain under the guise of this amendment <e> <s> nor did i suppose for a moment that anything that my noble and learned friend lord mackay of clashfern would say would have the smallest influence on the way in which the divisional court or court of appeal or your lordships sitting judicially would come to their judicial decisions <e> <s> as i plainly said i wanted to know what was the home office attitude about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord pitt will forgive me if i do not follow him down those somewhat broad paths although i know he speaks with the utmost sincerity and conviction upon this matter <e> <s> i should like to address the house for a moment because both my voice and my vote have been quoted on the committee stage and i think i should explain why i am not going to be able to support my noble friends on the front bench this evening although in fact i shall go away <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bitterly sorry that my noble friends on the front bench have not taken this opportunity of making appealable one area of government out of a very large number one area of government which is comparatively isolated in being now still without any remedy in any form of court or tribunal against the whole tendency of legislative practice over the past or years <e> <s> but i have one very considerable reservation about leaving this amendment in the bill and this alone <e>", "<cs> if i may follow the point made by the noble baroness about the definition in subsection in requesting and obtaining this the board and the statutory undertakers have obtained rather a good deal <e> <s> if the land is not operational land then presumably my noble friend will confirm that the local authority would take action under clause as we have just been discussing it <e> <s> there is no reason why any question of operational land should come in <e> <s> if however it is operational land then on the face of the clause the british railways board and the statutory undertakers have a perfectly reasonable concession in subsection of this new clause in that they can ask the local authority in carrying out the works to do anything necessary to protect the safety of the undertaking <e>", "<cs> with respect a manuscript amendment is required to leave out <e>", "<cs> i was not making the point that the whole of the clause ought to be deleted <e> <s> it may well be in every other respect it stands perfectly well on its own rights <e> <s> all i was saying was that as clause a has not been moved and is not in the bill it is improper to put in another new clause which has a reference to that clause <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c has references to other clauses for instance clause to which we have no objection and that has already been passed <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with that so long as if my noble friend wishes to pursue it he moves manuscript amendments to leave out the reference to the clause that he has not moved <e> <s> it means two manuscript amendments in paragraph <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend two questions <e> <s> as i understand my noble friends amendment and i appreciate that this may not be the definitive version but nevertheless it enables one to discuss the matter it seems to me that several noble lords and noble baronesses who have taken part in the debate may not have understood what the proposition is <e> <s> my noble friend would help <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for one moment <e> <s> i have heard the criticism that he has made about this passage in the bill but i am sure that he would like to refresh his memory about the existing provisions in the local government act of which in my time i have had considerable experience <e> <s> i am fully aware that they take up a certain amount of time and trouble but they <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> i do not expect my noble and learned friend on the woolsack to give an answer immediately <e> <s> however i should like to put to him a point which i have found to be of particular difficulty for practitioners when dealing with commencement orders on a bill which is as he himself has said of a heterogeneous nature <e> <s> the matter relates to the title of the commencement order <e> <s> what happens in the printed paper office here is that there is kept a consecutive pile of statutory instruments as they come out in the course of the year and a very large pile it is and at the same time there is kept an index and each of the statutory instruments is catalogued according to the initial letter of its title <e> <s> however in most legal libraries the only current list of statutory instruments is an individual copy kept in consecutive order as the statutory instrument comes out <e> <s> so whichever system one uses one is entirely dependent upon the heading at the top of the statutory instrument <e> <s> my noble and learned friend will appreciate i think if he looks at precedents of this nature that if one is looking for commencement order no <e> <s> or no <e> <s> whatever it may be one can be almost certain that the only thing it will not say at the top is administration of justice <e> <s> it will be indexed and it will be headed by reference to the county courts or mental health or attachment of earnings or solicitors or whatever it may be <e> <s> it really does make it absolutely impossible for a practitioner looking through a colossal pile of current statutory instruments which have not been sorted out or indexed at all because it is very difficult to find out which heading one is looking for <e> <s> one thumbs through the pile and as often as not one misses it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i shall try to persuade your lordships to agree with that motion <e> <s> the bill concerns certain commercial exhibitions of material on film video-tape disc and other electronic wonders with which i have not yet become acquainted which are not at the moment subject to the licensing procedure <e> <s> there is nothing new about licensing procedures for commercial exhibition of film <e> <s> it goes back to the cinematograph act and that act was reviewed and amended in <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot speak for them but i would suspect that the noble lords lord mishcon and lord beaumont of whitley will be as pleased as i am myself with the speech to which we have just listened from my noble friend lord elton <e> <s> it gives us the encouragement that i think we all wanted in the furtherance of this measure <e> <s> it only leaves me with a very few points upon which i think i ought to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed so <e> <s> but that does not get them home on the question of the defence because they have to go further than that they have to deal with the second limb of subsection to which i have referred <e> <s> yes of course they would pass that test but i am not so sure that they would necessarily pass the second <e> <s> i have in mind some of the things that have occurred from time to time in courts presided over by successive lords chief justices when people seek to take advantage of this type of technicality <e> <s> but let me consider the matter further as i have undertaken to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i think i have had my guidance from the committee <e> <s> may i just say two things <e> <s> first of all there will unless something goes tremendously wrong in a minute be a report stage because i have a whole collection of consolidation amendments which i hope the committee will accept <e> <s> secondly i do trust that those who are concerned with this matter will be prepared to see a solution reached at the next stage of the bill on this point <e> <s> we do not wish to send back a bill to another place with a contentious matter in it if we can possibly avoid it <e> <s> therefore what i should like to do is to take advantage of the extremely generous assistance i have been offered by my noble friend and by the noble lord opposite with those who have advised him to see if we can come up with a formula <e> <s> but i anticipate that we must try to get this right by report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have done some more homework <e>", "<cs> my lords i am led to believe that i have two-and-a-half minutes to deal with this and that does not give me much opportunity to answer a very substantial debate <e> <s> may i start by saying that having heard all those who have spoken i recognise that everybody has been trying to improve this legislation and so may i express my gratitude to them for the constructive way in which they have approached this <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a very happy outcome <e> <s> i forgot to say one thing to the noble lord lord jenkins and that was that we did look very carefully at the approach which was embodied in his amendment to see whether that might be the better way in which to do this <e> <s> i am glad to find him not insisting on that any longer but happy with the way we have done it <e> <s> i am grateful to all those who have spoken and may i just say in this particular connection that although historically i undoubtedly was a vice-count i think that perhaps just at the moment i had better stick to my modern pronunciation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord hatch of lusby will forgive me if i do not follow him on that particular subject and also if i do not speak for one and three quarter hours in order to allow him to return from his meeting to listen to my noble friend my modest notes would have to be stretched considerably beyond my capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon has probably saved my noble friend three and a half sentences in his speech <e> <s> if that is right then it would be a very welcome reassurance to some of those who have been reading this bill and who certainly have not absorbed the point with the rapidity with which the noble lord has done <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt my noble friend for one moment does he mean films or does he mean videos <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said films <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief but i plainly must thank my noble friend for having researched this matter with some care <e> <s> i think that my concern has not been shown to be wholly unjustified <e> <s> i speak for nobody but myself <e> <s> i wish to make certain that the result of the bill that i conducted through this house was not going to lead to very great practical difficlties <e> <s> anybody listening to the speech of my noble friend will wish the very greatest of luck to the licensing authorities as they come to interpret this legislation in accordance with the facts of some of the applications that may be made to them <e> <s> the only comfort that i have is what he said about considering the practical results <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> this is the first of the private members bills before your lordships this evening <e> <s> it is a simple bill which i think will not bring any wrath upon my head from any quarter of the house <e> <s> it was piloted through another place by my right honourable friend the member for bournemouth west and i suppose it will go down as the last of his parliamentary activities because he is not standing again <e> <s> i am glad therefore that with the cooperation of noble lords opposite it has been agreed that we can take this bill through and put it on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for his welcome and for the governments support in this measure <e> <s> there is just one thing which i think needs dealing with and upon which i believe that i can add a little to what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that that is the governments policy and the fact that it was in clause of the police and criminal evidence bill in general terms applying to a very broad range of powers of search underpins what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i would put this to the noble lord lord mishcon as something that i should like him to think about <e> <s> there are indeed a fairly large number of statutes which for limited and proper reasons give powers of search and seizure of documents to certain persons usually the police where criminal offences are anticipated to have occurred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon is very generous <e> <s> we have had a little committee stage of a sort in the course of the second reading <e> <s> in these circumstances there has been such a welcome for the bill that i may safely ask <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to the bill and that no noble lord has indicated or is indicating a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has already put one motion to the house that it should resume <e> <s> he has not withdrawn it <e> <s> with great respect i do not see how we can have a question upon another motion <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will take that advice <e> <s> it seems that the timetable about which he was speaking just now is most unlikely to be that which is accomplished <e> <s> i cannot see why in the light of the provisions of amendment no <e> <s> which was passed and the consequences of working out what the parliamentary timetable might be as a result of that we have to take a decision upon this matter this evening <e> <s> as the noble baroness said the provisions in this amendment seem to me exactly in line with some of the other matters that have been postponed <e> <s> i am afraid to say that if my noble friend insists upon this i shall certainly not support him <e> <s> it seems to me to be another of the matters that ought to be reconsidered in the light of the earlier decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to make further provision with respect to charities in england and wales <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord brightman made a speech which most earnestly and fully supported the case which i had to deal with in rather technical detail for the bill <e> <s> in joining with others in congratulating him on his maiden speech i feel that he must be a happy man this afternoon because of the way in which his work has been received by this house <e> <s> first he succeeded with members of the select committee in obtaining the support of my noble friend lady trumpington on the front bench without whose support we would not get any further at all <e> <s> then he managed to secure the generous support of my three noble friends whose bills have not been pursued <e> <s> they have set aside their disappointment and i congratulate them and thank them for their generous remarks this afternoon about this new bill which has tried to pick out the best of what was contained in the two previous measures <e> <s> so it has not been a failure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the reason why my noble friend lord renton has tabled this amendment and certainly it would not be my wish to complicate the bill any more than is necessary <e> <s> there are however and were in the view of the select committee certain possible defects which suggest that we ought to put this matter beyond doubt in very much the way in which the noble and learned lord lord denning has just suggested <e>", "<cs> this is a difficult point <e> <s> i know that the national association of local councils which is the current body <e>", "<cs> i was simply about to say that i have received representations from that association <e> <s> as a matter of fact i did not reach the stage of becoming its president but i was a vice-president for a time and so i have considerable sympathy with what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to this debate <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce and the noble lord lord airedale are of course absolutely right <e> <s> it could be a good deal more than one parish council which has to receive a copy of these accounts <e> <s> what i should like to do is to see how effective has been the duty imposed under the present law <e> <s> i do not know whether it is going to be possible to find out but efforts could at least be made <e>", "<cs> again this is very much a matter of judgment <e> <s> the existing provision for the retention of accounts is in section of the act and at that time parliament in its wisdom said seven years <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson said and we say two <e>", "<cs> may i proceed on the basis that that is what the noble baroness the deputy chairman has done <e> <s> when the select committee decided that subsection should be included we did not overlook the point that my noble friend has made about the ability of everybody to make a request to the charity commissioners <e> <s> the trouble about it is that on the whole they do not very much <e> <s> the charity commissioners do not have the facilities to check for themselves whether the charity trustees have put in their accounts for the year <e> <s> if the charity commissioners were to be asked about any one specific charity they would look up their files and would immediately and willingly say whether that was so <e> <s> there is no question of recalcitrance on their part but they do not make an automatic check every year to see whether trustees have submitted their accounts <e>", "<cs> this is the amendment that i have been dreading most of all in the entire marshalled list because i have to tell the noble and learned lord that for a very good legal reason his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> the point is that in the interpretation act in schedule it is said that person includes <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the reasons why my noble friend lord renton has moved this <e> <s> i think that to some extent we are in a bit of a drafting muddle here because there is no doubt that it would be very desirable to include a reference to section because the powers of the commissioners to act in the case of default are comprised in both sections and and they might want to use one or the other or conceivably both <e>", "<cs> i think i agree with my noble friend that it is extremely unlikely that a body which he has described and which has the form set out in section of the act would come under clause <e> <s> therefore there is no disagreement between us about the impact of the amendment that i am moving because it is not changing anything in any way <e> <s> the difficulty has been to find a formula because in the case of clauses and certain sorts of charities are thought or could be thought to profit from being able to use the provisions of the bill <e> <s> therefore one has to deal with exempt charities in the other clauses <e>", "<cs> i will look at that <e> <s> it was really exactly from that sort of formula that we departed in embarking upon this series of amendments <e> <s> but pending that i should like to make it abundantly clear that exempt charities are not within the scope of clause and so i hope that this amendment could go into this bill this evening <e>", "<cs> i am perfectly certain that i speak for everybody in this committee when i welcome the noble baroness to the dispatch box to speak on this bill and a very good point she has made <e> <s> there does need to be a balance and certainly the members of the select committee were very well aware of the susceptibilities of local charity trustees <e>", "<cs> i too looked upon it as being a constructive approach until i thought a little further and took some advice <e> <s> the primary purpose of clause is to deal with the very obsolescent charities whose original donors had in mind some specific beneficiary of a sort which either does not now exist or does not cover adequately the provisions of poverty in an area <e> <s> therefore it was particularly susceptible as a subject for changing the objects of the charity <e> <s> that is why in clause one concentrates on this type of charity <e>", "<cs> there is another point <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be accused of being flippant but this was part of the evidence that was brought before the committee <e> <s> one of the larger funds has taken over the administration of a charity which is for the benefit of the ladies of paddington <e> <s> the people who run this organisation have found it extremely difficult to define the ladies of paddington at least to the extent of avoiding trouble with the police <e> <s> they have had to produce a device whereby in their accounts for each year they set aside a certain amount of money which could be provided for the ladies of paddington if they ever found any i think that the ladies of paddington are described by some sort of adjective as well and at the end of the year because they have never found one they distribute it among the other beneficiaries who are entitled <e> <s> in that case i think that the object is impossible and therefore there is some point in having this word in <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to consider changing impractical in the way that the noble lord lord airedale suggested i certainly would have no objection but i believe that there are real cases of impossibility <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady faithfull has entirely taken the point about the various safeguards that are provided in order to prevent the charitable money going away from the relief of poverty <e> <s> there is the provision that there shall be no <e>", "<cs> i go back once again to the intention which underlies this piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> i think this is a fairly important point <e> <s> i bear in mind what the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs said just now about the susceptibilities of trustees <e> <s> underlying her point was <e>", "<cs> as a matter of fact i prefer amendment no <e> <s> because the scheme is meant to be that at the beginning of every clause when one first comes to a reference to the trustees one finds either the words the charity trustees or the trustees of a charity <e> <s> thereafter all through the rest of the clause unless there is a specific reason to differentiate between for instance transferor trustees and transferee trustees the bill merely says trustees in which case clause as it stands is all right <e> <s> but i think that the noble lord has a point in line on page because there the rule has been broken <e> <s> that is why i prefer his other amendment <e>", "<cs> of course i agree with that <e> <s> the more help that can be given the better <e> <s> having said that i think it will probably be easier under this legislation to carry out these changes than it is to go through the technicalities of for instance getting a scheme or dealing with something under the <e>", "<cs> perhaps in dealing with this amendment i may speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and and in the schedules and <e>", "<cs> i should prefer the noble baroness not to press amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should prefer to have the other three <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to say that i have to agree with my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> my noble friend lady faithfull will appreciate that in clause we have moved away from charities strictly for the relief of poverty into a much wider field <e> <s> of course i understand her concern that there should not be a transfer which takes the charitable money away from the whole field of the relief of poverty <e> <s> but for the reasons given by my noble friend lady trumpington i feel that the scheme of this clause and the way in which the commissioners have power to consider and indeed to listen to any representations upon the proposed transfer give a completely adequate protection against any such thing happening <e>", "<cs> as the sponsor of this bill i had hoped that i would be allowed to have a few words but i have waited until i have heard the rest of the debate <e> <s> there is perhaps not a great deal to be said except for an explanation as to why it is that i am unpersuaded by those who wish to increase these limits <e> <s> i am glad that i have at least one friend on these benches <e>", "<cs> i see no opposition <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i was wholly misled by the mistake <e> <s> i thought this was consequential upon an earlier amendment that the noble lord had put down <e> <s> now that i understand what he is saying i am afraid there is no way in which this amendment can live with clause <e> <s> it sets different criteria and is hopelessly inconsistent <e> <s> for that reason alone i hope he will not persevere with it <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could find myself in a greater area of agreement with the noble and learned lord lord denning than has happened on the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> but i too have to join in objection to what he is proposing <e> <s> i do not want to repeat what has been said before but on the political point if members of the committe would like to look at paragraph of the select committees report which gives the references to the evidence in the bigger blue book i think they will see that there is a point of great substance in what has just been said <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that it occurs to me that another possibility would be that if clause remains in the bill after the subsequent major clauses have been discussed there is always the possibility of recommitting clause as it stands which might give us a full discussion on all the points in the noble lords amendments <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend lord lucas a little about the logic of this part of the bill because i believe that it has a distinct bearing on the question of automatic disqualification under clause <e> <s> it is good to see that in subsequent clauses in this bill the government are indeed taking the question of disqualification very seriously <e> <s> for instance having introduced most admirably in my view the concept of wrongful trading in clause they then provide that the court can disqualify on an individual basis any person who is responsible for that wrongful trading <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether for one moment i could venture to disagree with the noble and learned lord lord denning on the basis of a very simple illustration <e> <s> for reasons which i really do not know vat is chargeable on my fees as a member of the bar <e> <s> it does not happen anywhere else but it does happen in this country <e> <s> what happens in practice is that when the fee note is put in to the clients solicitor per cent <e> <s> is added and he pays that money over to me and in due course i pay it on to the customs and excise <e> <s> i do not consider that ever to have been my money at all <e> <s> if it was anybodys money it belonged to the professional client <e> <s> he pays it because he has to and i am the custodian of it until the time comes to send in the next vat return when i pass it on to the customs and excise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord airedale has always been very good at english and at logic <e> <s> he is absolutely right and i am happy to accept the amendments one in manuscript form <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it was the noble lord lord airedale who spotted the point in the first place and i think he should have the credit for it <e> <s> i am very happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether it would be to the convenience of the house if i said a word now although i quite appreciate that i shall then not be able to answer any other speeches <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that my noble friend lord maude has not left me feeling very defused and i have to tell him more in sorrow than in anger that he is quite right <e> <s> i do not think i can accept this amendment and we shall have to take the view of the house upon it <e> <s> but i should like to give the reason because it is not a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent your lordships have taken most of the speech out of my mouth but it would be only proper for me to make two or three remarks <e> <s> the members of the select committee have stayed very much in touch with each other during the parliamentary process of the bill through this house <e> <s> indeed a number of them are here this evening <e> <s> i believe that we all recognise what the noble lord lord mishcon said that had it not been for the original initiatives of my trio of noble friends all of whom are here tonight we should never have made this progress at all <e> <s> they kept at it and although there were points of disagreement we now seem to have reached a conclusion with which nearly everyone is happy <e> <s> that is a very remarkable achievement and it is really due to them in the first place <e> <s> i am sure that we are all extremely grateful to them for what they did <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble and learned friend on the woolsack one question that might assist me in my deliberations <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> under subsection b of the amendment if the court of appeal is considering the question of leave to renew the application will it not in practice at the same time consider the question of whether the matter is arguable <e> <s> if it does not do that it will not know whether or not it is right to renew the application so in fact it will be a single hearing before the court of appeal effectively upon arguability which will then decide whether or not the matter proceeds <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot follow the noble lord lord rhodes to manchester or the right reverend prelate to liverpool but i can deal with one aspect of this bill from my own experience and again with a view to the amendment of the noble baroness try to look at the question of oversight or strategy <e> <s> i have chosen a subject about which i happen to know a little the noble baroness does as well which is town and country planning <e>", "<cs> one of the threads <e>", "<cs> one of the threads that has run through this debate and in view of the cries from the opposition i promise to be brief has been that related to strategic planning <e> <s> i am bound to say that i am glad i have listened to the noble baroness lady fisher because to judge by what she said and to judge by what a number of others have said including my noble friend lord molson it could be thought that central government never had anything to do with strategic planning until this bill came along <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher must know that that is absolutely untrue <e> <s> my noble friend lord molson will see that the schedule to the bill dealing with unitary development plans says that district and borough councils shall have regard to <e>", "<cs> this is the third debate on the reform of local government that i have attended <e> <s> on all those occasions practically everybody always opposed all change <e>", "<cs> i just wonder whether we do just as simply as that <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham has just said that when it comes to open-cast workings the requirements for restoration may or may <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a word or two on this amendment <e> <s> i think that it may raise an important issue and certainly one on which i believe the committee would like to have some information from my noble friends on the front bench not only for the purposes of considering whether this is practicable in the formulation that the noble baroness lady stedman has put forward but also in preparation for dealing with my noble friend lord molsons amendment so that we may know whether the suggestion that he is making is practicable as an alternative perhaps <e>", "<cs> now that my noble friend has helped us in explaining to us what the strategic guidance is going to be before the noble baroness decides what to do with her amendment i believe she now has a point which requires my noble friends on the front bench to give some further consideration to what is going to happen <e> <s> as i understand it and let us take an example from outside london for the moment there will be or is likely to be a document or letter probably one which has not yet come into existence which will relate for <e>", "<cs> i have looked with very great interest at my noble friends amendment and of course chronologically speaking when it comes to the preparation of a unitary development plan the stage about which he is talking precedes the stage that was the subject matter of the amendment of the noble baroness lady stedman which we have just been discussing <e> <s> it seems to me that there are a number of points which ought to be made about the amendment of my noble friend lord molson <e>", "<cs> i absolutely agree with my noble friend <e> <s> what i think he is doing in this amendment is to add a complete extra stage <e> <s> he is adding a third and preliminary opportunity to go into matters by way of public inquiry prior to the submission to the secretary of state or consideration by the local planning authority of part i of the unitary development plan <e> <s> therefore there will be a three-stage planning process in the metropolitan areas as opposed to a two-stage one everywhere else <e> <s> that is the point of principle which i am trying to point out <e>", "<cs> what the noble baroness says could theoretically arise but if say one out of six or seven district councils in one of the metropolitan areas simply refuses to co-operate there are of course default powers <e> <s> i do not believe it will ever come to that <e> <s> all i suggest at the moment is that there should be the flexibility built into this legislation to enable there to be a joint consideration of the part is <e> <s> whether it will happen or not i do not know but surely it would be a good idea to make sure that it could happen if in due course that seems to be the best way of dealing with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords that has been a happy interlude in our proceedings because all i need do is to say how grateful i am to all those who have spoken on the various matters that they have raised <e> <s> i think however that i ought to say something about one or two of them <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true but i am not legislating in washington i am legislating in london and in this country there are two different meanings <e> <s> we have adopted the american spelling for a specific reason <e> <s> however let us go back to that in committee if need be <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for making the point <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord about to wind up <e>", "<cs> it would be most helpful if the noble lord would first help me with a point of procedure <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi moved amendment no <e> <s> e and he spoke also to amendment no <e> <s> fa <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins spoke to amendment no <e> <s> g as well <e> <s> three different forms of authority are dealt with in these amendments <e> <s> there is a completely new statutory authority in the first amendment <e> <s> when he was dealing with his amendment the noble lord lord donaldson spoke of an authority that was transitional <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins who referred specifically to amendment no <e> <s> g introduced again the residuary body <e> <s> it would be enormously helpful to some noble lords to know which proposition is now being put forward <e>", "<cs> no it only deals with one of the two mysteries <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness is right in saying that the distinguished bodies that she has just mentioned support this particular amendment <e> <s> i should like to suggest to her and to the committee that perhaps the way in which she has gone about it is not really apt to deal with what i entirely agree is an important point <e> <s> certainly when it comes to the impact of archaeological discoveries investigations or assessment on the planning process the very last body i would suggest as being suitable as the repository for the skills of these teams which have been set up is the residuary body <e>", "<cs> i really must answer the noble lord lord donaldson on this because what he is saying is wholly inconsistent with what he said earlier this afternoon <e> <s> he said that in his own amendment which is amendment no <e> <s> fa and i remember clearly that he was not in his place when i mentioned this earlier what he was seeking was some sort of transitional body <e> <s> he received a great deal of support on this from your lordships <e> <s> i notice that what he chose to put in his amendment was an appropriate joint authority <e> <s> those are the words in his amendment <e> <s> he did not choose the residuary body because he realises as well as everybody else that if we are going to get a smooth transition the residuary body is the wrong one because of the way that it is constructed in this bill <e> <s> i am perfectly willing to support the noble lord in trying to smooth the transition for the archaeological services as in the arts and recreation <e> <s> all i am saying is that the residuary body is not the right method <e>", "<cs> i think that by her choice of the subject of mineral planning my noble friend lady vickers has perhaps illustrated rather well the way in which we should be looking at this question <e> <s> perhaps in order to simplify matters i may confine myself to the question of sand and gravel aggregates because this is perhaps a slightly easier subject and one which may be familiar to a number of members of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am sorry it is not <e> <s> i have the document <e> <s> it was specifically issued to all the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend lord brabazon <e> <s> i had not actually thought of all those arguments and they seem to me to be very telling <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i can fill in a moment before the government repeat it but i think the answer and i shall immediately be proved wrong is that this bill is really only reinforcing what is probably the law already <e> <s> therefore the gap between today and what i hope will be royal assent in a comparatively short time ought not to be material in this respect <e> <s> there is a very strong probability that the majority of what is in this bill is already the law if the judges had to interpret it after an enormously long and complicated argument in front of them <e> <s> i think that the noble lord opposite may be reasonably happy that there will not be a nasty lacuna in the legal protection and i shall now sit down and see whether i am right <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall leave that matter on the basis that we are agreed on this occasion this evening and i shall leave the noble lord to fight it out with those on the front bench on any other bill that attracts his attention in this respect <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i do not think that his objections to this stand up because if he is providing in the bill for costs to be awarded at the appellate stage in front of the tribunal i do not think that he can really object in principle to them being awarded when the hearing is in front of the traffic commissioner <e> <s> i do not think he would find that in any proceedings whether truly judicial or quasi-judicial the possibility of having costs awarded against you either prevents you defending yourself in a proper case or has any other effect upon the proceedings except to stop people wasting time <e> <s> it has proved to be remarkably effective in a large number of other areas of the law and in hearings and inquiries of this sort <e> <s> i hope therefore that my noble friend will look at this again <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> it all depends on how the secretary of state is prepared to work the duties imposed upon him under paragraph <e> <s> if he is ready to look with interest at the cases coming before the tribunal and makes sure that he does instruct an <e>", "<cs> one of the difficulties in keeping noble lords waiting to move their amendments is that they read the whole schedule <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend without expecting him to reply today to refer to paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for this amendment <e> <s> i am very glad that he is proposing that there should be regulations because most of these matters need to be looked at from time to time without primary legislation and regulations would be a very good way of doing it <e> <s> he will i am sure make certain that the department consults widely before regulations are made and indeed before they are revised if that should be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone for giving me a character reference in his speech which makes my entry into the arena on this subject a little more respectable than might have been supposed <e> <s> it is now nearly four years since this house helped to set up the <e>", "<cs> my lords it would certainly be unnecessary to have primary legislation to do what i have just said because there is a power in section which would enable the secretary of state to do it <e> <s> there is rather a lot on page <e> <s> perhaps i may tell my noble friend afterwards which parts of that could be achieved without further legislation and which might not <e>", "<cs> my lords if i thought the problem was as simple as that then i should not have embarked upon a fairly elaborate exercise <e> <s> if one examines the problem in detail one finds that it is usually a good deal more complicated than the simple point to which my noble friend has referred <e> <s> certainly it is sometimes the case that the reason is that which my noble friend has mentioned but there are many other reasons too <e> <s> we have compiled a questionnaire that might help to identify what is the impediment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could suggest another course of action <e> <s> i do so with the greatest humility <e> <s> the motion standing before the committee is that clause stand part <e> <s> if i were to move as an amendment to that motion that clause be considered after clause of the bill has been disposed of we would then have all the opportunities to consider these amendments before we came back to the principle of clause <e> <s> i would be happy to move that amendment if it required any sort of agreement of the committee <e>", "<cs> quite apart from the points made by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale i wonder whether i can draw to the attention of the committee some rather technical problems which the noble and learned lord lord denning has not really addressed <e> <s> he seeks as he said to attract the whole of the code which appears under the town and county planning acts so as to apply it to the fairly narrow question of whether or not an existing shop which has not previously and illegally been open on sunday for trading shall be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> i did have that case in mind <e> <s> what i think i said was that whatever anyone thought about the consideration as a matter of principle of whether shops should be open on sunday at all being foremost in the minds of the local council it would certainly he outside the planning acts <e> <s> this was one of the criteria that emerged i think in the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for giving us an opportunity to discuss this question <e> <s> as he accurately forecast i should like to confine myself to one code of practice which is required to be prepared under section of what is now the mental health act <e> <s> let me just tell you lordships what has to be done <e> <s> the secretary of state is told to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that i am not the only member of your lordships house who has found the membership of one of the european sub-committees an exceedingly educative experience <e> <s> certainly on this occasion the combination of the chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord templeman and the wisdom of our advisers not least in selecting the witnesses whom we invited to hear led to a whole area of investigation which i personally did not know existed <e> <s> i am extremely glad to find that the points that we were trying to get over in this report have already been very fully appreciated by the two previous speakers who were not members of the sub-committee <e> <s> i believe that those of us who were members should confine ourselves to highlighting one or two very particular matters because this was the report of us all <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much enter into the spirit of the question asked by the noble lord <e> <s> lord hacking <e> <s> i should have thought that s our lordships would in due course welcome legislation to deal with the th report of the law reform committee if my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor brings it forward <e> <s> i should therefore like to continue the discussion about whether that is adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will follow the advice of my noble friend lord home and not accept this amendment tonight <e> <s> it is my misfortune that i am the only lawyer to whom my noble friend lord trenchard has spoken who does not agree with him <e> <s> it is an even greater misfortune that i have to disagree with the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> my comfort lies with my noble and learned friend on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house and particularly to my noble friend the minister and the noble lord lord prys-davies for being detained and therefore unable to hear their speeches <e> <s> the points that i wish briefly to make are i think well known to my noble friend lord lyell and will not come as a surprise to him <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend in his consideration will address his mind to the interrelationship that i think the noble lord lord hutchinson mentioned with clause <e> <s> it is not only the primary intent of the offender although that has been very fully explained and quite understand and agree with the noble and learned lord lord denning that we have to go further than that <e> <s> we then get into the situation about likelihood which primarily depends upon somebody else thinking that something is going to happen <e> <s> it may be the policeman or the asian lady or whoever <e> <s> they will not respond themselves nevertheless they think that what is happening may cause violence somewhere else <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i listened very carefully to what he said about this <e> <s> he said that there are powers now in the common law to deal with this sort of thing <e> <s> it would be of very great interest to the committee if from the enormous experience that he has not only <e>", "<cs> surely we need it because as the noble lord lord hutchinson has said there has been a certain amount of confusion about this element in the law <e> <s> if one introduces a collection of new offences which are drawn to some extent from material which has been litigated in the criminal courts for some time and one is faced with the proposition that one has to elaborate what is the criminal intent the <e>", "<cs> i should have thought not because parliament would then have expressed itself on the subject <e> <s> something will have to be made of it and that will have to be different from what we had before <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord hacking replies to that since i too have an interest in clause and in what my noble friend has just said i hope that we shall be a little careful about this <e> <s> the words in brackets in paragraph <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> i should have thought that if any investment broker regularly had an introducer as part of the scene and did not check out that he was properly authorised there could not be any question but that he ought to have his transaction disallowed <e> <s> the difficulty is where the client comes along at the instance of an unauthorised introducer about whom the investment dealer knows nothing at all <e> <s> it is those circumstances which cause some anxiety <e> <s> my noble <e>", "<cs> as regards amendment no <e> <s> it is enormously agreeable to find a form of words that appeals to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that they will now go into the bill <e>", "<cs> i suspect that it is not but perhaps we can come back to it later <e> <s> i think that my noble friend has confirmed the fears that if an sro wishes to change its rules to meet some new facet of business and the sib has not got round to considering it the sro will not be able to do it under the way the schedule is amended until the sib itself has been moved into action to take some equivalent activity <e> <s> that cannot be sensible because if the sro is going to be responsible for the rules which deal with the sort of investment business within its own sphere it is going to be much better equipped to bring up to date the changes that need to be made <e> <s> it should not have to wait for the sib to get round to doing something similar <e> <s> it ought to be able to do it without being blocked <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that explanation is very much better and clearer and i should like to read the whole passage to see whether this matter is taken up under the clause referred to <e> <s> meanwhile since we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> with respect the motion that my noble friend has moved about the insertion of the new schedule is still before the committee and i hope i may be allowed to ask him some questions about it <e> <s> i wished to leave this until after the amendment of the noble viscount had been dealt with and perhaps it would now be convenient for the committee if i were to ask him some questions <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth will forgive me for throwing these questions at him but he will appreciate that this amendment has not been available to us for very long <e> <s> indeed he talked about the possibility of further consultations and response to views put forward <e>", "<cs> it was amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for supporting this amendment and also to my noble friend for what he said <e> <s> if i may say so there has been quite a long time already in which the government have been able to consider the matter <e> <s> they are now saying and i am glad to hear it that they are prepared to go a little further than they have so far in the bill <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that we can leave this matter in a fairly equable way because my noble friend has said without any commitment that he will look at it again <e> <s> there are two things i shall not ask him to comment upon them that need to be done <e> <s> first he takes the view that there are technological methods whereby one can somehow distinguish the dishonest business from the ordinary run of business <e> <s> if that is the case i have no doubt that his officials will be glad to expand on this matter that he has raised before the committee tonight <e> <s> i do not wish to go into it now <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for that <e> <s> the difficulty is this <e> <s> he is absolutely right in trying to deal with the unsolicited telephone call and other sorts of cold calling <e> <s> what will happen and i think this is really where he needs to discuss this with his advisers and perhaps the draftsmen is that there will be a number of small transactions which have taken place pehaps in the bank managers office and for all i know accompanied by the sort of notes that my noble friend has talked about <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend may have spoken to amendment no <e> <s> but now we have reached it <e> <s> is it clause or is it amendment no <e> <s> which was inserted after clause or is it both <e> <s> it would seem to me that one might consider at least the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> in relation to advertisements and it refers also of course to exempt persons as another candidate to be inserted at this point <e> <s> i am not sure which is meant <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble and learned friend can tell me this <e> <s> he is not i think saying that this liability is intended to be a strict liability of the sort concerned for instance with fencing or factory machinery <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> i imagine that he envisages that there is some latitude that prevents it becoming absolutely strict <e>", "<cs> in that case i suggest that my noble and learned friend would be well advised to look at this again as i am sure he will <e> <s> i say that for this reason <e> <s> if we at this stage can establish whether or not we are intending to have a strict liability that would be a very good thing <e> <s> it is not very helpful to leave it when even my noble and learned friend does not know <e> <s> this is the time when we are still at the parliamentary stage to deal with the matter rather than leave it to the courts <e>", "<cs> may i support my noble friend for a moment on this <e> <s> i think it is a very important point the problem about ombudsmen and in one of the amendments that is before the committee we have a suggestion that an ombudsman should investigate and make reports including recommendations on complaints is that that is just the trouble at the moment about the ombudsman system they do make reports after investigating complaints and they make recommendations but then nobody ever does anything about it <e> <s> very often they do not do anything about it because they can afford to get away with it <e> <s> i prefer on this my noble friends argument about clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hacking can move his amendment on report he can move it on third reading and he can move the substance of it on the question that the schedule shall be the sixth schedule to the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord makes up his mind on this i wonder whether he will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i have been following professionally the development of administrative law over a fairly long period <e> <s> what the noble and learned lord is now suggesting is entirely within the demesne of the rules of judicial review which are applying to an increasingly large number of <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may say a word about these two amendments moved by the noble and learned lord lord silkin <e> <s> he may be right on the natural justice point under amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i am afraid that too have not had enough time to look it up but i think the situation is probably something like this if he remembers what was said by lord greene the master of the rolls in <e>", "<cs> i think the noble and learned lord has to give the courts credit for being able to deal with this sort of thing <e> <s> there have been many cases <e> <s> i suppose the acme of the whole thing was <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord williams has got a point <e> <s> there is a bill running parallel to this one called the public order bill and in that there has been an abandonment of the expression reckless because the law commission has investigated this matter and has come to the conclusion that the case law on it at the moment is a little obfuscated <e> <s> the law commission has gone over to the expression is aware that <e> <s> it would be an amazing thing would it not supposing that we are talking about the same sort of recklessness though we may not be that we have in the same session at the same time two bills containing two entirely inconsistent phrases <e>", "<cs> nothing would give me greater pleasure than to withdraw my amendment if it is unnecessary <e> <s> i believe that rather than being a matter of interpretation for the courts this is a matter for the interpretation first of the department and then of the sib <e> <s> if my noble friend is assuring me and perhaps it would be kind if he would confirm this that there will be no problem for the sros to make rules that differentiate between different circumstances and different classes and to find that they are accepted then there is absolutely no reason to put anything more in the bill <e> <s> however it is an administrative matter <e> <s> if my noble friend will confirm exactly what he means then we can certainly leave the matter there <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> that is entirely clear and i am sure that the department and the sib will be held to that <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord boardman agrees with me in thanking my noble friend for this amendment <e> <s> the point is not an easy one and the legal implications of it have taken a great deal of paper to encompass <e> <s> the amendment seems to me to be admirable and i am grateful to my noble friend for it as i am for other amendments for which unfortunately i could not thank him last week <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that my noble and learned friend has moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in which case he has moved the amendment <e> <s> if the noble lord lord morton would allow me to say a word at this stage because my name was mentioned and i think i perhaps generated the origin of this debate i am glad that my noble and learned friend in fact prefers amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> when i saw it on the marshalled list i thought it had advantages not least in being consistent with the other statutes to which i referred in committee which emanated from what is now the department of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add a word <e> <s> if i am allowed to do that i shall not say another thing all evening <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend will ensure that this amendment does not have to go into the bill <e> <s> the difficulty about it is that there is as your lordships will have heard from those speeches a dispute going on about the drafting of the sib rules <e> <s> the only other chance that will occur for this house to express itself upon them is when the rules as a whole come forward as a statutory instrument for approval as they stand or not at all <e> <s> they will not be able to be amended and therefore what we need is some kind of flexibility between this evening and the time when the rules are finalised so that a good deal of further thought may go into this <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to participate in the discussion on the political merits of this matter either with respect to the landlords or with respect to the tenants save to say that this house has been over a very similar point before <e> <s> on this occasion the political problem if i may put it that way with a small p is that as a result of what the court of appeal has decided the tenants will be getting their freeholds cheaper than the landlords would like <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he accept from me that if he is thinking about this again he will have my support in advocating the earliest possible commencement for this provision if it is to go in the bill <e> <s> at the very least in the case that particular clause it was only one of three came into effect on royal assent <e> <s> if that were to be done in this case we have only to wait a fortnight <e>", "<cs> the designated agency <e>", "<cs> my lords this touches on the question that i asked my noble friend <e> <s> the whole point is that the time is not adequate <e> <s> it is far too <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask my noble friend a question which does not concern polarisation <e> <s> i have to declare an interest <e> <s> i am a director of a company which quite soon hopes to apply to the sib for recognition in respect of quite a large area of investment business <e> <s> to that end we have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord opposite is in a unique position to speak on this not only with his knowledge of affairs in northern ireland but also as a former member of the select committee which gave birth eventually to the charities act <e> <s> he will probably recognise that in relation to the statutory financial limits the order provides for a substitution of the sum specified by an affirmative resolution in article and in article <e> <s> he will probably recall that the discussions that took place concerned only england and wales at that stage and there was a very delicate balance in the discussions and in the evidence that was placed before the select committee about the starting point for the small charities that were going to be allowed to use this procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble and learned lord lord goff will not take it amiss if i do not follow him into the question of the correct definition of murder <e> <s> i doubt whether i can assist your lordships at all on the subject <e> <s> equally i apologise to the noble lord lord nathan for having missed his speech <e> <s> i can give only this explanation <e> <s> i was at a large mental hospital in east anglia discussing with the staff the prospects of some of their patients and trying to understand how they assess the risks of their re-offending <e> <s> that is a topic <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we must not hold up the scottish business very much longer <e> <s> i do not very much mind whether it is a government bill or a private members bill in view of the welcome that it has received from your lordships this evening <e> <s> that is the most important matter <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord milne that time was important in relation to the law commissions reports and we are seizing the opportunity to put the bill on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know offhand <e> <s> i shall certainly find out and tell the noble lord the result of my researches <e> <s> that appears to be the limit reached by the courts under the criminal damage act <e>", "<cs> my lords we can return to that in committee <e> <s> the provision in clause is a pretty cunning piece of work <e> <s> i suspect that it will stand the test of time for a while at least <e> <s> of course if there are any further suggestions to improve it i shall be delighted to hear of them and to consider them most seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>"]
