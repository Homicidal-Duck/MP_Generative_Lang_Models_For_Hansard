payment from next year to this year is a cosmetic affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by looking at the organisation of the gas corporation because some of the difficulties which have arisen can be dated back to wrong decisions taken in past years especially on the part of the two tory governments which we have lately had <e> <s> before i do so however i must congratulate my noble friend lord strabolgi for the way in which he introduced the debate which gave it its tone <e> <s> i must also declare an interest unfortunately only an intellectual interest <e> <s> during the government i was

subordination of the ministry of overseas development into a section of the foreign office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs>

notice <e> <s> i am of course glad that i find myself largely in agreement with him and i only hope that this will not harm him in his career in the city and elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite see that <e> <s> it seems to me that what could be done and what might help is to have a surcharge on the rates of houses which are not insulated progressive and at the lower end subsidised <e> <s> the

out almost like an experiment in physics to be judged by <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount think that the british people accepted in the election that the way in which inflation is to be fought is not a civilised manner by bargaining but by atrocious increases in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that reports that the soviets used chemical warfare in afghanistan were proven premature <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the noble lord seen the newspaper reports about his colleagues statement the other day in which he said that there is no mechanical relationship

think that the noble minister might have benefited had he learnt some logic in his university days <e> <s> nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent of guildford must have been far

balance of payments <e> <s> if the noble earl cannot answer the question now and i anticipate that he will say that he cannot perhaps he will let mc know later <e>", "<cs> in his usual charming and convincing way the noble earl suggested that this is a code of practice <e> <s> a code of practice of five lines <e> <s> what sort of code of practice is it <e> <s> who will create the real precedents

economics is not a real science but mrs thatcher has given and is giving at this moment a good imitation of a controlled experiment as in a physics laboratory <e> <s> i want to see it go through to the bitter end <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not realise that the creation of unemployment creates an atmosphere of bitterness and that bitterness will make a reversal of the policy impossible because as soon as they try to reverse the policy after inflation has been conquered which doubt the bitterness will result in excessive wage claims <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that in an economy which <e>", "<cs> my lords does that answer mean that the noble lord subscribes to the thesis that high rates of interest are good for investment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great privilege to congratulate the noble lord lord marshall of leeds on an extremely interesting constructive and non-controversial speech <e> <s> i hope that in future he will really reveal his true self and then we shall cross swords <e> <s> but i shall always remember this occasion of his first speech which really shows his profound knowledge of regional matters which in these

so is there a guarantee that the weeding will be unbiased <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that we cannot afford it but if we reduce our national income with high interest rates and extra taxes we shall not be able to afford even the new low level <e> <s> this can go on <e>", "<cs> my lords two debates which were held in another place on the economic situation and now in this house

congratulate him on his performance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> how does he reconcile the very sympathetic speech he has just made with the report of the very savage cuts in university grants which are endangering the capacity for research and development <e>", "<cs> my lords will the review include the methods of recruitment and the methods of promotion in these services because i think there is an essential fault at that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to tell us whether he considers that what he must have known would be a very provocative speech will contribute to a civilised and peaceful solution of the absolutely overwhelming problem of incomes and prices <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister realise that the proposed break-up of bnoc would make conservation difficult and costlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i was suspecting that i should be followed by a horde of noble

these markets depends upon the form of the market <e> <s> just to say the market forces is not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that the repudiation of tenure introduces into our universities a totalitarian scheme which ought to be resisted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl and i have fought very many battles most of them good natured <e> <s> but today i felt that the noble earl wanted to emulate his noble friend lord thorneycroft the chief entertainer of this house <e> <s> perhaps i misunderstood him but it seemed to me that he claimed that a figure of three million

the industry has had its ups and downs <e> <s> at one point the industry became a sort of political football and it still continues to be so <e> <s> that is a pity because in many other cases mainly

government <e> <s> the instructions of the government to the oil companies were completely disregarded <e>", "<cs> distributing the shares among small shareholders will not secure democratic control

these are monopoly and oligopoly situations and of course can be influenced now without any active role on the part of the producer <e> <s> bnoc will be hanging in the air not knowing what the situation is in fact neither the cost situation nor the price situation <e> <s> therefore we shall be exposed to great losses in capital <e>", "<cs> surely the minister completely forgets what i have said before if he ever understood it and that is that there is no market in the sense in which we were talking about markets in the neo-classical school and as there is no market or rather there are many markets we have seen this ludicrous situation at the petrol pumps <e> <s> first it went down and then it went up <e> <s> what certainty can come from that kind of signalling <e> <s> it seems to me that the government have completely misjudged the situation which is actually present in the market for oil <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister realise that the vacillations of her majestys

numbers in order to get a full scope for their accumulating <e> <s> what they imply is a general existence of free and perfect competition but what we have is a very imperfect market in which the big units fight each other but at the same time try to break through to the source of profits <e>", "<cs> my lords last year the right honourable lady the prime minister declared that she was not for turning <e> <s> one can now agree with her because her call for increased investment is no mere u-turn it is a somersault <e> <s> but the direction of the somersault is still on the whole unchanging
