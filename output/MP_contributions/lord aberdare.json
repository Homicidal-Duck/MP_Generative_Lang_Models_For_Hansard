this particular clause <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has put forward the arguments that were made on behalf of the oxford city council and the noble lord lord brabazon of tara has put the contrary arguments that were put by the government to the members of that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the first motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had made it clear that the level of illumination now is what would actually be the level of illumination whenever televising is taking place during the six-month experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord ponsonby is referring to the fact that when we saw it this morning it was what was called per cent <e> <s> and it has now been reduced to per cent <e> <s> but it is satisfactory from the broadcasters point of view and it is the lowest possible level of light that gives a reasonable picture <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked many questions but i can answer that question straight away <e> <s> there would be no bar whatever on the television authorities using a ministerial statement made in this house and not just made in another place and repeated here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> they are up to the intensity that is required for televising the house <e> <s> they can be turned up higher but they are at the agreed level which the broadcasters are prepared to accept for their picture and which we think is tolerable for the house <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions went on because the level of the lighting earlier on today was what was called per cent <e> <s> members of your committee who came in here found it very oppressive <e> <s> we talked to the broadcasters and they have now reduced it to per cent <e> <s> they have agreed that this is good enough for them and i hope that your lordships will feel it is not to bad for you <e> <s> the only fact of the matter is that these lights will be raised by about four feet should an experiment be conducted <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think your lordships would wish me to make another long winding-up speech after the brilliant speech we have just heard from the leader of the house <e> <s> i have felt a <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord lord brabazon replies may i say one quick word because i think that the noble lord lord carmichael gave the impression that the chairman of ways and means and i had gone into the merits of the case <e> <s> indeed we have not <e> <s> the only thing we had to certify was that their petition was in proper legal form and that their <e>", "<cs> my lords the house accepted by a handsome majority the recommendations of the committee on sound broadcasting <e> <s> that recommendation was that the committee itself should be enlarged to take in representatives of the front benches and the cross-benches <e> <s> that would have been sufficient to satisfy the vote <e> <s> in fact it was decided in view of the discussions that took place on the motion that we should add two representatives of those who had voted against the motion <e> <s> as the noble lord has pointed out those two people are now on the committee <e> <s> in general i am certain that whether any of your lordships voted for or against this particular motion they are perfectly capable of exercising their critical facilities to make sure whether the experiment is a success or not <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has correctly said there are three petitions against this bill and if they are not withdrawn they will be heard by a select committee <e> <s> i certainly will make sure that the remarks which the noble baroness has made are drawn to the attention of the committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for raising one or two matters on this bill <e> <s> on his first point referring to clause the closure of insanitary food premises this is an unopposed clause in the sense that there is no petition against it <e> <s> it will therefore be referred to the select committee that considers these unopposed clauses and i can assure him that we shall give very careful attention to what he has said <e> <s> i shall make sure that my colleagues on that committee have a copy from the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that the provisions are perfectly satisfactory <e> <s> there are very very strict standing orders which the promoter of a private bill has to comply with in the way of advertisement and again they are all in the private bill standing orders if the noble lord would like to have a look at them <e> <s> we find no difficulty in dealing with these bills <e> <s> of course it is in the very nature of private legislation that they differ from one area to another <e> <s> that is the whole reason for there being private bills as opposed to public bills <e> <s> there is a nice distinction that has to be made <e> <s> where powers are asked for on any one particular point we try to make sure that they are the same in one area as in another but each particular promoter has to justify the local need for any particular provision in the clause <e> <s> i think that that is as far as i can go this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be proper for me to comment about the merits of this clause but perhaps i may say just a quick word again about the procedure <e> <s> there are in fact three petitions against this bill but none of them relates to this particular clause <e> <s> therefore this clause clause will be referred to the same committee that i mentioned to the noble lord lord graham the select committee set up to consider the unopposed clauses and if your lordships accept this instruction which i have no reason to oppose that committee will give very careful consideration to what has been said this afternoon in respect of that clause <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of reading the whole report <e> <s> i am simply drawing attention to the first item of the report <e> <s> in view of its extreme importance to every noble lord here i thought it only right that the committees conclusions should be put before the house <e> <s> i have not far to go <e> <s> the report continues <e>", "<cs> my lords i only wish to say thank you very much to all your lordships who have taken part in this short and i think very helpful debate <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i have to point out that if amendment no <e> <s> is agreed to i cannot call amendments nos <e> <s> or <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i interrupt the proceedings again if i may with the leave of the house <e> <s> i think that the noble lord has to give notice of such a motion <e> <s> therefore it would be better i suggest if he followed my advice that in due course we proceed to give the bill a second reading on the undertaking which i readily give that we will see that it is referred to a proper committee <e> <s> if the unopposed bills committee is not the correct committee and cannot deal with the points raised today i will come forward or the noble lord lord mishcon will come forward with a proposal in due course that it be referred to a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly give the undertaking to arrange for the bill to go to a suitable committee which can in due course report to the house when the bill comes back on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords it would have the normal powers of a select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the c-poultry company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of country poultry incorporated which is a company domiciled in the united states of america <e> <s> the object of the bill is to transfer the registration of this company from the united kingdom to the state of delaware in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the doubts that have been expressed about these two particular matters i am sure that rather than spend a good deal of time this afternoon debating them the members of the procedure committee would be quite prepared to look at these items again and come forward with some other proposals <e> <s> if there are still hesitations and doubts in your lordships minds perhaps we can have a full debate on a day to be properly arranged through the usual channels <e> <s> i hope that that will satisfy your lordships <e> <s> personally i should be quite prepared to advise the house to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord shackleton so that the matter can be taken back and looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord mishcon perhaps i may say that any committee can decide to hear evidence in camera <e> <s> it is unusual but in the special circumstances of this case it could well be that the committee will decide to do so <e> <s> to turn to the noble lords second point we are having discussions about the best way of handling these bills in future <e> <s> i am not sure that it would be the best solution to refer these matters to the procedure committee <e> <s> however i shall keep in touch with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures announced for the division on the amendment to the motion to approve the lord chancellors salary order were wrong <e> <s> the numbers should be corrected as follows contents not-contents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper which is correctly printed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the third motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer is that it is covered by the local government act clause of which specifically excepts bills presented in pursuance of an order of either house giving leave to suspend proceedings on a corresponding bill in a session beginning before that date <e> <s> in regard to the necessity of it a number of these powers are powers that are required by district councils and the powers that are required by the greater london council will be distributed among the districts according to the provisions of the act <e> <s> this is a bill which is now before another place and has not yet reached this house <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the third motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee actually has no particular powers in respect of the rules that exist for the claiming of expenses <e> <s> it is appointed mainly to deal with individual claimants and difficulties that arise under the regulations as they exist <e> <s> i am afraid that most of the suggestions made by the noble lord would not be appropriate for this particular committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the third report from the select committee on the procedure of the house of last session be agreed to <e> <s> in accordance with the wishes of the house the recommendation of the committee on ministerial statements was considered and the committee now recommends that there should be no distinction between those who speak from the front benches and those who speak from the back benches but that in both cases comments or questions should be brief and the committee ask me to stress that this applies to both back- and front-bench spokesmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the points that have been made by the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> if i may first of all refer to what was said by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton i am not sure that he correctly explained to your lordships what had happened to the regulation of street trading provisions <e> <s> the fact of the matter was that in another place large sections of this bill were effectively removed <e> <s> first of all the whole of part iv which contained provisions relating to the control of amusement arcades was withdrawn by the promoters <e> <s> as regards part v to which i think he referred which dealt with the regulation of street trading these clauses were disallowed by the committee <e>", "<cs> i will have a quick look my lords but my piece of paper says part ii <e> <s> it is part ii of the bill part i is merely preliminary short title and interpretation <e> <s> only two clauses relate to the powers of the glc <e> <s> that is because they refer to matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house has heard very clearly expressed the issues that were before the committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter whose views i respect together with the sincerity with which he puts them forward has very ably put together today the same expressions of opinion that he voiced in the committee <e> <s> at the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly can <e> <s> in fact there is a petition by marks and spencer regarding these two clauses clauses and for the very same reasons as those expressed by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> unless that petition is withdrawn it will go to a select committee and will be given the usual very careful consideration <e> <s> i will also ensure that the words that the noble lord has uttered in the house this afternoon are brought to the attention of that select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble baroness is aware the services committee in another place considered this matter with great care and took evidence from trade unions medical advice and evidence from the civil service <e> <s> it finally came to the conclusion that it was far more important that people who should have these vital screenings should go to their own general practitioner because then the proper follow-up could take place and they could be advised about further treatment <e> <s> if there are those who are not able to go to their own practitioner then as i said in my original answer there are plenty of places near here where the screening can be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> however when the services committee considered the matter in another place it recommended that the importance of screening should be drawn to the attention of all the staff in another place and i hope that we shall do the same here and also that there would be no obstacle to their taking time off if necessary in order to attend these clinics <e> <s> as i have said the medical advice was very strongly in favour of going either to the general practitioner or to a clinic where the proper follow-up facilities are available <e>", "<cs> my lords i must categorically deny that i implied that the trade unions were involved <e> <s> the trade unions put the case very adequately to the services committee of another place <e> <s> it was very carefully considered but the overriding consideration was the medical one <e> <s> the medical advice is that it is much better for women to go to their own practitioner because sometimes a smear shows some signs of not being normal and if the screening is carried out by only a temporary mobile screening unit there is no way of following it up <e> <s> it is far better that they should go to their own practitioner if not to a clinic <e> <s> i am sure that that was in the mind of the services committee <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question i am afraid <e> <s> i do not know how many people were on the committee of another place nor can i commit another place to reconsider the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords a list of local facilities is available from our admirable nursing sister <e> <s> they do not so far as i can see exist at the hospitals but there are a number of clinics all within very easy reach of this house and i shall be pleased to show the noble earl a list of these rather than read them out now <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that <e> <s> it was a point made to the services committee but again it felt that those women who could not find the time to go to see their own general practitioner would be better advised to go to a local clinic near the palace of westminster <e> <s> the committee also emphasised that women should be given time off to do that <e> <s> that is what i am sure we would wish equally to do in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the services committee of another place will take note of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i shall send the committee a copy of what has been said this afternoon and i can only leave this matter to it <e>", "<cs> my lords it will be considered by the administration committee here <e> <s> no doubt it will wish to follow the lines set by the services committee by encouraging our staff to have cervical screening and will make it quite clear that if necessary they will be given the time off to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords again that was a point that was considered in the inquiry by the services committee and it thought that it would lead to confusion <e> <s> there was no clear evidence that that sort of reporting to the general practitioner would in fact take place <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be so but what the noble countess suggests may not necessarily be the case in this particular instance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the second report from the procedure committee be agreed to <e>", "<cs> no my lords the committee would have to go into the particular matter contained in the instruction as well as the petitions and it would then have to come back to the house <e> <s> what the house does on second reading of the bill is up to your lordships but there should be no unnecessary delay <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i was trying to say but the noble lord expressed it rather better <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a misprint in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the first line the figure should be deleted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to comment on the merits of the bill but i express the hope that your lordships will give it a second reading <e> <s> i expect your lordships are already bored with hearing me say once again that giving a second reading to a private bill does not necessarily imply that you approve of its purposes but it does allow the bill to be committed to a select committee which i suggest is the appropriate place to make a full investigation of the merits of the bill the petitions and the instruction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but the noble lord may be aware that the nature conservancy council has in fact petitioned us against the bill in this house and it will therefore be heard by the select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the subcommittee will take note of the noble lords remarks <e> <s> it is difficult to reconcile having a card that is specifically a part of the house of lords and relevant to it with one that has a christian religious connotation <e> <s> there was once a card with a picture of the angel in the crypt and on one occasion there was a picture of the seven bishops being found not guilty <e> <s> i shall certainly draw the matter to the attention of the sub-committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand how we would do that <e> <s> these are cards of the house of lords available for its members to send on its behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems a sensible suggestion <e> <s> i am quite sure that it will be taken into account by the sub-committee when it makes its next decision <e>", "<cs> that would be very welcome my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that will continue to be available <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord knows it is a smaller and less expensive card and one that is very suitable for airmail postage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the chairman of the sub-committee and its members will be very grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that seems to me to be a very christian attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords that has already been discussed in the sub-committee <e> <s> there are possibilities of that kind <e> <s> the present thought is that the smaller card is suitable for airmail <e> <s> to have the quality and a decent reproduction on the larger card it is rather more difficult to bring it down to grammes <e>", "<cs> my lords another place has a much larger turnover of cards about five or six times as many <e> <s> it also undertakes a large part of the administrative arrangements within the fees office of another place <e> <s> i do not think that our card compares badly with equivalent cards that one can buy outside <e>", "<cs> my lords on the first point about foreign languages i am sure that latin is a foreign language <e> <s> welsh is in a rather more delicate position and has a special standing <e> <s> as your lordships probably know it is permissible to take the oath in welsh

impossible for <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that that is so <e> <s> it will be considered at the next meeting of the finance sub-committee <e>"]
