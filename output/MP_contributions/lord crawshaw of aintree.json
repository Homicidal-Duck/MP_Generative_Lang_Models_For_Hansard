["<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mulley passed some remarks about something that happened years ago <e> <s> i hope that he passed them in a kindly way <e> <s> i intend to pass a few remarks about the territorial army <e> <s> i must say that i am very glad to be able to talk about it because once or twice in my career in the other place i began to wonder whether there was going to be a territorial army <e> <s> i was going to say that i would speak briefly but i believe that that is a word that is non-u in this house at the present time so i will say that i shall not exceed the limit which is customary in a maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord auckland will forgive me if i do not follow his theme <e> <s> as a person associated with toxteth for years and having had the honour of representing it in the other place for of those years i wish to take the opportunity of making a contribution concerned with inner city troubles <e> <s> one thing that has concerned me during this debate is the assumption that people are either for the police or against them <e> <s> what do we mean by are we for the police <e> <s> as a person who has been a member of the bar for years it is unlikely that i should be against the police but if being for the police means that one is never entitled to be critical of them i am afraid that your lordships must count me out from the word go <e> <s> i have not found a political party i have belonged to that i have not been critical of <e> <s> i have been critical of my church but i hope constructively <e> <s> what i shall say today i hope will be constructive even though it bears criticism <e>", "<cs> my lords what we are debating today is nothing more or less than the hijacking of a party and of a city <e> <s> some people have gone back as far as the last administration in liverpool <e> <s> we will never understand the problem unless we understand why liverpool was chosen for this particular takeover for the destruction of society as we know it because that in fact is what it is all about <e> <s> to do that i go back not or even years i go back to the late s when i first became involved in politics in liverpool <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of myself and my noble friends on these benches perhaps i may express our gratitude to the noble lord lord seebohm for the opportunity of debating what is a most interesting and vital report <e> <s> it is not merely a report on housing because the very basis of this is something that could destroy our society as we know it and i say that advisedly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also thank my noble friend lord thurso for giving us this opportunity of once again bringing up this subject <e> <s> i say once again because this is a matter that has now been running for four years <e> <s> what are we talking about <e> <s> in terms of money we are talking of million <e> <s> what are we getting in return <e> <s> one-third of our mobilised army in time of war will comprise territorial soldiers <e> <s> although i shall speak of territorial soldiers these matters apply to the other reserve forces as well <e> <s> it is without doubt the most cost-effective military force in western europe <e> <s> for four years we have been haggling over whether we can allow people who are doing service for their country the right to keep the pay that they earn as territorial soldiers <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness say whether she thinks a case can be made out in respect of that training which they are obliged to do as opposed to anything in excess of it that is the camp and so many -day attendances <e> <s> they are obliged to do that by the very fact that they are in the territorial army <e> <s> obviously one cannot give <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that those of us who have been trying to get extra funds for the inner cities feel a sense of shame when we realise that any success that we may have achieved has been gained at the expense of other areas of the country <e> <s> as the government have been profuse in their praise of the housing associations work is it not strange that many of these associations will now be in a position where it will be necessary to get rid of in-house management which has been built up laboriously over many years <e> <s> is this the most efficient way to run a housing programme <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord graham is important <e> <s> it involves nuclear measures and not everyone is an expert on them <e> <s> if the amendment were passed and we faced the alternative that the minister has given of the possibility of such things having to be done elsewhere of course that would be a tragedy for devonport <e> <s> if there is any possibility of that happening i certainly could not support it because there are so many implications of this bill which are not going to be to the benefit of devonport that i do not want to add another one to them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister is always courteous <e> <s> he is even more courteous when offering at least something in response to the debate <e> <s> having regard to the helpful remarks that the minister has made i would ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was very concerned about apprenticeship training having regard for the fact that it has a tremendous impact on the workforce in the areas affected because they are areas of high unemployment <e> <s> when i set down the amendment that is in my name and that of my noble friend i had not had an opportunity to study annex which deals with apprenticeship training <e> <s> it sets out all the different skills in which the dockyards will be required to train people <e> <s> it satisfies me that provision is made there for the required people <e> <s> however the amendment makes mention of <e>", "<cs> i have here annexe / which deals with pensions and there are one or two questions that i should like the minister to answer when he replies <e> <s> two schemes are to be set up <e> <s> i take it that one is to deal with the civil servants who are transferring and that will be funded <e> <s> i also take it that people who come into the employment subsequently will be funded by themselves and by the company <e> <s> but i am a little confused by paragraph <e>", "<cs> in supporting the noble lord i shall be brief <e> <s> we shall be dealing with people for the most part who have been transferred from one undertaking to another and who in ordinary circumstances would possibly have been entitled to redundancy payment <e> <s> having regard to the fact that they will not be getting redundancy payment i think it behoves this committee to make sure that if they require that redundancy payment at any future time the funds will be there to meet it <e> <s> we know that it will be a cut price business running these dockyards <e> <s> it is a commercial enterprise and people can lose money <e> <s> the situation may well arise where redundancy payments have to be reduced <e> <s> i think that would be iniquitous particularly in respect of those who at the present time would be guaranteed those redundancy payments if they were made redundant <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept that i agree with what the minister said about the necessity of providing for lower paid workers <e> <s> is it not rather remarkable however that this year the housing associations to which the minister has paid great tribute are in real terms receiving less money than last year <e> <s> moreover as the allocation is quite rightly being given mostly to the inner cities many of the local housing associations are this year in great difficulties <e> <s> they do not have sufficient allocation even to keep the staffs they have built up over the years <e> <s> as housing associations are a means of providing proper accommodation at a reasonable rent for lower paid people can the minister at least consider refunding the money that has been taken away from so many housing associations so that the position can be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to follow the noble lord lord parry who puts over what he has to say with such feeling because it comes from his heart <e> <s> i was interested in everything that the noble lord had to say <e> <s> i may also say how much i appreciate the opportunity that has been given by the noble lord lord dean once again to express our views on this particular subject <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord was not apologising for bringing this subject forward <e> <s> i am sure that he was not doing so because what he and other noble lords said two months ago is still as relevant today <e> <s> it is still as true today and it will still be true in two months time <e> <s> however the more we say it the more chance there is that somebody will pay some attention <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier this year i had the opportunity and the privilege of visiting the forces in norway and for the first two or three minutes tonight i should like to pay tribute to the work they are doing out there in extreme conditions <e> <s> as your lordships probably know it is a vital area in any possible conflict <e> <s> their task is to ensure that the airfields in northern norway do not fall under soviet domination <e> <s> it would be possible to secure them by airborne forces but to put airborne forces into those positions with back-up support would be almost suicide <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i might answer my noble friend here <e> <s> on the third thing yes it was the weakness of the league of nations but hungary czechoslovakia and poland were by the yalta agreement made parts of the sphere of influence of russia <e> <s> that is why i have to live now with the fact that although i volunteered in in order to go and save poland i go to bed every night <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope my noble friend will not mind if because of the time i do not follow his line of argument <e> <s> none of us was prepared for the full reality of apartheid <e> <s> as a contrivance of social engineering it is awesome in its cruelty <e> <s> with those words begins the book of the report and for another pages one follows a story of human suffering which is appalling and which brings disgrace upon any country which allows these things to happen <e> <s> i have not been more moved since i read about the holocaust and the million jews who went to the gas chamber <e> <s> the only difference here is that they have not gone to the gas chamber although many of them might have been better if they had done so <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the amendment on behalf of my noble friends let me first pay tribute to the noble and learned lord for the work that he has done <e> <s> i am certain that the bill will finish up very much better for his assistance <e>"]
