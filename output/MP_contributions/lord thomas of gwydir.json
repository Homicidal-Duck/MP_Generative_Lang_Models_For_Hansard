["<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the kindness shown to me and the welcome given to me since my introduction to the house last month <e> <s> i am greatly comforted in this my maiden speech by the knowledge of your lordships traditional indulgence and courtesy on these occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that the time restriction on speeches prevents me from adequately congratulating my noble friend lord st john of fawsley on his splendid speech <e> <s> i found it a delight and a speech of real quality as i know everyone who knows him would expect <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that accepting the importance of an international conference the most effective contribution that could be made in that sensitive part of the middle east towards peace would be for those who purport to speak for the palestinians to make it absolutely unequivocal that they recognise the state of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister agree that there is no prospect of genuine peace in the arab/israel conflict unless those arab states which are in conflict with israel co-operate with those who seek a peaceful solution <e> <s> can he tell the house whether any arab state other than egypt which has a peace agreement with israel or any palestinian leader has replied affirmatively to the us shultz initiative <e> <s> what hopes does the minister think there are for such a response from the arab and palestinian side <e>", "<cs> the time is nearly am the early hours of the morning <e> <s> for that reason the committee will be deprived of the penetrating persuasive and sparkling speech that i had prepared for this amendment <e> <s> the amendment to which i have put my name is amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i say a few words at this stage as chairman of the select committee to which this important bill was committed following second reading in february <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend lord gowrie for his kind words about the select committee <e> <s> we sat for no less than days and we heard and read a very great deal of evidence submitted by the promoters and by the various petitioners against the bill <e> <s> in addition we made a full days visit to felixstowe and were able to inspect the site of the proposed extension both on foot and from the air <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos because despite our occasional political differences we have long been old friends <e> <s> as far as i am concerned he is an old and valued friend whom i have long admired <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on his speech which was delivered as i would expect with authority and quality and much of it i accept <e> <s> i believe that the objectives which he spelled out are ones which most of us would hope for as a proper solution to the problems of the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords further to my noble friend the ministers remarks about there being a change of stance is he aware that the palestinian national covenant which unequivocally aims at the total destruction of israel and the creation of a palestinian state in the pre- territories of palestine is still the accepted covenant of the plo and is unamended <e> <s> is he further aware that article of the covenant states that there can be no <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords who have thanked my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for initiating the debate <e> <s> having served under him for some time in the foreign office or more years ago and having been a ministerial colleague of his when he later returned to the foreign office i endorse with enormous enthusiasm what was said by my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords having taken part in the previous debate i have been sitting on these benches almost without break since oclock and so i know that your lordships will be relieved to know that i do not intend to occupy your time for long <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity to congratulate most warmly the noble lord lord prys-davies on having dealt with what could be an extremely difficult and delicate little matter with such dexterity and sensitivity <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord orr-ewing paid tribute to the commissioners who produced the report for the hard work which they put into it <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> i have no doubt that they are all men who are able industrious and intelligent <e> <s> their two-and-a-half year inquiry was indeed comprehensive as the -page report bears witness <e> <s> what amazes me is that despite all their effort with the exception of the dissenting commissioner mr mills they have apparently failed to understand the way in which competition works in the brewery industry <e> <s> they appear to have failed to recognise the long-tested efficiency advantages of vertical integration and the role of contracts in allocating risk between brewer and licensee and the benefit of that structure for the consumer <e> <s> they seem to have discounted the clear evidence of heavy competition at all stages in the supply of beer and ignored the commendable and unique performance of the uk industry in particular when compared to that of other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords what i am saying is precisely what i have just said namely that the commissions interpretation of what was required under that part of section of the act was wrong and unreal <e> <s> the reason that i gave was that it should measure competition in relation to united kingdom competition and not in relation to what may be a contract between the brewer and licensee or borrower <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will have the opportunity to consider what i have said <e> <s> i may be wrong <e> <s> these are matters of argument <e> <s> but nevertheless it is a view which i wish to put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may wish to lend his support to the report <e> <s> i do not <e> <s> the difficulty that he says we are in is not my difficulty but his <e> <s> it is whether he is going to carry out through the legal process some of the recommendations contained in the report <e> <s> i suggest that he would be unwise so to do <e> <s> that is why i criticise the report <e> <s> the commissioners have produced an unsatisfactory report <e> <s> most of their recommendations do not deserve support <e>", "<cs> my lords i wholeheartedly support the amendment for the reasons given by the noble and learned lords lord ackner and lord griffiths <e> <s> their reasons are unanswerable and it does not add to the support given to the amendment for anything more to be said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i was chairman of the select committee to which this important bill was committed after the second reading debate on th february it may be for the convenience of the house if i say a few words about our deliberations and the views that we reached <e> <s> we sat for full days and two further days where we heard the evidence and submissions made <e> <s> we sat for a further two days on our deliberations on and preparation of the special report <e>", "<cs> my lords my view coincides with that of everyone else who has spoken that the amendment tabled by the noble baroness lady white is infinitely superior to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i support the view expressed by my noble friend lord crickhowell that it would be improved if the noble baroness would substitute for paragraph c the words <e>"]
