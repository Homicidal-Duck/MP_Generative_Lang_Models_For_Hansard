["<cs> my lords a long time ago i used to regard the unwritten constitution as a blessing <e> <s> it was superbly flexible it worked and worked admirably and stood the test of time <e> <s> some years later when i gave the haldane memorial lecture i said that there might be a real danger that times would change <e> <s> today i am convinced that alas <e> <s> times may be rapidly changing now <e> <s> there are so many countries in which the light of liberty has long ago gone out <e> <s> their law courts became the tools of the regime to carry out its policy of oppression <e> <s> innocent people were and are imprisoned often for years and sometimes for ever and even executed without a trial or at best there are mock trials <e> <s> to criticise the rgime is a criminal offence visited with dire consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords the name of contempt of court is by no means apt <e> <s> the law of contempt of court does not as its name suggests exist to protect the dignity of judges nor for that matter to harass the press <e> <s> it exists solely to ensure that justice shall be done and to this end it prohibits acts and words which might obstruct the administration of justice <e> <s> the horror of trial by press television radio occurs in many foreign countries <e> <s> i am sure that we should all hate to see it imported into the united kingdom and i have no doubt that we never shall <e> <s> nor have i any doubt that contempt of court should apply to all jury cases that is to say to all indictable criminal cases and to libel and fraud cases which in the civil courts are the only cases that now come before a jury <e> <s> a jury might well be affected and indeed seriously prejudiced by any comments appearing in the press during the course of the trial <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention to speak at all <e> <s> however it seems to me that clause states that discretion is vested in the secretary of state so that he may exercise it against an applicant but cannot do so on account of applicants race colour or religion <e> <s> why are those latter words put there <e> <s> obviously we all know that the present secretary of state would never exercise his discretion with prejudice to race colour or religion <e> <s> but parliament when it passed subsection must have foreseen that human nature being what it is it is possible that at some time in the future a secretary of state may well unless he is forbidden by the act to do so allow himself to exercise his discretion because of the race colour and religion of the person who is applying for naturalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am perfectly prepared to put it that way but it is not so easy <e> <s> it seems to me shocking that a bill should be passed in this way so that however unfair a secretary of state might be and however prejudiced he might be against the applicant the applicant has to put up with it and the secretary of state can do what he likes <e> <s> it seems to me quite monstrous that if the applicant can bring strong evidence to show that the minister has acted entirely on his dislike of the applicants race colour or religion and has therefore refused the application and the minister has dismissed the applicants appeal this would be a shocking and most serious denial of justice <e>"]
