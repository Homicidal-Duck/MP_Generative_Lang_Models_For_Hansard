["<cs> my lords i too believe that this house owes a great debt of gratitude to the noble lord lord winstanley not only for the opportunity of this debate but for the terms in which the motion was moved at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> he placed the emphasis where it should be and that is on the needs of patients <e> <s> before i leave that point i should like to say how much i enjoyed both of the maiden speeches <e> <s> however i was particularly moved by the splendid speech of the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be forgiven for speaking on a single possibly narrow aspect of the commissions report but this is due to a feeling that it is perhaps better to stick to something of which you have personal knowledge than to stray into matters of which you do not <e>", "<cs> my lords if in belfast today or elsewhere in northern ireland for that matter i were to follow an ambulance bearing the tragic victim of one of the frequent atrocities that contaminate the whole life of the province i would probably eventually arrive at the royal victoria hospital a teaching hospital of great repute but situated right up against a part of the city with a truly ghastly reputation for violence <e> <s> here the hospital staff and those dedicated people who help them try to practise modern medicine beset by problems which are unimaginable by those who have not been to see for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be very brief for i can express my views on this matter in a very few minutes <e> <s> if we are concerned with lenses for therapeutic and correctional purposes as of course we are then as the noble lord lord rugby has said under the opticians act these must be prescribed by an optician or by an ophthalmic medical practitioner <e> <s> quite clearly certain restrictive practices apply here <e> <s> i believe that if we were to go so far as to abolish them this would in fact be much against the public interest <e> <s> section of this act established a general optical council and charged it with certain responsibilities responsibilities for promoting high standards of professional education and conduct among opticians <e> <s> it was empowered to make certain statutory rules to which reference has already been made <e>", "<cs> my lords i had been a consultant for two years upon the inception of the national health service in and i can well remember that although an enthusiastic supporter from the start it worried me in those days that it might result in the evolution of two standards of medicine in this country <e> <s> such was the naivete of youth however not that youth has any monopoly in this respect that my fear was that the private sector of medicine might not be able to keep up with state medicine which presumably had access to an inexhaustible purse a misconception that even now has not entirely disappeared <e> <s> that there should continue to be an independent sector in medicine seemed to me to he quite essential and it is of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in a debate of this length with individual speakers confined to approximately minutes it would be totally out of the question to tackle a subject of that kindshould dearly like to see such subjects discussed and that is why i firmly believe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he will fully take into account one thing in particular <e> <s> patients who are sent straight home still have to be looked after properly <e> <s> if they are not looked after by doctors in hospital they are looked after by the family doctor at home <e> <s> this necessarily increases considerably the burden on the family doctors <e> <s> it is a scheme which simply will not work at all unless there is a particularly good relationship between the hospital and the surrounding family doctors <e> <s> for instance the family doctor must be able to get a patient straight back into hospital without argument if there is a complication <e> <s> there are a number of practicalities which show that there are disadvantages as well as advantages in this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble baroness lady mcfarlane of llandaff on her polished and effective maiden speech which i very greatly enjoyed <e> <s> i am sure there will be ample opportunity in committee to dissect the detail of this bill and i intend to speak very briefly today doing little more than indicating general agreement with the motives behind it and with its major provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the minister for that helpful and <e>", "<cs> my lords to a doctor this bill reveals certain potential dangers to patients and i think i might put some of them briefly before your lordships <e> <s> i have used the phrase potential dangers because i am sure that the government will have foreseen these risks and will have planned to avoid them <e> <s> it is the duty of any persons responsible for keeping medical information to keep it safe and this bill should be used to place a statutory responsibility upon them to do so <e> <s> furthermore i believe that the data on manual as well as on computer systems should be included <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate fully that among the servicemen wounded in the falklands war and operated on along the lines supported by the medical board mortality was nil <e> <s> does he seriously advise the abolition of this very successful board with no body to replace it <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first as it were declare an interest at the start of my short speech <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords as a doctor and as a surgeon i am very anxious to support the minister <e> <s> i am very conscious that your lordships will have been subjected on numerous occasions to all the arguments in favour of seat belts and all the arguments against them <e> <s> i do not propose to repeat any of the old arguments <e> <s> it is a very dangerous thing to put forward a new argument on an old topic but i believe that the public have ignored one of the most important of the reasons for wearing seat belts <e> <s> i doubt whether this medical reason has ever properly been described in this house <e> <s> i hope therefore that your lordships will forgive me while i tell briefly a true story by way of illustration and i can vouch for its truth in every particular <e>", "<cs> my lords when i was appointed a consultant at st georges hospital hyde park corner it was two years before the nhs began so i have lived all my professional life from the beginning hand in hand with the nhs <e> <s> but i feel as nearly all doctors feel that the nhs is afflicted by a sickness which provides in medical terms less and less for patients year by year <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive me but when there is something amiss with the health of a patient the doctor studies the patients history for the cause of the illness the present situation and the prognosis the future because these may be very relevant to the treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state should be congratulated upon his ambition to improve the standard of patient care in the nhs <e> <s> it is an ambition which for years has been recognised and freely discussed by many doctors <e> <s> no reasonable doctor could expect that the secretary of state would remain complacent in the light of serious complaints about the nhs from doctors and more importantly from patients <e> <s> the result is this bill <e> <s> i am sure that the government and all doctors agree that there is only one object that is to do what is best for the patients <e>", "<cs> this amendment so admirably moved by the noble baroness lady cox stems in part at least from a statement made by the presidents of the royal medical colleges <e> <s> at the second reading of this bill i listened with much enjoyment to the superb introduction by the noble baroness lady hooper <e> <s> in that speech she paid tribute to the presidents of the colleges but as regards the fate of this bill she held that their opinions were largely irrelevant <e>"]
