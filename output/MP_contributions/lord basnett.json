["<cs> my lords the sense of relief which i feel at now making my maiden speech is more than met by the sense of privilege and honour i feel with membership of your lordships house <e> <s> the privilege is all mine the honour belongs to the trade union movement and to its members past and present for the freedoms they have forged for the working people of this country and for the service they have done to our nation <e> <s> one pleasure is perhaps unique to myself <e> <s> it is the opportunity after years as an active trade unionist to make a non-controversial speech on the subject of trade unions and the law <e> <s> i can only say that i shall try <e>", "<cs> my lords a regrettable feature of our society and one mentioned by my noble friend lord williams of elvel is its polarisation and division <e> <s> that polarisation and division will widen if the government fail to repair an omission or to reconsider a commitment made despite the promise of consultation in the gracious speech <e> <s> the commitment was to introduce and i repeat the words for the benefit of the noble lord lord campbell the unsought unjustified and unnecessary legislation which can only be designed to harass the trade union movement <e> <s> the omission is of any acknowledgement of even the word unemployment or any commitment to give priority to its reduction <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that i did not say disunited <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has argued in defence of this situation that wages councils exist <e> <s> would he not accept that wages councils have been considerably weakened both in their coverage and in the inspectorate which ensures that wages councils can do an adequate job <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned his membership of the national economic development council <e> <s> i ask him to recall that at that council <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> does the noble lord recall that at that council there were discussions about the need for greater infrastructure investment in this country to stimulate manufacturing investment <e> <s> may i further ask him whether he is aware that employers throughout europe have signed a statement and this applies to all the industrial nations the oecd employers that there is a need for greater investment and for a set of policies which will give confidence in manufacturing countries for the restoration of their manufacturing base <e> <s> that point has been made <e>", "<cs> my lords my question is this <e> <s> will the noble lord say what the government intend to do about the representations made to the oecd and to the finance ministers in the presence of nigel lawson <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not acknowledge that despite the significance of the may day holiday to the labour movement throughout the world this country was one of the last countries although it had the first industrial revolution to introduce it <e> <s> despite what the noble viscount said it was introduced early by the united states of america and called labour day <e> <s> it was introduced by most of the commonwealth nations <e> <s> it has been introduced throughout europe east and west <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to the question now <e> <s> does the minister not agree that if other nations have given this in honour of their working people it would be offensive and totally insensitive given that the working people of this country have suffered such levels of unemployment and the deprivation of employment rights to even contemplate removing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> he is of course aware that for years the nedc has done a great deal to expand co-operation between both sides of industry <e> <s> certain questions therefore remain <e> <s> despite the answer from his noble friend earlier is he aware that both sides of industry are concerned that the government in this country show less commitment to manufacturing than do japan and germany <e> <s> there is a feeling that this is a restriction on the activities of the nedc <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask one final question <e> <s> do the conservative government still value the principles of the nedc which were established by a previous conservative government namely that our economic affairs should be a matter for consultation and that there should be an attempt to establish a consensus or have they turned their back on that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask one last question on this matter <e> <s> of course both sides of industry are working to make the current situation effective <e> <s> if they did not that would mean the end of the nedc and they value it <e>", "<cs> if i may i shall come to the question at the end <e> <s> if not the nedc would be abolished <e> <s> the question is this <e> <s> does not the noble lord understand that a body which the chancellor of the exchequer used to attend monthly but now attends only once a year and which has fewer edcs connected with industry gives less opportunity for both sides of industry to put their pressing problems <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate has illustrated that the challenges of the inner cities are the most severe that face society in britain today <e> <s> the debate has identified all those challenges <e> <s> there is the challenge of unemployment on a scale unmatched even by todays high standards <e> <s> there is the challenge of some of the worst housing in a country where bad housing is all too common <e> <s> there is the challenge of resisting racism both direct and unintentional <e> <s> there is the challenge of effectively combating crime without alienating local communities <e> <s> there is the challenge of giving people the skills and the education they need <e>", "<cs> yes but i am speaking of the quangos that were criticised by the government at the time they came to power <e> <s> i am talking about the creation of bodies which were not themselves directly responsible to government <e>", "<cs> my lords a short acquaintance quickly establishes the basic need which people with <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion of the noble lord lord ezra is most timely because after almost a decade we can begin to see the effects of denationalisation <e> <s> it is timely because the debate has begun with reference to the privatisation of electricity and water <e> <s> the privatisation programme has been costly a direct cost of million an estimated indirect cost of almost million and a loss of direct revenue <e> <s> for these costs and losses we were given the prospect of cheaper products better services and wider share ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords this year our economy has been growing strongly <e> <s> next year in an unsettled international situation it could bring the rate of growth down below the already predicted fall to per cent <e> <s> a much lower rate of growth will bring sharply into focus again the consequences of the immediate post- economic policies the period to which my noble friend lord jay referred in his magnificent maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the admission by ministers that some severely disabled people are to suffer a decrease in their income as the result of the new proposals will the noble earl agree that there is an urgent need for a review to ensure that this does not happen <e> <s> will he further agree that it is not in the interests of the disabled that they should await the opcs review <e> <s> that would be a disservice to the disabled since they were promised in that they would he provided with support to live normally in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lord lord young in evidence to the select committee on employment in another place conceded that the campaign alleging that the unemployment figures were fiddled had succeeded would the noble earl not agree that those figures lack public credibility <e> <s> would he not further agree that it would be sensible of the government to introduce an advisory committee on the unemployment figures like their advisory committee on the retail prices index <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl accept that i did not say that the figures were fiddled <e> <s> i happen to think that the changes over the past few years have been inexplicable <e> <s> what i said was that the noble lord lord young had accepted before the select committee on employment in another place that the campaign alleging that the figures had been fiddled had succeeded <e> <s> i therefore asked a question which has not been answered by the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak at no great length on one single issue that is the potential effect of the social security bill on those suffering from industrial injuries <e> <s> the effect of the changes proposed with those already introduced will weaken the support offered to those suffering industrial injuries it will increase the amount of litigation in connection with industrial accidents and it will undermine the purposes which lay behind the all-party support for the principles of the industrial injuries act <e>", "<cs> of course they are <e>", "<cs> if i expressed disappointment at the replies i have heard from the minister and other noble lords i should be understating my position <e> <s> really think that the point is being missed <e> <s> the noble earl asked a question <e> <s> he asked why we should seek local authorities to act for state agencies <e> <s> in fact we have not asked for that and i do not want that <e> <s> however there is a very good reason and that reason has been given namely that they are not working <e> <s> i have given the figures <e> <s> contract compliance has come down from per cent <e> <s> in june to per cent <e> <s> in june <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear is quite right in that the department responsible is undermanned which is well known and any of the agencies associated with the government can tell you that <e>", "<cs> my lords i make a simple brief point <e> <s> if your lordships support this amendment you are doing something for the disabled <e> <s> if you fail to support this amendment you are doing them an injury and none of us should have any doubt about that <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord williams of elvel has said there are issues in the white paper that we can welcome <e> <s> there are however silences within it that are most unwelcome <e> <s> it is certainly the case that it is stronger on presentation than it is on detailed proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to speak about the employment bill <e> <s> perhaps i may first of all apologise to the house and express my regret that because of a long-standing engagement i may not be able to stay for the whole of this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the fact as the minister will agree that support for the disabled should be steady should be known and should be reasonable questions abound about the intentions of the social security bill <e> <s> one has to ask some of those questions <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the damage being done to any sense of security among the disabled particularly the severely disabled by the bill and its provisions <e> <s> will he further elaborate to the house the governments intentions in regard to <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a one-off payment or will it be renewed <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord mentioned the winter of discontent <e> <s> is he aware that during that time there were occasions about which none of us was proud when members disobeyed their unions instructions and undertook acts which were regrettable <e> <s> my own union was concerned <e> <s> however the executive of my union and those of others <e>", "<cs> yes certainly on the general council <e> <s> that underlines the point made by my noble friend lord murray as to how one constrains the power of people in authority <e> <s> general secretaries and presidents have power and there is no doubt about that but which is the best way to restrain it <e> <s> is it by making them subject to an executive and a congress which determines what they do or is it making them subject to re-election every five years <e> <s> i was a general secretary elected to office and thereby not subject to re-election <e> <s> every two weeks i met my executive which could and did tell me on occasions exactly what to do <e> <s> every year i held a congress which decided the fundamental policies of the union <e> <s> i had to follow those policies whether or not i agreed with them <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord realise that in trying to control a minority of the movement as he suggests the government are creating loopholes for irresponsibility in the movement <e> <s> they are under-mining the responsible activities of trade union leaders at the moment <e> <s> that is the effect <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and await with interest the contribution of the minister <e> <s> however i should like to say a few words in support <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i am not quite clear <e> <s> did the minister wish me to withdraw the first amendment <e>", "<cs> i see <e> <s> i withdraw the amendment and shall not move the next <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all your lordships who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i think that it is an important debate <e> <s> i say to the noble earl that i have tried not to be emotional <e> <s> i think that i identified the irrelevance of some of the governments arguments the weakness of others and the positive discrimination that will occur if these amendments are now withdrawn <e> <s> there seem to me to be just a couple of things on which i need comment <e> <s> i shall do so quickly <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may give a different view of clause from that given by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i think that this clause and its effects are dangerous for industrial relations <e> <s> it could have two effects <e> <s> first it would create an opportunity for action by unofficial bodies which i am sure would not be welcomed by any of your lordships <e> <s> secondly and more importantly it weakens the authority of responsible trade unions <e> <s> i think that these are two very serious issues to be considered when debating this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have described how responsible trade unions act and what the effect of the bill if enacted would be on them <e> <s> as a trade unionist that is the point that i wanted to make <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord mottistone accept that one of my arguments is that the clause would cause the very bullying that he says now exists <e>", "<cs> my lords my concerns with the bill inevitably reflect those of the trade union movement with equal inevitability most of them have already been expressed <e> <s> however two of them were not frequently mentioned and i should therefore like to speak about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the two amendments briefly and to assure the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to hear evidence that the transport and general workers union itself actually issued this threat <e> <s> i should also like your lordships to be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to the question afterwards <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that any such threat can only have been issued by the negotiating body <e> <s> does he not agree that in this situation which we all regret it is difficult to ascribe the blame to one of the parties alone <e> <s> many people are to blame <e> <s> does the minister further agree that what is really needed is backing for effective tuc guidelines for reconciling union differences and allowing the peaceful introduction of single union agreements <e> <s> that is what is needed and not mischievous questions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all welcome the manner in which the noble lord lord joseph introduced the debate <e> <s> it is a manner which i hope i can reflect in what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting but i have been accused of being reserved about the governments achievement <e> <s> i acknowledge the growth in productivity <e> <s> i made reservations about the failure in investment and in particular the reduction in the percentage of gdp spent on training <e> <s> nobody would dispute both those facts <e>", "<cs> my lords there remain for me only two tasks to perform <e> <s> first i join the minister in thanking all those who have taken part in what as he says has been a fascinating debate but which equally has been a well-informed and caring one <e> <s> secondly i should like to withdraw my motion for papers
