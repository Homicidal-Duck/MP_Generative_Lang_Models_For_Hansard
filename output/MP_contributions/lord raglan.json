["<cs> my lords i hope that during the course of my remarks this afternoon i might contribute towards an explanation of some of the things which the noble lord lord skelmersdale may find interesting about nationalism <e> <s> i think i ought to say first of all that i was sorry not to have been able to take part in the debate on the scotland act last week <e> <s> i spoke quite a lot during the passage of that bill and should have liked to say something on its repeal <e> <s> nevertheless what i have to say on this motion i think would apply equally to the scotland act <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl does not mind taking on board one more question he may or may not be able to answer it without notice may i ask whether he is able to say what proportion of the total quantity of sheep meat and beef which comes into the national herd is in fact contributed by <e>", "<cs> my lords do the figures include scotland <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel it is a great tragedy that we are debating this order at the end of the day at the very end of the session <e> <s> this is because i believe that the decisions on regional policy are probably the most important national decisions which this or any government can make <e> <s> generally speaking governments are in fact less able to alter economic circumstances than either they are wont to claim or many people would wish to hope but regional industrial policy is one area where government help and guidance can make a considerable difference if it is well thought out <e> <s> those of us who like myself believe that they have something important to say in this matter should say it now rather than take a chance that next session there might be a debate on regional policy <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably the noble viscount will be writing to the noble lord lord rochester on the criteria <e> <s> will he please send me a copy of that letter <e>", "<cs> my lords in the manifesto of the noble lords party there is a commitment to phase out the earnings rule but the noble lord was showing some reluctance and suggesting that perhaps this might not happen after all <e> <s> does he not think that there is sufficient all-party agreement to phase this out and that the money really must be found <e> <s> would he not agree that no private firm would be able to take money from people on the promise of a pension without coming forward with that pension at the time of life when the donor of the subscription expects it <e> <s> does he not think that really there must be a moral commitment here <e> <s> i know it is difficult to get money out of the treasury at all times but surely a moral commitment should be a sufficient force to prise the money out of the treasury <e>", "<cs> my lords the money has never been available <e> <s> this has been going on for years and the government of the day have always said that the money is not available <e> <s> will the present government commit themselves to phasing out this immoral rule before the life of this parliament is finished <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount give way <e> <s> my noble friend lord hooson is too diffident being a maiden to press the point <e> <s> he raised the question as to whether this aid was in fact additional because according to his information the aid had previously been cut by million <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for a moment <e> <s> is it really true that this high mlr is a consequence of the labour governments policies <e> <s> if it is why are the united states in exactly the same position with rather higher interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords has the same thing been happening here <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to draw attention to two matters which although they may appear to be small in fact have the capacity vitally to affect the quality of post office service and closely affect the users of telephones and the writers of letters namely the telephone and postal codes <e> <s> in making my criticism i may say that although it appears to me that perhaps there is sometimes a tendency on the part of the post office to forget that it is there to provide a service and possibly the noble lord lord orr-ewing is right in saying that the telephone service is not as much on its toes as it could be there are many firms small as well as large in the private sector which in my experience are far worse in their outlook than the post office and whose attitude to their customers is one of casualness amounting to superciliousness as if it were demeaning and humiliating to provide a good service and as if they were in business to please only themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> i did not wish more people not to use the postcodes i was objecting to the kind of postcode we are expected to use <e> <s> i fully support the use of the postcode <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a comment here <e> <s> i suppose no research has been done as to why people do not use the codes <e> <s> the london codes are very widely known and so far as i know everybody uses them <e> <s> so there must be something which is very different about the way the london codes are put together and the ordinary postal code is put together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i rather find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord monson not in respect of our membership of the eec which i fully support but because he has pointed out that it is much easier to adjust to different time zones than is often made out <e> <s> i view this effort at harmonisation as an erosion of a benefit which we have gained and have had for many years <e> <s> i do not know whether your lordships know the history of how we came to have summer time <e> <s> it was due to the efforts of a builder called willett <e> <s> in fact he built a large part of the cadogan estate down chelsea <e> <s> he used to ride around in the early summer mornings and wish that other people were up at the same time as he was and seeing the beauty of the morning with him <e> <s> he hit upon the idea of adjusting the clocks because it was easier to adjust the clocks than to adjust peoples habits <e> <s> he brought the matter to the attention of members of parliament <e> <s> long and complicated committee proceedings were instituted in the other place at which all sorts of noteworthy people like sir arthur conan doyle the astronomer royal of the cape of good hope and i do not know who else gave evidence for days <e> <s> that took place in about <e> <s> he had a bill brought before parliament every year until when he died by which time i believe i am right in saying that the french government had adopted the idea <e> <s> but it was instituted in this country in when the noble lord lord samuel was home secretary as a measure to help save fuel which is surely a topical matter <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is he aware that many of us of course understand that the hours of daylight in northern scotland are shorter <e> <s> but by adjusting the clock by one hour one way or the other it does not diminish the length of daylight which is available <e> <s> it merely puts one hour at one end of the day or the other <e> <s> does the noble lord really believe that it is a problem there or was the protest against british standard time merely an assertion of scottish nationalism <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i should rise to say that in general i support the bill since i have heard so much criticism of it from back-benchers on the other side of the chamber <e> <s> these <e>", "<cs> my lords i fancy that the noble lord is exaggerating somewhat <e> <s> panda crossings and pedestrian crossings for instance are not constructed on motorways <e> <s> one must assume that the minister and the public highway authority have more sense than to construct one of these sleeping policemen in the middle of a motorway <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down could he reassure us on this matter of the number of humps likely to be installed by local authorities <e> <s> he said as i remember that these humps will only be constructed where local authorities want them to be constructed <e> <s> but supposing that they want to construct far too many <e>", "<cs> my lords i really came along to speak about certain matters in schedule which is headed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl lord mansfield for a new governmental definition that a consultation is one where the parties have agreed and a genuine consultation is one where the interested parties have disagreed <e> <s> i congratulate the noble earl on his frankness in admitting that his consultations have been genuine <e> <s> that i think is the answer to the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard and to the noble lord lord middleton that in fact nearly every interested party affected by these proposed orders has disagreed with them sometimes very strongly and even almost violently <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell me what arrangements will be made for those of us who live in wales but who do not speak welsh and who will not have the benefit of the choice of a fourth channel or a second itv channel which people in england will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not put my name down to speak because i thought and quite rightly that everything i might wish to say would already be covered by the speech of my noble friend lord walston <e> <s> but i remembered when listening to the debate the precept of my noble friend lord champion who used to tell me that if something is worth saying once it is very often worth saying twice <e> <s> i want to reinforce what both the noble baroness lady hornsby-smith and my noble friend lord sainsbury have been saying <e> <s> however first i should say that this report in which i have had very little hand in writing is to my mind extremely well written very clear for such a complicated subject and not over-long <e> <s> it is a model report of its kind and possibly the best report that the sub-committee has ever produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been encouraged to speak this evening by the noble earl who in his trailer last week hoped that as many noble lords as possible on this side would take part <e> <s> i do not think i can usefully comment now on resolutions passed at the labour party conference <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord lord chelwood is that i am not a unilateralist <e>", "<cs> my lords before the right reverend prelate sits down i wonder as a matter of interest whether he thinks it would be all right and the family would be safe if the fathers fathers wife or the wifes daughters daughter were allowed to marry <e> <s> are not these things a bit far-fetched in themselves and surely to have them associated together is a bit odd <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will be very well aware that the number of obligations which a local authority has to discharge has increased enormously over the past years compared with the past years or so in which local authorities have been in being <e> <s> when considering how the government are going to raise finance for local authorities will they also consider the strength of the management structure which needs to control the spending of this money and bear in mind that it is just as important a matter how this structure is designed that it should be brought <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord permit me to ask a question <e> <s> how is it in his opinion that the renault car company in france which i suppose is one of the best run motor-car companies in the world and the most profitable works so well even though it is nationalised <e>", "<cs> my lords it appears that not the least of the difficulties which is faced by the government and mr haig and the secretary-general of the united nations is that it is not clear who is in charge of the argentine government <e> <s> would the minister kindly say how much of an obstacle this characteristic of the argentine government is to a negotiated solution <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord beloff i do not think that it would be hypocritical of me to congratulate my noble friend who introduced this motion today although i disagree with quite a lot that he says <e> <s> i want to express my admiration for him <e> <s> he is an extraordinary man and his speech has shown that despite his age which he told us he has lost none of his vigour or idealism in this one of his most impassioned causes <e> <s> what has spurred him on i believe throughout his life is his deep belief in the ultimate goodness and good sense of human beings though he does not like governments much <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord barrington has raised points which would take me too long to answer <e> <s> i do disagree with him but i would say that modern nationalism is a development of imperialism and there is not much difference between them <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend withdraws the amendment i have here the new towns act which contains certain conditions under which a <e>", "<cs> for a number of reasons we should not be diffident about paying people not only the chairman but the trustees for what they do <e> <s> i had the good fortune i suppose one could call it that to me it was good fortune of being paid in two posts i took up <e> <s> in one i had the honour to serve under the noble earl lord perth when he was first commissioner of the crown estates <e> <s> i got a salary for that and a travelling allowance <e> <s> i could not have afforded time off from my own affairs had i not received that salary <e> <s> whether i was worth my oats i do not know but certainly the others on the crown estate commission would not have found time i am sure to do that job i am referring to some very expert people if they had not been paid <e> <s> in other words if one wants the people one needs that is one way of getting them <e>", "<cs> i should like to come back to what my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge said about the question of the professional or the amateur <e> <s> i do not say that it obtains today but apparently at one time the attitude of this is a jolly good party that you are coming to and you are going to have a glass of sherry afterwards was rife <e> <s> the point i was making was that instead of turning up for a meeting every now and again one should apply oneself regularly to the job <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the minister has said but in turn he will appreciate the anxiety that has been expressed over subsection to which my noble friend lord strabolgi has not moved an amendment <e> <s> the minister referred us to clause which one supposes covers a certain unhappy eventuality <e> <s> my family was touched if that is the right word to use by an accident of a very tragic kind <e> <s> my great grandfather gave lent rather than gave to the then united services institution a collection of <e>", "<cs> my lords the lack of noble lords on this side of the house with farming backgrounds has propelled me to the front bench <e> <s> in preparation for this honour i have of course equipped myself with a clean pair of shoes <e> <s> i wish only that it would be as easy to provide a short speech which did justice to the interesting and important subject which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie introduced this afternoon with his usual lan and thoughtfulness based on his deep knowledge from a long association with the farming industry <e> <s> the subject has been discussed from many angles during the course of a series of very interesting speeches and i am not aware that there is any particular party line on this subject <e> <s> this side of the house tends to be more urban in its origin but nearly all agree it would be objective of maintaining a healthy agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords with the aid of the tables in the report i have been trying to deduce about how much the countries of the eec spend upon agricultural guidance and i am afraid that i cannot find an accurate answer because a lot of expenditure is national and if in any case as my noble friend lord cledwyn mentioned it is in the form of cheaper loans it will be impossible to find out the real figure <e> <s> but it is probably right to say that the total would come to well over double the million units of account which the cap itself spends <e> <s> this seems a large sum but to get it in proportion guidance expenditure in this country cap and national together appears to be running at something over million a year <e> <s> i do not think it really helps to do as the noble lord lord middleton did compare it as a tiny percentage of the very swollen guarantee fund <e> <s> we are not talking about a huge sum though it is a significant one and it is important to examine whether it is well spent <e>", "<cs> i suggest that my noble friend should read on and give the rest of the sentence from which he quoted or perhaps he will permit me to do it for him <e> <s> the witness for the ministry of agriculture ends by saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord molloy over the importance of local government <e> <s> i also think it right that those who criticise local government should be aware of how much more is expected of it now than used to be the case <e> <s> some mention has been made of that today but i think it is worth underlining <e> <s> my father was a county councillor for years and it took him about a day a week <e> <s> when he retired in it was beginning to take longer and i think that is perhaps why he retired <e> <s> since that time central government has heaped ever more functions on councils and particularly on the new districts <e> <s> some councillors make their work pretty well a full-time job <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gave figures for estimated local authority current expenditure <e> <s> can he give us the estimate for local authority capital expenditure and say how the balance between capital and current expenditure has changed in let us say the last decade <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will have had impressed on them again and again the enormous economic importance of the bridge link to the principality and also the importance of a reliable link of adequate capacity which i think is one of the things which annoyed us more than anything when i had quite a lot of responsibility for inducing industry to go to south wales <e> <s> are the government also aware that bristol and parts of the south west also derive enormous benefit from the existence of the bridge because the economies of the two littorals have become to some extent interdependent through the existence of the bridge <e> <s> to deprive either side of this enormously valuable link would be a great blow to both economies <e>", "<cs> my lords when i came to the house nearly years ago i was impressed by the number of academics on the labour side and i am sure that it is good that the convervatives have equipped themselves with an equal number <e> <s> it is only with some reservations to which i shall come later that i welcome the noble lords invitation to discuss an interesting philosophical proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i was responsible for a housing department for many years and i slightly go along with the noble baroness on the difficulty of getting repairs done <e> <s> however i was drawing attention to the fact that the council tenant who is acquiring a property is acquiring responsibility and not freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may be relieved that i am not going to attack him <e> <s> indeed i think he has done very well to get as much money as he has in the present climate <e> <s> he and the arts council are in the position of never having enough money for what they would like and besides the greater part of it is always bespoken in the interests of continuity <e>", "<cs> my lords all my working life i have been a farmer and my sole income is from farming <e> <s> i know to my cost that there can be no quicker way of losing money and so i have a great respect for good farmers who i thought were doing a fair job of husbanding the land which apart from our lost elms looks more attractive to me than ever i remember <e> <s> only last week one of my noble friends who is not a farmer and who had just helicoptered from london to hereford told me that he had never seen the countryside looking more marvellous and that he had felt like god visiting his own country <e> <s> i admit that that was before the straw burning started <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble viscount as leader of the house a question <e> <s> the committee consider that a six-month period should give the broadcasting authorities adequate opportunity <e> <s> if before the six months has run the house feels that the experiment has gone on for long enough is there some provision by which it could express a view on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the lord advocate a question <e> <s> he mentioned that already holders of public offices and others are disbarred from those offices by virtue of bankruptcy <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords why then are peers and members of parliament specifically mentioned rather than the holders of other public offices <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord moves on may i ask him this <e> <s> has the commission given her majestys government any reason for adopting these proposals or is it as commissioner andriessen is reported to have said while on a visit to this country a couple of months ago that it is a good way of reducing the beef mountain <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the time to argue with the noble baroness lady carnegy but i should point out that scotland receives more per capita than the english regions <e> <s> i do not know why <e> <s> my party would expand funding through the regional associations in england so that after five years the government would be disbursing twice as much money as they do now <e>", "<cs> my lords i recently read in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell has as one would expect of him put the case for the bill as well as it could be put <e> <s> he is i know interested in the tourist industry and as he said he principally supports the bill on that account <e> <s> on that point i am inclined to think that though its provisions may help one kind of holiday industry it will do so at the expense of another kind <e> <s> i shall not bandy figures with him about employment prospects they of course will come out in the committee but i am bound to say that i think his figures will be contended <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i wish to ask her whether she knows that the lifeboat station at poole has just been asked for a rent of a year which is more than is paid for the rents for all the lifeboats right round the coast or it will have to move out because it is apparently using that much worth of space in the marina at poole <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it there was an original area of jurisdiction with the quay and the pier <e> <s> then when the bill was first mooted there was an extremely large area of jurisdiction <e> <s> now the promoters have shrunk this area but it is still considerably larger than the original area of jurisdiction of <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to keep interrupting the noble lord but he has several points wrong <e> <s> i was not criticising the development of the houses <e> <s> i was criticising the fact that they were being offered on the basis of having a berth in the marina <e> <s> as for the latter point that is not what i said <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that it be an instruction to the committee to whom the bill is committed that they should have particular regard to the effect of the bill on the environment and on the character of swanage and its bay and should consider whether it is in the public interest that as proposed by the bill a far more extensive area of the bay than hitherto should be placed under the jurisdiction of a private company and enclosed for the purpose of commercial development <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the government have treated the post of secretary of state for trade and industry rather cavalierly <e> <s> i read somewhere that there have been six secretaries of state in eight years and perhaps the noble viscount the leader of the house will put me right on that point when he winds up <e> <s> whatever the figure the government have shown a certain lack of awareness of the importance of the post <e> <s> that seems odd in an administration which rightly proclaims the paramount importance of the good health of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the noble earls questioning on this very point <e> <s> it would be difficult not to translate that into a right of access <e> <s> they have <e>", "<cs> my lords i will if it happens <e> <s> as the debate has proceeded so noble lords have answered most other noble lords points <e> <s> there are just one or two to which i think i should refer <e> <s> the noble lord <e> <s> lord orr-ewing who is not in his place was in favour of a marina any marina every marina <e> <s> he did not get my point that this is not any marina <e> <s> of course marinas can be a good thing but not here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords point was to try to minimise things <e> <s> he accused me of trying to maximise them <e> <s> the fact is that it is not a fair percentage <e> <s> we are talking about roughly half the usable area of the bay <e> <s> the noble lord lord greenway also said that it would enhance the fishing <e> <s> that is something i did not understand <e> <s> the noble earl lord onslow gave us to understand that there would be a boat-repairing facility there something that i have never heard before <e> <s> i should like to say to him that yes indeed the lifeboat has accepted the position <e> <s> but it has had to put itself right with the developer as the only sensible thing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the lifeboat would rather stay where it is but if it is put into the marina it shall accept that it is put into the marina <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of croy talked about the designation as a fishery harbour and said that the ministry of agriculture was against it <e> <s> i pointed out that the sea fish industry authority was advising the fishermen against it so this is another uncertainty <e> <s> this bill is surrounded by uncertainty and this is yet another one which has not been resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord st john and i have wondered why there is nowadays so little good architecture <e> <s> although i do not disagree with his suggestions on how to try to achieve improvements i am not sanguine that such suggestions will bring immediate effect <e> <s> the antecedents of the architecture to which both he and i agree to object go back a long way <e>", "<cs> my lords i did learn of one distinguished architect who lived in a tower block for three months <e> <s> he was mr goldfinger who is now deceased <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to congratulate the noble viscount lord knutsford on his speech which i do very warmly <e> <s> he and i served in the same regiment at the same time but we never met <e> <s> i note that three of the matters which he lists as his special interests are also mine namely conservation architecture and music <e> <s> as a local director of the national trust for over years he has had much practical experience on that side of conservation and as he told us this evening he has a strong interest in provincial museums about which he made some very wise observations concerning loans and other matters <e> <s> in one respect i disagree with the noble viscount but nevertheless i hope that he will feel encouraged to give your lordships the benefit of his experience on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble earl will do me the honour of reading my speech later <e> <s> the drift of my thesis is that these works are enormously expensive and that the money which goes on them would be better put to conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be following on that contribution from the noble lord lord reay <e> <s> since nationalism is strong in scotland at the moment i want to say something about it because little attention seems to have been paid in this country to what it is about <e> <s> most people take a nonintellectual and pragmatic view of politics but nationalism is a cuckoo in that nest a theory of political organisation which does not fit into the tradition of government as it has evolved here <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been on sub-committee d for a long time now <e> <s> i am bound to say that this was perhaps the most interesting inquiry i have sat on <e> <s> the sub-committee needed to find a careful way through a lot of evidence and some rather ill done research and present its opinions in a balanced way <e> <s> i think that with the help particularly of our specialist adviser and the guidance of the noble lord lord middleton we managed to do so <e> <s> certainly the noble lord lord crickhowell thought so as did the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> my noble friend lord walston thought we were not tough enough <e> <s> i hope that the mildness of our language gave emphasis to the gravity of our conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for providing those figures <e> <s> i suggest that it is perhaps a false reading <e> <s> in my speech i said that the councils have the ridley axe over their heads and they are worried that they are going to be done for costs <e> <s> that is what is making them feel more inclined to give planning permission in some cases rather than otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down she mentioned that she was going to listen to various representations about forms of tenure and so forth <e> <s> however neither she nor any other noble lord today has mentioned share farming in which there is a great deal of interest and which might be more universal as a form of contract if potential owners and tenants were more sure of the law in respect of such contracts <e> <s> will the government look into the matter and consider share farming as one of the provisions for which they may legislate <e>"]
