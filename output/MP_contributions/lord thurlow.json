["<cs> may i say that i share the uneasiness expressed by the noble baroness lady masham about this amendment <e> <s> the social services have limited resources and in my experience many social workers and i would expect this to apply to approved social workers in the future are overburdened and are sometimes unable to get on to cases with the speed they would wish or to devote the necessary amount of time to them <e> <s> i think it would be a great mistake to remove from the nearest relative or indeed the close relatives such responsibility as is at present contemplated under the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to suggest that this amendment which is in fact a modest amendment in its scope is important as a safeguard against dangers in the future even more than to remedy deficiencies at present <e> <s> in the best areas local authorities and the local health services are already providing these necessary services but at present conditions are patchy <e> <s> as has been pointed out in the white paper of we are dealing with a prospect of deficiencies in services for the next to years <e> <s> in confronting this lengthy period what is likely to be the financial background <e> <s> as the noble lord lord wallace of coslany has said local authorities are running into increasing stringency <e>", "<cs> my lords i think your lordships will agree that this is a modest amendment in so far as it deals with only the tip of a vast iceberg of social problems of after-care <e> <s> it is concerned only with the narrow point of the after-care of detained patients <e> <s> this bill and your lordships discussions on previous stages have been much concerned with rights with matters of consent and with standards <e> <s> but there has been no provision in the bill dealing with the whole of the great subject of after-care which is perhaps the biggest single field of the problem of therapy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot share the views just expressed by the right reverend prelate about alleged racism <e> <s> i spent some years or so serving in different commonwealth diplomatic posts and i strongly repudiate the suggestion that any of the members of our diplomatic staffs and within my experience faithfully serving immigration officers are racist in outlook <e> <s> indeed i fear that the right reverend prelate has been carried away emotionally by what must be great pressures from the large asian population in his diocese <e>", "<cs> my lords i will take the advice of the noble lord lord sherfield and confine my <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to be able to add my congratulations and thanks to the noble earl lord stockton for his extremely interesting clear and constructive contribution in his maiden speech <e> <s> those of us who had such respect and affection for his grandfather can suppose that the noble earl will make many contributions to our debates and we look forward to them very much <e> <s> i also look forward very much to the contribution of the noble baroness lady blatch <e> <s> this is an opportunity before the curtain rises on the great controversies ahead to seek to take a rather wider perspective than the particular issues which are going to he debated during the proceedings on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult in a debate such as this to give our contributions the appearance of debating when there is such a wide measure of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps rather a cheek for a layman such as myself to intervene in this discussion among such a galaxy of academic distinction <e> <s> far be it for me to seek to comment in any way on the difficult questions of structure that are covered in the two papers before this house <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a good moment to discuss this subject <e> <s> it is a time of opportunity <e> <s> we can now look back with the perspective of eight years <e> <s> we have a pretty good idea of the situation now <e> <s> the accent of the debate this evening like the accent of this very constructive document before us is positive <e> <s> i therefore do not think that it is a time for wringing of hands <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord elibank looked at the position in the south american territories with which he is familiar i have looked with interest and a measure of concern at the trend in the countries of which i have had direct experience <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the valuable report of the select committee on foreign affairs of another place represents a watershed in the movement of public opinion in this country generally towards appreciating the importance of the work for the promotion of britain abroad <e> <s> for about years there was a strong undertow of prejudice against support from the public purse for anything as intangible as that sort of work <e> <s> at times that undertow assumed proportions of such violence that it was even a threat to the established and very important work which had been going on <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed useful to open the window wider to let in to this difficult and complex subject more fresh air <e> <s> i pay tribute to the powerful statement of the right reverend prelate which was filled with valuable facts and presented with great force <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear often from the right reverend prelate <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all grateful to the noble baroness for giving us the opportunity to debate this subject <e> <s> if i may say so she is a modern st george attacking the dragon of ignorance and unbelief that is undermining our society <e> <s> but i wonder whether her lance is the most effective weapon to kill the dragon in the s <e> <s> is it appropriate to the condition of our schools and society to prescribe that the act of worship in school assemblies and the form of religious education should be explicitly christian <e> <s> the values which we have inherited have come to us through centuries of christian teaching <e> <s> like the noble earl lord halsbury i had the advantage of going to family prayers every morning as a child with the family on one side and the servants all filing in on the other side of the dining room table <e> <s> would it not be more effective in transmitting the values that we cherish and respect to leave it to the discretion of teachers and school governors to decide the form which the transmission should take <e> <s> it is no good trying to push christian forms down unreceptive throats <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to the noble baroness that i think it is a different sphere in teaching <e> <s> to impart forms of knowledge is a much simpler task than seeking to transmit values <e>", "<cs> we should not close our debate on this amendment with the only request for caution coming from those who profess no religious faith <e> <s> we are dealing with a subject of intense difficulty as the noble lord lord thorneycroft acknowledged and as the most reverend primate and the right reverend prelate are so well aware <e>", "<cs> i should like to support very strongly amendment no <e> <s> in favour of enabling small schools to opt out <e> <s> i believe many members of the committee will share my dismay at the number of small schools that have been closed down for what <e>", "<cs> i should like very strongly to support the position set out by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> with great respect to the proposers of the amendments and it is very difficult not to be carried away by the eloquence of the noble lord and the ardour of the noble baroness i submit that these amendments would be counterproductive <e> <s> i think that all kinds of practical difficulties would arise in relation to attempts to define the term christian <e> <s> that would lead us into a legal and practical quagmire but much more important than any legalistic considerations is the fundamental point to which the right reverend prelate referred that the object of the provisions for the act of worship and for religious instruction is surely to transmit to our children or to give an opportunity to transmit to our children proper values and proper morals <e>", "<cs> my lords we are privileged to have at the dispatch box the minister whose special brief is specifically related to community care <e> <s> we welcome this and wish him well <e>", "<cs> my lords as i see it the amendments are in no sense adversarial but rather protective with the object of tidying up the language of the governments amendment nor do they seek to introduce inflexibility in terms of that amendment <e> <s> they explicitly state that the council should have regard to the duty of maintaining <e> <s> they impose no duty as such <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to be able to follow the noble lord lord mottistone because i heartily endorse every single proposition that he put forward <e> <s> i should also like to confine my remarks to the subject of schizophrenics <e> <s> this is a field with which i am personally familiar from sombre experience and i regard it as the most serious and difficult part of the interlocking problems <e>", "<cs> the committee has covered the main points concerning this important amendment amply and i do not wish to extend the proceedings <e> <s> however i ask the committee not to attach cogency to the argument of analogy to which the noble lord lord hutchinson has referred <e>", "<cs> if i may intrude a purely personal comment at this stage in the committees proceedings i am a mere member of the same class as the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> but i happen to have a duplicate who is qualified under the terms of the bill to serve on the tribunal because he happens to be an identical twin <e> <s> i have no hesitation in saying that my learned kinsman would be infinitely better qualified to discharge these responsibilities than i should be myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly endorse the description of the bill as expressed by the noble baroness lady macleod as both excellent and necessary <e> <s> i very much hope as previous speakers have said that the government will take this matter on board and if possible find time for it <e> <s> however if that proves not to be possible perhaps they will at least take it as a model for their own legislation for which we have been waiting for a long time and which we keenly expect <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the first occasion the noble baroness has answered from the dispatch box on a motion on mental health i should like to say how warmly i welcome her arrival in this important field of health <e> <s> as the prospects seem to be that the responsibilities for treatment and after care are likely to remain fragmented between two or three central departments and a host of local authorities it is especially fortunate that she has had distinguished service in local government and is well known for her distinguished service in co-ordinating air traffic control <e> <s> her powers will be fully exercised <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not enter the controversial subject of polytechnics for one very good reason i know nothing whatever about them <e> <s> i want to speak briefly about an area of innovation <e> <s> before coming to that may i very warmly endorse what the noble baroness lady faithfull said about the terrible problems that we are building up for ourselves in the future from the phenomenon of truancy and the failure to do anything serious about it <e> <s> that seems to me to merit the most urgent intensive study and action <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my pleasure to open by paying a warm tribute to our chairman for the momentum which he enabled our sub-committee to maintain in its work despite the enormous scope of its studies <e> <s> i should like to endorse his tribute to the quality and effectiveness of our clerk miss de groose and to the encyclopaedic knowledge of our specialist adviser mr barnett who enabled us to keep abreast of knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord auckland referred to new zealand perhaps i may mention that i was in new zealand when that country introduced its health service <e> <s> one of the salient weaknesses of a pioneering measure was the uncertainty as to how it would be administered <e> <s> we perhaps have grounds for wondering how this bill will be administered <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to express my appreciation to the noble earl for giving us the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> he skilfully outlined the very wide spectrum of different therapies <e> <s> i should like to confine my remarks to <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him whether the guidelines which occupy an important place in the scheme of things will be published and therefore available for public comment <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking today i have a certain sense of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my strong support for the amendment <e> <s> the arguments for it have been expounded clearly <e> <s> my interest is in relation to those who are mentally ill and discharged <e> <s> i wish to refer to the resource prospects in relation to after-care which makes the tying down of the procedure particularly important <e> <s> in previous debates we have listened with growing apprehension to the scenario for resources <e> <s> it appears that for the foreseeable future the pressure on local authorities in relation to the poll tax and so forth means that the prospects for after-care are poor <e> <s> therefore it is all the more important that the procedures should be laid down as far as possible within a cast iron framework <e>", "<cs> my lords all noble lords will endorse what the noble lord lord eden has just said that the only factor that will settle the future of hong kong in the long run is the attitude of the peoples republic of china and that it is indeed very much in the interests of the peoples republic of china that hong kong should continue to thrive <e> <s> we seek to help hong kong to get through the immediate difficult years that lie ahead <e> <s> this bill will not solve everything <e> <s> but the package is designed to make people stay <e> <s> i strongly support the bill and i hope and believe that it will succeed in its aims <e> <s> i hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords at the second reading i indicated my support for the bill <e> <s> i still support it and express the hope that your lordships will not support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord aldington is not present i shall not add to the chorus of congratulations in which i should otherwise have participated <e> <s> his work was extraordinary <e> <s> however i should like to join in the many tributes paid to our remarkable clerk whose drafting i know a little about drafting has been very fine indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord lord hatch introduced the vital question of the race between resources and population in the context of the commonwealth relationship <e> <s> later in my brief remarks i shall return to that issue as i believe it to be of foremost importance <e>"]
