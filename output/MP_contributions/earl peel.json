["<cs> my lords in adhering to the traditions of this house i crave your lordships indulgence as like my noble friend lord halifax this is the first time i have had the honour of addressing your lordships <e> <s> i had been advised that when making my maiden speech it should really be on a subject that is not particularly close to my heart what some people regard as a secondary subject but i am afraid that i must admit that i am perhaps breaking one of the basic rules of the house for this bill is extremely close to my heart due to the fact that i live work and own land in one of englands national parks dare i say the most beautiful national park <e> <s> the yorkshire dales <e> <s> must add that i commiserate with my noble friend lord halifax for having been voluntarily moved out of yorkshire he has my every sympathy <e>", "<cs> if i may i should like to add one further point to what the noble lord lord buxton has said <e> <s> in view of the fact that this bill is largely to try to bring us into line with europe it is my knowledge that this particular point is not disputed in any of the eec directives <e>", "<cs> if i correctly interpret the noble lords suggestion would it not mean that if a schedule part ii bird what we loosely call vermin for example a carrion crow was seen to be taking the eggs of free-range chickens on a sunday the farmer would simply doff his hat and say its sunday i will let you go <e> <s> surely that is carrying the matter a bit too far and that he should be at least allowed to protect his agricultural pursuits or his livestock <e>", "<cs> there is one further point <e> <s> after the vicious attack on the black-backed gull i would love to be coming to its defence but sadly i cannot <e> <s> i must agree with my noble friend lord mowbray in tabling this amendment <e> <s> i must say i am most curious as to <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to the arguments on both sides and i share the sympathies of those who have expressed concern about snaring <e> <s> however i support most fervently those who believe that snaring is a most important part of controlling the fox <e> <s> we have talked about conservation and about the decrease in this country of many animals birds and mammals <e> <s> the fox is not on the decrease it is very much on the increase <e>", "<cs> there must be very few subjects on which i can claim superior qualifications to your lordships but i am a qualified deep-sea diver sub-aqua club class if that means anything to your lordships and i have dived considerably around the world <e> <s> i should like very much to endorse this amendment and also to take the matter a stage further and agree with the noble lord lord craigton particularly on the subject of marine nature reserves <e> <s> i have dived extensively off the african coast and it is extraordinary that where what are called marine national parks exist the difference between those national parks and the non-park areas is most impressive indeed <e> <s> i would certainly endorse everything that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene to reply to the noble lord lord houghton in fact a great deal of pleasure is derived in the simple use of hound work <e> <s> more often than not in the case of fox hunting when the fox escapes the hounds have been working and people have had the opportunity of watching them have a good chase and this gives them more pleasure than the killing of the animal itself <e>", "<cs> i should like my lords to support this <e> <s> may i take this opportunity of asking my noble friend something on a point of interpretation <e> <s> in clause i note that the word livestock is used on two occasions regarding licensing <e> <s> in the original bill the interpretation of licence included game birds <e> <s> i notice that in the bill we have in front of us it does not <e> <s> i am wondering therefore why this is so <e> <s> it would appear to me that it is no longer possible to apply for a licence for the protection of game birds <e> <s> earlier my noble friend lord burton made reference to the hen harrier <e> <s> i think that i am right in saying that my noble friend lord avon assured us that a licence would be possible for the protection of game birds against the hen harrier if applied for <e> <s> as i interpret the bill as it has been redrafted this is not the case <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister could give me his opinion on this <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i suspect come in as almost the final speaker on this i must admit that i came into your lordships house today very much in two minds <e> <s> i think i am probably speaking for one or two others as well <e> <s> this is not a clearly defined subject <e> <s> the differences which seem to exist between the two sides are small but obviously very deeply felt <e> <s> having considered all the points put forward i suppose i can say that i am most impressed by the point made by my noble friend lord middleton <e> <s> this to my mind sums up the whole aspect of the voluntary agreement the fact that it never really has had the opportunity to be tried because the nature conservancy council through no fault of their own have not in the past informed landowners and farmers about the aspects of an sssi <e> <s> so i would hope that with this now being brought into the bill there will be every good reason for landowners and farmers to adhere to the ideas behind the governments voluntary system <e> <s> i cannot say which way this will go and no doubt it will go to a division but i do on behalf of those members of your lordships house who are going for a voluntary agreement urge landowners and farmers in the future to show restraint and to recognise that we have faith in them and that they will try their best to work out a sensible policy on sssis <e>", "<cs> my lords any reference to national parks made by the noble lord lord sandford in view of his extremely wide experience must be taken seriously <e> <s> whereas he has given great detail to this amendment i should like to talk in general terms <e> <s> any sensible move which would provide the opportunity for a wider consideration of facts when considering simply agricultural grants for the national parks and for the less favoured areas must be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord lord renton as i do i am curious to ask the noble lord lord stanley why we have a restriction of hectares in this amendment <e> <s> do sheep not go into fields of more than hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very much to support my noble friend on this <e> <s> we have heard figures from both sides of the house on the hen harrier and i do not know which to believe <e> <s> i can only speak from my own experience and having spoken to people in scotland the north-west of england and wales there is no doubt at all that the hen harrier is on the increase <e> <s> this is a problematical bird particularly with game birds <e> <s> i think at times that one tends to forget the importance of the commercialism of game shooting and the benefit thereof to the countryside <e> <s> i do not think there is any doubt whatever that if the hen harrier savaged fish farms or livestock it would certainly not be on the schedule part i list <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend is going to press this amendment but i would sincerely hope the government would watch this bird very carefully in the future whether through binoculars or not and as the noble earl lord swinton said perhaps if the bird were shot it would keep it in the air more often <e> <s> it is a destroyer and i hope the government will keep an eye on it in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard this very exciting news about my windfall profits of between and a year about which the noble earl lord onslow has spoken and despite my excitement at this i must assure your lordships that in fact i <e>", "<cs> my lords i appear to be in a minority on both sides of the house in actually congratulating the government on having introduced this bill although i have to admit that i see it as one step in achieving the ultimate aim which i believe is the main purpose behind the bill that is as noble lords have said to try to rectify the damage that was brought about by the act and to try to make more holdings available or should i say to increase the percentage of holdings the percentage of units and to increase or get back the confidence between landlords and tenants <e> <s> as many noble lords have said there can be no doubt that the act was a bad act for both sides of the agricultural industry <e> <s> besides the excessive infringements it imposed upon the liberty of private ownership a fact that i feel sometimes is forgotten in these debates it has resulted in a reduction in the supply of land available for letting and has curtailed the opportunities for new entrants into the industry <e> <s> as noble lords have said it must go in conjunction with other bills for having produced this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems more than three years ago since many of us were here trying to unscramble the numerous problems we were faced with during the course of the consideration of the wildlife and countryside bill <e> <s> it was during the passage of that bill that i had the honour of addressing your lordships for the first time <e> <s> i therefore have particular pleasure in welcoming the noble viscount lord blakenham to the house and congratulating him on his maiden speech <e> <s> i agree with everything that he said <e> <s> i know that we very much look forward to hearing him in the future <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> a lot has been said on this <e> <s> i should simply like to say that i think that some form of definition behind the regulations would be eminently sensible <e> <s> i should not like to say at any stage which way this particular amendment would go <e> <s> we have heard one version from lord mackie and we have heard another from the noble lord opposite <e> <s> but i think that in principle this would be eminently sensible and could only help everybody concerned with this bill <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend and as he has quite rightly said this is an enabling bill and the importance of the regulations is paramount <e> <s> it is therefore with some i shall not use the word suspicion concern that these matters have a habit of lingering on <e> <s> it is for that reason i have put my name to this amendment and i hope that my noble friend the minister will as my noble friend lord onslow suggested give us a clear indication as to how soon the regulations will be published <e>", "<cs> in support of my noble friend and the noble baroness i too put my name to this amendment <e> <s> i feel very strongly that there is the need to control and if necessary to prevent the export of pesticides particularly to third world countries <e> <s> i think the danger is that companies may be tempted to offload pesticides which are unacceptable in this country for whatever reason that may be to third world countries <e> <s> the point that really concerns me is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord stanley on this matter because it seems to me that it is impossible to legislate when we simply do not have the complete evidence in front of us <e> <s> to my knowledge most of the experimental work that has been done in this field to date has been done by the manufacturing companies themselves <e> <s> i should like to ask the government what they intend to do in the way of research <e> <s> it seems to me that adas for example ought to be looking into the most effective way of pesticide application <e> <s> but how does one judge it by drift droplet size or quantity evaporation <e> <s> there are so many factors about which we really do not know enough <e> <s> at this stage much though i have great sympathy for what the noble lord is saying i do not see how this can possibly be enacted <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister will have a good reason why it is not practicable to put this aspect in the bill <e> <s> i would however agree with the noble lord opposite <e> <s> if we are going to look long term i sincerely hope that we are towards seriously reducing the amount of pesticides used in the countryside then surely the quality of the soil will be all-important <e> <s> we must therefore look after it now <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply but i must confess that i am perhaps a little disappointed although i realise the difficulties involved <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned the ministrys good record and nobody could disagree with that <e> <s> my noble friend is aware of the strong feeling in this committee and has given his word that he intends to complete the task as quickly as possible <e> <s> in the circumstances that is probably all i can expect <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support what the noble lord lord melchett has just said <e> <s> in doing so i am technically speaking i suppose to amendment no <e> <s> to which i have put my name <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having answered the many questions that were put to him but i must confess that i am extremely disappointed by his response <e> <s> it is getting late and one does not want to analyse the situation any further <e> <s> however i must say that surely it is possible to distinguish between the testing data on pesticides without revealing the detailed compound breakdown of a particular chemical <e> <s> i simply cannot understand why this cannot be done <e> <s> the noble lord has given us assurances that the government will be asking further questions or at least that they will be in a position to ask further questions and therefore that more comprehensive answers will be available to the government <e> <s> but my response to that is will they be available to the general public <e> <s> i fear that from what the noble lord has said the answer is no <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to say how delighted i am that the minister has seen fit to incorporate this clause in the bill <e> <s> however having listened to previous amendments being discussed i feel that one has to ask oneself the question when should one be specific or not specific <e> <s> i spoke to my noble friend lord renton beforehand and he advised me and i am sure that he is right that an amendment such as this within an enabling bill should be as wide as possible <e> <s> but my noble friend the minister quite recently made the point that it would be appropriate for certain aspects of amendments to be tightened up <e> <s> so when it is right to be specific and when it is not right is something that i do not really know <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should briefly like to support what my noble friend has said <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord walston that pesticides are dangerous <e> <s> i also agree with what my noble friend lord onslow has said <e> <s> i cannot possibly imagine how this sort of legislation ever sensibly could be put into practice <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are to move forward in this direction there is certainly merit in it surely the way forward as has been done with straw burning is for a code of practice to be introduced through the nfu <e> <s> i do not know whether a code of practice on the spraying of pesticides exists <e> <s> i suggest to your lordships that if we are to move forward in this direction that is the way to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> this is a sensible amendment <e> <s> it is almost a natural conclusion to all this complicated legislation that your lordships have been discussing and enacting <e> <s> if we can have stated on a packet of cigarettes that smoking can dangerously affect your health there is no reason why we should not have a warning on a fungicide that it can seriously affect the health of insects <e> <s> it is a sensible amendment <e> <s> i support the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support my noble friend on these amendments <e> <s> in relation to amendment no <e> <s> it seems to me that your lordships having accepted the basic principle of an advisory committee it would be somewhat halfhearted not to give it the strength to operate in a fully and thoroughly comprehensive role <e> <s> this entails giving the committee the powers to approach and advise ministers as it sees fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my honourable friend robert jackson for introducing this bill into another place and my noble friend lord stanley for introducing it into your lordships house <e> <s> it is a short but significant bill and quite rightly as my noble friend says brings bracken and gorse and vaccinium under controls similar to those for heather and grass <e> <s> it is perhaps quite pertinent that the wording of the bill should use vaccinium in the latin form and bracken and grass in the english form <e> <s> i am surprised that both noble lords opposite have used the word blaeberry which is the word i use in yorkshire <e> <s> i am not quite sure what my noble friend lord stanley would use in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that one as well <e> <s> this is a simple piece of legislation and will i hope prevent some of the ill-effects which burning at the wrong time of the year can have on wildlife and the long-term damaging effects on the environment in general <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up a point which the noble lord lord melchett has just made in connection with the work done recently by the institute of terrestrial ecology <e> <s> he referred to the lack <e>", "<cs> with respect it was the noble lord who raised the question of predation of foxes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just expand on what my noble friend lord gibson-watt said <e> <s> i have a great deal of sympathy with some sort of appeal system but there is a further point to which i should like to draw the attention of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i too have the pleasure and i regard it as a pleasure of having a number of sssis on my land and i have received the usual letter from the local ncc officer <e> <s> i would suggest that one way to try to ease the public relations problems and i accept what the noble lord lord melchett said earlier about young ncc officers would be that it would be courteous if in the list of objectionable operations that we receive those which are quite obviously not going to apply to the landowner or farmer were deleted <e> <s> that would at least make us think that our case had perhaps been thought out a little more carefully <e> <s> i think it would help enormously <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord opposite and indeed every other noble lord who is concerned with this matter that i have no intention of pressing this amendment <e> <s> however i think it is a very good thing that we have had this debate particularly in view of the fact that when this bill went through another place discussions there were largely dominated by the subject of badgers <e> <s> i think it is right that marine life should have its share of attention and i am very grateful to all noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that even including my noble friend lord stanley who agreed to the clause in principle there was total support except for my noble friend lord radnor <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed <e> <s> i must confess i do not know very much about the habits of hen lobsters <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley talked about the use of yachts within marine nature reserves <e> <s> i am sure that would be acceptable unless perhaps anchors were dropped in vulnerable places <e> <s> i do not know whether that would cause problems but it is perhaps something that ought to be considered <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my support for the principle of my noble friends clause <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble baroness lady nicol asked the question as to whether there had been any cases in which grants had been refused on conservation grounds which presumably refers to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say what a great honour it is to follow the right reverend prelate the bishop of newcastle and how much i enjoyed his speech on a subject which obviously is very much to his heart in an area which is very close to his heart <e> <s> try as i could i suppose in view of the nature of the speech i found it impossible to establish which of the various categories of bishop he belongs to as described by sir humphrey the other day in yes minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that if british rail are not prepared to commit themselves to maintaining the structures of the viaduct and the government themselves are not prepared to do so they will actually allow them to crumble <e>", "<cs> i also should like to join with other noble lords in welcoming this bill <e> <s> i think that if any criticism is to be made it is that perhaps there is a shortage of detail but i exclude from that remark the schedule pertaining to milk quotas which i think goes rather the other way <e> <s> i do not wish to say anything about milk quotas <e> <s> i do not for a moment pretend to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what was said by my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> the position at the moment is such that the countryside commission has this responsibility and to try to bring it on to the ministry of agriculture at this stage would be misleading <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment i must say that i feel rather a turncoat because i make no bones about it i had every intention of speaking along the lines of my noble friends lord onslow and lord buxton <e> <s> however i have to say having listened to the arguments on both sides that i am not convinced by theirs <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord the minister whether in view of the particular hardships that occur in the less favoured areas he would consider a reduced charge for farmers in those places <e>", "<cs> i have witnessed two fairly unusual things this evening in moving this new clause <e> <s> first every person who spoke to it was behind me and supported it <e> <s> secondly i actually heard a farmer say that he was satisfied <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend on the front bench for what he has said though i was hoping that he might have gone a little further <e>", "<cs> i rise merely to say that much earlier the noble lord gave the statistic of million people who walk through the countryside <e> <s> he cited exactly five or six cases and i hardly think that statistically five or six out of million people are a reason to change legislation <e>", "<cs> surely the whole idea as my noble friend on the front bench has said is to try to get a balance on this matter <e> <s> farmers are not going to be farming primarily for conservation reasons <e> <s> they are going to be farming in a way which is going to be sensitive to the environment <e> <s> to call it conservation farming would imply that the farmer is simply farming for conservation reasons and conservation reasons only <e> <s> that surely is not the purpose of this exercise <e>", "<cs> but we put public money into farming anyway <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment of my noble friend i think it would be appropriate for me to speak at the same time to my own amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think i should point out that there is a basic difference between the two amendments <e> <s> in the case of my noble friends amendment it would appear to me that when an esa designation is made it will be the responsibility of the ministry to inform all landowners or indeed the freehold owners as he refers to them <e> <s> in my amendment it would only be obligatory on the ministry to inform the landlord if an agreement were to proceed with one of his tenants <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i think i can speak for my noble friend lord radnor in saying that we are not happy about this <e> <s> we feel that there ought to be an obligation on the minister to inform the landlord <e> <s> i am not going to say any more on that now <e> <s> we shall return to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just reply to what the noble lord has said about open moorland <e> <s> i take his point but i think it is fair to say that as things stand at the moment with regard to moor-owners and the general public the relationship is extremely good <e> <s> what concerns me and many other moorland owners is that if the pressure is to increase and of course we have at the moment the common land forum which many noble lords will know about and if we were to get access to common land i think the problems would intensify greatly <e> <s> of course that is a different matter but as things stand at the moment they work well <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships and in particular to my noble friend lord sandford for having somewhat jumped the gun <e> <s> i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with what has been said by noble lords opposite <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett mentioned some cases where there had nearly been fatal accidents <e> <s> in the north of england and in the yorkshire dales national park i have been inundated with letters from small farmers who would be seriously inconvenienced if this proposal became law <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hunt talked about such conservation orders being extended outside of national parks <e> <s> i agree with him <e> <s> but i should just like to make one point <e> <s> everybody seems to think that things are totally protected in national parks <e> <s> yes of course we have the prior approval situation but farmers can go ahead without grants <e> <s> this point is very often forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment would in fact result in every landlord having to be informed by the ministry because it would concern only those tenants who were to be involved with agreements <e> <s> i am encouraged by what my noble friend has said <e> <s> on the basis of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard some fairly extreme views expressed already by noble lords <e> <s> i should like to take the middle line and give the bill a guarded welcome <e> <s> i certainly appreciate the need for such a bill but as my noble friend mentioned in his opening remarks we must try to achieve a balance between the protection of the general public and the legitimate firearms user <e> <s> however it is certain that the bill as drafted at present is a lot better than it was when it first started out <e> <s> i hope that noble lords can make it an even better bill along the lines that my noble friend lord swinton has just proposed <e> <s> apart <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support what my noble friend lord wynford said in what can only be described as a persuasive and moving speech <e> <s> your lordships house has undoubtedly a first-class reputation as regards the way the disabled have been treated recently and i hope that this case will be no exception <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment is unnecessary and restrictive <e> <s> under the bill the conditions imposed on the chief officer of police when assessing the suitability of an applicant should be sufficient in deciding whether a person should hold a shotgun <e> <s> to pose a restriction on the number of shotguns held is going a little too far down the line <e> <s> we have not yet had an opportunity of debating the question of safety but i hope that the committee will do so when i move the next amendment <e> <s> presumably when the chief officer of police sees the number of guns owned by an individual he will assess his suitability according to the safety covering those guns <e>", "<cs> i take heart to a degree from what my noble friend said <e> <s> clearly i am delighted to hear that <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the memorandum of guidance is to be published and everyone will welcome my noble friends statement on that point <e> <s> it is not enforceable as i understand it so i fear it means that no matter how clear are the instructions <e>", "<cs> i also support my noble friend on this <e> <s> i was encouraged when my noble friend on the front bench said that he had no intention of limiting the number of shotguns on a certificate <e> <s> we must bear in mind that as the law stands at the moment technically no such limitation exists yet it is my information that certain chief officers of police are in fact limiting the number of guns that an applicant may have on his licence <e> <s> therefore bearing that in mind i believe that this amendment is particularly worthy of support <e>", "<cs> my information is that anything written into the code of guidance would not be binding under statute <e>", "<cs> i was in fact referring to all visitors and not just those from america <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what noble lords have said <e> <s> i must say that i received the answer i expected from my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i was most grateful to the noble lords lord john-mackie lord brain and lord northesk for at least supporting in principle what i said <e>", "<cs> has the noble lord lord harris any evidence at all to show that visitors coming into this country have ever been involved in crimes involving shotguns <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has stated that the police would like to see controls of shotguns for foreign visitors the buying of shotguns by foreign visitors <e> <s> i come back to the point that i am not expecting the noble lord to cite endless cases in this matter but perhaps he will be good enough to mention just one specific case in which a visitor has been involved in such a crime using such a weapon <e>", "<cs> but <e>", "<cs> i accept that we are strengthening the law in this matter but i thought that the whole purpose behind the bill was simply to strengthen the law when it was necessary to do so <e> <s> in this case there is no evidence whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i explained at the beginning of the debate that i had attempted to have the amendment changed through the public bill office and that i was speaking in relation to great britain <e>", "<cs> i think i am right in saying that my impression and perhaps my noble friends will confirm it is that i stated clearly at the beginning of the discussion that i wished to substitute the words united kingdom for great britain <e> <s> that is the amendment to which we are speaking <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord john-mackie <e>", "<cs> we have had an extended discussion on this amendment <e> <s> i repeat what said when i attempted to wind up on it before namely i am disappointed with what my noble friend on the front bench has said <e> <s> the discussion has gone far enough and i have no option but to divide the committee <e>", "<cs> no i am moving the amendment with the words great britain substituted for the words united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends response <e> <s> that clarifies the point and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> since my noble friend has said that he will consider the matter i think that is a very satisfactory answer and i am grateful to him for it <e> <s> as a result i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we must come to terms with this matter <e> <s> i think the only way we can do so is by putting a statutory limit on it <e> <s> my noble friend has talked about the additional administrative problems as regards the chief constable <e> <s> but of course we are not talking about that many people in the context of the overall responsibilities of the police <e> <s> we are talking in terms of a great deal of money as regards individuals but that is a different matter <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend on the front bench regards as being a sensible number of hours <e> <s> before we can resolve the matter the committee must have more information <e> <s> i therefore put that question to him <e>", "<cs> i would be worried about such people as well <e> <s> however the point is surely that it will not make much difference in terms of nationality whether someone is coming in hours or in three weeks <e> <s> the police will never be able to check up in any case and it will not make a great deal of difference <e> <s> i believe that the applicant in this country takes the responsibility <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends remarks <e> <s> perhaps i may come back to the noble lord lord harris and say that of course one can never have a guarantee against criminals coming to this country <e> <s> i repeat yet again that there is no record to date of people coming to shoot in this country who have behaved in an illegal fashion or whose arms have been used for illegal purposes <e> <s> i know that we have pursued this matter a great deal but it is an argument that has been used and one which i believe is wrong in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord swinton <e> <s> sport and recreation constitute the greatest use of firearms in the country <e> <s> as i said on second reading it is all very well to have on the committee people who understand the technical side of weaponry but there must also be people who appreciate how it will be used in practice on the field <e> <s> the inclusion of the words proposed would strengthen the committee enormously <e>", "<cs> i received the answer that i expected from my noble friend <e> <s> i still make the point that i believe it is very important that there are experts on each force to deal with these matters <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will take that point on board particularly when the guidance memorandum is circulated <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord nelson referred to how the disabled would feel about being used as an argument for an amendment which they did not desire <e> <s> the simple answer to that question is that if he does not agree with the amendment a disabled person need not apply for such a weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is incorrect it is predator <e>", "<cs> my lords i am slightly confused because i thought we were speaking to amendment no <e> <s> but much reference has been made to amendment no <e> <s> tabled in the name of my noble friend <e> <s> am i out of order in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wish to say that i support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in fact it was my noble friend lord swinton who moved the amendment in committee <e> <s> incidentally he sends his apologies for not being here today but he has to attend a meeting in the north of england <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise the matter of compensation <e> <s> that worries me somewhat <e> <s> it appears that the individual who has had his licence revoked must to all intents and purposes negotiate with the police about the fate of his weapon <e> <s> if no agreement can be reached it is up to the chief officer what happens to the weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my noble friend to give way <e> <s> what guarantee can my noble friend give that the owner will receive the proper selling price <e> <s> unless the sale is conducted through a registered dealer i do not see how that is possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady lady saltoun has demonstrated the practical problems before us in connection with this series of amendments <e> <s> i should like to join my noble friend lord kimball in thanking the noble earl lord ferrers for having come forward with the amendment <e> <s> it is a most useful one <e> <s> however i take issue with my noble friend lord kimball on his suggestion about under- year-olds i think that is what he said applying for permits <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord monson and the noble lady lady saltoun that that is unlikely to be practical <e> <s> i am sure we would see a resistance to it especially from chief officers of police if it were to happen <e> <s> further i think it would be a waste of police time if children under the age of were to apply for such permits <e>", "<cs> my lords the new clause seeks to permit a person over the age of to borrow an estate rifle without himself owning a firearms permit <e> <s> if that is the case it seems to me quite ridiculous that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> so many people have entered into this in good faith that i find it hard to believe that the government are not ready to pay compensation to the full amount <e> <s> there is a real danger that if proper compensation is not paid for such weapons they will go so to speak <e> <s> underground and the government will fail to achieve one of their main purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i know how much thought and consideration he has put into this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a long and interesting debate which as i suspected turned partially into a constitutional matter <e> <s> when i saw my noble and learned friend lord hailsham sitting in front of me i thought that it would <e> <s> on this occasion the noble lord lord mishcon came to my rescue <e> <s> i echo his words what is all the fuss about <e> <s> we have been skirmishing around what is in principle a straightforward and easy matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment <e> <s> there has been a degree of confusion certainly among noble lords involved with this bill <e> <s> we were very much under the impression that when the estate rifle clause which most of us welcomed in principle was introduced by my noble friend on report it was for all age groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay tribute to the way in which my noble friend has dealt with the bill not only on the floor of the house but also in a private capacity <e> <s> he has made himself available for discussion at any time of the day and i am extremely grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully accepting the principle of the hlca payments as laid out by my noble friend for the purpose principally of <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down he said earlier that he regarded air pollution as one of the reasons for the disappearance of heather <e> <s> i think that this is perhaps a rather far-fetched argument <e> <s> to my knowledge there is no evidence to substantiate it <e> <s> from what i have seen it is certainly not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord moran for having tabled this question <e> <s> i congratulate him on the elegant and comprehensive way in which he described the grave problem that we are discussing this evening <e> <s> i should start by declaring a double interest <e> <s> first i am a member of the nature conservancy council and secondly i have recently become president of the yorkshire wildlife trust <e> <s> i should add that i was not in any way involved in the situation when the photographer has his troubles on thome and hatfield mosses <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it it is quite clear that under the act the secretary of state for the environment has the power to intervene and stop if he so wishes <e> <s> this may require some degree of compulsory powers but i believe that the secretary of state has those powers and could use them if he so wished <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by apologising to the house if i have to leave early <e> <s> i am due in yorkshire tonight for a dinner and i apologise to my noble friends on the front bench if i am not present to hear what they have to say on the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to become involved in devolution arguments <e> <s> it seems to me that the government are attempting to sort out for all of great britain the most effective and efficient way of <e>", "<cs> i am aware of the point <e> <s> the bird species in that part of the world require large areas a fact established by the nature conservancy council on many occasions <e> <s> i do not wish to get involved in a detailed debate with the noble lord <e> <s> i simply make the point <e>", "<cs> i think it is worth pointing out that the area designated to sssis is a meagre per cent <e> <s> i do not think that that is an overlarge area of land for specialised nature conservation <e>", "<cs> with regard to amendment no <e> <s> a whereas i appreciate that that applies to gb matters and therefore is the responsibility of the joint committee the implementation of the responsibilities as laid out in amendment no <e> <s> a will inevitably affect the country councils <e> <s> that is fine as regards wales where we shall see an amalgamation of the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> in scotland that will happen <e> <s> however in england that is not proposed at this stage <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment may well put responsibilities on the nature conservancy council in england which are presently those of the countryside commission <e> <s> that may lead to confusion <e> <s> i should be interested to hear the comments of the noble lord lord chorley on that point <e>", "<cs> the countryside commission may well accept that <e> <s> however i am wearing my nature conservancy council hat <e> <s> i should be worried if at this stage new responsibilities with which we were not able to cope were foisted upon us <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the responsibilities of the joint committee would inevitably seep down to the various country councils <e> <s> i do not believe that that can be avoided <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord lord hunt said about these being sensitive issues <e> <s> he put his finger on the main point <e> <s> however bearing in mind the activities that will be represented by the sports council it seems logical to counteract that aspect if i may put it that way that we should also have representatives from the owners side <e> <s> they must put up with a great deal of increased pressure much of it perfectly justifiable but there is the other side <e> <s> if you insist that the sports council <e>", "<cs> in addition to the question of the overall financial sums available there is another point which may have been answered and if it <e>", "<cs> as a matter of interest is it possible to enhance natural beauty <e> <s> is it not finite <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to appear pedantic but there is a rather important point that i should like to put to the noble lord regarding the amendment <e> <s> it concerns the comma that comes after the word buildings <e> <s> its presence could cause it to be construed that the adjective unlawful refers only to buildings and does not refer to fences and other works <e> <s> if that is the case it would imply that any fence or any work could be dealt with through the commission of the council applying to the county <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to say that i have a great deal of concern for what the noble and gallant lord lord carver said on this matter <e> <s> i am very much of the opinion that the country councils should develop their relationship with the joint committee as freely as possible <e> <s> but there will undoubtedly have to be standards which must be adhered to <e> <s> particularly in the case of sites of special scientific interest that is of fundamental concern to the way that nature conservation is to be run in this country <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> as regards covering those with common rights there is no doubt that much damage has been caused to sssis in this respect <e> <s> the committee will no doubt recall a recent list of damaged sssis <e> <s> i believe that list was released by friends of the earth <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the damage to the majority of those sites originated on common land where the nature conservancy council was unable to enter into management agreements with those who held common rights <e> <s> therefore i most definitely welcome this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment in principle <e> <s> however it is possible that a farmer may change his farming activities in order to comply with the recommendations of the original sssi <e> <s> if for whatever reason the ncc deems the site not worthy of such a designation the farmer may not receive compensation and the land will not provide a return <e> <s> that situation would be unfair on the farmer <e>", "<cs> i accept that statement but it may take some time for the farmer to return to a profitable system <e> <s> i wondered whether it would be possible to include in the amendment some form of compensation to lighten those circumstances <e>", "<cs> i go along with what my noble friend has said on this amendment <e> <s> the act successful though it has been in regard to land conservation through the voluntary system has meant a raw deal for marine conservation <e> <s> anything we can do to try to improve matters must be welcomed <e> <s> as my noble friend said only two reserves have so far been agreed <e> <s> it has taken an inordinate amount of time to have those agreed <e> <s> i hope that we can speed up matters and i welcome anything that can help <e>", "<cs> i need hardly say that i am extremely disappointed with the response which my noble friend has given me although i must express my gratitude to those noble lords from all sides of the committee who supported the amendment <e> <s> in response to the noble duke the duke of somerset i would say yes <e> <s> as i understand it the relevant authorities would include the countryside commission and the nature conservancy council and in fact any authority on which the secretary of state wished to confer that power <e>", "<cs> one of the problems is that the national parks authorities although they have the power for some reason which i do not understand do not seem to exercise it <e> <s> that is one of the real problems <e> <s> that is why there is the habitat loss occurring to such an extent within the national parks a point which i made earlier <e> <s> habitat loss is as great within parks as it is outside them because that power is not being exercised at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment of the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> however i am slightly confused <e> <s> if one imposes countryside responsibilities on the joint committee that is fine so far as concerns scotland and wales where the countryside commission and nature conservancy council are joint bodies <e> <s> but in england they will remain separate bodies <e> <s> it appears to me i wear my ncc hat now and i made the point at committee that we may find ourselves in a degree of confusion <e> <s> we might have countryside responsibilities foisted upon us that we are not capable of dealing with <e> <s> the amendment of my noble friend lord swinton appears to me to eminently sensible <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i should like to make a point <e> <s> i am a member of the moorland association <e> <s> i do not wish to go into details now about the discussions that took place but i should like to make it clear that the moorland association is in favour of legislation <e> <s> it realises the fact that legislation needs to be enacted to safeguard common land <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a great deal of sympathy for what my noble friend lord jenkin said <e> <s> he illustrated the need to act but i am not sure that this is necessarily the right amendment to achieve the objective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to all noble lords who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain whether my noble friend lord campbell of croy is in favour of the amendment or not <e> <s> however i very much enjoyed listening to his opinions <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> if it means strengthening the powers of the nature conservancy council to avoid more designations of national parks i shall be only too delighted <e> <s> my noble friend also mentioned lurchers gully <e> <s> wearing my nature conservancy cap i was delighted at the outcome of that particular decision by the minister <e> <s> my noble friend lord cranbrook supported me as i expected him to do <e> <s> he was absolutely right when he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for answering my question <e> <s> i was not referring to profits forgone <e> <s> i was asking about the period of time over which my noble friend felt that grants could be given <e> <s> she has answered that question comprehensively <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i am not as happy as i should like to be but i realise the governments predicament <e> <s> as a result i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it as regards sssis the ncc can only respond to activities which would actually damage the pdo list <e> <s> however this is a matter into which i should like to look more carefully <e> <s> in my view it is most important that we should try to encourage the ncc to enter into positive management agreements on sssis <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is insinuating that she thinks that the council already has the right to do so <e> <s> however as i said i should like to look again at the matter but i reserve the right to return to it at a later stage of the bills proceedings <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for her response and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in a sense this goes back as the noble duke said to the answer given by my noble friend as regards my amendment <e> <s> the noble duke raises an interesting point <e> <s> if the periodic grants are to be effective they will have to be equal or equal plus to the amount that the farmer would have received as i believe the noble lord lord mackie of benshie suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the most reverend primate and my noble friend lord prior for producing their report and also my noble friend lord middleton and all the members of the select committee for producing such a comprehensive and enlightening report <e> <s> it has been said i must say that i agree that it is a pity that the two reports are being discussed together <e> <s> since they are being so discussed perhaps i may suggest that a better term for the debate would be the future of rural society and do we have faith in the countryside <e> <s> that may be one of the major points with which we shall have to come to terms over the next decade or so <e>"]
