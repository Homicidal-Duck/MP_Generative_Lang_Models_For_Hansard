interest and concern for the corporation but i do not speak on its behalf <e> <s> in view of the crossroad presently facing british telecom i find the interest and affection built up over those years manifesting themselves more plainly than ever before <e> <s> i must make it clear that the affection i feel is not that bred of familiarity but that which grows from pride pride not only as an ex-member of the organisation but as a member of the british public <e> <s> i can think of no other public corporation which so directly affects almost every british man woman and child whether or not they are aware of it <e> <s> we should all take a pride in the success of the business for it belongs to all of us <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> nothing has yet been said about the tremendous complexity of the telecommunications industry <e> <s> it covers almost every single aspect of our lives and it will take a superman to be able to cope with it all <e> <s> this man will need somebody whom he can use as a sounding block if not as a statutory adviser <e> <s> if he were on his own i should not give him long before he had a nervous breakdown <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cockfield said that consumers would have recourse to the courts <e> <s> at present if consumers have a complaint against british telecom they can write to the council of post office unions to their mps to the general manager of the telephone area concerned or to the director of the region concerned and in every case when such a letter is received it is

order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply to my question <e> <s> may i ask him whether or not it is possible for a person or a group of people with fewer scruples than the recent pirates to use the same process to broadcast films of an unpleasant nature or for the purposes of political indoctrination and whether it is possible for the broadcasting authorities to prevent such pirate broadcasts <e>", "<cs> i am concerned that in this discussion we do not seem to have made much distinction between the telephone service and the telecommunications services <e> <s> we seem to have been talking just about the telephone service <e> <s> in rural communities there are farmers who need to have special data-communication links perhaps to measure milk and butter fats for feeding their cattle and that sort of thing <e> <s> another thing that comes to mind is water boards who use telephony circuits for measuring the level of dams which can be extremely remote <e>", "<cs> it is quite interesting that the following amendment is to provide free directories to all subscribers <e> <s> i think if this amendment were not agreed to everyone would want all the directories <e> <s> directory inquiries do generate their own calls people ring the directory inquiry number and then they ring someone else and are charged for the call <e> <s> the noble baroness lady lane-fox has already mentioned the disabled and people with difficulties <e> <s> there are an awful lot of people who cannot read and people who cannot retain numbers and they find directory inquiries very helpful <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the licence will give british telecom the power to charge if it wishes for its directory inquiries service <e> <s> can he tell me whether there has been a survey on the practicality of deciding who is sufficiently blind not to be able to read a directory who is dyslexic and what the cost would be of either certifying them so that they get their calls free in the first place or giving them a refund as opposed to having the directory inquiry service free as it is at present <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord kindly answer the questions i asked about the practicality and the cost of reimbursing <e>", "<cs> does not the whole of the bill make the poor director and the secretary of state push and pull <e>", "<cs> i disagree with the amendment <e> <s> i think this is already quite clear in clause <e>", "<cs> while i have every sympathy with the noble lords who have put forward the amendment and i am very much for small businesses i think that perhaps their fear of big brother british telecom is a little dwarfed by what should be their real fear namely competition from abroad <e> <s> we have at t sitting on the doorstep and the japanese market sitting on the doorstep <e> <s> unless we have a relatively strong british telecom there will he no room for small businesses or for that matter british telecom <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can help the committee a little <e> <s> in my days in british telecom we had to be careful about providing new kiosks <e> <s> before we put in a new one we had to be fairly sure that it would pay its way but we very rarely took out an old one even if it was in an extremely remote rural community <e> <s> i think that we used to leave them even when they were taking only a year <e> <s> there was one instance when an irishman tried to raid the cash box and found that there was only fourpence in it <e> <s> so we took that one away but it was the only one that was taken away during my seven years <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the motion <e> <s> i have been seriously concerned all the way along that there has been no mention at all of the staff or employees of british telecom or of any of the other people involved in the industry <e> <s> even before i left there were rumours flying around that people might have to lose their jobs that people might have to lose their jobs or that people might have to lose their jobs <e> <s> i understand that the staff still do not know what the position is and are extremely unhappy about it <e> <s> there has been a very big reorganisation in the regions in particular and nobody knows quite whether they are coming or going <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the industry at present has an excellent record for training and for the care of its employees as regards the promotion of safety and so on <e> <s> in fact people come from all over the world to british telecom to go through their training programmes and to learn <e> <s> i am sure that this happens with other manufacturers in the industry as well <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak very strongly against this amendment because if these provisions were struck out of the bill it would provide what is called a by-passers charter <e> <s> people could have unlicensed point-to-point circuits which means a company in glasgow could have a circuit operating from its head office in glasgow to somewhere in london <e> <s> someone could make a local call in glasgow be connected to the london office and then be reconnected into the network <e> <s> british telecommunications at present relies for one-third of its revenue from big customers which are likely to have point-to-point circuits <e> <s> it would be disastrous for the revenue base of british telecommunications if this was carried through and not only disastrous for them but also for all the other customers in the country <e>", "<cs> i find myself increasingly amazed as we go on through this bill particulary at the financing of the new set-up which is airy-fairy <e> <s> would it not have been better for the government to have put their policies on a solid basis before they presented the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord could possibly clear up one small point <e> <s> at present british telecom manufactures small quantities of aids for the disabled <e> <s> obviously if these were put out to tender they would just fall flat because nobody would want to know about them <e> <s> will british telecom still be allowed to go on manufacturing these aids <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak against this amendment for i suggest that it is totally impracticable <e> <s> for every telephone area there are at least four people dealing with number allocation <e> <s> it is a very complex business <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone does not realise perhaps understandably that certain numbers are allocated in blocks because of the type of equipment used <e> <s> there are special relay sets for big business users and their numbers come in blocks and they cannot be split up <e> <s> business users are allocated a certain group of numbers to allow them to grow <e> <s> the other problem with number allocation is that one quite often has a number that cannot be used perhaps because it is a recently-ceased business number <e> <s> it would not be good business practice to issue that number again to someone who is in business and who may be in competition with the person who had that number before <e>", "<cs> giving this duty to the director of oftel who would have a staff of would <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for answering my worries so succinctly <e> <s> it really was a probing amendment <e> <s> i think he has covered everything and i wish to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a very great deal of sympathy understandably for this amendment <e> <s> right the way through the committee stage i have made my position very clear <e> <s> one point about which i am very concerned is that the negotiating procedures appear to have broken down a little between british telecom and their employees <e> <s> i am anxious that this should not be carried into the new private business <e> <s> in april british telecom unilaterally abrogated after due notice the agreement under which either they or the unions could institute mandatory arbitration which has been the main mechanism by which the unions have sought to resolve disputes over many years <e> <s> recently they have also sought to deny the mechanism by which disputes could be escalated to high levels within the organisation for resolution <e> <s> no disputes procedure is now incorporated and the unions which have traditionally sought to resolve their disputes by peaceful means are finding that their only defence now is industrial action <e> <s> i am very concerned that it <e>", "<cs> can the noble and learned lord the lord advocate explain to us why everything is being rushed through with so much haste <e> <s> why is there not time to prepare a proper prospectus and put it out <e> <s> are the government so much in need of the money <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start my speech may i offer my congratulations to baroness seear <e> <s> we are delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree with the noble lords lord bruce of donington and lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i do not think that lord cockfields amendment goes anywhere near far enough to protect rural customers <e> <s> we must remember that rural industries and people living in the country are just as valuable to our society and to our business well-being in this world as people who live in towns and cities <e> <s> to discriminate against them because they happen to live in the country perhaps they are producing food perhaps they have a small factory in a rural area providing work for people who live in the country is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i must heartily support this amendment from a purely practical point of view <e> <s> at the committee stage i asked the noble lord lord lyell how much it would cost to find out who was blind who was dyslexic and who was disabled <e> <s> it would involve people going to visit <e> <s> i know that the rnib have certified blind people in their association but nobody certifies someone who is dyslexic and nobody certifies someone who is disabled and cannot turn the pages of a telephone directory <e> <s> it would involve a huge visiting staff to decide that they could not cope with an ordinary telephone directory and it would be unfair to penalise them because they could not do so by charging them for the service <e> <s> it might amuse the noble lord lord peyton if i say that when had one of my first interviews with british telecom i was asked what were my thoughts on charging for directory inquiries and i gave exactly the same reasons as i am giving now <e> <s> the sheer cost of administering the refund of charges to people who are unable to use telephone directories would be too immense <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i agree with the amendment of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i was talking to one of my ex-colleagues only the other day and he described to me the exodus from british telecom as rats deserting a sinking ship <e> <s> there are young men of to years who are taking early redundancy <e> <s> they had hoped nine or years ago to make a lifetimes career in british telecom <e> <s> i think that noble lords in the government will find that a great many men and women have spent a lifetime working for the post office and for british telecom <e> <s> the uncertainty that is pervading not only british telecom but the industry generally with the lack of a definitive statement from the government about the employment prospects of the employees in the industry is causing a great deal of concern <e> <s> i hope that noble lords in the government will accept this amendment in the spirit in which it is intended <e> <s> the government say that they care for people <e> <s> please let us see that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there are a great many people who appreciate the value of the national health service and the drugs that are prescribed for them <e> <s> for example i am on drugs which cost for each tablet <e> <s> my doctor made me aware of the cost i asked him whether there was any alternative and he said no <e> <s> i need these tablets and i very much appreciate the help that is given to me by the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords when is the unemployment situation going to improve this year next year some time when the world economy picks up or when the government inject massive sums of borrowed money into public projects <e> <s> all the indications are that never again will we see the unemployment statistics of the two post-world war decades <e> <s> the circumstances which brought about a general return to work in the late s are totally different from those which exist today and it is futile to suggest that the solutions which worked then will work again <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that it is not only strikers who suffer and that a married woman who gives up her employment and states specifically to the inland revenue that she has no intention of returning to work may have to wait up to months for an income tax rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much indeed for that response <e> <s> can he say how much was spent by the forestry commission and the institute of terrestrial ecology and other government funded bodies on research into grey squirrel control for the same period <e> <s> can he also say whether he considers in view of the probability that a great many of these trees that have been planted will be eaten by grey squirrels within the next nine or years that it would be a good idea if the government were to alter their priorities and did not pay grants until there was some successful method of controlling grey squirrels <e>", "<cs> order eight minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady lockwood has brought to our attention in this debate a subject in which i have a direct interest and i am most grateful to her <e> <s>

pedestrian but as a cyclist or perhaps i should say as the steam power on the back end of a tandem <e> <s> the other day when i was walking in kidderminster a young man was riding his bicycle along

one has a footpath and a cycle path adjacent to each other and without any division there are dangers of some very nasty accidents arising <e> <s> i hope the government will give this amendment careful consideration <e>", "<cs> i would like to support these members for two very good reasons <e> <s> first of all we have had a great drama about the spending of the glc <e> <s> what about

circumstances feel that they are left out of society because nobody is helping them <e> <s> again from what i can see the glc and the local borough councils are supporting these groups <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that schools are not the only environment where children receive their education and that if parents are not entirely happy about the balance of education that their children receive it is up to them to talk with their children and to convince them otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the house agrees this motion may i say a few words <e> <s> i have listened with <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to many of the debates which have taken place in your lordships house during the passage of this bill <e> <s> i have wrestled with my

to concern shown by dispensing doctors following the dhss letter of th november <e> <s> what response will the department make to the attack on these doctors by the pharmaceutical society at a public meeting on th february <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady jeger for introducing this subject <e> <s> the frequency with which our anxieties about the national health service and our social security system are expressed in your lordships house in the other place in the media and by individuals must surely be a clear indication to the government that despite their optimism their policies are not meeting the needs of large sections of our population <e> <s> it is all very well to preach the doctrine of hard work and thrift to those who have well-paid jobs

prescriptions in is coming from <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give examples of doctors who prescribe flora margarine and nivea face cream <e>", "<cs> my lords are doctors really prescribing

thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that the problem caused with the closure of beds i shall not say cuts because the minister does not like the word is that the consultants are no longer able to use their clinical knowledge when deciding whether or not a patient should be admitted to hospital <e> <s> is he aware that patients are suffering because they cannot have a guaranteed bed when they need it in an emergency in particular for intensive care <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the general population in this country must be coming round to realising that national health service facilities have to be rationed <e> <s> would it not be a good idea if the government opened to public debate clear guidelines of some kind for who should and who should not be treated and for how long they should be treated <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the foundations for coronary heart disease are laid at a very early stage in life <e> <s> will the minister say what advice is being given to parents and young people for avoiding heart disease later in life <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer which does not unduly surprise me <e> <s> did the noble lord read the second leader in <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> for a number of years i worked in a busy casualty department of a scottish hospital attended by a gp there was no permanent doctor <e> <s> the sister and staff nurse frequently decided on rather than prescribed the treatment to give to a patient <e> <s> the amendment would bring community nurses on to a level with sisters in the same kind of situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that because management guidelines for clinical regrading are unclear and that in certain cases it is now apparent that some health authorities have not been allocated sufficient funds many nurses are being under-graded <e> <s> does that not defeat the object of the exercise <e>", "<cs> i have listened most carefully to the debate <e> <s> there are two points i should like to raise with the minister <e> <s> first i have not understood why the government object to a simple majority in favour of changing a situation <e> <s> if we draw an analogy with the argument of the noble lord lord harmarnicholls when he said that the opposition benches were arguing on the basis of a general election can he say what board of directors would throw the chairman off the board on the number of dont know votes including them with the yes votes if that happened to produce a majority <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this problem exists not only in the hospital sector but also in the primary care sector <e> <s> gps have agreed a scale with their practice nurses and family practitioners are not agreeing to it <e> <s> can he say what instructions have been given to family practitioners about practice nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the valuable work carried out by the citizens advice bureaux and money advice centres in urban areas <e> <s> can he state her majestys governments policy towards such centres when the section funding ceases with the poll tax and the new funding comes into force <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may follow on from the noble viscount lord craigavon and ask whether the import of hiv testing kits will be made prohibitive that is the import by post or other such methods <e> <s> further what sort of publicity will be given about the dangers of using such kits <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i asked what message would be given to the public about using these kits <e> <s> they might as the noble viscount lord craigavon suggested get hold of kits from abroad in which case they will have no government health warning so to speak on them <e> <s> are there any proposals to have campaigns in magazines or that type of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> perhaps he will forgive me if i am wrong in assuming that the introduction of income support in replacement for social security benefits was supposed to make the system simpler to operate <e> <s> can he explain why there are more than different ways of calculating income support for people going into respite care <e> <s> can he give some hope to these people who already suffer terrible hardship and complexity in their lives that there will be some changes in the rules regarding benefit weeks and the days on which they are paid for their hostel charges <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that the roundabouts and swings happen to concern individual people and that <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may thank the noble earl for that slightly encouraging reply <e> <s> we have now been waiting nearly years for a comprehensive community care policy from this government <e> <s> will the noble earl say whether or not they accept all that is in the griffiths report how much communication there will be between the department of health the department of social security and the department of the environment all of which are involved in producing a new policy <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to a previous question the noble earl said that there was no reason why the health authorities should not press ahead with plans to put people into the community <e> <s> if that is the case will he please tell the department of social security and the department of the environment that they must co-ordinate their policies because people are being discharged into the community and the department of social security is refusing to pay for them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister bear in mind that per cent <e> <s> of the national health service acute hospital resources is used by between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of the population that is the over s <e> <s> does he care to comment upon public statements which have been made in the west midlands area by general practitioners who say that they are not referring patients except elderly emergency patients for consultations in hospitals because of the anxiety caused by the length of time that they have to wait <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the conditions under which nurses work are almost of equal importance as their salaries and that many of the failings are the result of their feelings that management does not care about them <e> <s> they rarely see management on the wards <e> <s> they have the impression that it does not know what they are doing <e> <s> that feeling was further reinforced during the summer when questions were being asked and dhss officials said that they had to visit a hospital before they could assess what sisters were doing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask a question for clarification <e> <s> he said that people who at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister and also to noble lords who have taken part in this valuable debate <e> <s> the noble lord thought that i thought that he set out to clobber the disabled <e> <s> i did not so i should like to disabuse him of that thought <e> <s> i cannot understand why he found it so difficult to identify the people about whom we are talking tonight <e> <s> they will all be receiving a higher rate of income support in their housing element and should be easily identified <e> <s> he spoke about transitional protection <e> <s> as the noble lord lord banks said this gives no cover to new entrants to the supported landlady scheme <e> <s> i am still puzzled about what will happen to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i was once a nursing auxiliary in a casualty department and i did jobs that were way beyond the training which i had received <e> <s> i am sure that still persists today <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the problems of being one of the last speakers in the debate is that many noble lords will already have said what i plan to say <e> <s> however i make no apologies for repeating gratitude to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for enabling us to debate this report today <e> <s> it encompasses matters to which i attach a great deal of importance <e> <s> the report highlights two major problems both of which have seriously affected the efficacy of the governments care in the community policy and it would appear the policies of other countries within the european community <e> <s> one is communication the other is funding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however i wonder for <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that local authorities will be expected to pay the care element of housing costs for those in supported lodgings when the changeover takes place from income support to housing benefit <e> <s> if local authorities are to provide for that care element can he say whether they will receive extra funding for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered my question <e> <s> there is to be a change from income support to housing benefit for people in supported lodgings <e> <s> if the local authority is expected to pick up the tab for the care element instead of the dss will the local authority receive additional funds for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> she speaks with so much knowledge of and sympathy for her subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord lord carter for bringing our attention to the predicament in which the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped who are discharged from long-stay institutions into the so-called care of the community find themselves <e> <s> the minister is well aware that their problems have been of concern to me for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that the noble lord has given indicate that a great many people are still waiting to have their claims processed <e> <s> what liaison is there between the income support officers and the housing benefit officers <e> <s> i know of a deaf and dumb man working in a sheltered workshop who has been waiting weeks to have his family credit processed <e> <s> in the meantime the housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister appreciate the fact that the problem is not confined to greater london <e> <s> may i suggest that if ever he is invited to redditch in worcestershire he avoids the town because i believe that many people become trapped there and try to find their way out after having found their way into the town centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> on tuesday he made quite clear that the take-up of family credit was not as high as the government would like it to be <e> <s> does he not agree that as well as improving the form which the noble baroness lady jeger clearly pointed out was poorly drafted there is also a need to overcome the concept that while child benefit is paid to the mother for the children in all families with no discrimination family credit tends to put a stigma on the poor and is really only a subsidy to employers for paying low wages <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the old-fashioned apprenticeships in the construction industry have fallen by the wayside and why the construction industry now expects the government to train their employees for them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that a great deal of ill will has been generated by both sides mainly because the definitions in the initial instructions were not clear <e> <s> i refer in particular to the word supervision <e> <s> would it not be a good idea now for both sides calmly to deal with any appeals as fairly as possible and as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord appreciate that as well as causing deafness the drills cause a nasty ailment called white finger where the fingers go numb <e> <s> is anything being done to limit the hours of work for people who operate these drills so that their circulation can recover <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that very helpful answer <e> <s> is he aware that in addition to the fact that certain sections have not been implemented there is a problem with the funding of sections that have already been brought into force <e> <s> for example hereford and worcester county councils treasurer has refused to identify the countys portion of the million for implementing sections and and therefore no allocation has been made to the social services committee <e> <s> what would he say to the parents of a disabled child in hereford and worcester who know that the social services committee has deferred the implementation of sections and <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow on from my question about hereford and worcester is there any way in which the money allocated to local authorities can be separately identified so that when the secretary of state allocates million it is put to the purpose for which it was originally intended and does not fall into the general pot <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that closures have taken place because the district health authorities have had to make economies <e> <s> does he consider it right merely to pass the costs from one national health service budget to another possibly at greater expense because the family planning association considers that its provision of family planning services is cheaper than if the patient were to go to a gp <e> <s> also can the minister say what has happened to the governments banner of freedom of choice and explain why women cannot choose to go to a family planning clinic if they wish rather than to their gp <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when the benefit changes take place next april many of the young people in this age group will he up to a week short of the amount needed to pay for their basic needs without having any personal income whatsoever <e> <s> is he also aware that many of them are now slipping into drug addiction drug pushing and prostitution in order to make ends meet <e> <s> does he recognise that the charities are doing as much as they possibly can to save those young people but that a great many are slipping through the net <e> <s> does he agree that it is very important that we protect them at that stage in their lives so that they do not go astray <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that to some extent the building societies are responsible for the problems in which many young people find themselves because they let them take on too large a mortgage while interest rates are low without anticipating what happens when interest rates rise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will probably be aware that the resource management initiative has been welcomed largely by all sides in the health service <e> <s> but is he aware that people working in the health service have projected costs of several million pounds per site for setting up the computers and hardware and estimate that if the software is to be compatible with all the computers it will cost much more <e> <s> is he further aware that at the moment the national health service is having difficulty in recruiting staff for secretarial work and similar jobs <e> <s> how will the health service be able to recruit highly qualified computer technicians if it pays the salaries that it is paying at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is being said that the white paper should not be entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords in the new methods of statistical collection will the increase in debt among the poor be taken into account <e> <s> i understand from citizens advice bureaux that they are dealing with more and more debt problems of people who are afraid to go to the social security social fund for loans and grants because of the implication that that carries <e> <s> they are incurring debts outside the social fund <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill has been described to me as a ragbag of measures <e> <s> some of the rags are good and should be retained others should be discarded <e> <s> as with all household ragbags there is room for more <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether the government have not learnt a lesson from the last national health service reorganisation after the griffiths report <e> <s> in that reorganisation managers and chairmen of regional and district health authorities were imported from industry <e> <s> they had no conception of what it was like to work within the national health service <e> <s> is it not time that the government realised that the health service needs the experience both of the researchers and to go back to the question of the noble baroness lady cox the nurses rather than of people who have been in sainsburys marks and spencers or whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords what steps is the ministers department taking to ensure that social security officers make the right decision the first time and that the department becomes more cost-effective because there are fewer appeals and tribunals that have to be attended <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the noble lord has really answered my question just as he did not answer the question i asked him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that our concern about the length of waiting lists is largely because of the anxiety which it causes the patients who have to wait <e> <s> not many people like having to go into hospital and the longer one has to wait the worse the anxiety becomes <e> <s> would she examine whether anything can be done about the supporting services for example x-ray and physiotherapy for which there are now long waiting lists and where practitioners are having to work with outdated equipment because there has not been the capital expenditure to bring it up to date <e>"]
