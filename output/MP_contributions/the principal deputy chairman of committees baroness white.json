["<cs> my lords i have the very great pleasure of congratulating the noble lord lord hooson on what was difficult to recognise as a maiden speech <e> <s> those who have had experience in another place perhaps have a little less to fear in this place although this place is a very different one as possibly the noble lord has already realised <e> <s> i live in the same county as he does <e> <s> i was one of his constituents for a number of years disenfranchised of course which perhaps was just as well for him <e> <s> but we share a common concern for wales as a whole with a special concern for that beautiful part of mid-wales in which we have the good fortune to find ourselves <e> <s> i am sure that on occasion we shall hear further from the noble lord about some of the problems of mid-wales <e>", "<cs> my lords as a member of the royal commission on environmental pollution which a long time ago recommended this addition to the numbers of the board may i say that we are grateful that at long last our recommendations should be given effect <e> <s> it is regrettable that quite so much time has been taken over deciding to do this <e> <s> there have been delays along the line partly owing to the change of administration but that after all was some while back <e> <s> however better late than never <e> <s> i am sure the government will take great care in choosing appropriate persons to be added to the board so that the breadth of interest and experience which we hoped for may be forthcoming <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he has read marked and learned the th report of this session from your lordships select committee on the european communities <e> <s> the committee took considerable pains in this matter and make a number of recommendations and i would commend the report to all members of the house who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put to the noble lord one other point which disturbs me <e> <s> i speak at the moment as president of the council for the protection of rural wales <e> <s> i know that my members there would have wished me to vote against the order and to support the prayer of my noble friend <e> <s> however a new matter has been introduced <e> <s> i should have thought that possibly it would have been appropriate for the leader of the house to express some regret to those of us who have been placed in this position <e> <s> we are being asked on constitutional grounds not to vote against something which has caused very great concern to both the conservation and the farming interests in this country both of which have been opposed to these orders <e> <s> now at the last moment as the noble lord lord sandford has explained a fresh matter has been introduced so i understand which was not available to any of us <e> <s> we could have no previous consultation on what is now called mark and mark is i hope a good deal better than mark <e> <s> but we are entitled to some further explanation and perhaps to some degree of apology <e>", "<cs> as no amendments have been proposed to clauses to perhaps it may be agreeable to your lordships to consider these three clauses together <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful as indeed are all other members of the house to the noble lord lord digby for having raised this matter <e> <s> i sympathise with him over the influenza germ i also having suffered a little while past from that affliction <e> <s> but i must with all due gratitude to him say that i feel that the local authority associations between them could have taken steps to see that those of us in this house who are interested in this matter but who are not in the privileged position of the members of the select committee on science and technology received their papers before this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this debate really for old times sake and out of regard for my friend sir joshua hassan who with mr isola and other political colleagues hope to meet some of us from both houses of parliament later today <e>", "<cs> my lords my non-conformist conscience will not allow me to remain seated without saying a word or two in this brief debate <e> <s> i do so because to my mind as has already been stressed by both my noble friend lord walston and other speakers in this debate this is really a moral question as much as anything else <e> <s> we are committed <e> <s> i recollect very distinctly when we were discussing in the early s whether or not we should remain in the community that this question of our obligation to certain territories was one of the sticking points for some of us who had had long associations with certain parts of the world <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord who moved the amendment has in fact asked leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble lord whether his attention has been drawn to the article by sir leslie murphy in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like most warmly to congratulate the noble earl opposite for the admirable way if i might say so in which he has introduced the report of his sub-committee <e> <s> i must also i am afraid apologise both to him and to subsequent speakers and not least to the noble earl the minister <e> <s> some of your lordships will perhaps realise that yesterday was st davids day and tonight we have the most important social gathering of the london welsh for which i shall have to leave i am afraid as soon as i have concluded my few remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of sub-committee g i wish at the outset warmly to thank <e>", "<cs> my lords as chairman of your lordships select committee on the european communities i have the particular personal pleasure of thanking the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow and the members of his sub-committee for what i think all of us would agree is an admirable report <e> <s> i should also like to put on record our appreciation of the excellent work done by the specialist adviser adrian hewitt from the overseas development institute and also perhaps unusually in this house might i thank the clerk to that committee francis hawkings a person of quite outstanding ability and dedication who alas is leaving the service of the house shortly to re-enter academic life <e> <s> we appreciate very much indeed the work of all concerned in the production of the report which is i think also responsible for the excellent debate we have had so far this afternoon and in which i was very glad indeed that two of my former colleagues in another place have been able to join <e>", "<cs> i understand that this amendment has been incorrectly printed <e>", "<cs> the next amendment is no <e> <s> zc <e>", "<cs> it might be for the convenience of the committee if together with this amendment we discussed amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> is it intended to move amendment no <e> <s> as an amendment to no <e> <s> <e>"]
