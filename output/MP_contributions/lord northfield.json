["<cs> my lords the noble earl who spoke from the government bench today was gloomy about the immediate prospects for employment <e> <s> he was honest in saying that he put his faith in the medium and longer term revival of the economy based on the revival of initiative and the revival of enterprise in our society by the measures which his government are introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords he is agreeing with what i am saying exactly i did not want to tempt the noble earl too far in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that we the british have agreed with our partners in the european economic community to cut by per cent <e> <s> this year our consumption of imported fuels <e> <s> is it not therefore inevitable that marginal services like those in rural areas will suffer unless a careful eye is kept on them <e> <s> can the minister not respond to the question which was put by my noble friend on the front bench and say that in the event of any danger of that kind he will do his best to make sure that at least these services are kept going <e>", "<cs> my lords before we pass this motion i wonder whether the noble lord the chairman of committees would inquire what is happening about the recommendations now two years old of the committee on practice <e>", "<cs> my lords would not price display as the noble lord lord orr-ewing and i have urged go some way towards reducing prices and <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to the above motion to leave out agreed to and insert referred back to the select committee for their further consideration <e> <s> i hope i shall be able to tempt the acting leader of the house despite the short notice he has had of this matter to intervene because i think the reply can best come from him in view of the events which i shall hope to relate this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he just explain one thing before i decide whether or not to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> is he now saying that he and his noble friend the leader of the house want finally to bury the proposal of the practice and procedure committee by postponing it indefinitely <e> <s> is he saying that the agreement reached on the th july is not now to be honoured <e> <s> if i may quote him the noble lord lord windlesham said <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply given by the noble earl puts me in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl still leaves me in a difficult situation <e> <s> i shall beg leave to withdraw my amendment but it will be with a considerable feeling of betrayal of the work that we did over the years <e> <s> the way of parliamentary reform is a difficult one <e> <s> i was chairman of the house of commons procedure committee for many difficult years <e> <s> we have to fight over years much depends upon coming back again and again <e> <s> i also recognise that saying to this house that there are matters of good faith at stake is not very pleasant or to challenge whether we are doing our job properly <e> <s> i accept all those difficulties in my path and i fully understand that the house may be uneasy at my pressing the matter unduly <e> <s> i shall withdraw my amendment but i shall return to the matter because i do not think that honour is satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords while my name appears next on the list of speakers i know that the noble lord lord orr-ewing has to leave <e> <s> would he care to speak before me <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord see his wife <e>", "<cs> my lords i must like others declare that i am over and now wear spectacles <e> <s> luckily these spectacles were bought in america for dollars <e> <s> they are all plastic with plastic lenses which i gather are expensive here and i can only say that they would probably cost to in england <e> <s> this is the kind of racket frankly that is a worthy word to use that we are asking tonight should be remedied <e> <s> i buy these in america and i now go there with orders from friends to bring back pairs of spectacles for them people are realising that one can do this abroad in particular states in america <e> <s> it is not like rummaging amid a pile of spectacles as one could in woolworths years ago <e> <s> there is a proper stand of spectacles showing the degree of magnification and if one is bright enough to check first in britain on the degree of magnification one needs as one reaches old age one can satisfy oneself by getting glasses like these quite cheaply in america <e> <s> considering that i have been meeting noble lords in the corridors in recent weeks who have told me that their spectacles have cost them or no doubt i shall be taking another batch of orders with me when i next go to america in march <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> the figures given to me in a parliamentary answer from the noble lord were even less <e> <s> it gave the average cost of lenses at about and the cost of frames about <e> <s> that is only about <e>", "<cs> it is yours <e>", "<cs> in an answer given to me by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> your lordships will remember that my original deer bill obtained a third reading as long ago as july and again in february <e> <s> so my lords we have been here twice before and we are hoping that this third time we shall get a very important small piece of legislation on to the statute book <e> <s> on each of those previous occasions the bill was blocked in another place because it had to try for its place at the end of private members business as is often the case with such small reforms <e> <s> happily at the beginning of this session mr john farr won a place in the ballot for private members bills and took up the deer bill re-presenting it in fact in the same form in which it left your lordships house early last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting the noble lord but will he repeat that last point because i did not quite understand what he was saying about the range rover <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in the debate and who have been so kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i can go some way to reassuring the noble lord right now <e> <s> the clause must be read as a whole <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be very helpful on the other two points <e> <s> i do not know the answer to the question as to when poaching becomes armed robbery <e> <s> all i can say is that the penalties in the bill are substantial and probably the difference does not mean a great deal but if i am wrong i shall gladly write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i would say anything in order to help the noble lord on this point and if i have trespassed in regard to this matter i readily apologise <e> <s> the deer society was kind enough to make me an honorary member and after receiving such a great honour i should hardly wish to land it in trouble <e> <s> i say to the noble lord that members of the deer society concerned have inspired me in preparing the bill and have been stalwart in helping me during the various stages of drafting and re-drafting and in mobilising support <e> <s> i hope that that is a happy note upon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not been very helpful <e> <s> i rather gathered from what he said that the aim of the amendment was agreeable to him namely that the duchy should have the power to grant long leases <e> <s> if i heard him aright he also said that they would like to be able to grant long leases <e>", "<cs> my lords looking at clause i can hardly accept what the noble lord said in one part of his remarks <e> <s> he said that a general bill on housing is not the place to amend the act <e> <s> with respect to him the whole of clause is designed to and indeed does in a page and a half of amendments amend various acts as they apply to the crown estates and to duchy properties <e> <s> it is a further step but i would say only a slight further step to single out the act which is particular to the duchy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not asking the noble lord to go any further now <e> <s> i am asking whether he would be prepared to look at it before third reading <e> <s> i would then withdraw it today with the possibility after consultation with him of not coming back to it at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords very reluctantly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the noble lord is protesting about <e> <s> i am rising to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> very reluctantly i beg leave to withdraw the amendment at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord recalls the last occasion on which i raised the issue of the failure of the government to carry out the recommendations of the select committee on practice and procedure <e> <s> on that occasion my noble friend lord shepherd rose to his feet and said that the government would regret it later in the session when the legislation before your lordships house was piling up and when they would reflect that the recommendations of that committee might have helped to some extent to relieve the pressure <e> <s> does the noble lord recall my noble friend lord shepherd saying that <e> <s> would it not be a good thing to have another look at the recommendations as a possible means of alleviating exactly the situation that my noble friend prophesied so clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> at this late stage of the bill i have only three short points to make <e> <s> first i should like again to thank the successive home office ministers and also the home office officials who have helped with drafting and later reshaping of the bill <e> <s> some who helped in the initial stage three years ago have moved on to other duties <e> <s> i hope that my thanks will reach them <e> <s> my special thanks are due to mr john hotchkiss vice-president of the deer society who in a personal capacity has been my patient guide and untiring negotiator in these years <e> <s> the second short point is to say to those of your lordships who are concerned that some parts of the longer bill have been abandoned for the time being that we hope to be back in future sessions with those further points and hopefully with a government bill on deer farming as the framework for our future study of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord <e> <s> but as there have been deputations to the government and continuous debates here and in another place about this matter can he make a statement of government policy on this matter <e> <s> do the government agree that it is high time that some form of price competition should be allowed in this country in the retailing of spectacle frames <e> <s> secondly do the government believe that there is a strong case or at any rate a case for a free market in the sale of simple magnifying spectacles of varying strengths <e> <s> if the noble lord could say that the government agree on both those points i am sure that we should be giving sonic guidance to the industry on how to approach these problems <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord bellwin has said and said as far as i am concerned reasonably convincingly <e> <s> but i wonder whether he appreciates that the trouble arises not only from a failure to get across the principle of what the government are doing here but a failure to communicate the content of what they propose <e> <s> in other words the difficulty the committee is in and many local authority members are in is that they read clause which seems to give the minister total power to designate any figure about capital expenditure and to impose it on the local authorities <e> <s> then we come to all these amendments all the worries of local councils all over the country my amendments for example dealing with the need for local authorities to be able to spend on industrial development <e> <s> the government have given no clue as to whether in using clause they will be taking account of these sorts of things in arriving at the total to be imposed on the local authorities <e> <s> i wonder if the noble lord realises that many of us who understand the principle and have sympathy with what he is saying nevertheless end up in difficulty because he has never spelled out how these powers are to be used on sensitive matters which local authorities and others think they will be denied from using under the powers of clause <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister sits down could he deal with the point about sir wilfred burns committee <e> <s> local authorities are very anxious to know whether the outcome of that inquiry is to be that they are to lose their traditional role <e> <s> to hear the contrary would greatly reassure them <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for what he has said and in a moment i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i should like to make two comments <e> <s> first may i stress to the noble lord lord sandford that in my subsidiary point upon lord seebohms letter i was talking about the receipts of interest not the capital receipts <e> <s> i very much hope that despite what the noble lord the minister has said he will have a look at this point and if necessary write to me to give any reassurance or explanation that he can <e> <s> he nods his head and i am grateful for that assurance <e> <s> secondly i make this comment to the noble lord lord sandford and to your lordships i feel bound to say that the problem is that this bill is being judged against a background in which the government are heavily criticising local government expenditure in general <e> <s> therefore it is being assumed perhaps too easily according to the versions we now hear from the noble lord the minister that this capital control will be a means of drastically curtailing and reducing some very worthwhile expenditure that is going on at the moment <e> <s> that is the problem in addition there is the burns committee hanging over these authorities heads and making them feel that even this part of their activity is under general threat <e>", "<cs> i am going to withdraw this amendment but i take this short debate as indicating to local authorities that there is no reason why they should not bid for the opportunity to have some capital available to make grants and advances to small industry in their areas as they have always done in the past and that they should not take the general framework of the bill as in any sense preventing them in principle from continuing with this very useful role in our community <e> <s> because the debate has been so helpful i am delighted to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is not this another case where the committee and the local authorities will misunderstand unless the minister is slightly more forthcoming <e> <s> what he said is and i paraphrase it and perhaps distort it but if i do i am sure that he will correct me that only if total cash limits are exceeded shall we want to use this as a reserve power <e> <s> but as the bill is drafted it does not read like that at all <e>", "<cs> there are precedents for this sort of thing in rating at the moment of p or p for particular purposes <e> <s> i hope that the minister will accept at least that part of the amendment <e> <s> it would apply very helpfully to local authorities that i am interested in namely those that are anxious about industrial development <e> <s> it would be the sort of thing they could use on special schemes for example that had not been successful in building up the total that the government will allow on special schemes to give grants and special help to small businesses <e> <s> it would be a very good use of a p rate <e> <s> i hope that that sort of thing would appeal to the minister <e>", "<cs> may i draw the noble lords attention to the sort of thing i have in mind that the noble viscount lord ridley is perhaps too modest to give as an example <e> <s> in his own county of northumberland he has a special scheme to give special grants to small industry in the area <e> <s> i believe the noble viscount was probably the originator of that <e> <s> let us take that sort of scheme <e> <s> it may well not commend itself in the arguments between northumberland and marsham street as to be allowed in the years capital expenditure <e> <s> but if somebody wishes to pioneer try things out and show other parts of the country how useful such things can be they must be given some freedom to pioneer otherwise all pioneering will be stifled in marsham street <e> <s> i therefore hope the minister will look precisely at what the noble viscount has pioneered and will agree that it is the sort of thing a p rate could allow to happen <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to withdraw my amendment no <e> <s> a because i found the assurances of the minister very helpful <e>", "<cs> i am quite content <e> <s> i take the ministers word on this matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i seem to be one of the few members of the committee who support this part of the bill in principle so i feel justified in detaining your lordships briefly to ask a question about subsection <e> <s> can the lord advocate say to what sort of circumstances that subsection might apply <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that that too was written in that there was taken a head lease without the right to occupy that it is merely in order to be the managing agent and to help to dispose of those by way of sub-lease <e>", "<cs> since the principle of enterprise zones is being discussed may i say that i am very strongly in favour of them and that i am glad the government have introduced them <e> <s> some years ago when we were debating the problems of the inner cities a number of us made the point that in some of the really difficult areas of the country the best thing to do was to relieve them of rates and taxes and to give them other freedoms in the hope that the sheer intractability of their problems would be conquered by concessions of this kind <e> <s> that is what enterprise zones are about they are for areas where the normal processes of development have failed to solve the problems where the problems are difficult where for or even more years we have been unable to get their economies moving <e> <s> a number of us have said over the years that that is the kind of solution which might help them and this led finally to the experiment being introduced <e>", "<cs> i must say bluntly to my noble friend that i oppose this amendment <e> <s> i think it is very ill-advised <e> <s> i have an interest in this matter in that i am the chairman of a new town and so far as i know we are the only new town which has applied to have an enterprise zone <e> <s> so i have a direct <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lady stedman must have misheard me <e> <s> i did not say that i had the support of the district council i said that unusually they were actually opposed to it but they have made it clear that they will tolerate it and will not hinder the operation of a zone if we are fortunate to get it <e> <s> that is good enough as far as i am concerned <e> <s> they see that some experiments of this kind might well need to be made and they are not going to stand in the way <e> <s> as far as the general principle is concerned why should the development corporation have these powers rather than the district council or equal with the district council in circumstances like this simply because we are providing acres after acres of industrial land throughout the whole town in order to attract employment <e> <s> that is more our duty or at least our <e>", "<cs> i share the slight disquiet of the noble lord lord sandford about the problem of large hypermarkets <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can indicate whether he thinks that amendment no <e> <s> a which we have just carried would be one way of dealing with such developments if there were dangers to retail operations in the area or other big public investment in retail opportunities in the area <e> <s> alternatively and here i come to my second point can he tell us that in drawing up the schemes for these enterprise zones the government really will be open and flexible with the authorities of the new town corporation as in my case and come to them and say we would like to put a limit on the size of these operations before we could openly allow them in <e> <s> in other words is there a real flexibility in the governments mind or are they asking for absolutely total freedom for anything to happen in this field of activity <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are all going to have to use the underground or are more or less forced to do so would the noble lord look again to see whether some express trains could be provided instead of one that stops at every station between the east end and heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer my question about express trains on the underground <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in this debate because i was part of the history which the noble lord lord trefgarne referred to at the beginning of his speech <e> <s> he mentioned that in representatives of the government and opposition were sent to anguilla to obtain a temporary settlement <e> <s> i was one of the two who went out there and in fact we were not representatives of the government and opposition <e> <s> it was a most strange thing something which i do not think had ever occurred before <e> <s> my noble friend lord shepherd who was then i think at the foreign and commonwealth office approached sir nigel fisher the distinguished member of parliament for surbiton and myself because of our knowledge of and connections with the caribbean <e> <s> he asked us to go to anguilla to try to effect a settlement of the situation <e>", "<cs> i agree my lords <e> <s> they are asking <e> <s> i want to come to that <e> <s> i am glad that my noble friend lord pitt who knows this area better than i do has intervened at this point <e> <s> they are asking but not under the present government of the state <e> <s> the present government is a coalition of politicians elected from nevis together with the previous opposition in the main island of st kitts <e> <s> but what happens and this is the danger if as is now on the cards according to the news coming from <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord because he has not dealt with the most important point which my noble friend lord lee and i raised and to some extent it was raised also by my noble friend lord pitt in his interjection namely whether it has been made absolutely clear that the precedent of the independence for anguilla will not be allowed to influence the position with respect to nevis where there has been and still is a continuous pressure to separate itself from st kitts <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble lord will as i believe the previous government did make it absolutely clear to the people of nevis that this would be an absolute nonsense that they cannot count on our support for it and that they must not use the anguillan example as a precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the noble earls reply to a previous supplementary question and of the fact that the government are increasing expenditure to help the unemployed will the noble earl have a look at the plans of the msc to close skill centres in various parts of the country <e> <s> is not that very shortsighted given that many of these people particularly young people could benefit from training in new skills and thus be more readily absorbed <e> <s> in many cases this decision to close these skill centres was made before the governments plans were announced to spend more on assisting the unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl have a look at shropshire where the demand is high and the closure is still going ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who buys bucket shop tickets and is very happy to do so at the nice fares that are charged which enable people to travel to other parts of the world may i ask the noble lord what is the precise position <e> <s> is it the case then that pending some international agreement with other countries on lower fares the government are happily conniving at the breaking of these regulations at home by allowing bucket shops to sell at these prices <e> <s> are the government saying on the one hand that they believe in these international agreements but that on the other hand they cannot do anything at home to stop them being broken <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this government were elected to further competition and made very sympathetic noises on this matter when <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord answer me on prosecution <e> <s> is he actually going to prosecute firms who put these on sale <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i ask him to take his mind back to some of the discussions which we have had on the deer bill over the last three years <e> <s> we originally had a very similar subsection to this one about which we were worried because it left such a great loophole in the bill <e> <s> we finally reached agreement and the noble lord lord stanley of alderley who has just spoken will remember this on a form of words that tightened the situation up considerably that it was not just a case of allowing killing when it was necessary for the purpose of preventing damage we included such things as reasonable grounds for believing that the species had actually caused the damage that the damage was serious that it was likely that further damage would take place and that the action was absolutely necessary in order to prevent the damage <e> <s> in other words instead of having a great big loophole in these sort of circumstances we tightened the matter up enormously <e> <s> it is now part of my amendment no <e> <s> dealing with deer <e> <s> but this was an agreed form of words by the house as regards the deer bill and in exactly similar circumstances <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will look at that even if he cannot accept the amendment as a whole <e>", "<cs> the noble earl spoke about control but this has nothing to do with control in that sense <e> <s> it is to do with the methods of killing which the long title specifically includes in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful that the chorus of supporters made the minister kindly agree to take this away and look at it <e> <s> but i would make two points to him <e> <s> first i hope that there will not be any doubt about the drafting <e> <s> i am not talking about the technical detail i am simply talking about the major proposals in the amendment <e> <s> they have been agreed by your lordships on several previous occasions <e> <s> so there is no question here that i am introducing anything new <e> <s> we have been over this many times and i hope that that is agreed by him <e> <s> so in agreeing to look at it i hope the noble earl is not saying that he will look right from the beginning again at the whole principle here <e> <s> we have been over it several times and i hope that the whole house is tired of it <e> <s> the second point is <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that support <e> <s> my second point is that i beg the noble earl to reflect on one other problem which is that if we do not make this final amendment of the deer act here the chances of doing it for another five years are almost nil for very specific reasons <e> <s> the whole country is waiting for a bill to amend the legislation regarding deer in scotland <e> <s> you really cannot deal with england and wales within that one <e> <s> the whole question involved in scottish law will take some time to bring up to date <e> <s> furthermore your lordships house and i am surprised that the noble viscount lord thurso has not intervened is also waiting for another bill to deal with deer farming <e> <s> so the chances of this third lot being dealt with within the next five years with those two already waiting in the queue is nil unless we put it into this bill <e> <s> therefore i hope that in looking at it the noble earl will have those points in mind in addition to the ones that i have made <e>", "<cs> i am in the hands of the committee <e> <s> on the whole i think it would be wise to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> if the government come up with very poor reasons for refusing it at report i hope that those noble lords who have been very kind to me over the years in supporting it will all turn up again <e> <s> next time we shall vote it through whatever the government say <e> <s> in the circumstances however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is also important to include the vehicle that is taking away the animal or whatever it is that the offence is in respect of after the commission of the offence <e> <s> so it is not only arriving it is taking away and making a get-away with the prey <e>", "<cs> we already have it in the case of deer <e>", "<cs> i resist that suggestion on the following grounds <e> <s> particularly in the case of deer we have now reached the stage where lurcher clogs are trained to do exactly this <e> <s> i feel rather sore about it because two days ago one of them attacked my own dogs <e> <s> it is a particularly cruel way of killing deer <e> <s> it is very clear that these or similar dogs can be trained to commit other offences which are dealt with in the bill <e> <s> when they become directly relevant to the commission of the act in that way i should be strongly in favour of confiscation as one of the most important deterrents in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord take steps to give some publicity to that part of his answer which indicates to people that they need not buy their spectacles where they have their eyes tested and that if they know places where they can buy these cheap imported spectacles for or less per pair they are entitled to go there and buy spectacles if they have obtained their prescription somewhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords as there is a good deal of contrary evidence about this subject in the medical profession i ask your lordships to read the editorial in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the government recently allowed the development commission in the rural areas to give half the costs something like per cent <e> <s> of building small industrial units to local authorities <e> <s> it is a partnership system of encouraging local authorities to build the small units in which small businesses can make a start <e> <s> would the noble earl have a look at whether this policy which i applaud and greatly welcome of helping local authorities to have a useful role in this way could be spread to the urban areas in some way as well as the rural ones <e> <s> that is where most of the small businesses are going to make a start <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend lady white leaves for her dinner those of us who have the privilege of attending sub-committee g would like to pay tribute to her leadership of this sub-committee in its earlier days <e> <s> she is still a regular attender and a great contributor and now those of us who attend that committee benefit from her being chairman of the full parent committee where i am sure she keeps a very favourable eye on all that happens in sub-committee g we should like to thank her very much for this leadership that she gives and which has given this sub-committee a great deal of momentum in its studies <e> <s> we should like also to thank the noble earl lord cranbrook for he has slotted into the chairmanship of this committee with great distinction and dedication and it is certainly a pleasure to be able to attend such a workmanlike committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very interested in the noble lords example and feel strongly about it because i myself caught hepatitis when swimming in the mediterranean <e> <s> but is it not equally fair to say that a directive was needed to force the pace of countries which were being very slow in getting on with the job of cleaning up the mediterranean and that a recommendation may never have got so far <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point may i say to him that the thinking behind the council of europe resolution on this matter was that the practitioners the officials in the oecd and the eec who meet frequently or regularly as the noble earl says are in a sense the last people who can be detached from the work that they are doing and examine how much is overlapping unnecessary and duplicating <e> <s> therefore the suggestion was that an outsider who nevertheless had considerable knowledge of the environmental problems of europe might look at this question in a better way than would the practitioners at their regular meetings <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will have another look at the suggestion from the council of europe about having an outsider to look at the overlapping <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he could answer one other question about which i gave him notice and which i think has been raised by practically every noble lord in the debate and that is the problem of the very small number of staff of the environment service in brussels <e> <s> the position is that the european parliament last year voted an increase of staff for this service but in the subsequent rows over the budget in the council the precise designation of funds for this purpose got lost and nobody was clear whether it was going to be given to the environment service <e> <s> the only question i am asking is whether her majestys government put some weight behind the recommendations of the european parliament on this issue <e> <s> i think it was only nine members or only a small number which was involved but that at least that sort of modest reinforcement ought to be given to this service <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the government for their help in drafting the part that deals with deer <e> <s> i should also like to thank noble lords on the other side of the house who were present during the committee stage and who were so strong in their support for the various measures to complete the work of the original deer bill which has been through the house so many times that they finally persuaded the government to give way and allow that remaining part of the bill to be incorporated into this bill <e> <s> i am very grateful indeed to everyone who has helped in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords as i had not been warned of this happy change of circumstance i was about to explain but i see i have no need to do so <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords for many of us who have an open mind on this issue a great deal turns on this question <e> <s> a lot of the debate has missed the point which seemed to be made by my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby that these powers to make by-laws are subject to confirmation by the minister <e> <s> is it the case that the power to confirm or to refuse could be used in order to prevent any unreasonable by-law in the case for example of the trade between the scottish islands and the mainland <e> <s> or is the power to confirm or not to confirm not used in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to interrupt <e> <s> i wonder whether he

characteristics so require leaving discretion entirely in the hands of the competent authority <e> <s> secondly it even leaves them with the discretion to have a simplified form of assessment after having decided whether to have them at all <e> <s> there is nothing really mandatory about annex ii <e>", "<cs> my lords as in a previous debate on these subjects i begin by declaring an interest as a part-time adviser to the commission indeed i have been so close to the drafting of this particular directive for so long that i am not quite sure how equipped i am now to debate it <e> <s> noble lords have said how many drafts it has been through and i am almost at the stage where in no <e> <s> i am not sure whether i can still see the wood for the trees <e> <s> however that may be i should like to say first of all that i was glad that my noble friend lady white and other noble lords have paid a particular tribute to the work of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said this twice <e> <s> yet it is not said at all in the directive <e> <s> what the directive says in article is that the competent authority should check that the conditions are being complied with and whether they are still adequate whether other provisions to protect the environment are being obeyed and whether the competent authority needs to take further measures to protect the environment from the effects of the project <e> <s> there is nothing there to say that the article is leading to additional burdens being put on the developer at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how long it will be before a second round of sites is considered <e> <s> how long is the first experiment to take before it is assessed and the disappointed applicants on the first occasion get a chance to have a second go <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that issue should he not examine the disaster that would face this country if we did not have that access to that industrial market <e> <s> it is no good saying that our deficit has increased <e> <s> what one also has to look at is the total disaster that would be facing our <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> i have been carefully following her argument but the point that puzzles me is this <e> <s> she has proof that bucket shops are selling tickets at <e>", "<cs> my lords that with respect does not answer the question <e> <s> the discounted tickets normally have the full price on them so there is no <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask follow which course <e> <s> does the noble lord mean that they will refer it to the article procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that at the western european assembly last week the minister of state of the french ministry of defence made a proposal that the assembly should study this problem of the possible financing by communist sources of the peace movements <e> <s> would that not be a good idea <e> <s> would not her majestys government give support to this study which a french minister has suggested <e> <s> and would her majestys government make available what information they have on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government completed their review of the work of the parent development commission and would the noble earl and the government welcome a debate on the outcome of that review since these matters of rural development are of great concern to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says in due course <e> <s> may i again ask him how long those of us who were disappointed

starting of light industrial and craft enterprises in farm buildings does the noble lord recall the department of the environments circular asking planning authorities to be less strict in allowing such applications <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we still get rumours and indeed cases where local planning authorities are being very restrictive in allowing these conversions to take place <e> <s> will the noble lord check whether that circular needs some further follow-up action in order to encourage local authorities to relax their restrictions in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to follow the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> in crystal clear terms he has explained the need for the bill which i think the whole house accepts and secondly he has explained again clearly the broad lines that the bill follows <e> <s> i am only too conscious of the fact that having got the deer act on to the statute book and having succeeded in adding some important provisions concerning deer to the governments wildlife and countryside act i began to make a nuisance of myself by turning my fire on scottish deer legislation and insisting that it was time that it was brought up to date <e>", "<cs> my lords when the whole house and many people outside are agreed that some methods are barbaric is it not a good idea to put a provision in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i trespass on the time of the noble earl once more <e> <s> he made a passing mention to shooting out of season and then left that and went on to night shooting <e> <s> may i press him on the point that i made about it being possible still unamended in this bill for an occupier to shoot out of season at any animal simply found on arable land not even causing damage not even causing serious damage but merely found <e> <s> does he admit that is an error in the drafting <e>", "<cs> my lords are they in any prime locations <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> does he realise the importance of the section p possibility <e> <s> take an area that gets <e>", "<cs> but that is already in the clause in section <e> <s> there already appears in line of section <e>", "<cs> i am very happy with that assurance and i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i am slightly surprised that my noble friend on the front bench has not yet heard about this escalating if he does not like the word epidemic amount of poaching going on <e> <s> the sort of figures which have been quoted in the newspapers were used at second reading by several noble lords and indeed i used some myself <e> <s> the sort of figure which is given as a reliable estimate is that about as much poached venison leaves scotland as is exported legally about tons of each <e> <s> it has got to that proportion equalling the legitimate trade with a worth of about million at present-day prices <e> <s> when one considers that gangs make easily <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down may i point out to him that the amendment in fact authorises the use of the shotgun by crofters in the circumstances as he says with strict controls so i do not know what he was really criticising <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the courtesy of the noble earl <e> <s> it is in contrast to the remarks of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i must say to him that during all the proceedings on the english deer bill we never complained that it was mainly scottish peers who were doing all the debating and i am surprised that in the reverse sense he now raises that old one on my amendment <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> i applaud the motives of the noble lord lord burton and the sincerity with which he moved this <e> <s> we have had this argument many times in this chamber in recent years concerning deer legislation and i have never heard a voice raised in defence of the use of the shotgun on large species of deer <e> <s> the amendment goes much further than my own amendment upon which my noble friend on the front bench poured scorn <e> <s> indeed my amendment would have <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> in view of what the noble lord has said i shall look at what his amendment will do to the bill and consider whether it needs any further amendment at report stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not really satisfied because the act as it stands at the moment makes this an offence in respect of shooting at night <e> <s> i should have thought that what the noble lord said about accidentally shooting one a few hours before the end of the close season can be said also about people who shoot half an hour before daylight <e> <s> in other words he is making a wrong comparison <e> <s> the comparison that is needed to be made is why is it an offence to do this half an hour before daylight and not a day before the end of the close season <e> <s> the noble lord is being quite illogical over this <e> <s> i hope he will reflect on what i have said and will see that he is making a totally wrong comparison <e> <s> i shall think about it as i hope he will and we can discuss it privately <e> <s> on the basis that i shall return to the matter on report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said that in the case of an alleged abuse the private members bill now in another place will introduce the test of showing for gain <e> <s> will this not simply lead bogus clubs into another subterfuge will they not become more like real clubs in which case the control will fail because the clubs will find ways of disguising their profits and will make people join for no apparent profit-making motive <e> <s> there will be no control and does this not reinforce the point made by my noble friend that a different type of control is needed <e>", "<cs> may i ask why there are difficulties when there was none in the english legislation <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord burton for trying to protect the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i have reflected on what the minister said and as on a previous occasion when we were involved in a similar discussion he said it most helpfully and he seems to have gone two steps in my direction <e> <s> first he said he is virtually conceding subsection <e>", "<cs> that is extremely helpful <e> <s> i can only say that i am very grateful to the noble earl and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the amendment is defective <e> <s> surely it is of some importance to the red deer commission to know not only the number of cal cases and the sex but also the species which are mentioned nowhere in this part of the clause <e> <s> i should have thought that in order to check on the culling of deer the commission would also need to know the species <e> <s> if i am right perhaps the noble lord will indicate and we can come back to this at the report stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has gone some way to meet me <e> <s> what he has said is that at report stage he would be prepared to move an amendment which added part iii to the offences for which the applicant could be disqualified from holding a venison dealers licence <e> <s> i would point out that that deals with night shooting as well as with illegal killing of deer in other words as well as with poaching <e> <s> so we are back on the old argument as to whether shooting out of season is as bad as night shooting <e> <s> i maintain that in many cases it is and i also maintain that when there is an accidental event of this kind the court will be fully capable of exercising its discretion <e> <s> in any case it does not actually have to consider it it is just that it may use this as a reason for withholding a licence in venison dealing <e>", "<cs> this debate has been interesting and i am glad that i raised the issue because it has led to the tabling of amendment no <e> <s> which goes a long way towards meeting me on a <e> <s> regarding b of course that is only a repetition of what is in the schedule and i still maintain that it should be in the body of the bill rather than in a schedule <e> <s> that is the normal place for it i understand <e> <s> regarding c i was interested in the discussion i know that the particular exception which is already in section of the act led to a great deal of debate <e> <s> i accept the noble earls point having listened to what he said that it would not be proper for one witness to be allowed to testify to the offence under the venison dealers section <e> <s> i am left i think with part ii of the act referring to shooting out of season <e> <s> i would strongly suspect that there is a good reason to look again at that on report stage <e>", "<cs> i have only one comment which is that i am very happy not to move my amendment no <e> <s> at this stage <e> <s> i say so for the following reason that i quite accept that the first part of the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> dealing with the owner is necessary <e> <s> when we come to the second part of his amendment dealing with servants or agents i would point out that my draft which is no <e> <s> is taken directly from the wildlife and countryside act which applies to scotland and for matters very similar to those that we are dealing with at this point in the bill <e> <s> i suggest that we reflect on whether in the interests of uniformity in legislation applying to scotland it would be better to replace the second part of the noble lords amendment dealing with servants or agents with the kind of drafting that i have lifted deliberately from the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> that is something that i would not do at this stage but would return to at report stage <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble lord has said i will not persist but i shall refer to the point when i come to the next amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up one or two points that have been made in this short debate <e> <s> the noble lord says that after all we are not dealing with a rare species <e> <s> what in heavens name do we have close season regulation for <e> <s> we have it because it is cruel to shoot at the wrong times of year <e> <s> here the <e>", "<cs> we would not revert to the act <e> <s> we would revert to what i had to do we should come forward year after year after year until we got the compromise right <e> <s> you do not buckle under on the first occasion <e>", "<cs> so have i <e>", "<cs> i respond immediately to my noble friend by reminding him of three points <e> <s> the first is that while he does not like the wording of my amendment it comes from the wildlife and countryside act and it appears in that measure all the way through in regard to animals and damage in scotland <e> <s> why he suddenly wants to exempt deer from those provisions which are now enshrined in parts of that act i really do not know <e> <s> he is a bit late in finding the disadvantages of those words <e>", "<cs> yes a bit late my noble friend should have been there if he wanted to stop those provisions in the wildlife and countryside act from applying to all sorts of other animals in scotland <e>", "<cs> be that as it may we are also concerned with the principle of marauding and that too is in the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble viscount has said and i do not agree with part of it <e> <s> in using the word cruelty i was simply talking about one of the reasons for a close season <e> <s> but to turn to the substance of the matter i think the debate has shown that those of us who feel strongly about it <e>", "<cs> i did not at all mean to imply and if i did so i apologise to the noble earl that anything improper had been done <e> <s> i am simply saying that the situation puts the house at a disadvantage <e> <s> it puts us in a very difficult position when this method is being used to promote a government bill because we are told we cannot amend it because of the fear of it not getting through as drafted at four oclock on the nod in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> the difficulty about the noble lords point is that it is actually covered by subsection a and the noble lord lord glenkinglas would immediately respond to him that what he has said would not invalidate the noble lords amendment at all because the power for the commission to allow night shooting is in a and not in which we are actually discussing <e> <s> there is another point i would briefly raise which nobody has yet mentioned poaching <e> <s> once we begin to legalise night shooting in this way we shall be giving a very good helping hand to the poacher <e> <s> at the moment <e>", "<cs> but enshrining it in this way i am simply saying will mean that the poacher will be getting away with it because the suspicion of shooting going on will not make people immediately think of poachers <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> as i understood the noble lord lord glenarthur he said that if the committee decided to make this amendment he would accept it reluctantly but he would then resist a similar amendment to the next subsection because it would then be left in effect to the commission to authorise night shooting of roe where appropriate <e> <s> that is what i understood him to say <e> <s> if that is what he said i am quite prepared to accept it <e> <s> let us put the amendment in <e> <s> i am quite happy to accept as a compromise that we except roe deer in subsection but leave them to be controlled by authority of the commission under a where real damage is being evidenced <e> <s> that would be perfectly satisfactory to me <e> <s> i think that it is a good compromise <e> <s> i shall take the noble lord up on his words <e> <s> let us make the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall do so reluctantly but i am satisfied and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord not prepared to discuss this <e> <s> if we have a form of words which is acceptable as to the restriction of the right to shoot out of season do we not have to consider the effect of those words on this subsection <e> <s> do we not have to get it broadly in line <e> <s> it cannot be satisfactory to have two parts of the bill in that sense with a special form of wording looking rather different <e> <s> i am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment if as i said before the noble lord will say that while we are discussing amendment no <e> <s> between now and report we may also discuss amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a perfectly fair offer on my part <e>", "<cs> i am glad to be able to save the time of the committee and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that is what i would propose and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not join the noble lord lord sandford in entirely welcoming this consultation paper <e> <s> i was glad that a consultation paper of some kind was issued but i thought that this one had escaped the eagle eye of the noble lord lord bellwin who is so familiar with local government and so came out in rather a half-baked form if i may say so <e> <s> he must have let someone else in the department deal with it instead of grabbing it himself before it leaked out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords since unemployment in these four districts is running at something like per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> no less than per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> does not the noble lord think that it was something of a mistake for the government to recommend that expenditure on assistance to small firms by these districts in the way of training and other initiatives that they are so successfully pioneering should be reduced to these relatively trivial sums compared with what they are able to do now <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to thank the noble lord for the amendment and to thank him most warmly for many further amendments that appear in his name on the marshalled list <e> <s> i also wish equally to thank the noble earl lord mansfield for going such a long way in the amendments that are now before us to meet points that i made at the committee stage <e> <s> to save the time of the house i shall not get up on each occasion and thank noble lords <e> <s> i hope that both noble lords to whom i have referred will accept this as an omnibus word of very warm appreciation for the steps that they have taken to meet me on so many amendments <e> <s> if we can this evening reach similar agreement about the measures to tighten up against poaching i think we shall have virtually a totally agreed bill <e> <s> i again thank the noble lords and repeat that i shall not intervene each time to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely satisfied but i see the point that the occupier will already have invited the people on to his land <e> <s> at this stage therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord glenarthur said his explanation is very tortuous <e> <s> frankly i have not followed it and i shall have to read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the act refer only to killing <e> <s> this amendment would extend it under subsection to taking killing or injuring so is it not to some extent the case that these provisions are not covered by existing legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble earl has been helpful <e> <s> i am glad to be put right about the matters and powers which exist in other acts and in connection with subsection <e> <s> i beg to withdraw the amendment on the understanding that the noble earl will look at subsection <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and before the noble lord lord burton speaks do i understand him to say that if we withdraw this amendment the words other equipment in amendment no <e> <s> will be specifically used to bring in some provision about the use of motorised vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting discussion and i think we shall have to consider putting down on third reading an amendment which limits the provisions to an improved version of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl the minister but i would say three things to him <e> <s> i am not sure about his interpretation of subsection because it refers back to subsection <e> <s> subsection is carefully prefaced by the words without prejudice to the provisions of this section <e> <s> i would chance my arm in saying that if the secretary of state wished to vary subsection he could do so under the earlier powers in the bill because subsections and are without prejudice to the powers of variation which he has anyway <e> <s> until the noble earl can convince me of it i am not really penitent on that point <e>", "<cs> i will make sure that they do my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i have probably pushed the noble earl as far as he should go <e> <s> i greatly respect his assurances <e> <s> as long as we have an understanding that the issue of daylight use is at least considered then i must be happy although obviously i am slightly unhappy at the same time <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry about this because i think the noble earl will regret it <e> <s> i think poaching will go on increasing in scotland <e> <s> all the signs are in that direction <e> <s> it will be increasingly difficult to convict <e> <s> the noble earl will regret that he did not think the situation was as urgent as it was in the and days of increasing poaching <e> <s> i think he will find he will be back with that situation before this decade is out and will regret that he has not got this piece of ammunition against the poacher <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is in substitution for my following amendment perhaps i may say a word about what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> here again we are quite obviously looking for assurances <e> <s> if we take out the directions to the secretary of state as to what shall be included in the form we are clearly looking for undertakings about how he will use the power he will have to set up the form <e> <s> here i am pointing at three issues which i think must be included first the place where the deer was killed <e> <s> i cannot see any possible argument against that because this is one of the crucial things in determining poaching <e> <s> secondly the registration number of the vehicle delivering the venison <e> <s> how can there possibly be any disagreement about the need for this <e> <s> one of the most important ways of frightening off poachers turning up with one animal in an odd vehicle is that they may be traced through their vehicle registration <e> <s> they can of course give a false name themselves but they cannot get away with giving a false registration number to the vehicle when the venison dealer can look out of the window and see what it is <e> <s> thirdly it is helpful if we can have an assurance that there will be some record of the manner of killing where that is possible and the type of firearm especially if certain firearms are going to be outlawed under the bill <e> <s> i should have thought i was justified in asking the noble earl to give us a few indications of how far he is prepared to go in using the powers under this part of the bill if we leave it entirely to his discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i say that the point which was worrying me concerned the vehicle <e> <s> i have not yet understood from the noble earl the problem about recording the registration number of the vehicle <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not intend to <e>", "<cs> my lords that is helpful and i am grateful for what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is concerned with a small point i am happy to withdraw it on the basis that i shall consider the matter between now and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is the present position on insulation grants <e> <s> are they being taken up and could not a lot more propaganda be carried out to encourage people to insulate their houses <e> <s> this is one improvement which is very much in the national interest and is badly needed for the millions of houses constructed between the two wars <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord care to comment upon the allegation that a number of these zones are failing by simply attracting some companies to hop from just outside the zone to just inside the zone without any real creation of new jobs <e> <s> is this happening to any extent which is likely to prejudice the success of the experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord sandford in offering appreciation to the government <e> <s> i suspect that we owe a special word of thanks to the noble lord lord bellwin who probably took back from the committee stage the message of strong criticism that we voiced at that time about the alternative proposals in the ill-fated green paper that these powers should be reduced to the spending of a p rate instead of a p rate <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord lord bellwin was able to indicate together with the reports coming in of the views of local authorities that the original proposal was misguided and ought quickly to be abandoned <e> <s> i am pleased that it has been abandoned and that we are now back to what the noble lord lord sandford suggests is a satisfactory conclusion <e>", "<cs> a p rate not p <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a misapprehension about this <e> <s> the majority of local authorities using money in this way are not in fact using it for loans for industry <e> <s> it is for quite other purposes than helping industry <e>", "<cs> having listened to this debate may i pull the leg of the noble lord by saying that i have read the same words in cols <e> <s> and of th may <e> <s> the noble lord has read out the same answer to a similar amendment <e> <s> i have been following it word for word <e>", "<cs> i was not saying that <e> <s> however i followed what the noble lord said word for word not to disagree with a great deal that the minister <e>", "<cs> i am agreeing with what the noble lord says but at the same time it does become a cloak for some local authorities to hide under provision of services <e> <s> in other words both of us can be right on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that pension funds and life insurance companies now own more than half of the shares on the stock exchange and that on present trends they will probably own most of them in the s <e> <s> is it not important for the government politics quite apart to begin to examine whether such pension funds are fully democratic fully accountable since these million people who quite properly are spreading ownership in this way by their contributions to these pension funds are at the moment not fully protected democratically and are not totally in control as they should be of the decision-makers in those funds <e> <s> this is an issue which is now causing increasing concern <e>", "<cs> that is being suggested without consultation my lords <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> raises quite different issues from no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord campbell of croy in offering good wishes and congratulations to the noble lord lord glenarthur and i express our sorrow that he now has to be silent at the final stage of his own bill <e> <s> as most of the amendments come before the house i shall not weary your lordships by repeating how much i appreciate the <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a pity that this amendment was suddenly squeezed in at the last moment in another place <e> <s> with a little more time and some discussion in your lordships house it could have been improved <e> <s> the addition of even one word the word agricultural to qualify the word land would have made the amendment a little less open-ended <e> <s> as it stands land can be any land provided the other conditions are adhered to it could be a back yard for example <e> <s> nobody wants to exempt that kind of phoney activity under the heading of deer farming <e>", "<cs> my lords at an earlier stage of the bill having with the noble lord lord glenkinglas raised the whole question of intentional injuries i am delighted with this amendment but at the risk of breaking the harmony this evening i must record my censure of the governments insistence which is still in the clause we are adding to here on the use of shotguns at night <e> <s> under the bill unless authorised by the red deer commission occupiers may shoot only at red and sica at night <e>", "<cs> my lords i have one question to ask and if the minister cannot answer it tonight perhaps he will be good enough to write to me <e> <s> we are dealing with the question of licensing venison dealers and i think it important to have on the record somewhere or in some publicity given to it that the minister should be asked for an assurance that the names of licensed dealers will be available to <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only a brief point to raise <e> <s> if the minister cannot give an answer tonight perhaps he will write to me because the issue is an important one <e> <s> can we have it clear that when these clauses are put into effect the names of the people who are approved by the red deer commission for shooting in the close season will be available for <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to say on this matter but it leaves me to make one general point since we are nearing the end of the discussion <e> <s> if one looks at the complexity of this amendment and both noble lords have referred to that one realises what a difficult situation we are going to be in when this legislation is through <e> <s> i made the case right from the very beginning that it would have been much better to redraft the whole legislation so that we could see it in front of us as a body of new law <e> <s> instead the procedure followed has been to amend to the point of such complexity that it will be a long time after the bill is through before everybody knows exactly where they are with all these technical amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems a happy note on which to conclude the passage of this bill because i believe that after we have finished this evening it automatically goes for royal assent <e> <s> i should not like this moment to pass without making one or two points <e> <s> first i think that the noble lord lord campbell was being unduly modest <e> <s> he said that his only qualification for taking on the bill at this point was his connection with past legislation <e> <s> that was such a distinguished past that he does not need to be modest about it on this occasion <e> <s> those earlier acts were of great importance and what the bill that we are discussing is doing is simply bringing them up to date in the light of further experience and dare i say it in the light of experience across the border <e> <s> one of the difficulties about this whole matter has been <e>", "<cs> my lords i am absolutely astonished <e> <s> i have not spoken at all on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lords are in error and i am sorry that the deputy chief whip comes in without having been here earlier and starts saying something without knowing what has been happening <e> <s> i had not said anything on this amendment <e> <s> i am using this occasion simply to say that i should not like the modesty of the noble lord to go on the record without paying tribute <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who is involved actually in selling off government-owned houses i want to say a few words and to give the house some of the facts and figures and the opportunities that this creates for tenants <e> <s> i would introduce what i have to say in this way <e> <s> the noble lord lord vaizey hinted at the revolution which is happening under our feet <e> <s> the average salary and wage-earner has only two ways of getting government help in accumulating capital <e> <s> the first is that he pays into a pension fund if he is one of those exempt from the state scheme or into life insurance <e> <s> those two kinds of ownership are now transforming our ownership of capital assets in society a revolution of which in my view we are taking no heed <e> <s> for example we do not realise that pension funds buy four-fifths of government stock and that the post office pension fund has million a day coming in and is almost finding it hard to know where to invest <e> <s> a similar revolution is happening through sales of houses and the government subsidy that goes to them in tax relief <e> <s> this is spreading home ownership and capital and i very much welcome it <e> <s> just as over half the ownership of shares quoted on the stock exchange is in the hands of pension funds and life insurance companies so more than half of our housing stock is now in individual ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question about england wales seems to have had a good time and press the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> is it not the case that the asistance to industry is given under section of the act and that discretionary grants to industry are available under section <e> <s> is it the case that we are to have another statement to meet the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear to indicate that section will be used more liberally and more decisively to assist the areas outside the assisted areas which are black spots of unemployment and which need help as much as and in many cases considerably more than some of the places within the assisted areas <e> <s> is there a further statement due on that <e> <s> because it is of great importance to many areas suffering from very high levels of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord darling of hillsborough i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for what both noble lords particularly the noble lord on the front bench have said <e> <s> i shall see that his remarks are passed on to my noble friend lord darling of hillsborough who cannot be here today <e> <s> on the specific point which the noble lord on the front bench raised i am aware of what was said in committee <e> <s> it should be put on record that the noble lord lord mottistone did not have universal support for the point which he raised and that in addition to the suggestion of a government review of these matters my noble friend suggested that there could possibly be a review of the problem by the law commission <e> <s> i hope if i may say so on my noble friends behalf that that point will also be borne in mind as a possible way forward on the point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> meanwhile i am grateful once again for the kind remarks <e> <s> i hope that the bill can now proceed on its way to the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged for that reply <e> <s> since the venezulan government are in this case denouncing frontier treaties which we have signed are claiming over half the territory of guyana and are being bellicose in order to whip up support for themselves at home may i ask whether the noble lord agrees that potentially at least we have something like a falklands crisis situation brewing here unless every <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord look to see how much further up the severn this could be pressed <e> <s> would it not be a good thing with all the interest in industrial archaeology and the origins of the industrial revolution at ironbridge and with all the traffic that went downriver from ironbridge to bristol and to the rest of the world to see whether the severn could be improved right up to the original places at ironbridge where all this happened <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the problems to which he has referred are very well known to the science committee of the council of europe assembly which has now been trying for some years to get eurocontrol to make annual reports to the assembly committee with a view to co-ordinating all these complaints about it much more effectively and getting a more efficient and economic system <e> <s> up to now quite contrary to what other bodies do eurocontrol has refused to report in this way to the council of europe assembly <e> <s> would it not be a good idea and in everybodys interest in view of what the minister himself has said to reopen the idea of an international assembly of this kind doing a little supervision <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i follow up what was said by the noble baroness opposite <e> <s> can the minister offer some advice and perhaps some reassurance to those authorities which have met the targets set by government and done their best but who now find as the noble lord knows very well that although they would like to get on with a lot of capital expenditure because they have capital available they are deterred from that capital expenditure because of the revenue consequences <e> <s> that is the point which is very worrying to a number of authorities which have done their best to play along with the government rules <e> <s> can the noble lord offer some advice and reassurance to those authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord says about no procrastination but may i put one simple point to him is it not the case that many of the peripheral counties of the country which were previously part of my responsibility at the development commission are having enough difficulty in attracting new industry to diversify their employment base and if there is much delay those difficulties of getting new industry to replace the old and to rebuild their economies are going to be enormously increased <e> <s> industry and new investors are going to wait to see whether any extreme option is chosen by the government <e> <s> therefore is it possible for the noble lord to convey to his right honourable friend the point that it would be a good idea if an early statement were made saying whether any extreme options were under serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say for how many years this would suffice at the present rate of housebuilding <e> <s> is he aware that the national housebuilders feel that this is an overstatement in a sense of the amount of land that really would be helpful to them in getting a faster housing programme going <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that those of us who have been fighting this issue for years in my own case years have some reason to ask the government when they are going to stop dithering on this issue <e> <s> is it not quite clear that the report for which we have all waited very patiently at page makes it quite clear that the medical and other disadvantages of self-selection of reading glasses cause no harm and can be disregarded <e> <s> does it not at page say that consumers have been denied essential knowledge in making their choice of opticians through the ban on advertising <e> <s> is it not quite clear from this report that after all this inquiry it is absolutely time that the government made up their minds <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord ask his honourable friend to receive a deputation from members of this house many of whom have expressed interest in this issue and on occasions like this wave in the air spectacles that cost or even <e> <s> so many of us are anxious to have some action on this instead of more talk <e>", "<cs> my lords i must resist the temptation offered to me by the noble lords lord sandford and lord walston to talk at any length about the suggestion of integrated development programmes for the rural areas much though i should like to be able to do so <e> <s> instead as in previous debates i begin by declaring an interest in that i am a very part-time adviser on environment policy to the eec commission in brussels <e> <s> speaking entirely personally today i want to look at the recommendations of the report particularly concerning directives and in the light of the need to get right the balance between conservation and agriculture <e> <s> if i may suggest it to my noble friend lady llewelyn-davies and the sub-commitee i think they have forgotten one of the committees earlier reports which is relevant and as a result they have not got their recommendations quite right <e>", "<cs> i started with the main quotation and said the witness asked to make a small final comment which he did and it was that <e> <s> it did not give me the impression of being a new dimension to policymaking that we integrate it from the very start but i am anxious to conclude my remarks and will not develop that point further <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i recommend that the noble viscount reads again the committees report on the third environment action programme where it strongly applauds the idea of bringing environmental considerations into each aspect of sectoral policy-making <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one brief moment to say this <e> <s> one of the worries i have is that nowhere in this bill are the problems of the general effects on the environment adequately dealt with <e> <s> the council of europe assembly of which i am a member has just passed a recommendation to ministers backing up a recommendation of the eec commission in brussels that we should now press all governments at every point we can to enforce in policy-making of all kinds right on the ground floor from the very beginning that environmental considerations shall be taken into account <e> <s> too often especially in transport the problem has been that the environmental damage occurs in this case my noble friend is talking about environmental benefits of switching from cars to buses but the whole problem of benefits and disbenefits has been that the environmental disadvantages occur and we then rush in with fire-fighting not in the literal sense activities to try to stop it being at its worst <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government linking this type of activity with the work of the development commission <e> <s> i understand that the development commission can offer per cent <e> <s> grants for the conversion of redundant farm buildings and can offer per cent <e> <s> towards the cost of local authority small workshops <e> <s> do we not need to link the economic revival of the countryside with the beautification of villages <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord lord skelmersdale say whether we are now making the much needed progress in improving the proportion of houses in the starter home range at the bottom of the market <e> <s> that is where we really need more homes particularly with the ending of public sector house building <e> <s> is it not the case that at the bottom end the position is getting better now thanks partly to the equity sharing system which many of us strongly support <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very hard-hitting speech to follow <e> <s> i pay tribute to my noble friend lord rugby who in recent years has been fighting very hard on a trail which started years ago when some of us opposed the opticians act at that time and forecast exactly what would happen over the years <e> <s> i am delighted that not only his pressure but the pressure of other colleagues in this place is now bringing some results and i shall come to that in a moment <e> <s> but what a long trail it has been <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says we soon shall <e> <s> i hope he is correct but i have not had any hint that we are going to see the end tonight <e> <s> anyway we now have the report of the office of fair trading and let us say quite bluntly that it justifies the whole of the fight we have had over the years <e> <s> it comes out totally on our side on the degree of competition and publicity <e> <s> we should go back because people do as though it were the bible to the crook report of <e> <s> over the years everybody has said you must go back to the crook report because everything that has followed has stemmed from it <e> <s> but reading the report what it was saying in and in explicit terms was that it expected the professional activity of eye-testing gradually to become dissociated from the commercial activity of selling frames <e> <s> what the crook report wanted to do quite properly and justifiably was to create a professional optical council for that professional activity alone <e> <s> so nobody should pray in aid the crook report for what is going on now which is the confusion of the two activities under the cloak of professionalism <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that <e> <s> i quite accept the ministers point <e> <s> but what i am saying is that this would be a good thing to take some of the mystique out of all this activity in the country <e> <s> before i come to the end of what might happen if we got a little more competition going we would have to say to the minister that just improving the prices of tests the dispensing fee and all that and having better national health service frames all the things which he has put to us at other times as ways of helping to get the balance right is no substitute for competition <e> <s> you cannot have competition stopped the minute it begins to bite you <e> <s> that is what it is all about in a trade <e> <s> once it begins to bite it is probably being effective <e> <s> you cannot keep using gimmicks to stave off the decision on real competition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to go on from that because what the report also says is that on top of those kinds of price reduction you could obtain a further per cent <e> <s> price reduction if the smaller optician disappeared or at least did the level of trade that competition brings in the more prosperous optician companies <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right to say that prices have gone down <e> <s> but the report says that if real competition took place and the very small optician disappeared or at least got more business at that sort of level of economic activity prices could then be reduced by a further per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been quite helpful <e> <s> however i should not have traded the old act for the new one <e> <s> the commission was making good use of the old act under a sharing of power with government <e> <s> it was unique in the history of bodies of this kind <e> <s> we shall have to watch very carefully whether the one-way street that we are now in in which only the government can give the orders and the commission has no effective right of fight-back with a veto works to the disadvantage of the commission <e> <s> nevertheless i take the general assurances that the noble lord has given <e> <s> we will watch and i shall consider what he has said but for the moment i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should again like to ask the noble lord a question on schedule which governs the <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord pitt with his very eloquent speech and my noble friend lord cledwyn i approach this order with mixed feelings <e> <s> my own particular link with this associated state dates from the s when as i have mentioned to your lordships house before i was sent with sir nigel fisher because of our joint knowledge of this area and of the people concerned to try to prevent the secession of anguilla from this associated state of st kitts-nevis and anguilla <e> <s> the process during which we negotiated with mini-shuttle diplomacy on aeroplanes between anguilla and st kitts was one which i shall remember for the rest of my life <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord on the issue of how early this statement should be <e> <s> is it not the case that we are now in a situation and have been for some time in which there are some areas suffering from high unemployment which have no grants to offer incoming industry and some areas in the assisted areas with much lower unemployment getting automatic grants for incoming industry <e> <s> in other words the policy is to that extent out of date and has been so for two or three years <e> <s> therefore is it not important to get the matter cleared up soon <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord howard will accept a slight sense of fun in what i intend to be a sincere compliment to him on his maiden speech let me say that he was indeed controversial in what he said <e> <s> i heard him say i think during the early part of his remarks that he thought this bill would have a profound effect on the agricultural industry <e> <s> i think he will find he is in a minority in the house in this and it was indeed a very controversial statement to make <e> <s> we shall look forward to hearing his justification of it when we come to committee and to hearing him again on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords instructs the arbitrator <e>", "<cs> one of the two main difficulties that the committee is in is that the noble lord lord belstead when introducing this bill said in column that the minister had emphasised to the nfu and the cla that amendments to the legislation <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he say that in those discussions he will take into account the scottish legislation which after all has been urged on many of us as a model which might be followed <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord renton has moved this amendment rather than remaining silent and letting it be absorbed in the discussions which the noble lord lord belstead has undertaken to have between now and report stage <e> <s> it enables us just to show to the government at least one shot in combining the sort of things that many of us on both sides of the committee would like to see <e> <s> after all this starts with the principle taken by the noble earl lord kinnoull as a starter namely that the normal rent shall be that of the open market <e> <s> then it shows how with clever drafting one can provide modifications to that basis to take account of problems and distortions in the market <e> <s> to that extent i think that it is a good thing that the noble lord lord renton has put this amendment on the marshalled list <e> <s> i hope that it will be actively taken into consideration by the noble lord lord belstead between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord the minister should read on because in the middle of subparagraph <e>", "<cs> i am only trying to loosen up on the guidelines given to the arbitrator and not as drastically with great respect as indicated by the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> just as all relevant factors applies to these parts of the clause so it would apply in his case where he says there would be variations all over the country <e>

lord exaggerated the reply <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord is right <e> <s> perhaps i may explain <e> <s> subsection as drafted states <e>", "<cs> on his existing holding <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is quite right <e> <s> this shows the folly of interfering so far in the operation of the open market <e> <s> noble lords on both sides of the committee have been saying this all day <e>

belstead has had what i would guess will be several days of consultation between now and report he will be able to satisfy us on a number of these points <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that we have made enormous progress on this small but important amendment <e> <s> i feel very happy about the outcome with the kind undertaking that he has given <e> <s> i have great pleasure in asking leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord say to which amendment he is speaking <e>", "<cs> i found this discussion fascinating <e> <s> i was grateful for the olive branch that the noble lord lord stanley of alderley offered me <e> <s> it is not the first time that in the end we have agreed on something after starting with a disagreement <e>", "<cs> that is what the amendment does <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but this is exactly what i said on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is the whole purpose of that amendment <e> <s> the beginning of subsection sets out in one simple sentence that the arbitrator shall take into account exactly what the noble lord has just said namely the fact that the tenant has himself tendered and agreed a high rent for adjoining or nearby land <e> <s> we reached that point i hope on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead said that it looked as though we had a point and that he would take it away and look at it <e> <s> i suggest that he should take away all these suggestions and ask how can we make a creator of mischief in the sense we are talking about that is one who tenders rents which are too high pay some price and not be protected from what he has done himself on any existing rents <e> <s> then we shall all be happy <e> <s> if the noble lord would do that i think we should make progress <e>", "<cs> that is basically the stage we were at earlier <e> <s> if one interferes with the free market and creates a set of protected rent controlled tenants as this bill does you will find exactly that kind of anomaly all the way through <e> <s> that is the problem with this bill as it is drafted <e> <s> that is why the free market must come in in the first place as the basic norm and then we should be aware of and should be careful about the qualifications we place on the operation of the free market <e>", "<cs> my lords since some of us have campaigned for years for a change in the law may we offer at least a guarded welcome for the decision to divorce the commercial aspect of selling spectacles from the medical aspect of testing eyes <e>

lord say which recommendations have been rejected so that we shall know where the government stand on the full body of their report <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we might ask the noble lord lord belstead to be helpful to the committee at this point <e> <s> would he agree that we might have a general debate at this stage about the whole issue of retirement at which arises on my amendment no

in the amendment of the noble earl lord kinnoull <e> <s> may i say i do hope that we can discuss them together so that we can get some response from the minister as to how he sees the whole issue of retirement as opposed to waiting for death and succession <e>", "<cs> i should not have intervened on this matter but for the joke about the pelicans which <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> a is really a paving amendment for amendments nos <e> <s> a b and a <e> <s> then we have amendments nos <e> <s> and which i suggest can be discussed together with these because they were early attempts to do the same work that is done by amendment no <e> <s> a and the amendments consequential on it <e> <s> i shall not be moving the latter amendments if we reach a satisfactory conclusion on amendment no <e>

attempts to meet the points we have been discussing <e> <s> they were amateur attempts by me at drafting <e> <s> it was when mr derek wood and the agricultural law association provided us with amendments nos <e> <s> a a <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been more than generous and i am very happy indeed to ask the committees permission to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> perhaps he will consider the amendments in the three names of myself and my noble friends they are the substantial amendments that we hope will form the basis of a new set of amendments that could come <e>", "<cs> i confess that i did not think that section went as far as i was hoping to indicate <e> <s> i shall leave it that i would prefer to study what the noble earl has said and then perhaps come back with a redraft at report stage if i can improve on the matter <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i make two short preliminary points on fixedterm tenancies <e> <s> first we must not forget that the possibility of short term tenancies already exists under section of the and acts <e> <s> the minister has already said that the government are clarifying the rules that they apply in using those two parts of the existing legislation <e> <s> it would be helpful to know tonight to what extent they propose to clarify them and to use them in future to allow a farmers son to take over for five years or whatever period it may be <e>", "<cs> this is the most difficult point in the amendment of the noble viscount <e> <s> i support his amendment in principle but when my committee studied this matter we suggested that notice could be given between the seventh and tenth years <e> <s> however we also said that the tenancies would be terminable if the authorities could at the time of termination offer a larger holding suitable to the needs and resources of the tenant in terms of size and type of enterprise or which met criteria agreed between the parties when the first tenancy was granted <e> <s> in other words we could not see the tenant young or old as he might be simply thrown out over seven years with no hope at all <e>", "<cs> i hope the minister will be sympathetic to the principle of the amendment despite the fact that we have made a mistake in drafting <e> <s> as i understand it and i am no expert on the matter landlordshave virtually given up trying to get certificates of bad husbandry <e> <s> it is almost impossible given the case law and the particular difficulties in every case <e> <s> we really need now to follow up the recommendation in my committees report paragraph which stated that the procedure <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is not the onus to some extent on the minister <e> <s> does he not agree that the present law has almost become a dead letter and that it is not possible under the present law to carry out the intentions of parliament namely to facilitate getting possession in a case of bad farming <e> <s> if that is the case may i suggest that the onus is partly on him to try to find a way of tightening up the act <e> <s> otherwise we shall end up by saying there it is and nothing has been done about it <e>", "<cs> as far as i can see i do not think that it is retrospective because it would insert the power of the tribunal to apply a notice to quit from the date of the passing of the act <e> <s> therefore it would be up to landlords at any time after the passing of the act to go to the tribunal and say that they would like to contest the power of the successor to inherit the whole of the tenancy <e> <s> the landlords would say we think that it is more than one viable unit and we are prepared to let the land to somebody else <e> <s> no i do not think that it would be retrospective <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the fact is that it is amateur drafting by me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said and i strongly agree with him that consultation has its price <e> <s> the price is delay now in concrete changes to the system of regional assistance <e> <s> so will it not be something like a year before there are any real changes to announce <e> <s> if i am right about that i wonder whether the noble lord would care to comment on and at least convey to his right honourable friend the problems of this interim period <e>", "<cs> i have a good deal of sympathy with the amendment and i was rather surprised by the remarks of the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> the fact is as he says that the power existed in the minister until and was then abolished <e> <s> it may well be that <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene again but i find the ministers reply disappointing <e> <s> certainly my committee said that we quite understood there should not be a blanket veto on all sales and that is why i nodded my head because there was need to rationalise estates and perhaps to sell some land in order to buy other land and make particular units more viable which is part of the direction given under the act <e>", "<cs> in this country there has been a long tradition of public and semi-public ownership of land <e> <s> that is the very first point i want to register with the committee <e> <s> ownership by the government government departments local authorities and so on is already per cent <e> <s> of the land area of this country <e> <s> that is a substantial slice of the let sector <e> <s> in the past the church the crown the oxbridge colleges and other such institutions have performed a valuable function in maintaining the let sector <e> <s> they have been perhaps almost as important as private landlords in maintaining the tradition of good estate management and the principle of the intimate management of estates <e>", "<cs> not true <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might explain briefly the reasons why there will not be much attempt to press this issue <e> <s> i believe my noble friend is referring mainly to the financial institutions namely insurance companies pension funds property unit trusts and property bonds <e> <s> i believe that any amendment or any debate which adds fuel to the fire about those institutions is to be regretted <e> <s> the position is that those institutions own only about per cent <e> <s> of land <e> <s> they are unlikely to own any more than per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> even on recent trends of acquisitions in another years time <e> <s> i would guess that as there has been some retrenchment they are unlikely ever to reach that figure now <e> <s> so any attempt to make them scapegoats is in some sense a mistake <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> before i offer just a few words of encouragement to the noble earl lord caithness may i say to my noble friend lord john-mackie that i apologise if he thought i was accusing him of hysteria <e> <s> his gentle restrained and equable character is not one that would attract that sort of accusation at any time <e> <s> i was really saying that we must not add to the hysteria about institutions that undoubtedly exists outside this chamber <e> <s> that is what is worrying me and has worried me for many years <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question in the hope that the minister will reply on this <e> <s> as i understand the present situation with regard to smallholdings succession is governed by the smallholdings selection of tenants amendment regulations <e> <s> what they do is to tell county councils that although smallholdings are outside the act they should consider certain specified near relatives of the deceased tenant as successors and only to consider other applications when these have proved unsuitable <e> <s> is it still the case that the act although not now applying is continued by these regulations <e> <s> if that is so would the amendment overtake the regulations as well <e> <s> in other words would we find that those regulations were effectively being annulled <e> <s> it is important to know where we would end up if the amendment were agreed to <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are taking all amendments between nos <e> <s> and i would say that my amendment no <e> <s> b hardly falls in the general discussion <e> <s> so i should like to reserve the right to say something about that separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are due for a speech from this side of the house <e> <s> first i should <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another point <e> <s> the noble earl has made the point successfully <e> <s> i did not want to repeat it <e> <s> i think that he is right and that farmers will be able to get their rents down at rent reviews under the present draft if they have offered silly money for it in the past <e> <s> if so the situation is even worse than i had imagined <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i had not realised and do not yet realise until i have studied what has been said that amendment no <e> <s> could possibly cover my point <e> <s> however the noble lord has generously conceded that the point must be taken into account and therefore for the moment my best plan is to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the little debate that we have had has been very interesting because it has raised two matters which have always amused me in this house one is that when we want to disregard scottish parallels we do so by saying why should we follow scotland <e> <s> but we now have it plotted out the other way <e> <s> the government want it both ways <e> <s> this time they want to say of course we should always keep in line with scotland <e> <s> it is funny how it is used one way one day and the other way another day according to the suitability of the circumstances for the minister concerned <e> <s> therefore i think that that falls by itself <e> <s> at this point i do not think that the scots got it right anyway and therefore i do not think we should follow it <e> <s> nor is their precise situation on holdings similar <e>", "<cs> my lords to use my own words the noble earl was saying that it is such a substantial departure from the scottish formula <e> <s> never mind he was having it both ways as ministers do <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> my instinct is to withdraw it and to ask the noble earl at least to have some talks about it <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead was extremely helpful during earlier stages of the bill and if he would by a nod of the head indicate that we will have another talk about this it would not close doors <e> <s> if i were to divide on this and be voted down by the troops who have obviously turned up given the number in the divisions earlier on it would not help me to get a bit of common sense on to the statute book <e> <s> if the noble earl would agree to have another chat about this with those of us from all sides of the house not just on this side who see the force of trying to get common ground extended this little step further i should be more than content to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i will even try knocking at the noble earls door between now and third reading <e> <s> but i shall move it and probably press it on third reading <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords when i moved amendment no <e> <s> b the noble lord was good enough to say that he thought this amendment covered the point i was making in amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> i have taken some advice and i do not think that that is so <e> <s> in this amendment he is talking about marriages i am talking about something quite separate <e> <s> perhaps i could leave it that if the noble lord would be kind enough to look again at what i said on amendment no <e> <s> b we could then have some further discussion about it as he indicated that amendment no <e> <s> b raised a matter that ought to be covered somewhere <e> <s> if i may hold him to that i would simply say that i am advised that amendment no <e> <s> does not cover my point <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i was grateful to the noble lord lord belstead for writing to me to explain that he had not yet been able to sort out the mass of problems i agree that they are horrific that surround the problem of eligibility to succession and that he would be trying to complete his discussions in time for an amendment on third reading <e> <s> i accept very much what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i am glad that what he proposes is an important step along that road and that more will follow at third reading <e> <s> meanwhile i express warm thanks to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords this series of amendments meets all the points we raised at committee stage and covers the recommendation that my committee made in paragraph <e> <s> those of us who tried amateur drafting at committee stage to cover this point were devastated to find that when it is done properly it needs nine pages <e> <s> it shows how far astray we can be when as amateurs we try to do the job of the parliamentary draftsmen <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> if i may make one brief comment my impression it is no more than that because i have not followed the matter so closely as i ought to have done in the years since the report was published is that county councils have been spending some years upon reorganising their system of smallholdings and with amalgamations have been trying to produce larger more viable holdings <e> <s> i feel that if the county councils were in a position to give people a start on a small smallholding of perhaps or acres they would be encouraged by the amendment to say that they must continue the reorganisation of their holdings in order to provide holdings of particular sizes so that there is a ladder up which people can move <e> <s> although the noble lord is quite right in saying that very few people do move at the moment i believe that that movement could be encouraged by allowing the county councils to pursue further reorganisations and provide a ladder whereby they could make use of the provision if it becomes law <e> <s> therefore i beg the noble lord to think about this point which would be in line with what the county councils association have in mind <e> <s> nevertheless after the kind undertaking which the noble lord has given to consider the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble earl is persevering with this matter <e> <s> it is a very difficult point <e> <s> getting certificates of bad husbandry is like getting a camel through the eye of a needle as i understand it <e> <s> landlords now have almost given up trying <e> <s> such case law surrounds this aspect and there is such difficulty in proving deterioration of the land which is essentially the important point in obtaining a certificate of bad husbandry that the likelihood of getting a refusal has deterred landlords from even trying even when they know that tenants are well below standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to prolong the debate and i shall be extremely brief <e> <s> may i just say to the noble lord lord monk bretton that he might care to look at the section of the northfield report which deals with smallholdings <e> <s> he will find that we had some good figures like those given by the noble lord lord northbourne about the effects of small sums put aside for pension <e> <s> but we made one other vital point which has not been mentioned that provision for retirement should he included and regarding not only money but a house <e> <s> that of course is very important for many small farmers who on compulsory retirement would find themselves out of a home <e> <s> that is a very important extra issue that should be taken into account as well as the issue of pension <e>", "<cs> the tribunal my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful <e> <s> i did not read amendment no <e> <s> in that way <e> <s> it is my mistake i freely admit <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks amendment meets the point i will be absolutely delighted <e> <s> i have read it several times but i do not understand it in that way <e> <s> let us proceed and see whether the noble lord can explain when we reach it <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble earl knows i have a good deal of sympathy for this principle <e> <s> i intervene very briefly to say that i think the minister will say that he will do something about this kind of case under section that he will start making provision for this kind of case with three- to five-year tenancies <e> <s> if the minister says that as we strongly suspect he will please will be reconsider the three to five years <e> <s> it is unduly restrictive given the needs of cases like this <e> <s> it ought to be wider than three to five years <e> <s> if he would make it wider than three to five <e>", "<cs> my lords the reply was not unexpected of course <e> <s> may i say two things very briefly first i am astonished to hear the noble earl say that the government are now disposing of their let land to make it all into owner-occupier land <e> <s> that really is a bit much to hear at this time <e> <s> here we have a bill the prime aim of which is to preserve the let sector and the government now announce that they are going to ruin their own let sector by selling it off to owner-occupiers something they are hoping that all the other landlords will not do <e> <s> here they are telling the private landlord look we want to encourage you to let stop selling it off to owner-occupiers <e> <s> yet tonight the government are saying we are not <e>", "<cs> my lords i got into hot water with my noble friend at committee stage and so i shall be as inoffensive to him as possible tonight in the hope that i can persuade him that this is not a very good idea <e> <s> the problem mentioned by the noble earl is not so small as he made out in referring to a few thousand people <e> <s> the point is that it is a figure of million people who have invested in pension funds <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but we took an estimate that there would still be a let sector of a certain figure in the th century <e> <s> i do not depart from that and i do not think that the facts have changed <e> <s> i do not think that my noble friend need be so alarmist <e> <s> it will be very small and something could be done to make it better <e> <s> but it will not be the minimal figure that he is suggesting and we were suggesting that there should be guidelines to cover his point <e> <s> i repeat what has been said from all sides that you cannot impose restrictions on one kind of private landlord which you are not prepared to impose on them all <e> <s> that is the simple commentary on his case <e> <s> let us move towards guidelines for all private owners including the institutions if that is what he wants <e>", "<cs> my lords i have enormous sympathy with what my noble friend on the front bench is trying to achieve <e> <s> i support strongly the aim of his amendment although not its precise drafting <e> <s> the noble viscount is not being as frank as he normally is to the house because although he knows well that some counties are selling simply to get rid of uneconomic units or for laudable purposes of management others are not so enamoured of having smallholdings as we should all like them to be <e> <s> i put that at its lowest in order to offend nobody <e> <s> in other words some county councils want to get rid of their smallholdings in principle or at least to cut them down significantly <e> <s> or some parties on some county councils wish to do so <e> <s> that is the kind of situation that this amendment is really aimed at to keep a substantial volume of smallholdings <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down would he go one step further and be prepared to say that the government do want smallholdings very broadly to be kept at their present acreage <e> <s> further would he be prepared to offer guidance to county councils that they should seek the sort of solutions which we outline namely if they insist on selling considerable areas they should see that the land does not go out of smallholding use <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say thank you to the noble lord because this is a very important provision indeed <e> <s> i am slightly surprised that the nfu in fact accepted it <e> <s> i believe i can offer a further compliment to the noble lord because taken with clause it should mean more tenancies it really should <e> <s> it will mean that land that would otherwise be taken on by a successor will become available and in the light of clause relating to the limitation to one generation the landlord will be more inclined to let the land than to sell it with vacant possession or to farm it in hand <e> <s> with goodwill on all sides and full realisation of what this involves i believe that this provision will probably do more to increase the number of farms available for rent than almost any other part of the bill <e>", "<cs> we are all indebted to the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe for spotting this point in the bill <e> <s> i must confess that anyone who follows these matters must be very puzzled by the present drafting of sub-paragraphs and on page of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will address himself to this point when he replies because what the sub-paragraphs seem to say is that the occupier whose consent is needed for these works will not have sufficient authority to give his consent unless he has had an agreement in writing from the landowner that he shall have this authority to give such consents <e> <s> i have rather convoluted it but what it seems to say <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged <e> <s> i am with the noble lord lord howard of henderskelfe all the way <e> <s> all i want to say is that the right of the occupier to give these consents seems to be limited to cases where he has an authorisation of some kind from the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he answer my question about what happens under sub-paragraph if landlords begin to say in leases that they specifically withdraw from the occupier the right to give these consents <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press my amendment <e> <s> this discussion will i hope be looked at in another place because i still think there is merit in the case and the amendment perhaps redrafted in the form suggested by my noble friend lord john-mackie <e> <s> i am not absolutely sure that it needs redrafting because it has to be a comparable holding so that even if it is slightly distant it would still fall within the general terms of that part of the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i think it might well be redrafted and pressed in another place and come back to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he has misread the bill <e> <s> it does not say in his opinion anywhere so that confusion does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not at all happy and i join the noble earls lord kinnoull and lord caithness in saying that i am sure we shall see trouble as a result of the drafting of the bill in its present form <e> <s> i will simply repeat what the noble earl lord swinton said at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that our report should be called in aid too much on this point <e> <s> i think that the committee was really dealing only with retirement at that point <e> <s> it may be that we just failed to consider the idea of handing over earlier <e> <s> i would resist using the report in this context <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the words of thanks to the noble lord lord belstead who has been extremely courteous to us all not only in the chamber but outside and in private meetings <e> <s> i have said before that i do not recall ministers being quite so courteous before and he has excelled in that direction <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for what he said about <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a couple of questions of the movers of the amendment <e> <s> i see this in everyday life as the chairman of a new town where we have dwellings such as this <e> <s> i wonder whether they could face up to the problem which i am having to weigh up in my mind which is that some of these people were tenants of a house before an adaptation took place <e> <s> for many years they have felt that they would like to own their own homes <e> <s> they see their neighbours who have not perhaps fallen on unfortunate days and do not have the misfortune of being disabled buying their houses <e> <s> suddenly because adaptations are made to their houses they are disqualified in the queue <e> <s> this could cause a great deal of anguish to those people who feel that their misfortune has meant that they are doubly <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for helping with the phrase doubly penalised <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord bellwin replied to the last amendment he said we all admire his patience and skill in dealing with the matters that we were on difficult issues on which we were seeking the balance of argument <e> <s> this is supremely the case on this matter <e> <s> briefly i wish to consider the conflicting considerations which must be in all our minds before adding some new points to the debate <e>", "<cs> there are two points i should like to mention <e> <s> first we should bear in mind that the original cost of a house is a floor through which the price cannot go <e> <s> so let us not exaggerate the effect of the discount <e> <s> in other words the effect of the discount does not allow the authority to sell the house below the original cost <e> <s> that is an important point to bear in mind and so we should not exaggerate on this <e>", "<cs> before the minster replies i should like to point out that i suspect that the point which the noble lord lord monson is raising is covered in paragraph <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may press my point <e> <s> what is the test of what is reasonable <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is missing my point <e> <s> the test of whether or not the land shall be included shall be if the tenant serves the notice and <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene but i was a little upset with what the minister said when he talked about a pyrrhic victory on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i do not know whether the committee had time to take in what he said because he said it rather quickly but i press him not to reconsider the offer he made <e> <s> he said that if the government did try to overturn the decision of the committee they might also at this point forget the offer they had made about looking into the idea of increased powers of pre-emption in order to satisfy some of the concern in the committee <e> <s> i hope that he will not stick to the immediate points that he made then <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion but i think that my noble friend has perhaps slightly misunderstood what i have said <e> <s> when the noble lord lord bellwin talked about a pyrrhic victory he was almost hinting and he has now said that he heard what i said that he would not come back with a revised clause giving greater control over pre-emption to the local authorities if at the same time the government decided to try to overturn the decision of the committee <e> <s> all i am saying is that i hope he will still go on with the thoughts that he ventured to the committee about an improved clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord bellwin recognises that there is a certain illogicality about part of what he has said to the committee this afternoon <e> <s> he said that he accepted the sensitivities of the charitable housing associations and recognised to some extent their anxiety about keeping their stock at its present level and not having to reduce it so that they can continue to cater for the particular classes of people whom they house <e> <s> the noble lord said that because he recognised the sensitivities and the needs of the charitable housing associations he had found some extra money <e>", "<cs> no perhaps not everybody but most people would have been happy <e> <s> i get some support from my noble friend on one side if not from <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that in this clash of extreme opinions from the two sides there is room for somebody standing more to the middle in this argument <e> <s> at least that is where i shall try to stand this evening <e> <s> if one takes a rather longer historical perspec-tive we all end up somewhere with the noble lord lord thorneycroft <e> <s> in a sense this unhappy bill is everybodys fault and nobodys fault <e> <s> it is everybodys fault including all of us in this chamber because in the past years we have not got right the boundaries between the powers of local government and the powers of central government a matter to which the noble lord lord thorneycroft referred <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment perhaps i may say that since second reading i have listened to many of these debates and to the various currents of opinion <e> <s> i remain exactly of the opinion that i had at second reading namely that i cannot find gross constitutional impropriety in this bill as was alleged on so many sides <e> <s> i cannot agree with most of the more extravagant criticisms of it <e> <s> but i feel very strongly that the right limitation to put on this bill is a limitation of time <e> <s> i should like at some time to be able to deploy that case even if we do not do it now <e> <s> so if the noble lord is going to withdraw the amendment i think that we should reserve the position and say that there will come a time when we want to say the point at which we draw the line in this bill <e> <s> i can go along with a lot of the governments thinking on this bill but not so far as to writing this bill permanently into law <e> <s> i hope we can express that at some time even if it is not tonight <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is tempting and i do not want to deploy the general case but the honest answer to him is that we have different objectives <e> <s> my objective in putting a limitation on the bill is not the same as that of the noble lord <e> <s> my objective is to force the government to seek more radical solutions to the whole area of conflict which underlines this bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to cross swords with my noble friend but i strongly disagree with what he is saying and i think it is high time that most of us put on record our view about this <e> <s> could i deal first with the point raised by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> i know that he is an assiduous student of what happens in another place but i think he must have missed the debate on nd may in another place when the minister of health dealt with precisely the point he has raised today <e> <s> the issue is what sort of protection will be given to people in relation to the quality of <e>", "<cs> i do not want to give way because i shall be too long if i do <e> <s> the noble lord has his name to the amendment and he can reply to me at the end <e> <s> what the office of fair trading report also showed was that the other problem in the opticians industry is that many are under-occupied <e> <s> they are protected by high prices and so do a small number of prescriptions every year <e> <s> the office of fair trading went on to find <e>", "<cs> yes it is worse <e>", "<cs> even when it is free <e>", "<cs> they are not <e>", "<cs> the debate has gone exactly as i forecast <e> <s> the memories of the agricultural holdings bill debates are reinforced because i see that the noble lord lord belstead who was resisting the open market in farm rents has now been brought in to reinforce the front bench in resisting the free market on this issue too <e> <s> it is amazing how hard it is to drag the tory party towards the free market and i must confess that on matters like this i am beginning to despair of them <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness looked at me when she was talking about a compromise <e> <s> i want to make clear that this is not a compromise between me or the people who i stand with and anybody <e> <s> this is a compromise between the people who do not want to do anything at all and the government <e> <s> it is going one step back compared with the bill <e> <s> it is certainly not a compromise with us <e> <s> therefore <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not look at me when speaking on this issue <e> <s> she has the wrong compromise in mind <e> <s> she wants to go further back than the government <e> <s> goodness knows they have not gone far enough <e> <s> the noble baroness has it wrong <e>", "<cs> i shall not enter the general argument but i wonder whether the noble lord would care to look into the point that if an amendment on these lines were to be moved at report stage the best place to make this amendment would be in the definitions of the words optical appliance at the end of the act <e> <s> in case we wish to return to this matter at the report stage perhaps he would write to me and confirm that that is the best drafting advice that the government can give <e>", "<cs> i do not want to intervene at any length on this but i think my noble friend may find it is already covered by the bill <e> <s> that is for the government to say <e> <s> while i am on my feet and it is the only opportunity we have i think we should give a welcome to this relaxation on advertising <e> <s> my noble friends on this side of the chamber often wonder why we distrust opticians to some extent <e> <s> if my noble friend would only reflect on the job we had to get opticians to display prices my goodness the pressure and the years it took to get that <e> <s> and even then they only carried the display of prices by i think one vote on the general optical council <e> <s> it was absolutely disgraceful <e>", "<cs> i thought that the matter was covered at the bottom of page by the orders which the privy council can make <e> <s> if i have misled the noble lord i apologise <e> <s> i said that it was not for me to dictate to him the answer that the government would make <e> <s> the government have given the right answer though it was not the one i thought <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bellwin knows that i have not been hostile to this bill <e> <s> indeed as he knows i firmly recognise the problems which the government have with certain high-spending local authorities <e> <s> at second reading i ventured to suggest that any government would have had to rein back the expectations that we had built up in the s about local government activity and local government spending <e> <s> i suggested that i was shocked that many of these high spenders have not used lamsac the local authority management body to get their costs under control <e> <s> i said that i could not find that the rate capping of authorities out of was some kind of constitutional scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords when ministers have to eat their words it is very often astonishing how they lack any sense of contrition <e> <s> i suppose they always say it only goes to show how much we have listened to your lordships <e> <s> but in this particular case the change of mind has been quite dramatic <e> <s> this issue was raised by the noble earl lord caithness on nd november in the committee proceedings <e> <s> at col i of <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would be kind enough to give way perhaps i may ask him to look at amendment no <e> <s> which was moved by the noble earl lord caithness on nd november last which was <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express my appreciation <e> <s> this was an issue in respect of which the noble lord was kind enough to write to me and say that the government were having great difficulty in <e>", "<cs> my lords before we part with these commons amendments i should like to ask the minister whether he is now satisfied that in the proceedings in another place all the points we talked about but could not finally draft or agree upon terms of drafting have now been picked up in the commons <e> <s> there were so many under the heading of eligibility retirement and so on where we were breaking new ground that i must confess that at the end of the proceedings i was not sure whether we had finally buttoned everything up <e> <s> is the minister fairly happy to say that everything was picked up so far as he now knows <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> i did not understand what he said properly <e> <s> he said that the statutory right of a trade unionist appointee needs to be removed to make way for single parents disabled people and so on <e> <s> why does one have to remove a right to bring other people on to the panel <e>", "<cs> i do not want to start a debate on this amendment but it should be recognised that what the noble lord lord cullen is doing is going back to clause and second reading <e> <s> he is really saying that it is wrong to allow unqualified people to provide spectacles not to do testing not to do the professional work but to do the commercial job of selling spectacles <e> <s> we have had this out time and again on second reading and in the debates on clause <e> <s> i suggest that that argument is now past and that this is a very late stage at which to introduce this great principle all over again as an argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> i would say to the noble lord lord broxbourne that i am a supporter of the bill let there be no doubt about that <e> <s> the bill is a step towards liberalisation <e> <s> it will in my view bring down prices <e> <s> so do not let us divide too much over this issue <e> <s> i want to take the reform one stage further but i applaud the step that is in the bill already <e>", "<cs> my lords per cent <e> <s> over <e> <s> that does not alter what i am going to say <e> <s> one then has to ask how many people would be at risk if this freedom were available <e> <s> the office of fair trading estimates that if this freedom were allowed only per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the population would buy these reading spectacles <e> <s> so the only people at risk would be per cent <e> <s> of that per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> only per cent <e> <s> of that per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> who availed themselves of the freedom would be at risk of non-dectection of glaucoma <e> <s> are we going to legislate or continue to demand that the whole of the nation should be tested in this way for glaucoma on first referral which is all that it is and very often it is wrong simply because only per cent <e> <s> of to per <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to disagree with the noble lord lord cullen of ashbourne <e> <s> he is such a gentle and courteous person that i should never chose him for my enemy <e> <s> you always faint before someone who deals with you so charmingly <e> <s> i would question the first part of the noble lords amendment because it simply restates the legislation namely that optical applicances should be sold by a qualified person <e> <s> all the noble lord is doing is trying in the latter part of his amendment to leave open the door for unregistered people subject to certain rules being made <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he is saying that the protection for the consumer is to take the product to the local trading standards officer if it does not reach the british standard set down <e> <s> is that the protection that the bill is now setting out <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have a great deal of sympathy for what my noble friend has said i wonder whether there may be questions to ask and positive proposals to make <e> <s> the first point i should like to make is that i understand the subsidy on nhs frames to have been about <e> <s> faced with priority spending choices any minister would probably say that it is worth saving on the mass subsidisation of spectacles for use in a much more direct way in order to help those who are particularly disadvantaged <e> <s> there are many people your lordships included who do not need the subsidy on nhs spectacles <e> <s> there is therefore the danger of exaggerating this point <e> <s> the stage had been reached where the subsidy was not totally justified <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister replies i should like to say i am bound to register a protest <e> <s> he said the consumer can be relied upon not to go back if the spectacles are wrong he will not go back and be caught a second time <e> <s> but this is the whole case on reading spectacles and all the other libertarian things we have been talking about <e> <s> today the consumer is sensible enough not to need to be patronised led and kept in napkins for the rest of his life <e> <s> it is astonishing that the minister can say that on this amendment and not apply the very same reasoning to the need to have in the first place freedom to choose whether to buy spectacles without a prescription <e> <s> i am in favour of the noble lords philosophy <e> <s> why cannot he apply it evenly right across the board <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may say to the noble lord lord mottistone that in so far as any of us have been critical of aspects of the profession it is because of the difficulty under which opticians are placed by the act <e> <s> i have tried studiously not to make very many criticisms of opticians but rather to refer to the consumer <e> <s> in so far as i have said anything it is because the act puts the optician in an impossible position as i tried to say way back in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how grateful i am to the ministers on the government <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> perhaps i can rephrase the remark in a way which does not upset my noble friend <e> <s> she implied that after the bill becomes law someone serving at a shop counter who has very little knowledge will go into a back room and start making up spectacles <e> <s> that is no more likely to happen after the bill becomes law than before because in this trade this task is performed by a highly professional separate company which does it for many opticians <e> <s> it is a highly skilled task that nobody pretends to do in a back room <e>", "<cs> my lords as in previous debates of this kind i declare my interest as one of an international group of four of five special advisers to the commissioner in brussels who handles environment policy but of course in this debate i speak for myself <e> <s> i say straight away that the commissioner dr narjes was enstranced if i may use that word by the red report when i was able to communicate it to him in brussels <e> <s> he was very anxious to consider the positive suggestions that are in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall resist the temptation to fight old battles and go over old ground <e> <s> we are not here debating the principle of this matter which was decided in the act of parliament <e> <s> we are talking about the machinery for implementing it and i do not really want to go over the whole of that old debate again <e> <s> i would however just comment on three points which have been made by my noble friend lord ennals and echoed by other speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is the case slightly less often on this issue but the fact is that everybody is complaining about the high prices of spectacles and is saying that it is about time there was some competition in order to bring down the prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no idea and it is not my business <e> <s> if he wants to take the risk of doing this in providing a commercial service blooming good luck to him is all i can say <e> <s> a very good precedent is being set by this first step into a competitive situation by the young people who are doing this job very well in victoria <e> <s> i congratulate them wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i would be wasting your lordships time <e> <s> these are ones i had on prescription <e> <s> i do not know the price because they came in a package but i remember the cheque i wrote was for <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be a good idea to have consultations on the figure of a maximum tolerance of <e> <s> my guess is that it should be something like in other words that it should probably be double what it is <e> <s> could there not be some discussions on whether that would be acceptable

about reducing profits to drug companies under the price regulation scheme will the minister give an assurance that on this occasion there will be full consultation with the industry rather than a unilateral decision <e> <s> secondly will he assure us that the cost of research which up to now has been funded under the agreement concerning the pprs will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the work of post buses that is those involving carrying of passengers by people delivering <e>", "<cs> my lords since we are talking about development corporations is it not the case that this side of the house has been fully in favour of these kinds of development corporations throughout the sixties and seventies and even the eighties <e> <s> is not the docklands corporation another example of showing how the success of the new towns is now being applied in the urban situation in a special form <e> <s> since it is now an ongoing success are the government giving consideration to applying this success in a purely urban regeneration situation to other parts of britain that could do with some help from development corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope to deal in particular for a few moments with what was said at the committee stage about this matter and perhaps to push the government a little further along the road that they seemed to be half willing to travel when a reply was made to the debate at that time <e> <s> but before i do so perhaps i should say that i have a double interest here <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl not intending to say a word about the section power <e> <s> this is the nub of the debate which we have raised <e> <s> i took down his words <e> <s> he said that the local district authorities will have the resources as well as the power <e> <s> they will not have the resources if they are already spending a p rate on this matter <e> <s> they cannot make up for the reduction in spending by the disappearance of the metropolitan councils <e> <s> this was the nub of the issue raised at committee stage <e> <s> i have raised it again now and the noble earl has not said a word about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl does not know his local government legislation <e> <s> the fact is that the councils are limited to a p rate by section of the act <e> <s> all funding has to come out of that <e> <s> if a precept is reduced they do not have more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not enter into an argument with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i simply disagree with him <e> <s> if i paraphrase what he read out from the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this co-ordination of foreign policy in the ec has been proceeding quite happily for six years or more <e> <s> most noble lords will be aware of that fact <e> <s> has this not led quite happily to the presentation of a co-ordinated ec view on specific issues of foreign policy sometimes in such forums as the united nations with very good <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount replies may i put a specific point to him <e> <s> i join with others in being grateful for this change of heart <e> <s> but anyone who reads the report of the proceedings in the other place will find that the government spokesmen on several occasions said that they would have to think about certain matters that were raised with a view to possible correction in this chamber <e> <s> as we meet this afternoon we have not yet seen any government amendments put down they may be down but they have not been published <e> <s> i have asked in the printed paper office and have not found any government amendments there <e> <s> in that case can the noble viscount guarantee that they will be put down today because it would be most unfortunate if we received them only on thursday morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed for the kind remarks of the noble earl about my own contribution to this issue and i shall say a little more about that in a moment <e> <s> in the meantime i express my very warm thanks for his kindness <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell us whether he has made an attempt to ask the deer society to do the culling for him because i should be surprised if they had not taken up his request <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest as a member of the board of directors of wembley stadium <e> <s> i was unable to be here on th july but i read the debate on that occasion and i have read what was said in another place on rd july <e> <s> first i found myself deeply concerned that the noble lord lord glenarthur in speaking on the second reading debate singled out wembley for special mention as if in some way wembley was one of the worst places for rowdiness and crowd misbehaviour <e> <s> the noble lords honourable friend the minister of state did the same thing in the other place <e> <s> we do not have any problems of this kind at wembley stadium and we have had only one isolated problem of this kind which arose about years ago <e> <s> therefore it was rather hard on us to be singled out for special mention as one of the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness add to the answer she gave a couple of weeks ago about a small secretariat to further political co-operation <e> <s> in particular can she say whether other countries of the nine have agreed to this or have commented on it <e>", "<cs> my lords in case there is some misapprehension about the costs of recruiting of this kind is the noble lord aware that in the case of my own new town we recruit new jobs from japan and america at a cost of something like a job and not at the astronomical figures which are often bandied about <e> <s> also in case there is some feeling that cash incentives are not important may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that in many cases they are critical at the last stage and in this respect that one of the difficulties we face in england is that the scottish and welsh development agencies have far too much money to hand out in grants of this kind leaving urban areas of england far behind in the queue <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask a question about the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware as he mentioned in his original statement that one of the primary defences of the pharmaceutical industry has been taken away namely the state of the art defence <e> <s> can he tell us what the directive puts in its place as some means of compensating the pharmaceutical industry <e> <s> secondly can the noble lord tell us whether measures may emerge from these consultations which he is about to have which may bring it within the discretion of the united kingdom government to provide compensation for the pharmaceutical industry in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall put it in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that to the relief of many of us who have been working on the matter for so many years the council of the european economic community has recently passed a directive on environment impact assessment <e> <s> is not this pre-eminently the kind of project that will be covered by that directive in which case there will be a compulsory need for an environment impact assessment before this scheme or any scheme like it is allowed to go ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to return to the noble lord but he did not really answer me adequately <e> <s> is it not important to reassure the people of an area such as this that this kind of protect is pre-eminently one that is covered by the new ec directive and that they should therefore feel assured that the procedure set out in that directive involving a full environment impact assessment will be followed before there is any question of allowing the kind of development that is the subject of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest as i have done before in that i am an adviser to a pharmaceutical company <e> <s> but i hope that my record in putting through your lordships house not once but several times legislation to protect deer from cruelty shows that i am not exactly indifferent indeed quite the contrary in matters of animal welfare <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may add one or two words <e> <s> if the noble earl had not risen i was going to quote his very eloquent words at second reading on this point <e> <s> they hit me very forcibly when i read them in col of <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might suggest one flaw in the two amendments apart from the fact that i believe it is better to leave it to the home secretary to satisfy himself that the applicant has had an appropriate level of training <e> <s> as i read the bill as drafted the effect of the amendment would be this <e> <s> if you have someone who is going to be trained under a licensee i shall take this slowly because it is slightly complicated he has himself to have a licence <e> <s> so you would end up with this amendment in the rather ridiculous situation that a person who is just beginning to be trained would never be able to have a clearance because he had no experience in anaesthesia analgesia and so forth <e> <s> therefore you would have a self-defeating situation for someone who is about to start training <e> <s> he would never be allowed to start training because he could not get a licence <e> <s> in those circumstances i believe that the amendments are almost a nonsense <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one or two remarks <e> <s> on the face of it no one can complain that my noble friend wants to put this matter clearly in front of the secretary of state but the sort of thing that he talked about gives a false impression <e> <s> it is too bad of him to say that some of what he calls the me too drugs are sought for by an irresponsible industry trying to woo or to look after rich patients <e> <s> that is an exaggeration which now that it is on the record must be counteracted <e>", "<cs> i do not like to cross swords again with my noble friend but i have to take the amendment as it is drafted it says <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> i was relieved when the noble lord defined it as beauty preparations rather than as cosmetics because cosmetics cover some important things as the noble lord lord auckland said such as soap toothpaste and shampoo <e> <s> i feel that the noble lord is firing at the wrong target <e> <s> i am no expert but i helped the cosmetics industry to get its case heard in brussels as the noble lord will be glad to hear to prevent the necessity for the retesting of hundreds of their products <e> <s> at last i think we have reached agreement in brussels so that many of them do not need to be retested <e> <s> although i have no brief for the industry i still think that we should be looking at what is in the ec directive of <e> <s> this is the real problem <e>", "<cs> i should like quickly to say to my noble friend that it is in the guidelines on page paragraph <e>", "<cs> the only problem i see in this amendment is that what can start as a thoroughly approved experiment and treatment of an animal can provide unexpected results in terms of pain and distress <e> <s> the start of that treatment of the animal the start of the experiment the start of whatever was happening in the project was deliberate and the project was deliberately licensed <e> <s> i am slightly worried whether this would then catch a situation when the result the outturn in terms of the degree of pain or distress became worse than everybody expected and had a right to expect <e> <s> the word deliberate would as i see it still apply because the experiment had started <e> <s> in cases such as this i want to avoid a lot of criticism and litigation in relation to people who are doing their best and who have been caught by the circumstances <e>", "<cs> i think this is covered in annexe e of the guidance notes where it says in paragraph that the person who has an establishment shall make sure that there is a proper record of all the animals and where they come from <e>", "<cs> i suggest that this amendment goes much too far <e> <s> annexe b to the guidelines sets out the work which may be done by assistants but much of it would be prevented by the words in this amendment <e> <s> the assistant would be prevented from doing a great deal of it <e> <s> that is the real danger <e> <s> the amendment does not say <e>", "<cs> oh no no <e>", "<cs> i merely point out that this is covered by the council of europe convention on the protection of vertebrate animals which the british government support <e> <s> article <e>", "<cs> if the amendment has been tabled just to get a statement and to put a point of view on the record i think some of the rest of your lordships should put their views on the record too namely i do not think it is the case that people who are laboratory users and people who are concerned with animal welfare are separately identifiable as different groups <e> <s> i do not believe that they are antipathetic and can be marshalled on one side or the other <e> <s> i do not believe that they are diametrically opposed <e>", "<cs> that is a different point from what is in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say that there will now be some stability in the scheme for at least the rest of this calendar year and one hopes for next year as well <e> <s> is he aware of the distress and concern of sponsoring bodies like my own new town corporation where we have had to hire supervisory staff discharge them when the scheme has changed hire more again when the scheme has changed yet again and then discharge them yet again <e> <s> is this not a bad way to treat devoted staff who are supervising the schemes <e> <s> can we not now please have some stability at least for a good period ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to speak after the eloquent speech of the noble lord lord sandford with much of which i agree and i shall return in a moment to some of the things he said <e> <s> first of all like my noble friend lord john-mackie to whom we are greatly indebted for this debate i want to declare an interest in that i am involved in a planning appeal for development in the metropolitan green belt <e> <s> i shall not refer either to that appeal or to its subject which is housing <e> <s> i have rather wider principle and consideration to put before your lordships this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i attributed that to the noble lord i thought that he nodded his head <e> <s> i understand what he is saying but i am saying that in order to enforce it on recalcitrant councils some of them are recalcitrant and the conservation lobby has become hysterical and is simply in favour of preserving the <e>", "<cs> my lords moreover the problem is that what we really need in order to keep everyone in a game that they understand are clearer guidelines <e> <s> we are all asking for that <e> <s> then we shall stop making so many appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say just when approximately we shall be able to meet the ec quality objectives on most of our beaches <e> <s> the noble lord gave the money which is to be spent but how long will it take to clear up the rest of them <e>", "<cs> i want to say a few words on the schedule <e> <s> as the noble lord the minister knows there was on the marshalled list until late last week another amendment to schedule <e> <s> as a result of shall we say <e> <s> misunderstandings at any rate the amendment was taken off the marshalled list <e> <s> i shall be proposing unless the minister says a few helpful words this evening to return to this matter at report stage <e>", "<cs> i think the misunderstanding was that the noble lord lord lloyd thought that i would not be here this evening and therefore he thought he had better withdraw it in case i was not here to move it in his absence <e> <s> i am saying that that was the basic misunderstanding <e> <s> i bear no grudge towards my noble friend and i am more anxious to hear what the minister has to say <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everyone who has spoken and particularly to the minister both for talking to me last week and for his kind remarks this evening <e> <s> i shall of course consider what to do before report stage but if i may say so during a very long time in parliament i have heard ministers year in and year out saying that now is not the time to rock a particular boat <e> <s> we have often rocked the boat or so ministers thought and it had no effect whatsoever <e> <s> a bill has steamed on its way and the apparent difficulties have been quickly overcome once parliament has been very tough and stated its desire <e> <s> so i cannot accept that this will in some way delay this bill <e> <s> it is a very short amendment that is needed and in my view it would not take long to debate <e>", "<cs> my lords was the minister saying obliquely in his answer that if no progress is made in the coming months the british government are prepared to take this matter to the european court <e>", "<cs> my lords i am just a little puzzled <e> <s> i want to understand what the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to reply briefly to three points <e> <s> i shall then ask your lordships leave to withdraw my amendment having aired my complaint <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench said that this is not a matter of complexity <e> <s> i am afraid that it is because the problem is not in the event of the repeal of the disliked subsection of the act but in how the industry lives between now and then <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear the noble lord lord lloyd saying yes <e> <s> that is the complexity for which we wanted time to negotiate discuss and refer back to the industry <e> <s> that is a substantial sum and it is a substantial industry incurring it <e> <s> in my view it would have been courteous to give us enough time having heard the noble lords views on the matters to go back to the industry and hear its views about what further representations might be made today <e> <s> i have not had that opportunity <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lucas for the kind way he has dealt with the propositions i have put this evening <e> <s> frankly i do not accept his point that the bill would sink without trace if it were broadened <e> <s> governments have control of the other place <e> <s> i do not know of any government bill that has sunk in this way for lack of time <e> <s> it is one of those arguments disingenuously if i may return the compliment trotted out by the noble lord when it is convenient and forgotten in between <e> <s> all governments try this tactic of saying do not rock the boat or you may lose the bill <e> <s> what a lot of nonsense that is <e>", "<cs> my lords the central electricity generating boards complaint on this matter has been that the costs of protecting the environment have proved too high for the electricity producing industry <e> <s> has that problem been overcome <e> <s> is the central electricity generating board now more willing to install the sort of suppressors and so on which will prevent the sulphureous emissions <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the case that this payment is six months overdue <e> <s> if it were the other way round and someone owed the government money for six months would not the noble earl today be making a lot of noise at the dispatch box complaining about it <e> <s> since we all nowadays have to pay for any delays in settling our income tax i was recently asked for a payment while my accountant was <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not misleading us about the situation in the south-east as compared to the rest of the country <e> <s> i think he was giving national figures <e> <s> if one takes the present average earnings in the south-east of about per <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not answer my question <e> <s> i made the point that as people with average earnings can only service a loan of about and the price of very small new houses in the south-east is now over are we not facing a <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the case of the jobclub experiment the problems are to a considerable extent overcome by the devotion and help of the staff who assist the long-term unemployed in making their applications <e> <s> in other words there is already some help being given in the jobclub to people who have problems in drafting letters and this has been a great and very helpful feature <e> <s> in my own town i am sure it has helped to lead to an enormous success rate in the jobclub experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that it was the packaging <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not alarming <e> <s> there are only registered parallel importers and the noble lord has just said that more than of them are being investigated for possible infringements and possible prosecution <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord finally sits down i wonder whether i may ask him to be sure to write to me about the points i raised about the ec namely that the ec commission needs support in pressing through its view that research and development expenditure should be included in the pricing of pharmaceuticals by other countries and that some order should be brought into the whole system of comparative pricing so that one hopes parallel importing will fade away <e> <s> i should be grateful if he would write to me about that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i refer to something that the noble lord lord henderson said <e> <s> has the minister seen the example set by mr richard rogers in his exhibition in london showing how trafalgar square perhaps for the first time could be linked by pedestrian routes to the south side of the river so that the emerging cultural heart of london is linked back to the old centre <e> <s> there will be no chance of this great initiative getting off the ground unless the government begin to take an interest in it <e> <s> will the noble lord have a look at that scheme and encourage his friends in the government also to look at it with a view to some government action being taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the patents act to exclude the pharmaceutical use of products from the acts authorised by licences available as of right by virtue of paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate <e> <s> as in all debates in your lordships house one always learns something <e> <s> i did not know the delightful quotation which the noble lord lord mcfadzean had extracted from jeremy bentham about an adequate period of exclusivity <e> <s> i shall beg leave to use it myself on future occasions <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord for his support <e> <s> i did not know the delightful calculations of the noble earl lord halsbury about the number of years one has to live hopefully in order to profit from any invention <e> <s> i shall study that with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the figure but i can say to the noble lord once again that representatives of the producers of per cent <e> <s> of generics are in favour of this bill <e> <s> it is wrong for this organisation to say that the generic sector is not convinced about the bill <e> <s> that is what it claims to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep the noble lord for more than another minute or so <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that his department is aware of the immense danger of distress being caused to these wild animals by putting them through a slaughtering process intended for domestic animals <e> <s> the ministers department has recently written to me about one such slaughtering operation in which ministry vets were present <e> <s> will he confirm that the practice of watching this sort of slaughtering which is intended for domesticated animals will continue to be very carefully supervised <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be kind enough to answer my specific question namely whatever time we have to wait for the governments guidelines will he give an assurance that meanwhile any slaughtering will continue to be subject to supervision to avoid the danger of deep distress being caused to wild animals <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord mellish i venture to speak as a practitioner on the ground in the subject about which we are talking <e> <s> that may seem a strange claim by someone who is the chairman of a new town up in shropshire <e> <s> in fact the new town of telford is a vast reclamation project <e> <s> telford was a bit of clapped out britain uk ltd <e> <s> it had all the signs of the collapse and decay that worries those of us who are interested in the inner cities <e> <s> the southern two-thirds of the town were blighted by thousands of acres of derelict land and the decaying communities scattered on that land <e> <s> in years of work pulling that area round we can claim some successes which are relevant to the inner cities and at the same time some lessons learnt <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> like many others i had the wrong impression this afternoon <e> <s> however it enables me to reinforce the point <e> <s> the basis of all this must be government money <e> <s> i very much take the point made by the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend lord stallard begins perhaps i may suggest that it may be for the convenience of the committee if we discuss together amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> they all raise the same point <e> <s> if the noble viscount lord craigavon is in agreement i am sure that that will speed up the proceedings <e>", "<cs> i shall also be brief <e> <s> i shall deal with the point concerning retrospection by saying that it all depends on what one means by the word retrospection <e> <s> normally it means that one is providing for something that occurred before a bill even started its passage <e> <s> in other words one had no notice of it happening and one goes back into the past to change something to regularise something or whatever the case may be <e> <s> there is in fact no retrospection in this bill <e> <s> all that happens is that it states that the starting date is the date of publication of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not want to give way <e> <s> i shall not be anything other than absolutely brief <e> <s> this bill has been in the background for a long time now <e> <s> it seemed only fair since the government said last april that it was time this matter was repealed that the right date to start everyone having had a lot of notice should be when the bill was published <e> <s> otherwise all sorts of things would begin to happen between now and the passage of the bill which would waste a great deal of time and money and start further legal cases <e>", "<cs> with respect that is not really on this issue <e> <s> if that matter is to be raised it should be done on clause stand part <e> <s> it has nothing to do with these amendments <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is <e>", "<cs> the issue of the cost of the bill has been one of the difficulties because my noble friend on the front bench would not accept the assurances that were given by me at second reading in quite deliberate words in cols <e> <s> and of the <e>", "<cs> that is because my noble friend does not want to listen <e> <s> that is the real answer <e> <s> if i tell him that the report to which he refers is shot through with basic inconsistencies and is admitted to be a broad brush approach and therefore reaches extraordinary conclusions he does not take any of that into account <e> <s> he does not take into account the ceiling that is put on the whole situation by the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme <e> <s> in other words he ony listens to what he wants to listen to <e> <s> that is the difficulty of someone who is quite new to the industry and knows nothing about it being pitchforked into the middle of this discussion <e>", "<cs> it has been increased in the united states <e> <s> my noble friend knows nothing about the matter <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee very much longer <e> <s> my noble friends remarks show the depths of his ignorance <e> <s> the united states has just increased pharmaceutical patent life by a further five years to cope with exactly the problems that lie behind patent life exclusion <e> <s> japan and other countries are considering doing exactly the same <e> <s> my noble friend really ought not to keep talking about something that he knows nothing about <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord <e> <s> lord tordoff the answer is this <e> <s> if nothing is done in certain circumstances and certain drugs and consumption patterns emerge and are allowed to occur one could have a small increase <e> <s> if one balances that by saying but the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme insists that this be kept constant because of the agreement that there be a ceiling that wipes it out and adjustments must be made to counteract it <e> <s> it is the working of the pprs that would hold back an increase if such a thing happened although the calculations show that the effect is more likely to be neutral anyway <e>", "<cs> i was talking about costs not about this issue <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i should briefly like to say a few words because my voice is disappearing rapidly <e> <s> i am grateful to the chief whip and to the officials for kindly arranging for the committees work to resume at an early hour today <e> <s> after our experience at oclock the other night this is appreciated <e> <s> i apologise to your lordships

private <e>", "<cs> i have yes <e>", "<cs> neither can i i should just like to remind the noble viscount lord craigavon that when i put through the deer legislation i had to put it through three times

soon <e>", "<cs> before i comment on the amendment of my noble friend and i must be brief because my voice is nearly gone perhaps i may refer to what i said at second reading about one of the <e>",

trade and its practitioners are members of the association of the industry the abpi <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord thinks that this bill would in some way kill them off <e> <s> the companies that are members of the abpi fully support this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords has the minister seen a programme on television which went out in the middle of last week and which i think was called london report <e> <s> it showed the immense cruelty that is now involved in large-scale deer poaching particularly in the south-east of england and the use of crossbows for such poaching which is causing immense pain and suffering to many animals <e> <s> when he has seen that programme will it be possible for him to consider circularising magistrates and inviting them to use more readily their powers of confiscation in respect of such weapons when poachers are caught and also to use their power to confiscate lurcher dogs which as shown in the programme are also causing immense suffering <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have been involved with this bill <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lords lord stallard and lord kilmarnock and the noble viscount lord craigavon for the fact that on one occasion i was able to reply to them only in a hoarse whisper as a result of a heavy cold <e> <s> my answers

that before i sat down i was not gloating at all <e> <s> i was trying to see the funny side of what has been a tortuous path in getting this bill through <e> <s> if my noble friends telephone had been ringing day and night in connection with this bill as has mine i think that in the end he would be quite happy to say that it is good that we can see the amusing side of the serious operation of getting a bill through parliament <e> <s> my attempt was to lighten the proceedings a little by seeing the funny side of a very serious operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in welcoming the maiden speech which we have heard and particularly the distinguished speech of the noble lord lord joseph <e> <s> he was typically thoughtful analytical persuasive and modest <e> <s> it is a delight to welcome him <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the unemployment figures can the noble lord say to what extent he is now aware of shortages of specialist skills in manufacturing industry <e> <s> where are those shortages beginning to emerge and what does he think the government can do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are making some progress on the cost of flights to paris would the noble lord be prepared to consider the cost of flying on beyond paris to strasbourg <e> <s> the return fare to strasbourg is about which is ridiculous by the standards of today <e> <s> it is almost as much as the cost of flying to new york and back <e> <s> cannot something be done to break that part of the cartel <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what is supposed to be wrong with the westminster hospital that we now have <e> <s> it is not an old building it was built just before the second world war <e> <s> a new wing was built recently which cost a lot of money it has a fine reputation for research and a fine reputation for teaching <e> <s> in every sense it is one of the best hospitals in the country <e> <s> why is there a proposal to close it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i was interested to hear the points raised by the noble lord lord hacking <e> <s> one of the two possible objections to his amendment has been so over-argued by the noble lord lord jenkin that i shall confine myself to the second point of retrospection <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly because i have spoken to my own bill on this matter <e> <s> i intervene only to say to my noble friend that although i have listened to him extremely carefully he put forward a false prospectus <e> <s> i heard him say very clearly that the amendment is fair because it makes sure that every drug will have a -year life free of licensing <e> <s> that is what he said today <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord replies i may say that the government are thought to be sympathetic indeed they have shown themselves to be so today towards the erosion of patent life in respect of pharmaceuticals <e> <s> i know attempts are being made in europe to achieve international agreement under the european patents system on extending patent life at least in the way that japan and america are doing <e> <s> both those countries are sensitive to the problem of erosion of patent life by the years of testing

progress of the jobclub scheme and the restart scheme <e> <s> have they peaked in success <e> <s> is their effect continuing or have we had the best from those schemes <e> <s> they have done a good deal to bring down the level of the long-term unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i too apologise because i did not put down my name on the list of speakers <e> <s> i can only plead the expected shortness of the debate <e> <s> there is only one issue about which i wish to speak and that concerns the forfeiture of dogs <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby is aware of it but when the deer acts were reformed by legislation which i introduced earlier in this decade there was a similar problem to consider if there is forfeiture of dogs what is to happen to them <e> <s> that is how the noble lord put the question <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a general problem of underfunding for the west midlands health authority <e> <s> has the noble lord any figures to show to what extent the region has been helped by a reallocation of funds <e> <s> if not can he write to me and let me know in particular whether any extra funds have been made available for shropshire where there has been a considerable problem <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount make clear what is really holding up liberalisation in key routes such as london to paris <e> <s> is it not a scandal that the regular fare the return round trip paris fare is even if one is only going for the day <e> <s> that is the cost of flying across the atlantic <e> <s> can the minister make clear whether it is british airways the british government air france or the french government which is stopping real competition and liberalisation on that route <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to follow my noble friend <e> <s> i shall pick up one of his themes a little later <e> <s> i begin by declaring a very indirect interest in this matter as chairman of a consortium of the major house-building companies which individually play a significant role in the areas of the existing urban development corporations <e> <s> we shall probably be performing that role in the new corporations that we are speaking about tonight <e> <s> i also speak as the chairman for years of the telford new town development corporation <e> <s> as i have said in this house before telford is not simply a new town <e> <s> telford was a vast reclamation and revival project covering about square miles <e> <s> its centre was a former coalfield spoiled land and some acres of it needed years of reclamation before the new town could receive new infrastructure new industry new confidence and a new heart <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give a broader breakdown than he gave in answer to a supplementary question when he contrasted the growth in the imports of motorcars with growth in the imports of capital goods <e> <s> for example can he say whether there has been a larger growth in the import of consumer goods than in capital goods and raw materials <e> <s> we should all like to hope that it is the growth of the latter which is creating the deficit at the moment rather than a huge surge in consumer goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i have more than a passing interest in these regulations <e> <s> i was interested in what my noble friend lord mcintosh pointed out as the inadequacy of the documents before us <e> <s> my interest arises first because as special adviser to the <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> of course the commission is glad that everyone is carrying out the directive in a general way <e> <s> i am asking whether the government have put to the commission its exclusions from the annexes <e> <s> those are particular matters on which we should like the commission to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords on this motion i believe that we are entitled to a little more explanation <e> <s> when the noble lord hared through the brief he said when we tried to discuss this in one group that nuclear power stations are included here and that preparations were being made to bring the english regulations into line <e> <s> can he expand on that <e> <s> why is it not possible to put the nuclear power stations issue firmly into both orders as should have been done in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords we are putting the motions <e> <s> as we have not had full answers in trying to debate these motions together i am afraid that issues arise individually on some of these orders <e> <s> i have another matter to raise because the noble lord did not deal with it concerning the drainage of land when we come to the drainage regulations <e> <s> i have not <e>", "<cs> my lords why are they not in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope we can have some answers <e>", "<cs> my lords this is where i must put the following question <e> <s> it has not been answered <e> <s> the noble lord can answer this very quickly i am sure and if we do not receive an answer we are bound to keep putting this question <e> <s> the directive makes clear that the subjects in annex ii should cover the water management projects for agriculture whether they are grant-aided or not <e> <s> all that the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question to put to the minister which i do not expect him to answer today but it is a matter which he may wish to look at before we come to third reading <e> <s> the definition which he has put down talks of <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he will answer my question about bifocals or will he deal with that point later <e>", "<cs> my lords japanese companies which have established manufacturing bases in this country are increasingly concerned that entry of their products into the european community is being stemmed <e> <s> the noble lord knows of the problems with nissan <e> <s> can he assure such companies that they will receive the full protection of her majestys government once they are british companies and that they will share in the benefits of export promotion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government be sure to bear in mind two factors that have been mentioned in this house before <e> <s> first not very long ago in the time of the chairman of the governors the noble lord lord reigate westminster hospital spent a lot of money on a new wing which is so to speak hardly out of date or needing replacement <e> <s> secondly will they bear in mind the degree of local protest in the st stephens area at the congestion that this huge hospital is bound to create by undue concentration in that part of london <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness said that we had discussed this matter in july <e> <s> though she was not here at the time she has no doubt read the report of the proceedings on that occasion <e> <s> she will know that together with my noble friend lord mcintosh i was very upset at the way in which the government have been handling parts of the implementation of this particular directive <e> <s> my concerns have not decreased since that day despite a helpful letter that was received the day after the debate from the noble earl <e> <s> lord caithness <e> <s> he was obviously very upset himself that there had been such a noisy scene in the chamber on that date in july when we found the replies of the government so very unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble baroness whether she would be good enough to write to me further on the point about the tonnes <e> <s> i should have thought that if the effect of the works under these regulations made the harbour capable of taking tonnes it would then be within the spirit of annex of the directive and therefore have a compulsory assessment <e> <s> in that case would it not be better to have some threshold as there is in nearly all the other parts of these regulations <e> <s> as i said the thresholds which are in the directive have been reproduced in the regulations <e> <s> however if i may say so i am still puzzled despite the noble baronesss attempt to explain this as to why there is no threshold in this one and why it is left to so much ministerial discretion <e> <s> if the noble baroness will write to me on that point i shall be most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord mentioned other matters can he say whether progress has been made at the last two or three council meetings on liberalisation <e> <s> are the french and german governments beginning to give way on liberalisation in respect of competition on air routes and freedom of pricing and fares <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this country now has the reputation of being the dirtiest most untidy and most litter strewn of all of western europe according to foreign visitors <e> <s> we see it not only in the rural areas but in urban areas too <e> <s> do we not need something more than an extra million for the keep britain tidy group <e> <s> do not the government think that our national reputation now deserves a good deal more energy being put in to clean up britain <e>", "<cs> on the previous occasion i declared an interest as a director of wembley <e> <s> although i am no longer a director i have listened with some incredulity to the exchanges this afternoon <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord realises the problems created for wembley by the sort of examples that have been bandied around the committee this afternoon <e> <s> the problems are enormous <e> <s> it is not good enough to come to the committee today and say to noble lords that the government really do not know what they want at this stage and then to ask parliament and this house to give a <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could add a point in support of the noble lord with particular reference to wembley <e> <s> one of the problems that wembley has it must be easily understood by the committee is the immense impact of wembley on its local community <e> <s> when hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of people begin to turn up at wembley games there is an enormous disadvantage for the local community in terms of the clogging of roads the danger of hooliganism outside and so on <e> <s> but in the past couple of years wembley has built up a very good ongoing relationship with its local authority <e> <s> it now has a very good understanding of the importance to the community of wembley and the importance of community relations <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the department and the department of health are fully staffed to inspect and to provide expert advice on these problems of contamination of drinking water <e> <s> has the minister noted that in north cornwall there has been a recent scandal in which the department of health is accused of sitting on a problem of contaminated water with bad effects on local health <e> <s> this situation has continued for about six months <e> <s> the excuse given was that this was in some way due to advice from government departments and that there were to be no long-term effects from the contamination <e> <s> are we fully staffed with experts and inspectors to make sure that this kind of event does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard is present <e> <s> i hold with affection our exchanges during the three attempts to have passed my reform of the deer act <e> <s> the process took some years <e> <s> i hope that he will share my pleasure that the work carried out at the beginning of the decade has not proved to be deficient <e> <s> the reform of the deer act is working well and it is controlling cruelty in england on a considerable scale <e> <s> the bill relating to scotland was passed later <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said we are here dealing with the whole issue of exemptions and it might be worth just having a general debate about this issue because it goes to the heart of the complaint that a number of us were making when this bill was last before the committee that we are not clear what is the governments thinking about this matter <e> <s> i remember all the issues that were raised last time of foreigners of scotsmen of irishmen living in manchester and goodness knows what and of the possible chaos that all this could cause unless exemptions and requirements for membership of a scheme were made clear and the governments thinking was announced in advance on the issue <e>", "<cs> i know that the minister is trying to be helpful and i accept what he said <e> <s> however i wonder whether he can see that that places me in a dilemma <e> <s> if he refuses to accept amendment no <e> <s> that means that we should have pressed him further at this point to say something more about exemptions <e>", "<cs> i suspect that in his reply the minister will say that the best way of dealing with the matter is to define guests of the club as he did in relation to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if so is he prepared to accept an amendment to put that on the face of the bill or is he saying that it is to be left to the fma to define it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was not in the chamber and he did not therefore hear the minister say that the government would not accept the proposal even if football recommended it <e> <s> he said that the government are against allowing season ticket holders to be exempt <e> <s> he has said that no matter what football recommends the government will not accept it <e>", "<cs> let him say it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls has made that speech at least six times in my hearing <e> <s> he keeps saying lets leave it to the football membership authority <e> <s> he has not grasped that the authority does not have discretion <e> <s> it must submit a scheme through the minister who can turn it down <e>", "<cs> that is precisely where the noble lord is wrong <e> <s> when we were moving amendments about possible exclusions from the scheme under the earlier part of clause the minister made it clear as a result of our probing that if the fma made certain recommendations he would veto them <e> <s> we did not know that until we explored the matter by probing amendments <e> <s> that is important <e> <s> the noble lord does not seem to realise that there are gross infringements of personal liberty within the bill <e> <s> we are trying to discover to what extent those can be ameliorated <e> <s> we can only do so by ascertaining whether the minister will veto some of the ameliorations we hoped for <e>", "<cs> may i join the noble lord in pressing the minister to reconsider for reasons that i mentioned on an earlier occasion <e> <s> i hope that this bill if it becomes an act is only a temporary measure <e> <s> i hope that after two or three years when we have calmed down the whole situation we will revert to something much more normal in football <e>", "<cs> if the licensing authority is to be some creature of the secretary of state we ought to know what its powers are how much responsibility it has and how much discretion it has <e> <s> we need something in the bill to tell us what this body is other than simply a creature of the secretary of state <e> <s> we believe that it would be much better to have some body to which the system could be devolved in a few years time and secondly a body containing some democratic element to which representations <e>", "<cs> as i indicated on a previous occasion i have a slight advantage in that i was in charge of running wembley for at least a couple of years <e> <s> i saw for myself the problems of running cup finals and other events <e> <s> the minister and the government should realise that wembley does not have a history of violence <e> <s> despite the example mentioned by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich wembley does not have problems of violence <e> <s> it has not had the troubles that have led to the introduction of the bill <e> <s> that is a good starting point <e> <s> despite its size and despite the number of people who go to matches there wembley has learnt over the years how to handle the bouyancy and exhilaration of the spectators and to channel those feelings into something better than killing or harming each other <e> <s> i should not like anyone to think that wembley is a paragon but it has no reason to have vengeance wreaked upon it <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i did not raise that point <e> <s> the problem i raised perhaps the minister is coming to it was that wembley does not sell the tickets <e> <s> the tickets are sold to a considerable extent by the participating clubs <e> <s> i want to be clear as to who will be responsible in the case of a breach of the legislation <e> <s> will it be wembley or the participating club <e> <s> how do we apportion responsibility between the two <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend speaks from the front bench may i say that it seems i guessed correctly when i forecast that the minister would say that he is to ask the fma to make a special study of wembley <e> <s> i am much obliged that will help <e> <s> i should like to think about what the noble lord has offered <e> <s> i note that he said that the government would need a good deal of persuading-i think those were his words before they would accept any recommendation from the committee that wembley be totally excluded <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to press a point that i raised earlier <e> <s> this clause sets up the licensing authority <e> <s> as the clause reads that body appears to be entirely a creature of the secretary of state <e> <s> the clause states that the secretary of state shall appoint those persons and that the terms of appointment shall be agreed by him <e> <s> he shall give them directions whether general or specific regarding their functions <e> <s> clause states that it shall be a duty of the authority to comply with any such direction <e> <s> the remainder of the clause is not relevant to the point that i wish to make <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not taken my point <e> <s> i was here for that debate <e> <s> the point is that <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides whether to withdraw the amendment perhaps i may make this point to the noble earl <e> <s> i am fortified in what i am going to say by having noticed in the newspapers in the past hours that when the new chairman of london transport went to see the operation of the computer-controlled turnstiles at victoria station he found them all out of action <e> <s> he was told by the people in charge that they go out of action every week and that the staff are fed up with them <e> <s> these things are difficult to get right <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there are other issues about which he might say a word <e> <s> as he will be aware the recruitment of <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble earl say that it is so terribly difficult and complicated for britain when other countries are promoting this kind of reserve <e> <s> for example has not the minister seen the underwater national parks which exist in parts of america <e> <s> the americans seem to solve these problems reasonably easily <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl can tell us why we are finding it so difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords the act was a triumph for my noble friend lord houghton <e> <s> he used his great powers of persuasion conciliation and advocacy to have the act drafted and then to get all sides to accept it <e> <s> his immense reputation for concern for animal welfare was the guarantee to all animal lovers that the act would constitute a definite advance in care for animals used in science while allowing the necessary use of animals to continue albeit historically as i am sure he would agree on a steadily reducing scale <e> <s> as a result we in this country now have a system of tight controls which is the best in the world <e> <s> i know that it was a great satisfaction to my noble friend that the council of europe convention was very much patterned on the uk example <e> <s> as he said a cornerstone of the act is the animal procedures committee which advises the home secretary so widely <e> <s> there is much to welcome in the report of its first eight months <e> <s> i select some points at random <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in companies that want to undertake some of this work <e> <s> may i press the noble lord for a full statement about the total effects of this relaxation <e> <s> is he aware that the announcement was made by the chief secretary to the treasury in a speech outside parliament <e> <s> apparently all we can get hold of is a press release of that speech <e> <s> this is a matter of great importance to private enterprise companies interested in this work <e> <s> should there not be a fully considered statement to parliament with copies placed in the library and elsewhere so that companies will know the guidance which they must follow <e>", "<cs> my lords in his replies the noble lord has referred only to the roads programme <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the tax can be levied only on the basis of valuation <e> <s> is he aware that with landed property tenanted farms and so on a percentage of that valuation is taken for taxation purposes <e> <s> to meet the noble lords point could not for example the first per cent <e> <s> of the valuation be free of inheritance tax <e> <s> there are precedents <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether much of this ivory is reaching hong kong and elsewhere through the united arab emirates one of the worst places in the world for the selling of poached ivory <e> <s> if that is the case are the government also putting pressure on the government there to stop their trade <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord convey to the noble earl lord caithness the congratulations of the whole house on the part he played in luxembourg yesterday evening in securing this european community-wide ban on the importation of ivory <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister did not reply i am not complaining to my point suggesting that the foreign office might try to obtain the good offices of the united states in putting pressure on taiwan <e> <s> will the noble lord convey that suggestion to the foreign office <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is mistaken <e> <s> i opposed charging for sight tests <e> <s> i voted for them to remain free <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all congratulate the noble earl on the initiative which he took when he was in kenya <e> <s> when he was there was he able to say to the kenyan and tanzanian governments that we should be able to give special help to them in order to stop the poaching on the ground and the killing of the elephants <e> <s> secondly if those governments ask for financial help in order to employ more game wardens and stop the poaching will her majestys government give a favourable answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to detain the house <e> <s> however this is the only opportunity i have to raise an issue on which i have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the noble baroness and the ministry so relaxed as it seems from recent parliamentary answers to the whole issue of the abattoir slaughter of deer <e> <s> that is a procedure which most of us find absolutely abhorrent <e> <s> has she not in recent parliamentary answers to me indicated first that there may be breaches in this voluntary code and that it should be made statutory <e> <s> has she not revealed also that there are possible other infringements which have been noted and that there are not enough veterinary inspectors in her ministry to make sure that the code is enforced <e> <s> does not the ministry need to be shaken up on this issue <e> <s> as a first step should it not make this voluntary code into a statutory code <e>", "<cs> my lords might not taiwan be a refuge for some of these citizens if ever the need were to arise <e> <s> we all hope that it will not arise <e> <s> as we do not have relations with the government of taiwan which is so obvious a place of refuge how do the government propose to bring them into the general considerations to which the noble lord has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord prepared to put some designs out to open competition among architects given that these are in many cases such important civic buildings <e> <s> is he aware that in telford where we asked for a building in keeping with the new modern image of the town what we got was a purely nostalgic pavilion that people think was built in the s <e> <s> the design was by an in-house architect we could not shift his authority from that design <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has repeated again today that the government accept responsibility for mobilising other countries in the event of some refuge being needed for hong kong people <e> <s> i want to ask him again about the position of taiwan <e> <s> i fully understand tthe governments difficulty <e> <s> we have no diplomatic relations with taiwan <e> <s> i do not expect diplomatic relations to be resumed and i do not press for that but is it not a possible refuge for some of the people from hong kong <e> <s> in the coming years do not we need to consider the possibility that if it were ever needed some of them could go there <e> <s> it is chinese <e> <s> its democracy is developing fast <e> <s> our trade relations with it are good <e> <s> can the minister say at least that we hope that over the coming years our relations will improve and that eventually we may be able to talk to taiwan in some way about the possibility of it providing part of the insurance system that he has talked about <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case as the noble lord has just remarked that any prosecutions stem from several directives about water supply which this country freely signed <e> <s> i myself took some part in drafting those directives in the early s with the full agreement of her majestys government at that time <e> <s> is it not therefore a little late for members in any house or for any country to complain when the commission then sets out to enforce the regulations in the directive which we freely signed <e>", "<cs> i must declare an interest in this matter in the same manner as the noble lord opposite <e> <s> the minister said that the leaflet would be made available through local authorities <e> <s> can he go one stage further and say that the demand for the community charge will be accompanied by such an explanatory leaflet so that tenants have the remedies quite clearly drawn to their attention <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly pursue the point that i raised in my earlier intervention <e> <s> i am concerned that tenants should not have to find a leaflet or to be aware that such a leaflet exists in order to protect themselves when they ask their landlord to reduce their rent in order to take account of the rates that they have been previously paying through the landlord <e> <s> when the community charge demand is sent out by a local authority what i have in mind is that the demand should have a phrase on it which says something to the effect if you are a tenant who has previously paid rates with your rent through your landlord you may have a right to have that payment reduced to take account of the fact that you are now paying the community charge <e> <s> if so please get leaflet x <e>", "<cs> that is not what i am asking <e> <s> when in april next year a tenant receives his demand for the community charge it should clearly state that if he has been previously paying rates through his landlord he should make sure that he is protecting his position <e> <s> he should look at the leaflet to see whether he is entitled to a reduction in his rent to compensate for the community charge <e> <s> i am asking for that to be drawn to the payers attention when the demand for the community charge is sent out <e> <s> that is a reasonable position <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear that i was not putting forward my view as an alternative to the proposition of my noble friend <e> <s> we should try to do this by legislation <e> <s> the minister made a legitimate point <e> <s> getting it right in law is very difficult indeed because of the exceptions which he carefully set out <e> <s> there are difficulties in making the law work and apply where we want it to apply <e> <s> if the amendment is withdrawn and not voted on will the minister take the issue away and see whether he can find a way of doing the job properly by legislation in a manner which would command the support of my noble friend <e> <s> it would certainly command mine <e>", "<cs> i do not know the position as regards order in connection with the motion which the noble lord lord rugby has just mentioned <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> the report of the joint committee seems to be mainly concerned with the powers regarding universities and teaching departments <e> <s> some may no longer have courses in optical matters and other newer universities may have them and may need to be added to the list <e> <s> that point seemed to concern the joint committee <e> <s> however the amendments seem to go much further <e> <s> unless i am very much mistaken they seem to give a much wider power to the government through the privy council to alter the membership and possibly the balance of the general optical council <e> <s> is that the case <e> <s> if it is the case does it mean that the present balance in the general optical council could be changed <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble and learned lords pardon but he has not answered my question <e> <s> he may have intended to give powers to alter the people nominated by the examining bodies <e> <s> but does not the amendment as drafted give the privy council much wider powers to recast the membership of the general optical council if it so desires <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the care that he has taken in responding to my remarks <e> <s> however i could make many comments <e> <s> first he says that he cannot comment totally on the lewisham proposal because it has not been received in final form <e> <s> no of course it has not because in correspondence representatives have been trying to iron out the lack of agreement with the department before formally submitting the proposal <e> <s> to say that he cannot comment because it has not been formally received is no answer at all <e> <s> the essentials of the scheme are known to the department and should have been commented upon <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to assess the value because no one except phoenix is prepared to try to get a scheme moving <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> there can be no value until someone is willing to set up marriage schemes or put forward total regeneration proposals <e> <s> that is the basis of the whole project <e> <s> as i keep saying none of this will be lost in the end because whatever profits are made from the process will all be put back into regeneration so i do not know why the government are being difficult about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend withdraws his amendment perhaps i may say that i am grateful to the noble earl for taking on board my suggestion <e> <s> he tries to be helpful to the house within the limits of government policy and that is half a loaf <e> <s> however i am sure he will recognise that in committee we said that we preferred an amendment to the statute rather than the suggestion he has now made <e> <s> i thank him very sincerely but perhaps he will take on board that we hope that on third reading he will still consider an amendment to the law <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord brightman can help us to produce a succinct amendment for third reading that will be very good <e> <s> however that does not detract from my thanks to the noble earl for trying to be helpful on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one reason why i wanted to intervene <e> <s> i refer to the position in the private sector <e> <s> when my company is planning new settlements in the countryside we are under considerable pressure which we happily accept to offer land at low or nil value to local authorities in those rural areas so that they can fulfil their statutory obligations to house elderly people retired agricultural workers and so on <e> <s> it will be difficult for us to continue to make those offers of land if we find that the result is that the right-to-buy provisions apply and the elderly person sells the house bungalow or whatever it is for which we have given the land <e> <s> this is a difficulty because what will happen will be that in planning any settlement we shall have to charge rather more for some building lots for other people in order to subsidise these ones for the retired <e> <s> then we shall find that that retired person goes off with the swag <e> <s> that is impossible <e>", "<cs> my lords when the matter was before the house on a previous occasion i made the point that the essential role of the football membership authority is not clear <e> <s> i suggested to the minister and i reiterated it in a letter to him that we must be clear about whether the authority will simply administer a static scheme or whether it will have a wider role to advise as experience gathers momentum on any changes which may be needed to the way in which regulations affecting football spectators should be changed <e> <s> in other words i suggested that there should be a subsection providing that it must be the duty of the football membership authority to keep under review the working of the act and to report to the secretary of state any changes that experience may suggest are required <e>", "<cs> my lords topsy <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hesketh has not answered my question <e> <s> is the role of the football membership authority simply administrative or is it expected that in pursuance of its work and particularly in its annual report to the secretary of state which presumably will be published it will review the working of the bill draw lessons about which matches should or should not be designated and advise the secretary of state the government and the country on that <e> <s> will it as i hope have the power to say eventually that football is moving into a period of good order and that much of the bill can be dispensed with in future because the situation has settled down <e> <s> in other words is it advisory as well as administrative <e> <s> i simply want a yes or no answer <e>", "<cs> my lords that is only the membership scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word about amendment no <e> <s> and ask a question <e> <s> it concerns an enormous power which is being taken by the government <e> <s> it is a power which the noble lord lord hesketh said is to be taken to take account of what lord justice taylor may find in his report <e> <s> but it is a very wide power <e> <s> if one looks to the beginning of clause it can be seen that this refers to the national membership scheme <e> <s> the amendment as drafted provides that the scheme must include provision <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out that no one has moved the amendments <e> <s> the deputy speaker is putting the amendments without anyone moving that we agree with the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords they have not been moved <e>", "<cs> my lords someone has to move that we agree with the commons <e>", "<cs> my lords with all respect to the deputy speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like simply to ask a question about this important new clause <e> <s> i should like an assurance from the noble lord that very careful consultation will take place with the owners of the grounds and the clubs concerned <e> <s> it is not simply a matter of ordering seats there is a problem of paying for them <e> <s> if the power were used at all unreasonably some clubs would have to fold immediately <e> <s> they could not afford the degree of seating that the secretary of state might try to impose <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that i did not ask for a cast-iron guarantee <e> <s> i asked whether the government would look at the whole issue of the availability of grants to see whether there was some possibility of increasing them particularly for clubs which will find the burden crippling <e>", "<cs> my lords it is almost an abuse of our procedures to move so many amendments some of them quite substantial without any explanation <e> <s> if the noble lord were to stand up and say that nearly all of them are drafting amendments or of no consequence perhaps my fears would be proved groundless <e> <s> however it is not proper to move some amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no objection to the amendments being taken in groups <e> <s> however they deal with totally different subjects <e> <s> some of them are important some are unimportant <e> <s> it would have been helpful if the noble lord had risen to say for example that amendments nos <e> <s> to are drafting amendments amendments nos <e> <s> and are something else and so on so that at least we should know where we stood <e> <s> as it is parliament is being asked to be a rubber stamp <e> <s> it is not proper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble earl for explaining the matter and i do not want to raise points on it <e> <s> however he will realise from what i said earlier that what he has now placed on the record is important particularly to football clubs for example to wembley with which i have been associated in helping them to understand how the bill is to work <e> <s> this therefore reinforces my <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments deal with totally different matters <e> <s> they are not a group which hangs together <e> <s> to correct myself slightly they are not totally different but inserting a totally new schedule into the bill without any explanation is i should have thought almost an abuse of the procedure of the house <e> <s> however i shall not press the matter <e> <s> as the noble lord lord harris said it is far from being satisfactory but there is very little that we can say at this stage that will have any effect on this ill considered bill <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much to praise in this very balanced report and in the introduction of it today by the noble lord lord kearton <e> <s> i see two emphases in the report which i very much welcome <e> <s> the first is that we must learn the real lessons of japanese success as opposed to the imaginary reasons for japanese success and we must understand japan much better <e> <s> secondly we must stop putting all the blame on the japanese if our exports to japan do not grow quickly enough <e> <s> as the noble lord said it is now an out of date view to say that it is the fault of the japanese <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that they would be interested for all kinds of reasons <e> <s> japan today does not produce only on its own land <e> <s> it invests all over the world <e> <s> companies such as nec have plants in dozens of countries <e> <s> there is no reason to think that they would refuse to invest here if there were no ec <e> <s> of course they would <e> <s> they see <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister give a figure of million over four years <e> <s> if he did is that not a grossly inadequate figure given the challenge <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that when she talks about the extra costs of some lenses those are the rare cases <e> <s> is she also aware that the average cost of a pair of lenses for normal presbyopia which is what most of us suffer as we get older and which requires simple magnification is between and <e> <s> is she further aware that the frame usually costs about or from the wholesaler <e> <s> however people are not being charged anything near that figure by opticians for such a pair of spectacles <e> <s> according to the ministers department last year they are being charged an average of about a pair <e> <s> in other words there is a per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> mark-up on spectacles <e> <s> does not this matter merit being referred once again to the office of fair trading as the noble lord lord orr-ewing said <e> <s> however else shall we make progress against that rip-off <e>", "<cs> my lords in america recently i was offered for the tate gallery the portrait of the wife of sir henry tate the benefactor who founded the gallery <e> <s> however the owners of the portrait say that they will be happy to give it to the tate gallery if the gallery will hang it <e> <s> it is the companion portrait to that of sir henry tate which has at last been hung in the gallery <e> <s> does the minister realise that the fame of the gallery in the sense of having too many pictures stored away has crossed the atlantic and is not confined to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government working on any new proposals to increase the possibility of houses being built for rent at a low price <e> <s> is it not the case that with the land cost of a small house now often per cent <e> <s> of the cost of the house and perhaps amounting to in itself that means that there is very little chance of getting low-cost rented housing under way in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords provided that the money goes to the clubs which can least afford to <e>", "<cs> my lords the leaflet to which the noble lord referred was promised in this house when we raised the issue on the legislation passing the poll tax <e> <s> at that time it was promised that the leaflet would be ready and would go out with the poll tax demands <e> <s> will the noble lord give an assurance that that leaflet drawing tenants rights to their attention will be distributed with the poll tax demands <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has been helpful in what he has said about regional guidance <e> <s> however will he also say whether the government will consider the point i made that if regional guidance is to be part of the statutory process thought should be given to some of its work being carried out in public <e> <s> it cannot be enforced if it is done behind closed doors <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the noble lord has not answered my question <e> <s> that type of body has become part of the statutory process <e> <s> however although they meet in public at county level when they meet at regional level they meet in private <e> <s> that is to be given the force of law or at least will become part of the statutory process <e> <s> i ask only for thought to be given to the possibility that some of that process should be open and seen to be open <e>", "<cs> my lords it was reported at the conference that the united kingdom had failed to carry out the terms of the signed agreement to stop dumping in the north sea by the end of <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us when that failure was reported to parliament <e> <s> were we told in advance that the government were not going to carry out the terms of an international agreement which they had signed <e>", "<cs> my lords as the letter came to me perhaps i should say a few words <e> <s> i hope that we can have some private discussion about this matter outside the chamber when i hope we can settle it <e> <s> however if one reads the exchanges that took place yesterday one will realise that it was not so much a matter of the minister misleading the house but rather of simply failing to give facts <e> <s> we asked time and again whether britain had signed an agreement to end industrial dumping by the end of <e> <s> we never received a straight answer to that question and that made the house angry <e> <s> i hope therefore that we can discuss this matter outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg the pardon of the house but i do not understand why noble lords are calling out order <e> <s> i am in the course of an exchange with the noble lord the leader of the house and as the letter that we are discussing was sent to me i am entitled to make a simple point about it <e> <s> i do not know why the noble lord the chief whip also howled order <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say whether the new proposals which concern a change in the way in which we are to carry out the directive have been cleared with the commission in brussels <e> <s> has the commission said that it is satisfied that this is a proper or acceptable way of carrying out the directive <e> <s> does the noble viscount realise that for years now ever since we tried to upgrade the environmental activity of the community into a full directorate which we finally achieved the difficulty that friends of britain have had all through europe is that we have always seemed grudging about the implementation of every directive concerning the environment in matters such as this <e> <s> does he agree therefore that it is doubly important to take the commission along with us and to have its approval <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that last week sir christopher benson chairman of the housing corporation had to apologise to his constituent members namely the housing associations because money would be drying up towards the end of this year and a lot of new starts could not now take place <e> <s> have the government ruled out completely bringing forward some of the money planned for next year into the latter part of this year so that the momentum can be kept up <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply to my question appeared to hint that in some way my suggestion that money be brought forward from next year to this year in order to sustain momentum would cause damage <e> <s> now that the associations are able to mount a substantial programme that should not be interrupted would it not be sensible to ensure that some of the money is brought into use at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness denying dr kaisers statement <e> <s> perhaps we can have that clear <e> <s> dr kaiser says that st thomass needs four more intensive care cots to stop patients being turned away and babies dying <e> <s> is the noble baroness denying the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware reverting back to the previous question that those figures given publicly by mr joy the consultant cardiologist at st peters hospital chertsey indicate that a study not press reports not tittle-tattle of patients over years found that of them died unnecessarily on the waiting list because they sometimes had to wait months for operations <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble baroness seen the later part of mr joys remarks in which he said that a quarter of the patients about whom he was complaining people on this long waiting list were referred to private hospitals where they were seen within two or three weeks <e> <s> none of the private patients died <e> <s> can we really be satisfied with this great gap between private provision and what is on offer in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask again a question to which we tried very hard to get an answer last week <e> <s> the government are quite commendably providing extra money on an accelerating scale for the housing corporation over the next few years <e> <s> is it not the case that the housing associations are completing faster than expected and therefore it would be better to phase the increase in money differently <e> <s> does the minister not agree that it would be better to allow some of the money allocated for future years to be brought forward to this year <e> <s> did not the government allow that to happen last year in that they allowed million to be brought forward to this year <e> <s> since there is the great danger of cancellation of projects which are ready to start does he not agree that the idea which was so successfully implemented last year can be sensibly applied this year <e>", "<cs> my lords why was it possible to bring forward to this year million from last year when the same thing is not being allowed for this year when it is equally necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords in america public opinion has forced the tuna fishing industry to move over more and more to line fishing instead of net fishing because that does not trap the dolphins <e> <s> will her majestys government support that pressure as well as any other measures <e> <s> further is it not the case that the americans have also developed a kind of net that enables porpoises to escape <e> <s> should we not press that aspect as well <e>"]
