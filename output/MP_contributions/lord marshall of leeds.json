["<cs> my lords first may i crave the indulgence of your lordships house <e> <s> i must confess to some disappointment that my noble friend lord cockfield totally omitted reference to clause of the bill the definition of scotch whisky and irish whiskey <e> <s> not that i am a connoisseur just a satisfied user <e> <s> to be serious your lordships would i think expect me with my background associated as it has been with the larger provincial cities the great conurbations as well as london to have something to say about the vital innovation concerning enterprise zones announced by the chancellor in his budget speech <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to congratulate my noble friend lord grimston of westbury upon his speech this afternoon <e> <s> i had the privilege of knowing his late father and i can tell your lordships how much good his late father did for local government <e> <s> i follow a plethora of presidents of local authority associations and i shall try to be as relevant as they were even though they argued from different premises <e> <s> therefore with regard to clause may i say simply that however much the generality of local authorities welcome the relaxation of controls as referred to in clause many local authorities at the same time feel disappointment at the comparatively limited scope of the relaxation contained in clause of and schedules to to the bill <e> <s> i think that those authorities would very much hope that government would explore with local authority associations the inclusion in a future bill of further relaxations of governmental control and interference in particular with regard to those departments that have not hitherto been very forthcoming <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord sandford <e>", "<cs> what the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has argued depends to a large extent upon whether or not private interest will be adversely affected in the areas <e> <s> no evidence has so far been adduced that private interests will necessarily be adversely affected <e> <s> in fact on the contrary <e> <s> the aim of the urban development areas is to confer benefits upon an area which could have a spin-off effect upon the private interests within those geographical areas <e> <s> for that legal reason the rather attractive argument of the noble and learned lord must fall down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend the last speaker whether what he proposes in his amendment is educational or entertaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness on the statement which she has repeated <e> <s> i had the job of producing a report on the government of great london in and i came to the firm conclusion after hearing a vast amount of evidence that the ilea was financially unaccountable and that the only privilege that the glc had was to pick up the tab at the end of the day when they received the ilea precept <e> <s> we now know that something will be done about financial non-accountability <e> <s> i also came to the conclusion that the ilea was democratically not accountable <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness can tell us whether the government have plans to put that matter right also <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that most people concerned with local government will be very welcoming of this statement made by the noble lord <e> <s> would the noble lord care to say that a view was taken by the advisory committee on local government audit in regard to the public accounts committees recommendation that the audit commission should be under the surveillance of the comptroller and auditor-general the fact that he has announced that it is not going to be so will be greatly welcomed by those in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the house will be in the debt of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for having initiated this debate <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i should like to walk under the coat tails of my noble friend lord ridley who said as he always does rather disarmingly that he had an interest to declare and then went on to declare his presidency of the association of county councils and other distinguished associations <e> <s> i might walk as i say under his coat tails and declare an interest as a vice-chairman of the conservative party organisation with a kind of tenuous responsibility for local government <e> <s> i had the pleasure to serve for two years under the distinguished chairmanship of my noble friend lord thorneycroft <e> <s> one day i was waxing eloquent on the very great benefits which local government had conferred on the community <e> <s> i was discussing with him how all the sewers and the drains were built in the victoria era to counteract typhoid and other such horrible diseases <e> <s> i went on to say that the victorians called local government government of the drains <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord lord mishcon for saying that <e> <s> it is not the easiest of matters to refer to a commitment of <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon my lords but the commitment was a qualified commitment <e> <s> i was very careful to say that the qualified commitment said that it was hoped domestic rates would be abolished provided that should not take precedence over any changes in the present income tax <e> <s> the commitment was qualified <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord mishcon should remember better than i the conservative party manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept that <e> <s> i do not have the document in front of me and i am very sorry that the noble lord lord mishcon does not take too kindly to the dissimilarity of ages between us although of course i was only joking <e> <s> a careful reading of the manifesto will show that the commitment was a qualified commitment <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to take the point further as he has the document and i do not he would have to take the opportunity to read out what it said <e> <s> i believe he would find that i am correct and he is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords what i was saying was that those who are so vociferously in favour of abolishing the rates either domestic or non-domestic or both are not so articulate in suggesting the alternative source from which the revenue would be derived <e> <s> if one considers the figure of billion from domestic rates and billion from non-domestic rates it is a considerable amount of money <e> <s> the abolitionists do not take the trouble to turn round and say where that amount of money is to come from and it is a vast amount of money to have to raise <e> <s> it is for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i congratulate the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey upon his admirable maiden speech <e> <s> he comes from a local government background and i am sure the house will welcome him here <e> <s> i know he will be a great asset <e> <s> he spoke of the rapid advance of technology and quite obviously he is a very knowledgeable person on that subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to have been asked that question <e> <s> i am inclined to the view that the invitation to refer the matter to the deliberations of the new advisory board is a surplusage at this stage and may lead to further delay <e> <s> virtually nothing has happened to progress matters since apart from the serpell report and the janes report <e> <s> there have been plenty of reports about ordnance survey <e> <s> if one conducts a fair reading of the serpell report and i do not mean reading only those parts that appear to be favourable to ones argument i think that one will find that serpell dealt comprehensively with the affairs of ordnance survey making it quite unnecessary to refer the matter again to a committee which is only in its infancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i used the words that i understood that the director-general and the majority of the staff in so far as the noble lord has been reading bits of the serpell report without quoting the actual paragraphs from which he was reading i should like to ask him also to read paragraphs to which contain virtually what the government are proposing to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with the greatest possible respect i do not recall using the word privatisation at all in my speech nor did i mean to infer that serpell ever considered or advised upon privatisation in the ordnance survey <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise for not being in my place when the noble lord lord young of dartington opened this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may also say however that i had the advantage of reading the press release that was put out by the mutual aid centre on wednesday th april outlining the seven point charter for building society reform of which the noble lord lord young of dartington is a part author and on which no doubt he has spoken this evening <e> <s> secondly i declare an interest as being a director of a building society <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will be patient i have only one more point to make and that concerns the fourth point of the seven point charter of which the noble lord lord young of dartington is joint author <e> <s> this in my submission is wide of the mark it is the interests of building society directors <e> <s> i attended this morning the annual general meeting of my own building society and i was amazed to see that the members sitting in the audience were told among other things that i was a director of a philosophical and literary society a company limited by guarantee <e> <s> i was amazed to see they were also told that i was a director of the university college buckingham limited a company limited by guarantee <e> <s> this was knowledge which was superfluous but i did not mind that my interests commercial as well as non-commercial were being disclosed to the members in annual general meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hooson used the following words in discussing the role of the london borough councillors <e> <s> he said the borough councillors were not elected to run the glc <e> <s> of course we must then inquire what does running the glc entail and what is the glc <e> <s> like many other speakers i shall find it quite impossible to produce hamlet without the prince <e> <s> so if i use the word abolition from time to time i hope i shall be forgiven and that your lordships will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i bring up the rear but first i apologise to the house as i was not present in the chamber when my noble friend lord boardman introduced this motion <e> <s> this was due to an inescapable engagement arranged long before i knew i would be speaking in this debate so i hope your lordships will excuse me <e> <s> i also missed the maiden speech of my noble friend lord vinson but i have it on the highest authority that it is in order for me to congratulate him on that maiden speech <e> <s> i do so most sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry it is million <e> <s> i find it difficult to deal in astronomical sums of money <e> <s> the figure is million more money than was spent on putting a man on the moon i believe <e> <s> that is a wholly worthy and i hope rewarding exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords the national federation of housing associations is to be congratulated on initiating this inquiry into british housing and on producing this report as is the noble lord lord seebohm for introducing the debate today <e> <s> i think that we are fortunate to have with us a member of the inquiry team the right reverend prelate the bishop of southwark who i thought made a quite outstanding contribution to this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could ask the noble baroness whether she possibly misunderstood what i was saying becaause i do not remember saying that to sell off large housing estates would be detrimental to this that or the other <e> <s> it is not the sort of remark i would make anyway so perhaps <e>", "<cs> my lords when i opened the debate i said that i had not aimed the motion at the green paper and nor had i sought to exclude <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord diamond has considered the inhibitions that attend anyone proceeding under the employment protection consolidation act for what are in effect damages for breach of contract <e> <s> if he examines those matters carefully he will find that if one really wants true damages for breach of contract for unfair dismissal one would be most unwise to limit oneself to the powers and discretions accorded to industrial tribunals <e> <s> one would have no option but to go to a court as we know it <e> <s> i am bound to say in answer to the noble lord lord bruce of donington that the fact that someone may be taxed under schedule e from the profits of his office or his employment does not automatically in my view bring him within the word employment for the purposes of the employment protection consolidation act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord diamond will not have forgotten that incapacity or misbehaviour are well known words used in regard to contracts of employment <e> <s> the committee will i believe be aware that incapacity means that someone is no longer in possession of his full mental faculties among other things <e> <s> maybe he is not in full possession of his physical faculties rendering him incapable of continuing to perform his duties <e> <s> misbehaviour is again a pretty formal word well recognised in employment law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord may be misdirecting himself because the person who will be the chairman of a nationalised industry which is about to be privatised will be appointed by the government to hold office during the transitional period after privatisation <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at clause he will find that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister as gratified as i am to be able to say that the majority of the whole house have suffered no permanent damage or impairment <e>", "<cs> i very much admired the speech of the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> anyone who is attracted to the idea by some correlation between civilian life and life in the armed forces is severely misleading himself <e> <s> in civilian life a person has the right to refuse to do something that someone else asks him to do <e> <s> in the services one cannot without retribution refuse to carry out the terms of an order <e> <s> life is very different in civilian life from that in the armed forces <e>", "<cs> again i find myself in almost total agreement with what the noble lord lord mayhew had to say <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord graham deceives himself a little if he tries to compare the duties of a juryman on the one hand and the duties of a person whoever he may be sitting on a field general court martial a district court martial or a general court martial <e> <s> the juryman has the benefit of having the judge who goes to some great trouble to address the jury before they retire to give their verdict <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to prolong this discussion but surely the noble lord lord diamond should take account of the strict meaning of the word incapacity which was not quite the meaning he was ascribing to it a few moments ago <e> <s> the word incapacity refers to a series of happenings which incapacitate a person from carrying out a contract of employment <e> <s> i do not want to recite them all because frankly i do not remember them but three important ones are first that the person in question has been made a bankrupt secondly that he has become of unsound mind and thirdly that he has been committed to prison for the commission of a felony <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission the situation generally is that the question of ill-health is quite separate from the word incapac-ity and is dealt with in a separate clause in every contract of employment where one can find that the most generous leeway is given to someone who is ill certain periods are laid down which generally have nothing to do with the particular clause and have nothing to do with the word incapacity <e>", "<cs> i declare an interest as chairman of an insurance company i oppose the amendment of the noble lord it would be unrealistic to require the conduct of regulated insurance companies which as beneficial owners hold the assets of the long-term insurance funds to meet their liabilities towards policy holders to be in all respects consistent with the rules for other investment managers dealing as principals or agents for investors who unlike policyholders remain the beneficial owners of the assets <e>", "<cs> it appears that in discussing amendment no <e> <s> a moved by the noble lord lord williams of elvel we have somehow slid into a discussion of the forthcoming amendment no <e> <s> of my noble friend the minister <e> <s> if that is the case i wonder whether by leave i may say a few words now about amendment no <e> <s> and then i shall not say anything at the appropriate time when the amendment is called <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak on this amendment moved by my noble friend the minister by saying that section of the insurance companies act provides for regulations to be made governing <e>", "<cs> before commenting i should like to declare an interest as i am the chairman of an insurance company and of a unit trust company <e>", "<cs> i am rather unclear as to how the position will lie <e> <s> my concern is that people in this country who are investing their hard earned savings in life assurance companies which are located and domiciled offshore in places like gibraltar should have so far as possible the fullest investor protection rights rights so far as possible equivalent to rights that they could achieve in this country either under this bill or this act when it becomes an act or under any other insurance protection legislation on the statute book <e> <s> one of the great difficulties is that in the past this has not happened and has led to the losses to which i have referred with the signal life assurance company because they were not answerable under uk legisaltion <e> <s> i am trying to ensure that investors in this country will be accorded a similar protection <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by my noble friend lord kimball seeks to require that when selling life assurance an appointed representative should declare to all potential policyholders that the premium which they will be paying for a particular policy will be the same irrespective of the type of intermediary from whom they purchase it <e> <s> when a similar amendment was moved at the report stage of this bill in another place its supporters argued that this requirement would underpin the sibs proposals for equivalence of treatment between appointed representatives and independent intermediaries in the area of disclosure <e> <s> in my view the government were right to point out during the debate in the other place that premiums are not always the same when policies are sold by different outlets and it would not be sensible to require appointed representatives effectively to make an untrue statement when they may have no way of knowing what costs or premiums are payable under investment agreements offered by authorised businesses <e>", "<cs> my lords in so far as this amendment requires further support which i doubt i beg leave to say that it commends itself to me and i declare an interest as vice-president of the building societies association and as a director of a building society for the past years because it would help building societies to provide a broader and better service for their customers in accordance with the provisions of the building societies act <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak briefly to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i must declare an interest as chairman of an insurance company <e> <s> i rise to express the reservations of the insurance industry in regard to this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to avoid any repetition of the very many points made by so many eloquent previous speakers not least by the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> one has to admit at this time of the evening that most of the points have been made already <e> <s> the original instruction initiated by the noble lord lord sefton required the select committee on which i served as a member to consider the consequences of the bill on the south-east region and on the city of london in particular <e> <s> after the house had agreed that the select committee might hear evidence from sources other than the promoters we were offered no evidence which related to that instruction or no evidence which i can remember <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is <e> <s> i speak with some experience of inner-city problems both in the north and the north-east of england <e> <s> i also have not a little experience of the problems of the eight-and-a-half square miles of londons docklands <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down does he not agree that what i was saying was that the terms of the instruction initiated by the noble lord lord sefton of garston were completely different from the terms of his amendment which is before the house today <e>", "<cs> i should also like to say that the words whenever practicable will be a matter of great contention if any person who fails to comply is thereby guilty of an offence <e> <s> it makes me regret that i am a lawyer retired from private practice because the amount of litigation that this might generate is a very attractive proposition so far as the law is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the lord chairman of committees for the advice he gave to the house and also to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe with whom i have worked for many years for his words of support <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for the very constructive approach he <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble viscount and i accept fully what he says <e> <s> however it might have been more helpful had a discussion taken place between british rail and the noble viscount before the debate this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether what the noble and learned lord lord denning said does not also apply to professional advisers including accountants who are asked questions by inspectors of taxes about their clients financial affairs <e> <s> there must be a time when a professional adviser has some protection in the face of what is an overwhelming demand made for instance by an inspector of taxes in respect of a taxpayer for whom the professional adviser acts as a chartered accountant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> as many of your lordships will be aware i had the privilege of moving the second reading of this bill when it was debated by your lordships house on th march last <e> <s> little did i think that it would be necessary to be troubling your lordships yet again but i must crave your lordships indulgence while i explain once more the provisions of the bill and in addition provide an indication of what has happened to the bill since it was given a second reading <e> <s> i do so because i understand that the noble viscount lord craigavon intends to press his objections <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> lord brabazon of tara for his statement <e> <s> i am also obliged to the noble viscount lord sidmouth <e> <s> i believe that the points he raised will he noted by british rail and i am sure that it will give proper regard to them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> for the avoidance of doubt i should like to ask the noble lord whether he subscribes to the view expressed by the noble viscount who when moving the amendment described homosexuality as legal <e> <s> in my view the legislature of this country has never legalised homosexuality not even between consenting adults it has merely protected from criminal prosecutions adults who committed homosexual acts together by consent <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he please consider that local authorities are creatures of statute and derive their powers statutorily <e> <s> they do not get them from anywhere else <e> <s> is that not a proper answer to the question posed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> your lordships will be pleased to note the brevity and simplicity of this bill the purpose of which is encapsulated in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how grateful i am to all noble lords who have displayed such a helpful approach to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if it comes to an argument on a busy train as i think i pointed out in my opening speech the question will have to be resolved in a different way <e> <s> if it cannot be resolved because of pressure of time the ticket examiner will issue a penalty fare notice which will then require payment within days or will allow investigation within days <e> <s> it is then that the powers that be within british rail will investigate to see where the passenger boarded what were the conditions obtaining at the station he joined whether any deferred ticket machines were in operation or whether the booking clerks were in attendance <e> <s> in my submission the matter will be dealt with fairly at the end of the day but it will take days <e>", "<cs> my lords i also join noble lords in their regret at the death of sir brandon rhys williams <e> <s> nothing i say shortly i hope in opposition to the bill is to be taken as indicating that i am against non-executive directors <e> <s> i have been one for over years and i still am <e> <s> neither am i opposed to audit committees <e> <s> i have served on audit committees <e> <s> i currently serve on a voluntary audit committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lady gardner of parkes on the very clear and attractive way in which she has spoken on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> however i beg leave to register my opposition to it particularly to part iv <e>", "<cs> while i fully understand what the noble lord has said and have every respect for what my noble friend lord boardman had to say i am just wondering whether your lordships chamber should have to defer or wait upon the deliberations of anyone even of the takeover panel or indeed of the cbi <e>", "<cs> i ask the committee to oppose this amendment on the basis that the amendment deletes the new section a which confers a power on the secretary of state to amend certain provisions of part vi of the companies act that is on the question of the disclosure of interests in shares <e> <s> it also repeals section of the act <e> <s> i do not want to elevate it to the seriousness with which my noble friend referred to it just now but i am opposed on the grounds that the existing provisions for disclosure are quite satisfactory in most respects and that the new section a is unobjectionable in all respects <e> <s> for those reasons i hope that my noble friend will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when in the labour government came to power they declared that there was no foreseeable need for any future airport facilities or capability in the south east and that there would not be for the next years and that i as chairman of the maplin development authority was then sent for and told that the project was scrapped <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be permitted to say that i am in a somewhat privileged situation because i happen to receive briefing material from the bar and from the law society <e> <s> the first briefing i do not read and the second one i read not as thoroughly as i should <e> <s> however it is the view of solicitors that amendments such as these seem at first sight to be attractive <e> <s> it is argued that the cab rank rule ensures that all advocates in the higher courts are subject to the same rules and thus it provides a level playing field <e> <s> but it is also argued that it ensures that legally-aided litigants are properly represented <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how grateful i am to all noble lords who have participated in this debate on second reading <e> <s> one or two noble friends including my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard raised the issue of noise levels <e> <s> i dealt extensively with the difficulties of the noise problem when i spoke on the matter during the second reading debate <e> <s> it will be remembered that i said in regard to noise levels that the electrically powered vehicles will be much quieter than the present trains using diesel engines that there were some new disc brake designs and more welded rails allowing for quieter running especially with regard to noise reduction for those living near or alongside the line <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord and i am sure that british rail will answer that point at the select committee <e> <s> it is a fact that the normal increase in freight traffic is expected to be so great that it will be equivalent to lorry movements per year
