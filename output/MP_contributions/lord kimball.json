["<cs> my lords i hope i am not overtaxing your indulgence by asking for it for a third time this afternoon but i do find myself in a somewhat curious situation as indeed did my distinguished predecessor from another place the late lord crook-shank when he addressed this house for the first time in this debate some years ago today <e> <s> he said then that he found himself doing something novel and yet <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for this prompt and generous help to the less favoured areas <e> <s> as one who very nearly lost all his hill cow subsidy because of a little local difficulty of the number of one cow may i particularly welcome the flexibility that he is introducing into the hill cow subsidy scheme <e> <s> this is a year when many people will not be able to maintain their numbers as the scheme demands <e> <s> the noble lord lord walston mentioned the hardship inflicted on the corn growing areas <e> <s> i hope my noble friend agrees that the lesson we have all learned from the bad weather is that people will soon have to stop growing corn in unsuitable areas <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend whether we could have a debate on this subject <e> <s> i think that he touched on a very important issue <e> <s> he started to stray in his statement into the whole question of land use <e> <s> does my noble friend realise that there may well be a case for more afforestation in grade land but there is certainly no case for more afforestation in moorland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl who has just sat down has been characteristically modest about the enormous part that he has played in persuading the government to have the political courage to bring forward this bill <e> <s> there is no doubt and i was a member of the other place that the success he had in getting his two bills through all their stages in this house has influenced the government enormously in this way <e> <s> may i add to what has already been said my congratulations to the noble viscount lord allenby on his maiden speech <e> <s> the only thing that i am somewhat sad about is that by some quirk of the school system and we both had the same tutors we were deprived of his lucid argument and clear diction for the whole time that he ws a member of mr jaques debating society at school <e> <s> but we certainly enjoyed it today <e> <s> it is with some pleasure that i find myself in agreement with the noble lord lord houghton after many years of disagreeing with him on certain other subjects in another place <e> <s> it was a great pleasure to realise what a major contribution he has made to this bill and to the atmosphere in this chamber today <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of a district fishery board and i am also the managing partner of a sweep net <e>", "<cs> i find myself in somewhat of a minority here <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord ridley will not have the same success with this amendment as he had with his previous amendment <e> <s> although i sympathise with the spirit behind the amendment i must tell your lordships that in practical terms it simply will not work <e> <s> the theory that because you have a drought in your watershed your fish will remain in your estuary washing in and out on the tide hoping that in a couple of weeks time they will eventually be able to run the river just is not true <e> <s> in actual fact what happens is that they try the river of their origin the first time round and if there is a drought there they push off round the coast basically going off round to the east coast and down the east coast turning round at northumberland and coming round again up the coast of scotland hoping to get up a river <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i should not want to move amendment no <e> <s> i seek confirmation from my noble friend that he will as a result of amendment no <e> <s> be making regulations to deal with the problem of the leader of the stake net being set as a gill net and a gill net being set from the shore <e> <s> those are two major problems but i hope that amendment no <e> <s> will allow my noble friend to deal with them <e>", "<cs> may i suggest that the noble earl who has just sat down goes to billingsgate market in july <e> <s> he is quite likely to find there on any one morning about am when the fish boxes are opened that two-thirds of the fish in the market have been illegally caught <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> may i make it absolutely clear that two-thirds of the fish in the market were hung fish <e> <s> the inspector was there on the morning i went <e> <s> we went round we saw the boxes open and they were fish that had been caught in gill nets <e> <s> it was proved because of the marks at the back of the head and around the gills <e> <s> two-thirds of the fish in the market in salmon boxes were hung fish <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the government will resist the amendment because as i understand the position anybody with a rateable value of in a watershed is entitled to a seat on a district fishery board <e> <s> i am confident that that is the position <e> <s> it seems a sensible position to maintain <e> <s> i do not know how otherwise you would select from all the people who fish your river who would be a member of the district fishery board and i hope that the government will leave the situation as it is at present <e> <s> i appreciate the liberal sentiments of the noble viscount lord thurso but i do not think that his suggestion will be an improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that two of the proposed sites are in the old county of lincolnshire and that anybody who knows that part of <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some trepidation as one who is not versed in the law that i dare to enter into this debate <e> <s> my only reason for so doing is that for the past two and half years i have been joint chairman of lloyds of londons law reform committee <e> <s> we have been negotiating with the department on this particular bill and on the long stop provisions especially <e> <s> in any negotiations with a government department the more that one has to negotiate more often than not one gets let down by it <e> <s> it is fair to say that my understanding of the position of the negotiations as we finished them was exactly that as summarised by the noble lord lord hacking who has just spoken namely that the long stop provision would run for years from the date of completion of a building <e> <s> that is a very acceptable arrangement and one equally proposed by the noble lord lord mais <e>", "<cs> my lords the service of the noble lord lord taylor to the forestry industry is well known <e> <s> his concern has been well expressed tonight even though i suspect in another capacity his heart may be elsewhere at wembley on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the passing through this house of the private members bill dealing with safety at sea would be an ideal opportunity to insist that the trawlers operating in the northumberland drift net fishery <e>", "<cs> my lords no member of your lordships house would doubt the depth of local knowledge which my noble friend lord holderness <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say why sheep only <e> <s> are we monitoring the position as regards fat cattle <e> <s> certainly in easter ross some fat cattle will be coming forward for slaughter in the near future <e> <s> can my noble friend say a word on the position of monitoring of cattle <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the report of the medical officer of health for the county of sutherland the late dr lyndsey who over many years long before dounreay was ever built had to face up to the fact that the diseases prevalent among the communities huddled along the north coast of multiple sclerosis epilepsy melancholia and leukaemia were always out of proportion to the rest of scotland and even to the county of sutherland itself <e> <s> is he also aware of the opinion of dr lyndsey that in considering this problem one has to bear in mind the historic factors of isolation inbreeding and imbibing <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware as i am myself as an employer of labour quite close to dounreay that the general wish of the whole population of the county of sutherland and that part of caithness is to get a job at dounreay <e> <s> everybody wants more opportunities to work at dounreay and they are very grateful for the prosperity that the atomic energy authority has brought to the whole north coast <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will be aware that this is a well read and well educated part of the country <e> <s> people will understand the motives behind the question of the noble lord lord jenkins but they will not understand and will resent his deductions <e>", "<cs> i am certain that the members of the british field sports society will be thrilled to know that the noble lord lord bruce of donington regards bfss investments as a major city fund <e> <s> i should remind him that it was in fact a fund set up to protect the interests of those in the countryside <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington did not seem to realise that he was talking about a unique institution in the shape of lloyds <e> <s> it is within two years of its th anniversary and is bringing in million in foreign exchange to this country <e> <s> the first thing a labour government have to do when they come to power is go down lime street and assure themselves that that amount of foreign exchange is still coming in despite the threat that they always pose to the economy of this country <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kennet and my noble friend lord montagu have made a very good case for the existing procedures but they have utterly failed to deal with the argument which has been put forward so well by my noble friend lord salisbury that the whole of the procedures at which we are looking at the moment are quite simply undemocratic and unfair <e> <s> that is an argument to which i hope we shall have an answer from the government when they reply because that is the feeling on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of my noble friends reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does not my noble friend agree that he has made an encouraging start in the right direction with minimum hardship to the agricultural community <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very appropriate that my noble friend lord montgomery should introduce the bill at this time <e> <s> after all we had the erroll report just at the time that the breweries and the supply of beer was referred to the monopolies commission <e> <s> at this moment the director of fair trading is looking at the whole of the tied house system <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that lloyds itself is very grateful to sir patrick neill for his thorough and careful study of the situation <e> <s> it must be particularly grateful for his finding that <e>", "<cs> my lords in agreeing with the motion perhaps i may declare an interest as a council member of lloyds of london and say that in anticipating some of the comments that might be made in this debate i took the precaution of checking most carefully with the market exactly what the position is <e> <s> at this moment there is no shortage of capacity within the lloyds market for professional people to get all the insurance they need and to get all the cover they need in every form they need it <e> <s> in fact as has already been said the insurance premiums are now beginning to fall substantially and they will fall substantially over the next two years <e> <s> market forces are coming into play in this market <e> <s> the difficulties which the noble lord lord hacking mentioned earlier that were experienced in this market are behind us <e> <s> the undercapitalised and inexperienced underwriters have been put out of business <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend bear in mind that the major predator upon sand eels is the grey seal <e> <s> that is a factor which should be taken into account when we consider the management of the exploding grey seal population around our coasts <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there could well be some concern about the verification documents that have been issued with the british airports authoritys new share issue if the shaky state of british caledonians finances were known particularly in view of the fact that it represents a major part of the prosperity of gatwick airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this motion is the right moment for your lordships house to consider what are the realistic prospects for this bill after completing all its stages in your lordships house <e> <s> this bill will go to another place as a public bill which has not been introduced by the government <e> <s> even if taken up by another mp as the noble lord lord wyatt <e> <s> assures us it will it goes on the order paper of another place below the line <e> <s> whatever day it is put down for it will never be reached <e>", "<cs> my lords add the congratulations of this side of the house to those that have already been expressed by the noble lord lord blease to the noble earl lord granville on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> how much we all agree with him when he says that so much depends on the confidence the local agricultural community has in the local regional officer of the nature conservancy council <e> <s> we all hope that the sound commonsense and excellent leadership which has been shown by the present chairman of the nature conservancy council in england and wales and his counterpart in scotland will start to permeate through the whole of the organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords without in any way wishing to downcry the damage that is done by the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies may i ask him whether in his reply he would look particularly at the point on scottish fisheries which is covered by schedule to the bill and to which there is an amendment down za <e> <s> it is only a probing amendment <e> <s> exactly the same arguments apply north of the border as south of the border where a fishery board north of the border is making an assessment under the section of the act <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend in his reply could give some indication of whether or not the district fishery boards in scotland where they levy a rate will be able to retain that rate for the benefit of the fisheries they look after <e>", "<cs> my lords i refer my noble friend lord dilhorne to the middle page of this weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may address my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> in so far as it affects england and wales and to amendment no <e> <s> inasmuch as it affects scotland <e> <s> the amendments were specifically put down in order to try to find out what is the governments intention about the rating of shooting <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the indication which i read into my noble friends reply that he may be prepared to have a look at the unfairness of this matter before third reading i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is one other underlying fear behind the amendment which the noble lady has moved <e> <s> when information technology is advanced to such a state that all shotguns with their numbers can be held on one central computer which is quite feasible in the not too distant future we shall find that rather like putting the clock back on a motor car a great many of the serial numbers of some of the best guns in his country made by the london gun trade are not totally accurate <e> <s> that i believe is partly due to the war and records being destroyed by bombs <e> <s> however there are some guns that carry serial numbers which make them look younger than they are <e>", "<cs> in view of that reply and the undertaking from my noble friend that he will give further consideration to the point that a weapon can only be used on land to which the territorial restriction on the firearm certificate applies which would meet the point that he made about somebody else being allowed to use a gun in his front garden i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards amendment no <e> <s> i wish to thank the government most sincerely for legalising what is in fact a well-established practice <e> <s> during the course of this bill there has been a certain amount of criticism that the government have not paid too much attention to the demands of the genuine users of firearms <e> <s> this is an example where the government have listened and have gone out of their way to meet a well-established practice <e> <s> from the point of view of the police and everyone else by allowing the principle of the estate right for someone who comes to stalk or to use a rifle the government are ensuring that fewer firearms certificates are issued and fewer people have a need to buy a firearm <e> <s> they can go stalking and use a rifle which is already there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gallacher in opening this debate has at least confirmed to all of us the importance which we all attach to the continuation of the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> he may have put down a challenge about its future but everything he has said today has emphasised the point that the ministry of agriculture is the most important ministry in this field <e> <s> however the ministry of agriculture may have found that the department of health has been a somewhat fair <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that i should declare an interest as an honorary associate of the royal college of veterinary surgeons and as chairman of the cambridge university veterinary trust <e> <s> the unstarred question that the noble lord lord molloy has tabled asks categorically what action the government should take <e> <s> i say to my noble friend tonight that i hope the first action we take will be to inform the university grants committee in its new form that it will take after st april that the riley report is based on a false premise <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord lord peston forgot that criticism of the report came from behind him to his left to his right as well as in front of him <e> <s> it is fair to say that this has been a unique debate <e> <s> in fact noble lords have spoken and from all sides of your lordships house have found little in favour of the monopolies and mergers commissions report <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that point but i am giving an initial reaction to what my noble friend asked <e> <s> my noble friend lord thomas showed us the extent of the legal tangle into which we may get <e> <s> it is the governments job to sort that out <e> <s> it is not our job to do so <e> <s> but we may find ourselves in a very difficult and serious situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend appreciates that he has made a very disappointing statement <e> <s> of course the industry is grateful for what he said that he will do <e> <s> already <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be churlish of me not to start by thanking the minister for some progress over the period of negotiations and consultations that has taken place on the order <e> <s> however in my opinion we are faced with a sad evening in this house on three major points where there has been further dicrimination putting constraints upon the major brewers of great britain who own more than outlets thus making it difficult for them to compete for the supply of the free trade <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that the national licensed victuallers association has obtained an eloquent advocate in the shape of the noble viscount lord falkland <e> <s> however i am sure noble lords do not want to be led down any road of sentimental attachment to the good publican because we are discussing in this bill a straight and profitable business relationship <e> <s> i hope the house will remember that <e>", "<cs> my lords some of your lordships may have a room in your house where you hang old school photographs <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that i have a shooting eight photograph in which the captain is none other than my noble friend lord swansea <e> <s> therefore it hurts me a great deal to have to repudiate in this house so much of what he said particularly about the firearms consultative committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will realise that there are those of us on this side of the house who do not share the view of the noble lord lord williams that the bill is a mistake <e> <s> the bill is perfectly correctly drafted for what it was intended to provide <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord williams does not seem to realise that there are many on this side of the house to which those amendments are not acceptable and who do not feel <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the bill was introduced in another place by my successor in my former constituency <e> <s> i am grateful for the opportunity of supporting him <e>", "<cs> my lords in conclusion perhaps i may follow the example of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and thank him for his support and express my thanks for the support which the bill has received from his side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord radnor for all the work and attention he has given to the detail of this bill <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble baroness lady nicol for accurately summarising the problem we face in accepting the amendment much as i should like to do because i now that my noble friend genuinely prefers the word treat <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to disagree with my noble friend but i regret to say that his amendments taken together change the structure of the bill <e> <s> that is the problem <e> <s> this paragraph in the bill has been <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just say to my noble friend lord gisborough that he is quite correct in what he said <e> <s> however i hope that i can convince him and my noble friend lord stanley that what they fear is not the case <e> <s> the requirement on the occupier as set out in the bill as drafted is not an absolute one <e> <s> it is to prevent a crop from encroaching on to or over a relevant highway so as to render it inconvenient for the exercise of the right of way <e> <s> an authority taking action must first assess the inconvenience being caused to path users <e> <s> therefore there is a consistency of drafting with the same concept being applied here as elsewhere in the bill namely in clause on page line and on page line <e> <s> in each case there has to be some demonstrable inconvenience to the public before the provision can be applied <e>", "<cs> i have much pleasure in accepting the amendment <e> <s> in doing so i thank the noble earl lord radnor for his diligence and experience <e> <s> it has enabled him to spot a point which had hitherto been missed <e> <s> despite all the careful scrutiny that the bill had had by the working party the lawyers the officials of the ministry of agriculture the department of transport in fact three government departments and the preliminary draftsmen and so on this point did not surface <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for having spotted it <e> <s> i have much pleasure in accepting the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will reconsider and not press the amendment <e> <s> we all understand the point quite clearly but the definition we propose in the bill has existed in legislation since and has not given rise to any difficulties in the court cases that have been brought <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend said this is a simple matter <e> <s> at committee stage we were pleased to accept the small amendment so wisely moved by my noble friend lord radnor <e> <s> its purpose was to make it clear that at least for the provisions of the bill the term grass does not include a cereal crop <e> <s> unfortunately however the words chosen to frame that amendment did not meet with the approval of the parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> as a result we now have before us these two amendments to the amendment as it were putting what we have already agreed into a different form of words <e> <s> in fact all we have done is to put a little more polish on the amendment <e> <s> i hope that noble lords will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to delay the house at this late hour or at this late stage in the session <e> <s> had the bill any chance of making progress there are several relevant arguments that i would wish to deploy <e> <s> there is no valid argument why the level of compensation for public house tenants should be any greater than that for any other business tenant that is six times the rateable value of the tenancy <e> <s> that is the minimum value only <e> <s> in practice most brewery companies have paid more <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that a humble address be presented to her majesty as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the tenth parliament of her majestys reign <e> <s> the opening of the previous sessions was the responsibility of the late lord great chamberlain who performed this task with all the care charm and precision he devoted to the responsibilities of the great office of state exercised by his family during her majestys reign <e> <s> what a pleasure it is to all of your lordships and to the friends of the family to see the present lord great chamberlain carrying on the family tradition in a way in which his father would be proud <e>", "<cs> my lords those of your lordships who have had the honour to be asked to move this address know that after soundings from the captain of the gentlemen-at-arms the formal invitation comes in a letter from my noble friend the leader of the house <e> <s> as i read it i was very conscious of the fact that almost years ago to the day i was forced to explain to the then mr ganzoni the newest of new boys that if he did not keep my room tidy and stop burning my toast at tea he would never make a success of his life <e> <s> our respective positions in this house prove how timely that warning was <e>"]
