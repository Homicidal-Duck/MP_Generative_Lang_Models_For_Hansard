["<cs> my lords i rise this evening very conscious of the fact that i am making my maiden speech and addressing your lordships from the dispatch box for the first time <e> <s> i would ask your indulgence on both counts <e> <s> i would also like to express my most sincere thanks to my noble friends and to the noble lord lord carmichael for their kind and generous words of encouragement <e>", "<cs> my lords the general policy is at least to maintain the current overall level of supercomputing services <e> <s> the computer board is currently in discussion with the university of london about new arrangements for securing an efficient and cost effective contribution to those services from the university of london computer centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord peston for his kind wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> whatever changes may be necessary in the geographical location of provision of service the intention would be at least to maintain the existing level of service nationally <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for those figures from other countries <e> <s> i was not aware of them <e> <s> where efficiency reviews have been undertaken which affect the spending of public money we cannot ignore the findings if it is shown that savings can be found <e> <s> i repeat that there is no intention of reducing the provision <e> <s> however there is a requirement to make provision more cost-effective at the ulcc <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will appreciate that i am rather <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i have given has already taken account of london weighting <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen press comment to that effect <e> <s> i do not think i can defend from the dispatch box anything that i have seen in the press <e>", "<cs> my lords assuming nominal lives of to years for fossil-fuelled plant years for magnox and years for agrs per cent <e> <s> of the existing plant in england and wales will be time-expired by and per cent <e> <s> by <e> <s> that is equivalent to gigawatts by and gigawatts by <e> <s> noble lords will appreciate that in a competitive market for generation the actual life of the plant will depend upon commercial decisions by the companies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree <e> <s> several generators are building or are planning to build new plant <e> <s> in addition to projects promoted by national power and powergen a number of independent projects are coming forward <e> <s> planning consents already exist for more than gigawatts of new gas-fired generating capacity <e> <s> most of the applications are for gas-fired capacity <e> <s> applications <e>", "<cs> my lords in the new structure of the industry a competitive market will provide the capacity needed <e> <s> suppliers are required by their licences to meet the existing standards of security and to purchase sufficient electricity from the pool to meet the needs of customers <e> <s> generators will respond to the pool price and consequently will have an incentive to build sufficient capacity <e> <s> suppliers may also enter into long-term contracts with the generators as well as buying from the pool <e>", "<cs> my lords the distributors now have this power <e> <s> there are further powers vested in the director general of electricity supply <e> <s> he will monitor the security of supply provided by suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the director general cannot supply electricity himself <e> <s> but the system in other industries involving people occupying similar roles has proved effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the government provide no funds directly to operators of generating capacity contracted for under the non-fossil fuel obligation <e> <s> there are powers in the electricity act to contribute to the costs of reprocessing and waste management of nuclear fuel and decommissioning of nuclear plant but no payments have been made or are presently expected <e> <s> the extra costs incurred by regional electricity companies in meeting the nffo are recouped from all electricity suppliers through the fossil fuel levy <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords the exact figures appear on a long list <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i should have thanked the noble lord at the beginning of my remarks for his welcoming comments <e> <s> this is a complicated schedule <e> <s> if the noble lord wants those details i shall have to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have given the figures <e> <s> i certainly would need notice before providing any more <e> <s> i said that some million was available for nuclear research and development and million for the research and development of renewables <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that will be the case <e> <s> under the nffo these matters are recognised <e> <s> no suggestion has been made to us that renewable forms of energy will have a difficult time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those comments <e> <s> at no time in the foreseeable future will renewables other than nuclear amount to more than per cent <e> <s> of total generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with those comments <e> <s> i do not think that nuclear power is extremely damaging to the environment <e> <s> the governments policy is to have a broad spread <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is the case <e> <s> we have information that the programme in this country is well respected throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding wave power the government are updating their earlier wave studies and a review is in hand to examine the prospects for wave energy in the united kingdom across the whole range from shoreline to large offshore devices <e> <s> all interested parties are being consulted including professor salter <e> <s> the study is due for completion next year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an interesting point <e>", "<cs> my lords before i answer this question i should declare an interest in that my family business has been engaged in exploring the possibilities of wind generation <e> <s> the fossil fuel levy compensates the regional electricity companies in england and wales for the additional costs they incur in fulfilling the non-fossil fuel obligations imposed on them <e> <s> while separate obligations have been imposed for nuclear and renewable generating capacity it would be unnecessarily complex to impose separate levies in respect of nuclear and renewables <e>", "<cs> my lords under the nffo the regional electricity companies have entered into contracts for over eight gigawatts of nuclear capacity and megawatts nameplate capacity of renewables <e> <s> that demonstrates the success of the policy to date <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says <e> <s> those costs will emerge in the declared accounts of nuclear electric and others and it will become apparent what the levy will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lards point <e> <s> we shall be reviewing the matter <e> <s> i cannot reveal the details at the moment but i shall inform him <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady hooper i beg to introduce a bill to make provision with respect to the unlawful disclosure of information required in connection with the discharge of functions under the census act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the wage settlement is a matter for the electricity industry <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i did answer the question <e> <s> this matter is for the electricity industry <e> <s> of course general levels of pay are of interest to the government but negotiations are squarely a matter for the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i defer to the noble lords experience in the matter <e> <s> however i do not see that that has a bearing on the governments attitude towards pay and negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i could not have been clearer than i was in my original answer <e> <s> the wage settlement is a matter for the electricity industry and therefore the government are distanced from those negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the noble lords remark <e> <s> as i say the government have an attitude towards pay negotiations which is well known to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords school admission registers in maintained schools are not public documents and the regulations governing the compilation and use of school records provide that they may only be used for educational purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that additional question <e> <s> the governments attitude is enshrined in law and regulations <e> <s> my departments responsibility must be confined to ensuring that no records are divulged to unauthorised people <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not here to talk about approval or disapproval <e> <s> our attitude is enshrined in law and regulations and i made that clear in my opening answer <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that suggestion <e> <s> i am not entirely clear on the present position <e> <s> i believe that updating is in hand at the moment but i shall be pleased to write to the noble baroness in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords some parents could be upset and i believe that the law and other provisions protect them from that <e>"]
