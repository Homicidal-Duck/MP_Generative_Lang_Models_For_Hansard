depth of study and the qualifications which the noble lord lord vaizey possesses and that is particularly so in the area of dance and the theatre <e> <s> i too can claim robin howard as an old friend of some years <e> <s> i have always been interested and aware of what he has been doing at the institute of contemporary dance but the dance has never played as much a part in my life as music <e>",

own personal reasons how pleased i am to be able to speak in the debate introduced by him <e> <s> i should also like to join other noble lords in acknowledging the contribution made by the members of the royal commission in producing the report which is the principal subject of todays debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord glenamara for introducing this debate on such an important subject at so timely a moment <e> <s> the few days that have passed since the government introduced their latest budget have allowed us to consider more carefully the effects of the measures put forward and to assess them in the context of the requirements of the country <e> <s> i should like also to apologise to the noble lord lord glenamara and to my noble ally lord banks for arriving too late to hear their speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords if i can lay claim to the good fortune of

more favourable than today and with the advantages <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for his persistence and foresight in asking this question at a time when i hope your lordships house can still combine with the countless voices from outside parliament to persuade the government to renounce what would be a sad betrayal of the british theatre <e> <s> the rayner scrutiny seems to show in these short sections not only a narrow-minded and essentially condescending attitude to the commitment of previous governments to provide a theatre museum worthy of our theatrical traditions but seems in places to be wilfully blind to the cultural educational and even economic value of the project <e> <s> the rayner scrutiny implies for instance that the government are being asked to shoulder the entire burden of preserving the history of theatre in this country ignoring the fact already highlighted by other noble lords that the value of private gifts and benefactions to the museum since is many times the cost of establishing the building to house them <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord jacques for introducing this debate i am struck by how apt the motion is and how unsurprising his phraseology <e> <s> it seems almost natural to associate the governments economic policy with cost and not with benefit not just as a political opponent of this government but as anyone working or not working as the case may be in this country anyone retired or anyone studying <e> <s> the government did not of course promise that it would be easy but it seems tragic that so much has been sacrificed by so many for what is so far so little <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to answer him briefly <e> <s> i did not think it appropriate to rehearse the detailed policies which my party outlined in this document and many others <e> <s> i will happily send the noble lord a copy <e> <s> what i did was to try to outline the general philosophy which my party holds and which if the electoral system which the noble lord himself says is freakish allows us would give us the chance to promote the creation of wealth and not the destruction of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to those expressed by other noble lords to the noble lord lord polwarth for initiating this debate and demonstrating so vividly the severe crisis in the performing arts <e> <s> the knowledge and experience of the noble lord lord marley which he demonstrated so well in his speech make me feel inadequate even in congratulating him let alone in speaking further <e> <s> in that vein i think that in a debate on this subject it would be appropriate to describe myself as an understudy for my noble friend lord donaldson of kingsbridge who is unable to attend your lordships house this evening and whose knowledge and experience will therefore be much missed <e>", "<cs> my lords last week it was suggested in your lordships house that companies accounts although appearing dull <e> <s> in fact contain within them great human drama <e> <s> the subject which the noble lord lord lever has introduced tonight could be seen as even more esoteric and incomprehensible but it also contains within it human drama on the highest scale <e> <s> indeed a number of my fellow bankers have found even richer pastures than the profession of banking in writing best-selling thrillers about economic armaggedon brought on by the collapse of the international banking system <e> <s> even cinema audiences have been shown the tightrope which international banks have to walk and the consequences of the system breaking down <e>", "<cs> my lords to those of other noble lords i should like to add my particular thanks to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for introducing the debate on this motion <e> <s> since i last spoke in your lordships house about the governments economic policies

to apologise for leaving before the end of the debate in which case i shall read the final speeches with great interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise for being unable to attend the beginning of this debate which was due not to a faint heart when faced with a long but distinguished list of speakers but a commitment at work which i could not break <e> <s> i am sure i shall read the speeches which i missed with as much enjoyment as i have had listening to the speeches i have heard today <e> <s> with more noble lords due to speak tonight before this debate can be wound up i shall be very brief <e> <s> another reason for being so brief is that the gracious speech comes after an intensive and wordy election campaign in which the economic record of the government was a central focus of attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the other noble lords who have spoken this afternoon in thanking the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for introducing this debate on a stimulating but contentious subject <e> <s> after one of my first speeches to your lordships house the noble lord suggested that my contribution exhibited a radical naivety or perhaps a naive radicalism which reminded him of some of the speeches made by members of the labour party in another place when immediately after the second world war they were lodging temporarily in your lordships chamber <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not think me impertinent if i say that the subject of the debate which he has proposed and his speech suggest to me naivety certainly but perhaps radicalism also now that the advocates of a return to <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx first became prime minister i was of an age at which much of my reading matter centred on stories about a schoolboy in the upper sixth suddenly finding himself playing in the cup final shoulder to shoulder with roy of the rovers or going into bat at lords with a latter-day w g grace <e> <s> i say this not to emphasise the handful of years that separate the noble lord from myself in age but to express my feelings in trying to wind up on behalf of my colleagues on the alliance benches in the debate introduced today by the noble lord lord wilson <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the use of statistics referring to a selection of european countries over the last months is definitely arbitrary in considering a subject such as unemployment where the trends are a great deal longer term than months <e> <s> i hope that when the noble earl speaks again he may quote some figures on the growth in unemployment in the united kingdom by international comparison over say the five-year period which the prime minister has just so confidently celebrated rather than just three or months <e> <s> it will certainly take as he said fast footwork and flexibility to show that the united kingdom has fared well compared with our european neighbours and competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first speaker tonight or should i say this morning <e> <s> with the formidable task of winding up this remarkable debate i feel like the man commissioned to summarise <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house should be grateful to the noble lord lord barnett for introducing the debate this afternoon on the effects of the governments recent budget <e> <s> since as the noble earl lord gowrie has just mentioned normally your lordships house does not get a chance to debate the budget until the end of the summer when already the thoughts of outside commentators are turning to next years budget rather than the effect of this years i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord barnett for giving us the chance to discuss this subject even before the house rises for the easter recess <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of these benches i too should like to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for repeating the statement made in another place <e> <s> we on these benches welcome the agreement of the draft community budget for and the satisfactory outcome for the united kingdom itself in the form of the billion ecu abatement in our contribution <e> <s> i also welcome the opportunity to respond to the noble earl on an occasion when i think his wrath will be directed more in the direction of other benches than in the direction of myself <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house has i think shown its gratitude to the noble earl lord shannon for initiating this debate through the interesting contributions made by all the noble lords who have spoken this evening <e> <s> there can rarely have been more meat crammed into a two-and-a-half hour sandwich which is a tribute to the noble earl lord shannon and to the other speakers as well as to the significance of the subject being discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords my relative youth and greater inexperience do not permit me to set this years finance bill in the same historical perspective as the noble lords lord harmar-nicholls and lord houghton <e> <s> i hope your lordships will forgive a speech which looks forward more than backward <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the social democrat and liberal benches i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord lord skelmersdale for repeating the timely statement on the funding of the arts <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said the promptness of the announcement of the grant-in-aid for the arts council is a valuable and welcome development since every arts organisation large or small needs to plan ahead to provide its services to the public as well and as economically as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if at this late stage of the evening i keep my thanks to the noble earl lord stockton brief and my whole speech brief i hope that your lordships will not think that i am in any way less grateful than other noble lords who have spoken at the noble earls initiative in introducing this debate or any less struck by his memorable speech <e> <s> the noble earls speech left one particular impression on me <e> <s> it was of his strong and resolute optimism overwhelming even the concerns and fears which he and many other noble lords on this side of the house share that the governments policies are damaging the prospects for the countrys continuing stability and increased prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the alliance benches i also should like to thank the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth for repeating the statement on the future of british leyland and its key subsidiaries <e> <s> i think that these benches greet the statement with a mixture of relief continuing apprehension and absolute stupefaction <e>", "<cs> my lords in the short time that i have spent in your lordships house i have always enjoyed hearing the noble lord lord bruce of donington and from time to time speaking in the same debate as him sometimes in agreement and sometimes not <e> <s> it is therefore particularly pleasing to be able to speak on the motion proposed by him today for which your lordships house should be grateful <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the skilful wording of the motion by the noble lord which pinpoints with great accuracy one of the central issues of current political debate <e>", "<cs> on behalf of the alliance benches i should like to support the amendments proposed by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon <e> <s> i should begin by declaring an interest in that i am a director of the bank which is an adviser to the british gas corporation <e> <s> the purpose of the payment of interest on any deposit from a user of the gas services is to ensure that the security that he is providing by way of a deposit is merely security and not an additional charge <e> <s> particularly in view of the governments rejection of the earlier amendment limiting the maximum size of the deposit it is all the more important that the rate of interest paid on such a deposit truly reflects the market rate <e> <s> as my noble friend lord diamond said in commenting on that amendment our strong preference on these benches is for parliament to have the greatest possible say in matters of detail such as this <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to accept the suggestion of the noble lord the minister that the financing programme of companies in recent weeks was a demonstration of the fear that the privatisation programme over the next two years would create difficulties in the equity market for other companies <e> <s> the privatisation programme to date has been more limited than the aggregate that is now being talked of by the government to be achieved before the date of the next general election <e> <s> it is that change in degree and scale which has caused the greatest comment among analysts and economists in the city many of whom are in other respects strong supporters of the governments policies <e> <s> it is simply not possible to decry those fears as being ill-founded <e>", "<cs> i said at the beginning of my comments that i and i think my colleagues on these benches have supported some instances of privatisation and would do so again in the future <e> <s> it is quite possible to imagine public corporations being sold in tranches or of a size and with a regularity that does not interfere with the financing requirements of the hundreds and thousands of companies that are already in the private sector <e> <s> what i have been suggesting is that the sale of british gas and the sale of the other public corporations such as the water authorities that is being discussed in the time scale of the next two years is sufficient to cause serious disruption of the equity markets of this country <e> <s> despite that as the time is late and a number of divisions have already been called sadly unsuccessfully i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the alliance benches i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his clear introduction to the building societies bill <e> <s> i seem at the moment to be unable to speak in your lordships house without having to preface my remarks with a declaration of interest but on this occasion i should declare that i am a director <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord cameron of lochbroom has introduced this important and complex bill to your lordships house with great skill and clarity which i am sure your lordships house will appreciate <e> <s> i am certain that the house will in turn follow the same high standards throughout not only the second reading but also the later stages of the bill that stretch out ahead of us <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord lucas for his response though there are still some aspects of the matter which concern me <e> <s> i shall make a few comments on the intervention of the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> in this case there is a danger of trying to kill two birds with one stone and to use the bill to ensure and safeguard the position of employees in the financial services industry <e>", "<cs> in the hope that the sib success-fully enforces the guidelines mentioned by the noble lord lord lucas and despite maintaining some reservations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> i was aware of the problem of forcing firms to become unwilling members of sros <e> <s> we have to face the fact that some firms are potentially unwilling members of the whole self-regulatory and supervisory system that is being set up <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are to avoid the risk of somewhat wasteful duplication of facilities it might be preferable to have firms become unwilling members of the sro rather than unwilling members of the sib imposing a strain on the sibs resources to allow that direct representation <e> <s> nonetheless i fully accept that the government are aware of the problems of conflict inherent in this area and i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i feel that i have a formidable task in trying to justify my amendment after the comments of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate as well as those of the noble lords lord fanshawe and lord hacking <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just refer back to the point that i made in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in that both futures contracts and contracts for differences covering in particular interest rate and currency swaps are instruments that would be predominantly if not wholly transacted by listed institutions it is my understanding of clause as currently drafted that it is only authorised persons and not exempted persons who would thereby be clearly removed from the gaming acts <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate has had a chance to clarify that since i first raised it but i very much hope that at least before the report stage that could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak briefly in support of the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord hacking and the comments of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> the essential point is that which the noble lord lord williams made that a security guaranteed by government or for that matter any entity is in almost all respects as irrelevant to investor protection as say the direct obligation of that entity <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support the noble lord lord williams especially in <e>", "<cs> moved as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> ba <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support amendments nos <e> <s> and of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i think that the original wording of the bill which attempts to limit the ambit of the bill to only the most specialised publications is a matter of drawing a line in one place and the drafting which the noble lord lord williams has suggested is trying to draw a line in another place <e> <s> he has suggested that his drafting may be imperfect but the sense behind the amendment is that the influence of the financial pages of non-specialist publications can be very much greater on individual investors than is the case with specialist publications <e> <s> therefore even if the drafting is imperfect it gives an opportunity for the government to reconsider at this late stage whether this important matter of principle should be amended <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move as an amendment to amendment no <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may respond to the noble lord lord lucas and speak in particular to amendment no put down in the name of my noble ally lord ezra this is an exceptionally difficult problem and i regret that the main treatment of it comes so late <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord the minister will forgive us if possibly we come back to it when the later amendments are reached <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to clarify two or three points <e> <s> first i was not supporting the proposal of the labour front bench that there should be a minimum enshrined in the legislation <e> <s> i was using it as i think the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne was using it as an illustration that there was widespread unease at a maximum level of or thereabouts which is what the chairman of the sib has said that an industry-wide central scheme might provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to chew on this particular bone again but i have been impressed by the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> we spent many hours in committee discussing the problems that the clearing banks have in proffering investment advice <e> <s> the clearing banks and all banks are subject to the banking act a recent act with a further banking bill in the pipeline <e> <s> yet nobody has suggested that the investment management activities of the banks should not be subject to the financial services bill <e> <s> it seems to me that the existence of the lloyds act in no way prevents the investment management activities of lloyds being subject to the financial services bill and this in no way diminishes the power or the strength of the lloyds act <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> lord lucas of chilworth for his co-operation in accepting amendments nos <e> <s> b and a and i commend them to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lucas for his assurances <e> <s> in view of the changes that the government have had to make as the bill has progressed i hope the changes i have attempted to introduce in this area can be considered in the same light <e> <s> therefore i ask leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might add a rather breathless word of thanks to the noble lord lord lucas for introducing this amendment <e> <s> it covers very effectively the objective of the amendment that i moved at the report stage <e> <s> with that i will sit down <e> <s> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords at earlier stages of this bill i have suggested that we would if starting with a clean sheet of paper have preferred to see a system that was just a few degrees more based on statutory regulation than on self-regulation <e> <s> that said we stated at those stages that we would support the bill and the system of regulation that was being proposed within it <e> <s> on that basis despite the reasons that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has advanced it seems to me that to make this small change in the wording of this clause strikes at the heart of the balance that the government are trying to achieve in the bill and on that basis i suggest that your lordships should not support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble ally lord ezra and from these benches i should like to add my support to that of the noble lord lord morton of shuna for this amendment <e> <s> much discussion has taken place at every stage of the bill about the question of immunity <e> <s> it is a difficult question <e> <s> but consistency must be the most desirable element to introduce to the bill at this stage <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord lord williams of elvel a question <e> <s> does he not think that the provisions he would propose to make for the building societies would in fact reduce their ability to provide mortgages to their customers and in so doing reduce their competitiveness against other financial institutions which may be more prone to sell off the mortgages to other institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke both at report and at committee stage on a number of the matters dealt with in these amendments and i should like just to add my words of thanks to the noble lord lord lucas for covering in these amendments all the subjects that i raised then <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble ally lord ezra and the alliance benches i should like to join the noble lord lord williams of elvel in paying tribute to the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth and the noble and learned lord lord cameron of lochbroom and their noble colleagues for their conduct of this bill <e> <s> if i were to mention with particular admiration their stamina i hope your lordships would not think that i was underestimating the many other virtues that they have shown and which this complex and important bill has required <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to your lordships house and in particular to the noble lord lord young for arriving too late to hear the opening of this second reading debate not i should add because of the crush of people outside welcoming the newest member of the house of commons but because i was detained unexpectedly on the practice of banking as opposed to the theory <e> <s> i should like to thank your lordships for agreeing to my speaking out of scheduled order <e> <s> it it does nothing else i hope it will encourage the government front bench to press the prime minister for fairer nomination of alliance working peers to allow the non-working peers to pursue their non-work <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoons debate has been of a quality commensurate with the importance of manufacturing industry <e> <s> i strongly believe that contributions from all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams said a little more time may be needed to agree the ideal drafting to reflect what both the noble lords lord elton and lord williams are trying to achieve and indeed what i and my colleagues would like to see <e> <s> at this stage in the first instance we should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord elton if for no other reason than that i suspect that amendment no <e> <s> a moved by the noble lord lord williams may be tarred with the brush of the industry act thereby gaining rather less support on all sides of the committee than the amendment of the noble lord lord elton <e>", "<cs> i wish to remind the committee that three of the four largest clearing banks in this country have acquired german banks admittedly relatively small ones <e> <s> but i believe that the german authorities and the german banking industry would not regard the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord elton as provocative <e> <s> they would not expect the german authorities to allow a british american or japanese bank to buy the deutschebank or the dresdner bank and they would therefore regard it as reasonable for the united kingdom authorities to take reserve powers to protect the equivalent banking institutions in the united kingdom the major united kingdom clearing banks <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord williams i find it unusual to be in agreement with the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne and even more unusual to be in disagreement with the noble lord lord roll <e> <s> nonetheless while i agree with the noble lord lord elton that banks are special they do not seem to be special enough to warrant the measures that his amendment proposes <e> <s> as i said in the second reading debate on this bill the protection that is given to banks already and the further protection that was either proposed or contemplated leaves me and many other people feeling quite uncomfortable relative to the protection which is given to industrial and other commercial companies <e> <s> for that reason whether or not there is a gap or a hiccup between the measures available for shareholders up to per cent <e> <s> and those above i think it would be totally wrong to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> as this subject is as all members of the committee tonight have agreed so important i feel that the views of these benches should be <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the request to the noble lord to reconsider the matter as he has already promised to do <e> <s> since the act the markets have developed in a way that makes it difficult to suggest that even a dollar paper is not offered within the united kingdom or in areas or time zones around the united kingdom that would make it possible for investors albeit large investors to be able to buy such paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to repeat the support that i gave to the amendment in committee <e> <s> the noble lord lord obrien has already expressed the problem succinctly that is that reciprocity and competition either individually or <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he tell us why if he thinks that banks are no different from other companies we are seeking to produce a new banking act when there is in existence a companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the committee stage it is with regret that i cannot support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> like the noble lord lord elton i should like to emphasise that the desperate poverty and deprivation prevailing in many countries of the third world to which british banks are lenders give rise to legitimate and acute concern about the effects of the burden of foreign debt on the economies of those countries <e> <s> but if this amendment is well intentioned it is fear also contradictory and potentially counterproductive <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should have enjoyed being a student of the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> the opportunity to debate even the truncated finance bill which the government have now proposed is most welcome because the economic policies of the government which this bill symbolises are the single most important factor in the election campaign now under way <e> <s> in this area your lordships house does not have the same detailed revision role as it has in respect of other legislation <e> <s> therefore the removal of the more complex clauses from the bill may strike a less discordant note with your lordships than with our colleagues in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord thorneycroft has done great service to the house and to the country on many occasions but not least today in introducing such an important subject for debate and making such an enjoyable contribution to the discussion <e> <s> over and above that to have introduced a subject that stimulated remarkable maiden speeches from three distinguished members of your lordships house should earn him another place in the record book of parliamentary achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord young of graffham for arranging for time even on a friday to be devoted to the discussion of the dtis white paper for which he was responsible and for the usual courteous explanation of it by the secretary of state <e> <s> i look forward very much also to the contributions of the three maiden speakers with their different but distinguished contributions to the business and industrial world <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the secretary of state for the statement and his subsequent amplification of it <e> <s> in principle i and my colleagues in the sdp repeat our earlier welcome to the proposed acquisition of the rover group by british aerospace <e>", "<cs> given to the chrysler corporation took warrants in shares of the company that ensured that in the event of the companys ultimate success the government stood to gain some benefit from that success <e> <s> does the noble lord not think that a similar arrangement which is also used in the united states when the federal authorities <e>", "<cs> could this not have presented an opportunity to give a similar interest to the employees of rover and a consequential incentive after a number of difficult and hard years to maintain a productive and tranquil atmosphere of industrial relations <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships house is grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his remarks in introducing the second reading of the finance bill <e> <s> i must apologise to the noble and learned lord and to your lordships for arriving too late to hear this introduction which i shall read with great care <e> <s> however i understand that he has perhaps not been quite as extravagant in his praise for the bill the budget and the chancellor as has the prime minister <e> <s> the prime minister has resorted to hyperbole in her tributes to the chancellor and his budget recently though for much of the past year her actions and words have sometimes suggested that she has come to bury him and not to praise him <e> <s> if peace has temporarily broken out between the warring tribes of conservative economists the rest of us must try to form our own views as to the real achievements and effects of this budget in the latest stage of the governments economic strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the indulgence of the house and apologies for failing to put down my name in time for inclusion on the list i should like to intervene briefly on this important question tabled by the noble baroness lady turner of camden <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord

community company law directives and tidy even <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not understand what concerns noble lords on this side of the committee <e> <s> he suggests that consultations with
