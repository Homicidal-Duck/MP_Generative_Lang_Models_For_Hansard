["<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that in the effort to ensure as far as possible that there is no discrimination in northern ireland we have sprouted almost more quangos than in any other part of the united kingdom what with the fair employment agency and the equal opportunities board as well as the commissioner for complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> the point i was trying to make was that i think it is her majestys governments duty and i think it would be in all our interests to put the onus on the northern ireland political parties to be constructive rather than destructive so that they will think how best can we make this work <e> <s> rather than to say that wont work <e> <s> that wont work <e> <s> that wont work because of so-and-so <e> <s> that is the point i was trying to make <e> <s> at the end of the day i would say that probably her majestys government will have to come out with their own proposals <e> <s> but i would hope that this will be before too long <e> <s> that was the burden of my speech that i wanted to see something happen soon <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of what the noble lord has just said i shall keep my remarks extremely brief <e> <s> however i would like to join in thanking the noble lord lord kings norton for having initiated what has turned out to be a not only very interesting but a very entertaining debate <e> <s> unlike some noble lords i think that there are two categories of people who can be excused for abusing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that the main reasons why the housing executive is not held in higher esteem by the public is its failure to have built more houses in areas where they are desperately needed the fact that it has not brought up to modern standards a greater proportion of old housing stock and the delays which occur in carrying out essential repairs <e> <s> will he further accept my assurance that i have always found the local officials of the housing executive to be extremely helpful and prompt in answering inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord glenarthur for having given us the opportunity of this debate this afternoon <e> <s> i have four brief points which i should like to mention <e> <s> some of them have been referred to already <e> <s> first we welcome and when i say we i speak as a member of the tavr association the improvement in the bounty to ta members but inflation being what it is i think it ought to be reviewed periodically perhaps once a year to keep pace with inflation <e> <s> there are still a significant number of people who lose money when they go off to camp for a fortnight every year <e> <s> secondly i understand that her majestys government are looking into the matter of compensation for part-time soldiers to bring them into line with regular soldiers <e> <s> i welcome that and i hope that they will be able to expedite implementation of it because part-time soldiers are just as vulnerable to accidents as are regular soldiers and their families suffer every bit as much in the unfortunate event of their being permanently injured or killed as do the families of regular soldiers <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that i made a grievous error in allowing the noble duke the duke of abercorn to see the notes that i had written for my speech because he has just made my speech for me <e> <s> however i shall edit what i have noted down <e> <s> i too salute the government and the previous administration as well for the strenuous efforts they have made to attract industrial investment into northern ireland <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the industries they have attracted when they get into full production will prove to be successful and that the efforts will prove to he fruitful <e> <s> at the same time i think one has to bear in mind that these jobs though desperately needed are bought at a very high price and i hope it will transpire that the very large sums of public money which have been invested will turn out to have been justified <e> <s> one has to hear in mind that when the economic climate becomes unfavourable the multi-national firm which has a subsidiary overseas is likely to axe that subsidiary before it closes down its main production plant at home and this is where there is a certain area of vulnerability <e> <s> none the less i wish these projects every success <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down might i ask him if he could tell me whether it is true or untrue to say that if our law was in conformity with the law in the majority of eec countries <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak only briefly first because the hour is late and secondly because i am virtually uninfected by any knowledge about this problem <e> <s> but if your lordships permit i should like to broaden the discussion a little because i think that many of the points the noble duke has made are relevant not only to other parts of northern ireland but to other parts of the united kingdom as well <e> <s> i take many of the points that the noble duke has made but having consulted my medical friends i think that he would probably agree with me that it seems that we are moving further into the position whereby there will have to be two sorts of hospital first the ordinary hospital where you go if you have a broken wrist or an ingrowing toenail or something like that and secondly the major hospital which has to be equipped with highly sophisticated and extremely expensive equipment <e> <s> it also has to have a team of technicians who are able to operate that equipment <e> <s> the results of the treatment that has been developed in recent years by that equipment is such that it is obviously necessary but it cannot be put into every hospital <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord allow me to intervene for a moment <e> <s> would he not agree that whereas we all want to see reconciliation in ireland there is this fanatical group of terrorists who are now very much marxist-orientated who shot a man dead on his tractor the other day <e> <s> how does the noble lord think that entering into consultations and i hope he was not suggesting that her majestys government should enter into consultations with the provisional ira or the irish national liberation army or the uvf would stop these people coming over the border and shooting a man on his tractor and blowing up soldiers near warren point <e> <s> is he seriously suggesting that <e>", "<cs> i would be very glad in that case if the noble lord would kindly go and sort them out <e>", "<cs> my lords it only remains for me to thank all those noble lords who have participated in this debate <e> <s> as i said i was trying to be constructive to float ideas and to expose them to the collective expertise of this house and indeed they have been very carefully considered by your lordships particularly the noble and gallant lord lord carver who gave us a most interesting speech <e> <s> i have got a lot out of this debate but one of the main things is a vague feeling that there is not a great deal of acceptance for the suggestion that was put to me that the border ought to be mined <e> <s> i will take that home with me <e> <s> my lords i beg leave to withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his reply do i take it that he indicates that her majestys government do not intend to honour the undertaking given by the previous administration which stated that it was their firm intention to abolish hare coursing in northern ireland <e> <s> will the noble lord also be good enough to report on the progress made by the working group set up in to make recommendations on wildlife protection whose report was originally hoped to have been ready by easter <e> <s> furthermore is the noble lord aware of the revolt and disgust felt by many of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the population of hares in northern ireland has declined drastically <e> <s> if he thinks that legislation is not the way to deal with this can he possibly make another suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i owe an apology to the house in advance because i am sure that your lordships must by now be tired of hearing me talking about northern ireland problems and the security situation there <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord clifford will forgive me if perhaps i put a slightly different slant on this situation <e> <s> the noble viscount lord bridgeman made reference to avr iii <e> <s> i had the unpleasant task of having to preside over the disbandment of an avr iii unit <e> <s> prior to that ironically i trained the members in what action to take in the event of nuclear attack <e> <s> also even more ironically in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask whether his attention has been drawn to a recent report on the northern ireland gas industry undertaken by coopers and lybrand an independent firm of consultants who i am told are of international repute whose calculations reveal that the cost of a pipeline would be in the region of million whereas the cost of running down the gas industry in northern ireland could be anything up to million including the loss of jobs <e> <s> does the noble lord not therefore feel in the light of that report that there is an argument for reconsidering this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord kindly confirm or deny the accuracy of the information which i have received which is that when even <e>", "<cs> finally my lords the noble lord has kindly said that this report will be studied can i take it that reconsideration will be given to the decision <e> <s> i would not ask for reversal but may i take it that reconsideration will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords in making reference to district councils could i ask the noble lord whether her majestys government are fully aware of the different levels at which the recreation officers of district councils work as opposed to the sports council itself <e> <s> are her majestys government aware of the tremendous amount of expertise which has been built up by the sports council over the last six years and the fact that that expertise is not perhaps available at a lower level <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble earl for his reply may i ask whether he is aware that the rspca have produced a report or statement in which they describe the ritual slaughtering of animals as being horrific and according to veterinary evidence have shown that the animal can remain conscious after slaughter for an average of seconds <e> <s> is he of the opinion that this suffering is unnecessary in view of the fact that according to a statement made in a press report by dr abul siddiqui the president of the ulster islamic centre <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank her majestys government for having produced this white paper <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord on the government front bench for having made it clear that her majestys government are under no illusions that this is a solution but rather a further step in the long process of hopefully trying to distil a solution <e> <s> this is the realistic way of looking at it <e> <s> in reading the white paper i refrained from flattering myself that perhaps the secretary of state had picked up a few ideas from the submission that i sent in <e> <s> rather in the words of the management consultant i identified areas of parallel thinking <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that kind offer <e> <s> one example i had in mind was the case of the ritual slaughter of cattle which i mentioned yesterday <e> <s> by the time i received a reply from the noble lords right honourable friend the slaughter had been going on for something like three weeks and my constituents were on my hack about it <e> <s> another example is the sewage scheme in portaferry but i will not bore your lordships with that fascinating topic at the moment <e> <s> what i will do with your lordships permission when i get home is to look up the file and let the noble lord know of any particular cases <e>", "<cs> my lords following what the noble viscount lord brookeborough has said i should like to add my thanks to the noble lord on the front bench for having given us in advance an explanatory memorandum on this order <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble viscount lord brookeborough has said about agriculture <e> <s> it occurs to me to wonder why in fact in class vote there is an increase of over million for expenditure by the department on administration in view of the fact that the service to farmers seems to be in the process of being curtailed and i thought that was with a view to staff reductions but it may be an inflation factor <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i was given those figures by my political research unit who perhaps were in error <e> <s> i accept it if the noble lord has authentic figures which i do not have <e>", "<cs> i will check that anyway my lords <e> <s> if i may say a brief word on education a proposal has been made in the chilver report that the teacher training colleges should be amalgamated <e> <s> this i think would be a useful economy as well as a valuable step towards social fusion in northern ireland as indeed i think integration of schools a subject about which i have spoken before in your lordships house would not only be socially valuable but would also save money <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord permit me to interrupt just for a moment when he is dealing with that subject <e> <s> in the event of worthwhile quantities of gas being found off rathlin island would it alter the noble lords attitude towards that <e> <s> or even if there were a likelihood of gas flowing in the other direction would it alter his view towards having a link between northern ireland and scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his quite encouraging reply i should like to ask him whether he would not agree that if he has not yet received what he considers to be sufficient positive reaction from elected representatives the probable reason is that those representatives are apprehensive that their constituents might interpret such reaction as indicating their approval of cohabitation of couples outside of marriage <e> <s> would he further agree that the social workers who do not have constituents but who are dealing with these problems every day in making such a recommendation are in no way trying to condemn condone or judge but rather are trying to avoid violence as indeed our lord succeeded in doing when he neither condemned nor expressed approval of the woman taken in adultery <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble duke for having introduced this not only important but extremely urgent topic in this house this evening <e> <s> i think that one of those things to which he referred is particularly pertinent and that is the state of unemployment which is an index of the economy <e> <s> the overall figure in northern ireland of per cent <e> <s> is appalling but when on considers some of the worst areas the worst one of all is the town of strabane where total unemployment is per cent <e> <s> and unemployment of all male workers is per cent <e> <s> this is not just appalling it is disgraceful disgusting shocking and shattering words are inadequate to describe it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention which i fully expected and for which i have prepared <e> <s> i am about to go on to do that <e> <s> if the noble lord will bear with me i shall if i may pursue the sequence of my notes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for saying that my lords but may i ask him as he seems <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has missed the point my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl on the government front bench for his exposition and for his explanatory memorandum <e> <s> like the noble lord lord donaldson i too should like to range a little wider than the actual provisions of this draft appropriation order <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be impertinent to ask if the noble earl had never drunk before that given that the crown was only restored a couple of weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl forgive me for intervening once again <e> <s> i do apologise <e> <s> will her majestys government kindly bear in mind the education northern ireland act which provides for integrated schools so that where schools are faced with possible closure there is the opportunity to integrate both controlled and maintained schools thus rationalising them <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord ohagan for having given us an opportunity to debate this subject which i believe is one of fundamental importance <e> <s> many of the points to which i had intended to refer have been covered by other noble lords with much more skill and authority than i would have been able to command <e> <s> therefore and bearing in mind that we are approaching the end of a short debate i should like to refer merely to two points the first of which is perhaps rather peculiar to ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear the point that the noble lord has just made <e> <s> the noble lord lord blease and i served on a voluntary body called the ulster enterprise voluntary committee for a number of years for this very purpose of monitoring designs and inventions <e> <s> our main difficulty was that we did not have the technical expertise to be able to evaluate the various proposals that were put forward <e> <s> we tried as best we could to refer them to those who might know but since then the local enterprise development unit has taken over and perhaps the noble earl might want to make reference to that in his winding-up speech but i would agree that any original thought from any source should be exploited <e>", "<cs> my lords i did write to the noble lord lord elton i think it was suggesting some questions <e> <s> i am no demographer <e> <s> nor am i an expert on public opinion surveys <e> <s> this is a very specialised field because one has to ask questions to which there must be a clear-cut answer yes or no <e> <s> we already have a referendum coming up next year similar to the one held years ago asking the electorate whether they want to remain in the united kingdom or whether they would prefer to leave the united kingdom and become part of a united ireland <e> <s> those are the first two fundamental questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i must start by making an apology <e> <s> i am already late for another engagement <e> <s> i did not realise that the business of your lordships house today would extend to this length <e> <s> unfortunately therefore i shall be unable with permission to stay for the winding-up speeches <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add to the tributes paid to the noble earl on the front bench for his presentation of this order <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble duke for giving way to me because i rather wanted to follow the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord hampton because they dealt with the subject with which i want to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to refer to class xi in the order which concerns the northern ireland assembly <e> <s> i would mention in passing that i am the only member of your lordships house who is in a position to give a first-hand report on the inside working of that body <e> <s> whether that is an enviable position to be in is perhaps questionable <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me for intervening i quite agree that this may never happen <e> <s> what we are concerned about is the effect which this has on public opinion and the hardening of attitudes among the unionists which has caused this particular standing order of the assembly to go through <e> <s> the leader of my party has taken steps to put it to the courts <e> <s> i was attempting to say that if the constitution act were altered this would remove the excuse for that standing order <e>", "<cs> my lords in joining with other noble lords in agreeing that the order should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i too would like to thank the noble earl for having kindly given us notice of this debate and having solicited points which we might want to raise <e> <s> i gave him notice of a number of points but he will be relieved to know that i shall not by any means touch on all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will forgive me and he is now moving on to his final point could he give us before he sits down the reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl once again for having followed the precedent of the noble earl lord gowrie in writing to us in advance seeking our views as to points we might raise during this debate <e> <s> i should also like to take the opportunity to welcome him to his new post in the northern ireland office <e> <s> i do not think that i have met him since we overlapped at the same house at school when he was in the library as the viscount stormont and i was a lower boy <e> <s> i cannot recall whether i actually fagged for him but if i did he cannot have been a hard taskmaster otherwise undoubtedly the experience would have marked itself indelibly on my mind <e> <s> it was a great pleasure therefore to see him again when he came to address the agriculture committee of the northern ireland assembly appropriately enough at stormont a couple of weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for his very full reply but can he just say whether her majestys government will give an assurance that they will confirm their contribution towards the cost of the less favoured areas so that the european agricultural commissioner as he said will be able to continue and confirm the extension of the less favoured areas <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support the noble lord lord graham i must declare an interest because i am a dairy farmer <e> <s> i should also say that i rise in a mood of some surprise and indeed bewilderment because as has been pointed out for something like two years her majestys government succeeded in resisting imports of uht milk it has been called <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his kind guidance <e> <s> i was merely drawing attention to the fact that these antibiotics are available to be purchased anywhere <e> <s> there is a warning on the syringe that milk from any cow which has been so treated must be withdrawn for hours but there is no way of policing that <e> <s> that was my point <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the rate of unemployment in northern ireland is <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for having presented this draft appropriation order and like the noble lord lord hampton apologise for the fact that i was unable to reply to the letter inviting points that i might raise in the debate this evening <e> <s> i too only received the letter on saturday <e> <s> i was delighted to hear what the noble lord had to say about the improved health of the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> we in the agriculture committee of the northern ireland assembly sent him a message of good wishes <e> <s> now on behalf of that committee and on behalf of the northern ireland assembly i should like to say how delighted we are to hear that he is improving and we hope it will not be long before we see him back in his place <e> <s> i can give him an assurance that the next time that he is addressing the agriculture committee he will receive an even easier ride than he normally does <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear that i am not among the northern ireland protestants who dismiss the new ireland forum report out of hand or condemn it completely <e> <s> i indeed welcome the report because i regard it as being a genuine attempt on the part of nationalists to take a serious look at the problems of ireland as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his intervention <e> <s> i quite agree and that has been done on borrowed money to a large extent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl seems to disagree with me but i think if he were to check the figures he would find that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to reply to any questions put to me by the noble earl but perhaps i ought to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords really he is alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for having been courteous enough to write to me in advance giving notice of this debate and seeking my views as to the points i might raise <e> <s> i also owe him an apology because i omitted to welcome him to his comparatively new post on the front bench <e> <s> we have of course met on a couple of occasions across the table at <e>", "<cs> my lords class i of the appropriation order covers the thorny subject of agriculture which is perhaps causing more concern in the province than anything else at the moment <e> <s> much has been said about it <e> <s> but i am afraid that we on the northern ireland assembly agriculture committee continue to adhere to the view that we have been sold short so far as the milk quota is concerned <e> <s> this view is reinforced by the milk marketing board whose full-time job it is to monitor and evaluate these matters <e> <s> this opinion is reinforced by a telegram dated th june from the european commissioner mr poul dalsager and addressed to the chairman of the committee the rev <e> <s> dr ian r k paisley whom god preserve <e> <s> in the telegram mr dalsager says <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the first report of the select committee with great interest and would respectfully congratulate them on what they have produced <e> <s> noble lords have touched on various aspects of the report but with permission i should like to take up what i consider one of the most pertinent points that has been made this afternoon <e> <s> that is not so much the inconvenience disruption discomfort that may be involved in televising your lordships house but rather the point of it <e> <s> what good is it going to do <e> <s> what is going to be gained <e> <s> that if i may say so is the point i should like to take up because it is the pertinent question <e>", "<cs> my lords my sole contribution to this debate is to say that i have yet to hear or to read a convincing argument as to why identity cards with <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend should not look at me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for having kindly invited advance notice of any points that we might raise in this debate <e> <s> i gave him notice that i wanted to touch once again i am afraid on the vexed question of milk quotas <e> <s> i have with me a mass of figures but i shall not weary your lordships with them because this is an appropriation order debate and not a debate on agriculture exclusively <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord on the front bench will have a very much fuller brief than i have <e>", "<cs> my lords they will wonder what is the purpose of this debate and what we are doing here at all <e> <s> therefore having given notice that i would ask <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl does not intend to reply may i join in thanking the noble lord lord houghton for providing an opportunity to discuss this far-reaching topic and say once again what a privilege it is to be able to follow the noble earl lord longford <e> <s> indeed from my point of view it is a certain relief although i am not without some apprehension as there is always the chance that he might intervene to hurl at me verbal abuse in the way he has done before now <e> <s> the noble earl is difficult to follow even so with his erudition and wit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in thanking the noble lord for having presented what is on the whole a penetrating and far sighted order <e> <s> it was well received generally in northern ireland <e> <s> in the assembly we were gratified to find that there was not the chasm that might have been expected <e> <s> there have inevitably been conflicting interests between the harvester and the hedgerow and between the drainage and the duck <e> <s> in the event both agricultural and conservationist interests with certain reservations welcome the order <e> <s> her majestys government are to be congratulated thereon for that reason <e>", "<cs> my lords this order deserves a broad welcome because like the nature conservation and amenity lands order which we debated last monday this is something of an enhancement to the wildlife and countryside act effective in great britain <e> <s> whereas i quite agree with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby that there has been impatience and that we have been waiting this long perhaps the intervening years have not been entirely a disadvantage because certain lessons have been learnt over that period of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend article of the road races northern ireland order <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have been kind enough to respond to my proposal for a second reading of this bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies clearly appreciated the motivation behind the bill <e> <s> one point on which he touched is tremendously important <e> <s> it is that motor sport is a unifying element in irish society north and south <e> <s> there is no differentiation between association football and gaelic football <e> <s> for as long as motor sport has been going its enthusiasts have joined together in a spirit of co-operation friendship and comradeship <e> <s> we look at this as an extension of that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for taking up the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord for his introduction and for his usual courtesy in inviting us to bring to his attention in advance any points that we might wish to raise <e> <s> on class i the noble lord was right <e> <s> i am going to mention the milk quota again i am afraid <e> <s> it has been said before but in a nutshell the situation is that last year when the quotas were introduced for the first time the peculiar dependence of ireland both north and south upon grass-based agriculture of which milk is the major sector was recognised <e> <s> therefore the republic of ireland was given an additional quota over and above what its previous production had been <e> <s> northern ireland was promised favourable treatment as well and was allocated an extra tonnes of quota by the ec <e> <s> in the event her majestys government instead of giving this tonnes to northern ireland where it was supposed to go decided <e>", "<cs> my lords though the noble viscount is not in his place at the moment i should like to thank him for the way in which he initiated the debate and for his kind reference to the warmth of the northern ireland people <e> <s> i can reciprocate by recalling our warm feelings towards him as a congenial and convivial leader as our first secretary of state <e> <s> i must also thank the noble lords lord donaldson lord blease lord fitt and lord moyola for having kindly delivered parts of my speech for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i hope sincerely that what he infers is right and that after the debate there may be a change of mind <e> <s> but what i am saying is that so far there has been no sign of it <e> <s> mr john hume has specifically said that the agreement does not amount to enough to persuade him to bring his members into the assembly at stormont <e> <s> i hope sincerely that the noble lord is correct and that what i have been saying is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to replace article of the public order northern ireland order <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill he now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> in effect this is really a tidying up amendment to bring the law as it applies to northern ireland into line with that which obtains in great britain <e> <s> but for all that it has some significant implications <e> <s> perhaps it would be helpful if i were to give your lordships some background to this <e> <s> i hope that i may be forgiven if i read portions of my speech on this because for the sake of the official record and the fact that there are various titles dates and quotations involved i would wish to be accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords who have so kindly contributed to this short debate for their very helpful and constructive comments <e> <s> the noble lord lord hampton referred to the problem of graffiti <e> <s> i understand only too well the difficulty that this presents because unfortunately as i said in my opening remarks they are normally the work of anonymous contributors <e> <s> they do not sign their literary efforts which they write on walls any more than did the person who wrote ulster says no and accompanied it by a very attractive union jack <e> <s> therefore it is very difficult to see how the provisions of the bill which i am proposing could be brought to bear on that <e> <s> however as i also tried to bring out graffiti are not all that much of a worry except under certain circumstances <e> <s> there are many more things to be worried about as the noble lord lord fitt said during his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord on the government front bench for his letter once again kindly inviting us to give him notice of any points that we might want to raise <e> <s> i regret that since i replied to the noble lord some water has flowed under the bridge and the points that i shall raise may not be entirely consistent with what i had anticipated when i wrote to him <e>", "<cs> it is my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of a most useful meeting i had just yesterday morning in <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in the knowledge that no part of this bill is applicable to northern ireland <e> <s> however i make so bold as to speak in the hope that the provisions of what in many ways is an excellent piece of legislation will be applied to the law of northern ireland in the not too distant future <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in your lordships house this evening to apologise to say that i am sorry that the northern ireland assembly has not worked <e> <s> the noble lords right honourable friend in another place mr james prior has been accorded some acclaim and some disapproval for having introduced the northern ireland assembly in <e> <s> i feel perhaps i should confess that it was on st november that i ventured to suggest to your lordships house that there should be an assembly of that sort set up <e> <s> indeed i was reading the speech which i made on that occasion again this morning and it was interesting to see how very close the provisions of the assembly came to what was suggested in that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his usual courtesy in having written to us in advance of this debate <e> <s> we are grateful to him as always for having sought points that we may wish to raise on this occasion <e> <s> looking at a number of the matters in the draft order to start with the department of agriculture class votes and there are many complex and indeed some worrying facets to the new ec price packages with regard to farm produce <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord lord ennals to whom we are grateful for having initiated this debate will not consider me unduly opportunist in making use of the occasion to draw to the attention of her majestys government what is an apparent and notable gap in the coverage of the national health service and one that is peculiar to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord lyell for kindly having invited some of us to meet him earlier this week to discuss the provisions of the bill <e> <s> i regret that unfortunately i could not be present but i am grateful for the comprehensive brief which his department was good enough to supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention and i am very interested to hear what he says <e> <s> in fact when i was elected representative i never received complaints from the family of a prisoner because his trial came forward too soon <e> <s> it was always the other way round my father/brother/son has now been languishing in custody for months and there is still no word of his trial coming up <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hold the garda responsible for the detonation <e> <s> i said that it was very difficult to envisage how the car could have been left there unattended with a bomb inside it if both police forces had been fully co-operating with each other <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the noble lord the minister for having introduced the order once again with his usual courtesy <e> <s> it is of course inevitable that the order has to be accepted <e> <s> i am afraid that the necessity for that is a reflection of the failure of those of us in northern ireland who have tried to take some part in the political process to find a more suitable way of governing the province <e> <s> but i think that now there is probably more hope than there was this time last year because the report of the unionist task force <e>", "<cs> my lords i was sorry to hear that the morale of the noble lord lord moyola is so low <e> <s> i should like to be able to say something to cheer him up <e> <s> i wish he had heard the comments of some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> does he accept that would cover the complete rewiring of the building which is the alleged safety hazard <e> <s> will he accept that the arts centre is prepared to raise that amount voluntarily if given permission <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister once again for having presented the draft order in his usual clear and courteous way i should like to refer to energy efficiency which is mentioned in the only vote before your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> what i beg to say is peripheral to the more central points that the noble lords lord prys-davies and lord mcnair have raised but perhaps there are certain general implications which would make them worth touching on <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord very kindly state whether or not it is yet obligatory for the original gravity of beer to be stated at point of sale <e> <s> does he not agree that the public is in greater danger of being deceived by weak measure than by short measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not consider me to be unduly opportunist if i utilise the occasion to make a few general remarks about rail transport as opposed to road transport <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for having asked the unstarred question this evening <e> <s> i think it raises important points <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble duke for having introduced this interesting and important <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord moyola referred to farm effluent and its pollutant effect on water courses <e> <s> the noble lord lord blease referred to slurry digestion <e> <s> it so happens that the last time we were discussing an appropriation order in <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord fitt i remember the debate in your lordships house after the signing of the anglo-irish agreement <e> <s> i remember on that occasion welcoming the aspirations and objects of the agreement but like the noble lord lord fitt i felt that it was very doubtful that it would work <e> <s> whether it was tactless or not i said so on that occasion in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i was more than happy to give way to the noble lord lord hunt and to <e>", "<cs> my lords i spent a considerable amount of time composing a speech which i now find to be almost entirely inappropriate to the debate <e> <s> however my confidence is marginally restored by the observation that the noble lord lord lyell has taken his place <e> <s> perhaps i may be permitted to confine myself to a few remarks on a local level <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will listen to them with his usual sympathy even if the noble baroness lady trumpington finds that they are not entirely relevant to her reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for having raised this topical matter <e> <s> before i express my views on it i should perhaps make my position clear <e> <s> i am a member of the anglican church of ireland of a variety that feels that there is something wrong if one does not go to church on sunday <e> <s> it is rather like going to bed without brushing ones teeth <e> <s> it feels uncomfortable <e> <s> to avoid such discomfort i have attended roman catholic masses when in france or italy and i have not yet been disciplined by my church for that misdemeanour the noble and learned lord is not on the woolsack <e> <s> i have subjected myself to services of the russian and greek orthodox churches of which of course i did not understand a word <e> <s> they were great theatre <e> <s> in the case of the russian orthodox church i should say that it was marvellous opera with its <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for the way in which he has put the bill to us <e> <s> i am sure that he will have assimilated the mood of the house from the comprehensive speeches that noble lords have made following his introduction <e> <s> so comprehensive have they been that there remains little to be said <e> <s> however looking at the bill in order of its clauses perhaps i may touch on one or two points briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i have often wondered why organ enthusiasts such as the noble lord lord somers are also railway enthusiasts and are very likely to have an above-average understanding of architecture to be discriminating about vintage wine and real beer and probably be experts on the beautifully scripted titles of victorian lavatories <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord includes those in his field of interest but obviously this is an indication of civilisation <e> <s> perhaps when he replies to the debate with his final speech he will enlighten me as to why this should be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords this sensible rationalisation is to be welcomed but i would respectfully ask the minister how much attention will be paid to those public spirited well informed civilised people who are to sit on the new council <e> <s> is the noble lord aware of the frustration experienced by members of councils such as the historic buildings council <e> <s> they make recommendations and the department goes ahead and does exactly what it was going to do anyway <e> <s> how much clout will the new council have <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be grateful to the minister for having presented this order to us and also to the noble duke for his very informative speech <e> <s> i think that this is a most exciting opportunity for belfast perhaps the most exciting during the last century <e>", "<cs> i have added my name to this amendment though i confess that i was in two minds about it <e> <s> i believe that elected representatives should think before they speak and they should be held responsible for what they say <e> <s> at the same time having given it careful consideration i believe that this is a proper amendment because errors can be made <e> <s> i do not know whether any member of the committee apart from myself has actually sat in the northern ireland assembly <e> <s> if privileged so to do members of the committee will have witnessed the way in which our fundamentalist friends have been carried away by their own oratory <e> <s> it is possible for a slip of the tongue to be made <e>", "<cs> as usual we are greatly appreciative of the noble lord lord monson for his thoughtfulness in having tabled the amendment <e> <s> indeed i understand the reason behind it and i can understand his thinking <e> <s> however my concern is that the more we define the more the problems will be compounded for the courts <e> <s> that is an issue upon which i should be interested to hear the qualified opinion of noble and learned lords who sit on the judicial benches because i am no lawyer <e> <s> however should be afraid that the more precise the definition the more difficult the job of the courts would be <e> <s> what we are aiming for is something which is not in dispute at all it is just a question of how to make it work as effectively as possible <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that this brings us to the crunch amendment <e> <s> the arguments were well <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble lords pardon but surely the attorney-general takes many actions without having been present in person to witness the offence taking place <e>", "<cs> my lordsi hope that i may be forgiven a brief intervention <e> <s> i fully realise that the point i make should have been made during second reading committee or report stages but unfortunately i was briefed on it only at the end of last week <e> <s> the matter i should like to put to the noble earl is that perhaps it is unreasonable for a bank official to be held responsible for making a decision about whether a transaction is likely to be connected with terrorist activities <e> <s> one can imagine the busy situation in a banking hall with queues of customers coming in to make transactions withdrawals and lodgements <e> <s> is it fair to ask a bank official to have to carry that decision on his own shoulders <e> <s> i apologise for intervening in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords once again we are grateful to the minister for having presented the draft appropriation order in the way that he has <e> <s> it seems to have surfaced rather more quickly than usual on this occasion <e> <s> i therefore regret that i was unable to give him advance notice of any of the points that i wished to raise <e> <s> however i have no qualms about raising them because i am sure that they will occasion him no difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i was interested in the ministers comments and wondered whether there was a chink of light regarding the possibility of relaxing vat on alternative enterprises particularly horse breeding <e> <s> horses could be regarded as farm animals in the same way as cattle or sheep thereby relieving the accommodation of taxation <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i received just hours notice that the second reading had been advanced from friday to wednesday <e> <s> most unfortunately from my point of view i was unable to attend that debate <e> <s> similarly the marshalled list of amendments was not available when i telephoned last week <e> <s> i obtained it only when i called in this morning <e>", "<cs> i entirely concur with what has been said <e> <s> it is of cardinal importance that this position should not only be completely independent of the department and of the government but should be seen to be independent <e> <s> having complete confidence in the competence and impartiality of the noble and learned lord who sits on the woolsack and secure in the knowledge that he bears no allegiance to the free presbyterian church in ireland whose permanent moderator is a friend of mine and sits in two other places i entirely support and accept that it should be up to the lord chancellor to make this appointment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord monson has raised some pertinent points <e> <s> the noble lord lord blease very nearly said what i was going to say <e> <s> if one has lived and been brought up in northern ireland one must be conscious that one very often looks at matters from a northern ireland perspective <e> <s> i have tried to stand back and look at this matter from the perspective of england scotland and wales <e> <s> i tried to transpose the situation into that context <e> <s> the nearest i can come to it is to suggest the following situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will forgive me if i intervene for a moment <e> <s> is he aware that the presbyterian church has taken legal advice about the matter and has been told that the wording of the new legislation if taken literally by a court could lead the churches into considerable difficulty <e> <s> i am not sure whether that point has been drawn to his notice <e>", "<cs> further to what the noble lord lord mottistone has said have her majestys government taken into account the number of small companies i venture to suggest such as my own employing some people where labour turnover is extremely low <e> <s> the noble lord would probably recognise from his experience in the department of agriculture in northern ireland that in small companies of this kind where there is a really good relationship between management and labour the turnover of labour is small <e> <s> therefore opportunities to meet goals and timetables are very limited <e> <s> many <e>", "<cs> i am on rather difficult ground here because quite frankly i do not know what i am talking about <e> <s> nonetheless i was much relieved to hear two things from the noble lord lord prys-davies first that he too acknowledged that this was a complicated matter and secondly that he had had contact with the equal opportunities commission <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble earl for introducing this topic <e> <s> it is gaining greater currency as time passes and it is appropriate that he should have raised it tonight <e> <s> he has fully covered the subject of hospices and i hesitate to repeat his comments <e> <s> the main point arising from his comments and from the research that has been carried out is that our hospitals are already overstretched as a result of attempting to deal with all the patients who have a reasonable chance of recovery <e> <s> hospital beds are at a premium and ideally they should not be occupied by those who are terminally ill hospital beds are for one purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for the way in which he has introduced this draft appropriation order <e> <s> of the only two votes that we are considering this afternoon i have one point to make on the first it being <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord referring to the calendar year or the financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has rightly said that this is a very comprehensive order <e> <s> i knew that the noble lord lord hylton was going to speak on the subject of integrated education <e> <s> however i had not been expecting other noble lords and the noble baroness to cover it <e> <s> therefore much of what i would have said has already been stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord mountevans for having <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to thank the minister for the way in which he has introduced the appropriation order <e> <s> i thank him also for his kind letter inviting prior notice of any points which noble lords might wish to raise in the debate <e> <s> regrettably however the letter did not reach me until saturday morning and there was no opportunity for me to reply <e> <s> as i pointed out to the predecessor of the noble lord on the front bench the noble lord lord lyell degrading though it may seem i do not live in the palace of westminster <e> <s> the delay was incurred through the letter having to be forwarded to my home address for which i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the minister will forgive me for interrupting but is it not true to say that a right honourable member in another place has a letter from mr colin wallace <e> <s> has that letter been authenticated either through fingerprints or other forensic means <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble viscount lord brookeborough <e> <s> while agreeing with much of what he said i should add thank goodness for a free press and for independent broadcasting media <e> <s> that is one of our strongest guarantees against abuses at all levels <e> <s> had there been a free press and independent broadcasting in eastern europe the abuses which survived there for such an astonishing length of time until late last year would not have been able to continue <e> <s> thank goodness too for investigative journalism which is an art in itself but which has to be very carefully handled <e>", "<cs> and my godfather too <e>", "<cs> my lords for as long as i can remember and i have no doubt for much longer than that the possibility of reform of your lordships house has been a matter for discussion <e> <s> one of the main arguments that it should be reformed is that your lordships are not accountable to the public <e> <s> i respectfully submit that in many respects that is more of an advantage than a disadvantage <e> <s> for a start i am not aware of any abuse that has arisen in my time as a result of non-accountability of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i ought to be frank with your lordships and confess that unfortunately i have not been able to give this very substantial bill the detailed scrutiny that it deserves <e> <s> the reason not an excuse is that i have been busy all week trying to get legislation passed to enable women to be ordained to the priesthood and episcopacy of the church of ireland <e> <s> interestingly enough it was the female laity who were in the lead in opposing it <e> <s> however we made it so let no one say again that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great privilege to speak after the noble lord lord prior <e> <s> i received the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl lord longford for having once again raised the matter of hospices <e> <s> we have both spoken on this subject on previous occasions <e> <s> i think that what the noble earl has said in the past and perhaps something of what i have said in the past has helped to bring about a situation in northern ireland with which he would be satisfied <e> <s> i am not aware whether the noble earl is familiar with the way things are at present but we have had very good treatment compared with great britain <e> <s> i believe that what the noble earl and other noble lords have said has contributed to that end <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to differ with the noble earl <e> <s> i have paid tribute to him on many previous occasions <e>"]
