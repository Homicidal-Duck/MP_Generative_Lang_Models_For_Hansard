["<cs> i had not intended to intervene at this stage <e> <s> i was waiting with some expectation to hear what the justification was for this clause from the government front bench but no doubt we shall get that in due course <e> <s> basically all that i have heard are reasons why this power should not be granted as against the general proposition that there are justifiable reasons for its being there <e> <s> i intervene at this stage to indicate one <e>", "<cs> i find it rather difficult to follow one of the last points made by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate about the inadvisability of trying to incorporate the common law into a statute because that is exactly what is done in paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> since the parallel or simile of taking statements has been introduced in considering the position of suspects who are detained although that is not a proper equipartation because the situation is different i think it is right that i should inform your lordships of the present position in scotland with regard to the taking of statements from a person who has been cautioned and charged because it has been suggested that that can lead to a great deal of injustice <e> <s> i am not saying that there cannot be improprieties <e> <s> whatever you legislate for there is always the liability of some police officer going beyond the score <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i should like to say something on this <e> <s> i think that in balancing the arguments for and against which it may be is a very fine skill it must be borne in mind that there are arguments in favour of allowing this power <e> <s> may i say from my experience that the most formidable argument is that a very large <e>", "<cs> may i just correct the noble lord lord ross i was referring to serious crimes when i said that a large proportion of serious crimes of assault were committed by the use of offensive weapons <e>", "<cs> when i first addressed your lordships on this amendment i tried particularly to confine myself to the bare bones of the argument because of the lateness of the hour and it would be inconsistent if i went back on that at this even later stage of the evening <e> <s> so having regard to the undertaking given by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate about the manner in which he will deal with the matters referred to by me in regard to this amendment and may i just add something that i omitted to say previously that the lord justice general as head of the court is very much in favour of it being done by way of the bill and not by way of act of adjournal and i hope the government will bear that in mind as well i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> may i add that i do not think i shall be able to be here next week because of my judicial duties <e>", "<cs> may i first ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he is giving an affirmative answer to the question put by the noble lord lord galpern as to whether the witness will be on oath when merely there for the purpose of giving a precognition <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that because first i do not know why there should be a reference to evidence in paragraph ii prevaricates in his evidence <e> <s> if he is not on oath he is not giving evidence he is merely giving a precognition <e> <s> that is point no <e> <s> <e> <s> if i may try to answer the noble lord lord foot so far as our procedure in scotland is concerned the word prevarication arises in relation to contempt of court <e>", "<cs> i am not too satisfied either with the situation here and i hope that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate will look at this seriously again <e> <s> he says it is an equiperation of the position of a prosecution witness <e> <s> i have been trying very hard to find out which section of the criminal procedure act deals with that <e> <s> i do not think it does <e>", "<cs> it is very strange and i think this has to be borne in mind <e> <s> it is one thing to constitute an offence for something done or said by a person giving evidence in court under oath or affirmation and to do the same thing for a person who is merely being precognosced and not on oath <e> <s> it is quite a different situation when you are making it an offence in these conditions <e> <s> therefore i think the lord advocate should look very carefully at this matter to see whether when a person is brought for precognition either for the prosecution or defence the matter is properly regulated and the difficulties to which reference has been made observed <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again but i am obliged to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for drawing my attention to that section <e> <s> however if we look at section of the criminal procedure scotland act we find that the offence of prevaricating in ones evidence relates to the situation where one is in court and under oath and not where one has been summoned for precognition <e> <s> therefore for the first time we are creating an offence here so far as someone summoned by the defence is concerned of prevaricating while giving precognition not evidence and not on oath <e>", "<cs> the purpose of moving this amendment was to ensure <e>", "<cs> as a judge who deals with all bail appeals in scotland from the other courts i am glad to hear the assurance given by the lord advocate because it will certainly lessen my work which i have to carry out on every sitting <e>", "<cs> that is quite wrong <e> <s> i do not want to intervene in this matter because i might have to declare an interest but so far as the sheriff principal is concerned that arrangement might be all right in glasgow or strathkelvin but the sheriff principal in grampian or tayside is not immediately available and i could quote many other examples <e> <s> i do not think that this suggestion is on <e>", "<cs> i think there is a problem here which has to be faced up to and it has already been touched on by the noble lord lord kinross in his review of the memorandum published by the council of the law society of scotland <e> <s> but there is this experience and it is linked with the problem of legal aid <e> <s> an accused person is brought before the court and at that stage he probably gets legal aid from the duty solicitor <e> <s> at the first diet which is the pleading diet he pleads not guilty and in the situation to which i referred in the discussion on an earlier amendment a diet of trial is fixed for months ahead <e> <s> i am sorry to say that in many cases nothing is done between the first diet and the second diet <e> <s> then on the morning of the trial diet the <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> for the reasons just displayed by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate i think that this is a problem and that some solution must be found to it otherwise as he has pointed out a determined accused could set at naught the whole administration of justice by continued conduct of the nature envisaged in the clause <e>", "<cs> may i just point out to the noble lord that it has not happened in scotland so far but it has happened elsewhere <e>", "<cs> i should just like to say that as the lord advocate knows the lord justice general and i at all times will be available to put forward suggestions and to consult with him in these matters which very much affect the running of the courts <e> <s> i should like to give that undertaking which he knows privately but i want to make it publicly <e>", "<cs> we hear a great deal about the question of jury vetting <e> <s> i should like to give the committee the advantage of my experience over years on the bench as to the type of jury vetting that takes place at present <e> <s> it is one to which many potential jurors who have been brought to court on a list of assize take exception <e> <s> as has been pointed out for a jury of we have five peremptory challenges and any number of challenges on cause shown <e> <s> there is a practical difficulty in that when preparing the list of assize of jurors one must make provision for objections of that nature <e> <s> therefore the number of members of the public who qualify as jurors who are cited to attend court to be balloted must exceed quite considerably the actual number of jurors eventually empanelled <e> <s> that can cause a great deal of inconvenience to a great number of people for the right of peremptory challenge afears to each individual accused <e>", "<cs> i am perturbed about the extent of this clause <e> <s> i can understand the purpose behind it but we know that social workers in local authorities are constantly being asked to provide reports for the courts and that they are finding it very difficult to do so and at the same time to carry out the work for which they are primarily employed <e> <s> i wonder whether this provision is necessary in relation to solemn proceedings where the fact that they are being taken on indictment would indicate that the offence if established is of such a serious nature that normally a prison sentence would follow <e> <s> if this clause were to stand as it is it would mean that in every case in a situation qualifying the conditions here the court would require to call for a social inquiry report from the local authority <e>", "<cs> i am not so sure that i can because i am not altogether satisfied with the reply <e> <s> i am very seldom not satisfied with what the noble and learned lord the lord advocate says on matters of law and procedure <e> <s> it is all <e>", "<cs> subject to that undertaking and also on the understanding that looking means looking and considering i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> on that undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> that is the nearest that i have got so far so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord referred to the edinburgh procedure but in that situation if the point arises in inverness three or five judges as the case may be may have to go to inverness in order to constitute the court there they would lose one day at either end in travelling which is a complete waste of judicial time time that is in very rare supply at present <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord the lord advocate give us an undertaking to look at this again <e> <s> judges do not make these appeals lightly they do so in the light of experience <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is singularly unfortunate that on the first occasion that i have had the privilege of being involved in a discussion initiated by the noble and learned lord the lord advocate i find myself in opposition to him <e> <s> i have a great personal and professional regard for the lord advocate <e> <s> he has had long experience of the operation of the legal aid system in scotland as a member of <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to the speeches of the noble earl lord selkirk and the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i thought that it might perhaps suffice if i adopted the formula of the judges in the appeal court who heard the judge in the chair give a very persuasive judgment and simply say i concur with what your lordships have said and have nothing to add <e> <s> the other form of that is to say there is nothing that i can usefully add and the third member of the court says i agree <e> <s> but i find myself in one way unable simply to concur although i would adopt <e>", "<cs> i referred to that in my speech on second reading <e> <s> to save time i shall refer noble lords to that speech and adopt it as read <e>", "<cs> i referred to that fact to indicate that the secretary of state had the power to control perhaps the largest expenditure in the whole of the legal aid administration <e>", "<cs> i think that in any particular clause the objection or wording depends on the context in which that clause is framed <e> <s> it is against the background of all the other powers that are being granted under this bill that one has to have regard to this subsection that the board shall have regard to such guidance <e> <s> guidance means that they are being led <e> <s> it is not just a question of the secretary of state making representations to them <e> <s> he will guide them as to the way in which they are supposed to go <e> <s> this underlines once again the question as to the independence of the board or the fact that it is merely as i have said before the arm of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow the logic of the argument of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> the advisory committee may be advising the secretary of state about the way in which the board is administering the legal aid scheme and said the lord advocate it is all right <e> <s> the board can do all that <e> <s> they can report to the lord advocate on the unfortunate and improper way they have been carrying out their duties <e> <s> thus all is well and we do not need an advisory committee <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand the difficulty of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate <e> <s> he has said that in practice such advice could be obtained and would fall within the permissible fees that the solicitor would incur <e>", "<cs> i take rather a different view to the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> the initial words of clause state <e>", "<cs> in making my observation about the qualifying words at the beginning of the subsection i was dealing with the point raised by the noble lord lord morton that the regulations could not be more definitive than what is contained in the body of the clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add my voice to this plea <e> <s> this is not just a question of representation before an industrial tribunal <e> <s> our experience in scotland is that there is an appeal from an industrial tribunal to the appeal tribunal and then from the appeal tribunal to the court <e> <s> having dealt with quite a number of these cases in the appeal court to me it is quite clear that in many of the cases the whole basis of the dispute is the fact that at the initial stage before the industrial tribunal there has not been a proper legal representation of the claimant <e> <s> not only would this be a matter of justice in giving representation at that stage but it might save a great deal of public time and money by cutting down the number of unnecessary appeals through the industrial appeal tribunal to the court of session <e>", "<cs> with all due respect to the noble and learned lord the lord advocate what i was saying had no bearing at all on the saving to the legal aid fund <e> <s> my point was that the whole basis of the claim and the whole basis of flaws in the claim can be traced back to the fact that the applicant did not have legal representation in the court of first instance namely the industrial tribunal <e> <s> it was because of those flaws that all these subsequent proceedings had to take place at both public and private expense <e>", "<cs> at least we know what the legislation contains we do not know what is in the legal aid regulations <e> <s> that is the snag <e>", "<cs> in when we were first introducing legal aid in civil causes in scotland actions of defamation were excluded largely for the reasons advanced by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> but i have to say that the history of defamation actions in scotland had entirely different cause from the position in england <e> <s> we had very few defamation actions in scotland <e> <s> whether or not that was due to the fact that we are thicker skinned i am not sure but we took these insults as part and parcel of the give and take of life <e> <s> therefore there was not such a feeling of unfairness in not allowing defamation cases to fall within the ambit of legal aid <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene again because i have suddenly recalled what i think the noble lord lord hughes had in mind by way of quotation in addition to the one he gave <e> <s> it is perhaps the most formidable argument in favour of recognising the right to have such cases subject to the provision to which the noble lord lord morton referred by way of limiting the number of cases <e> <s> the quotation is <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene <e> <s> the lord advocate has just said that regulations will be made under clause <e>", "<cs> up to a certain point <e>", "<cs> what if he is not on bail <e>", "<cs> who are those persons <e>", "<cs> i have had to deal with quite a number of people against whom this amendment is directed and as i sit north of the border i normally would not wish to say or do anything which would differ from the opinions of the noble and learned lord lord denning and his comments in connection with this proposed new clause <e>", "<cs> when we were discussing amendment no <e> <s> and the new clause that was introduced by the noble and learned lord lord denning i indicated that i shared with all members in all parts of the committee an abhorrence of the iniquitous traffic that is continuing at the present time <e> <s> before i retired just a few months ago i was not only in the fortunate position of being able to indicate in the courts of scotland how the law regarded such traffic with abhorrence and believed that it should be visited with the most condign punishment but i also had the opportunity as lord justice clerk of setting the pattern of the method of disposal <e>", "<cs> i find myself in complete agreement with the noble and learned lords lord elwyn-jones and lord denning <e> <s> the more we go into this bill the more i keep posing in my mind the question what is it that english lawyers have that scottish lawyers do not have that causes this great distinction between the operation of the legal aid system in england as compared with scotland <e> <s> why is it that english judges can be trusted to do certain things that scottish judges cannot <e> <s> why is it that certain full rights are granted to people south of the border but may be denied to them north of the border <e> <s> there has been no answer to that series of questions since the beginning of this bill <e> <s> i would invite the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to give some explanation of this enigma that has puzzled me throughout our proceedings <e>", "<cs> there is no real excuse for the government not knowing of the problems referred to by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> these long delays arise out of a procedure introduced by this government or rather their predecessor in the criminal justice scotland act <e> <s> you can have these preliminary hearings on primary points a procedure we did not have before but which was introduced under that act <e> <s> that was an act of this governments predecessor <e> <s> they should have been very much aware of that situation when framing this and of the difficulties which would arise as referred to by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that under the system that the noble and learned lord has just outlined the legally-aided person is not receiving <e>", "<cs> i should like the noble and learned lord the lord advocate to be more explicit about the reasons why this could not be done <e> <s> it would seem that this is another instance of an accused person not enjoying the benefit of the doubt <e> <s> instead of dealing with technicalities of procedure i think that this is a matter which ought to be decided on broad general principles <e> <s> if therefore it is the broad general principle in england and wales that if there is a doubt the applicant should get the benefit of it then i fail to see why this principle should not apply equally in scotland <e>", "<cs> if i speak now it might give the lord advocate the opportunity of dealing with the points raised in favour of this amendment <e> <s> i have some personal experience of this procedure which was introduced under the criminal justice act of allowing new trials to take place in given circumstances in scotland <e> <s> this situation presupposes that the accused person has been found guilty and that for some reason or another the court of appeal has found that there has been a miscarriage of justice because it is a prerequisite to allowing the lord advocate to re-indict and therefore bring about a new trial that he is so advised that there has been a miscarriage of justice which is the only remaining ground of appeal so far as criminal appeal is concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws the amendment may i say a word or two in answer to that point <e> <s> i remind the lord advocate because we have both been involved possibly in the same case where this has arisen that while it is a matter for a new indictment when the lord advocate has been authorised by the appeal court to formulate a new indictment if so advised so far as the accused person is concerned he has been put in double jeopardy <e> <s> in the first place you could say it was his own fault because he may have committed the offence but on the second occasion he is brought to trial not because of anything he had done but <e>", "<cs> on a point of information could either of the two noble lords enlighten me <e> <s> if the board is required to give advice to the secretary of state will the board be obliged in terms of clause to have regard to the guidance given to it in that matter by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage and earlier report stage the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was very inflexible in relation to any amendment that was put forward contrary to the governments views <e> <s> having regard to the way in which this amendment has received support from people with great experience in the operation of the advisory committee south of the border i think that the government must look long and hard at this before they reject it out of hand as other amendments have been rejected <e> <s> when in addition to that there is a clear case in common sense for the adoption of a body of this nature it becomes more and more difficult to understand how the government can resist <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord not accept that the two reports have a marked difference <e> <s> the report of the law society will presumably be about their handling of legal aid whereas the report of the advisory committee as an independent body will deal not only with the handling of legal aid but also with the mishandling of it <e> <s> it is because it is necessary to have that objectivity with regard to mishandling which may be much more important that it is necessary to have the advisory committee <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord will allow me i shall give him some support <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the reasoning behind the clause as it now stands whereby when a person gets legal aid and institutes proceedings the successful defender will be entitled to get money from the legal aid fund in respect of his expenses <e> <s> the reasoning surely is this <e> <s> if the legal aid organisation has been involved in financing the case by the pursuer and that case fails in equity the successful defender should be entitled to payment out of the legal aid fund <e>", "<cs> but my lords should not exactly the same argument apply to the reverse situation where the unassisted person raises the action but the defender gets legal aid and pursues the action unsuccessfully in a court of first instance <e> <s> he has been able to do that only because legal aid has been supplied to him <e> <s> surely if it is equitable in the first case it should be equitable in the second case <e> <s> if the expense has been incurred to the successful party through the intervention of the legal aid fund in equity the successful party should be entitled to be considered for expenses against the legal aid fund <e> <s> i say considered deliberately because as the noble and learned lord lord denning has pointed out the underlying principle is the one in operation at the present time in scotland where the proceedings as framed in the clause take place and the court has to decide in all the circumstances of the case whether it is equitable that expenses should be given to the successful defender and the extent to which these expenses should be given <e> <s> this is a case where equity should rule over the possibility of being faced with some extra expense <e> <s> the whole principle of legal aid will surely be made a nonsense of if one is to have two standards of equity <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have difficulty in understanding what is meant by the phrase in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my voice in support of what has been said by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones for one reason perhaps most of all <e> <s> either by design or accident the impression has been given under the bill that the secretary of state is getting everything in connection with legal aid into his own maw <e> <s> he will be the person who controls the legal aid system from alpha to omega <e> <s> that impression could have been modified to a certain extent if some of the proposed amendments put forward today had been accepted <e> <s> this is a last-minute effort whereby perhaps in his own interest and the interest of the government the noble and learned lord the lord advocate might well be advised to think again about this matter and put in this very modest qualification if for no other reason than giving the impression that the secretary of state is prepared to devolve to other people some of the responsibility for the operation of this act <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot let this occasion pass without taking advantage of the opportunity of rising to support the lord advocate <e> <s> surely one of the common situations which arises is when a person has not previously been sentenced to imprisonment or detention <e> <s> the court cannot proceed to sentence a prisoner forthwith <e> <s> the case has to be continued to allow various reports to be obtained from the appropriate quarters such as social inquiry reports detention centre reports and things of that nature <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble learned lord the lord advocate is considering this question as to whether or not there should be some form of appeal since we are now dealing with summary causes will he bear in mind the point that i made at an earlier stage in the proceedings that if the applicant is on bail at the time then he has to be brought to trial within days under our procedure <e> <s> therefore the need for a speedy form of appeal becomes paramount <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord referred to the test that is applied to the good people of england and wales <e> <s> as a matter of clarity will he explain what the test is for the bad people of england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether this is an extension of the duty solicitor system that we have at the present time <e> <s> will the noble and learned lord bear in mind i am sure that he will the unsatisfactory reports one gets from accused persons about having a duty solicitor foisted upon them two or three minutes before they are due to go into court with a very unsatisfactory time for the consultation <e> <s> if that is so under these proposals will steps be taken to ensure that a more satisfactory system will be in operation so that in effect the accused person will have exactly the same advantage as a person who is instructing his own solicitor and counsel <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add my voice to the plea that has just been made by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> here is another opportunity in view of the criticisms that have been levelled about the position of the secretary of state in relation to the operation of legal aid under this bill of removing that <e>"]
