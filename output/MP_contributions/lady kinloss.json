["<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for having initiated this debate and for having explained the report so lucidly and concisely <e> <s> in a report of this character so very many different points are raised that in a short speech it is possible to deal with only one or two of them <e> <s> no one i suppose can approach this subject with a wholly open mind <e> <s> it is not our function in your lordships house to attempt to legislate to make then moral but it is possible nevertheless to abstract certain common principles which your lordships house is accustomed to follow <e> <s> i could not help reflecting during the christmas festival when in our home we had greetings cards from buddhists hindus jews and moslems as well as from fellow christians how many fundamentals we all have in common <e> <s> all agree in having positive attitudes towards marriage and the family <e> <s> all taken together comprise <e>", "<cs> my lords the education no <e> <s> bill to which we are giving a second reading today has many virtues which the noble baroness lady young has explained <e> <s> there are several clauses which are causing some considerable concern to parents of disabled children whether they are mentally or physically handicapped blind or deaf <e> <s> if clause is included in the bill the parents of disabled children will be deprived of the rights given to the parents of non-disabled children <e> <s> why should parents of handicapped children not have a say in choosing their childs school <e> <s> it surely strikes a cruel blow at all those who are concerned with progress in educating the disabled and who are working for the integration of disabled people into our society <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply may i ask whether he would not agree that there is a vast difference between that charge and the charge made by the british library of p the bodleian library in oxford of p and commercially between and p per copy for the same service <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> it is very important to have as a social worker the older man or woman who has experience of life and the world in general <e> <s> the older person is more likely to stay in one place which is important when he or she has got to know the area and its problems <e> <s> such people can also give encouragement and support to the young social worker who is of the greatest importance to the social service <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal in initiating this debate has deservedly highlighted a comparatively small number of people in our society who nevertheless are individuals who merit our help in every posisble way <e> <s> in the case of the mentally handicapped blind who have been in special schools there are few places which they can go to when they leave school other than mental hospitals where really many of them ought not to be at all <e> <s> this needs sorting out because it is unfair both on the hospital and on the hapless individuals <e>", "<cs> in thanking the minister for his reply and in hoping that he might reconsider part of it at the report stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate on the year of disabled people and <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for his explanation <e> <s> i might wish to bring this forward again in a different way at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness lady young consider the placing of a ramp sign under the wheelchair sign where there is a step in say a lavatory and a ramp has been fitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that today we are at long last beginning to legislate following the warnock report <e> <s> it is now three years since the committee chaired by mrs warnock reported <e> <s> it has been a pleasure to listen to the noble baroness lady young explaining the bill in her usual eloquent fashion i say eloquent but i mean elegant too <e> <s> i have many times argued in debate for the concept of intergration wherever possible and i am happy to see introduced the new concept of special educational needs <e> <s> there is a sense in which every child has special educational needs for no two individuals have identical talents <e> <s> from this point of view each child requires special educational consideration <e> <s> the old concept <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that this is very hard on hire firms on either side of the tunnel <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> mencaps experience has been that after parents have been notified that their child is handicapped stress and unhappiness has been greatly reduced by the early provision of helpful information advice and counselling from various organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords if i do not follow other speakers but confine myself to a few remarks i hope i may be forgiven as i have rather severe catarrh and find it hard to speak clearly <e> <s> my noble friend lady loudoun also regrets that she is unable to be here today to speak in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that vat is an unfair tax on charities because commercial companies can recover their vat on their expenses and local authorities do not pay vat on the same kind of services as provided by the charities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord nugent of guildford is much to be congratulated on his endeavours to free our cities and towns of pornographic material and sex advertisements which stare at one down so many streets <e> <s> it is an insult to the human spirit and a degrading of women into mere toys <e> <s> the trade is very much in evidence and the sex shops scandal has raised a nationwide outcry <e> <s> i have read that even where residents have protested the local authorities have allowed sex shops to open <e> <s> is this because the local authorities have not enough power or feel they have not to refuse them a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are to be congratulated on the tremendous <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood that i was to speak first <e>", "<cs> my lords let me begin again <e> <s> the government are to be congratulated on the tremendous amount of work that the department of transport has done since the conference held in london in march for the mobility of disabled people <e> <s> it is a pleasure to learn that so many of the suggestions which were made at the conference have been implemented and that the department is continuing to discuss further suggestions <e> <s> the departments transport without handicap action programme shows clearly what action it has taken and is hoping to take in the future <e> <s> i must thank the noble baroness lady stedman for her excellent explanation of the report and not least for initiating this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just over three years since i visited rampton in october but it was an unforgettable experience <e> <s> the distressful state of mind of many of the patients was equalled only by ones admiration for the devotion and skill of the staff <e> <s> it is because of this that it is most fitting that the noble baroness lady macleod of borve should have asked this question this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to follow other noble lords who have spoken on defence although one cannot entirely disentangle it from foreign affairs <e> <s> i wish to speak only on a limited range within foreign affairs <e> <s> in his majestys government was kind enough to send me to the school of oriental and african studies in london to learn swahili preparatory to years with my husband in what is now tanzania <e> <s> my travels took me to zanzibar <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to hear the noble lord lord wells-pestell once again opening a debate on this subject on which he is so knowledgeable <e> <s> i should like also to support the noble viscount lord ingleby in saying how pleased i am to see the noble earl lord snowdon here today and i am only sorry he is not speaking in this debate <e> <s> there are an infinite number of topics that can arise within the broad range of this debate <e> <s> while supporting what the noble lord and many others have said i shall confine myself to a few of them <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether section grants are part of the governments national policy for water transport as intended under section of the transport act <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed indebted to the noble lord lord harvington for introducing this debate today <e> <s> it is time that this subject was ventilated because as others have already said deafness partial deafness or some loss of hearing is likely to afflict most of us sooner or later <e> <s> there are many and various ways in which the hard of hearing can be helped today <e> <s> the british association for the hard of hearing is a registered charity <e> <s> through a network of local clubs social eduational and community activities are organised and ideas experiences and information are exchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have done so before me i should like to thank the noble lord lord kennet for and congratulate him on introducing the bill <e> <s> in a report of the world health organisation on female circumcision it is stated that at one time it was performed among various communities in all continents of the world both old and new <e> <s> today it has long been abandoned in many places <e> <s> herodotus tells of female circumcision practised by the phoenicians hittites and ethiopians as well as by the egyptians in the fifth century bc <e> <s> although its origins are obscure it seems evident that circumcision was first performed on the male and then on the female <e>", "<cs> i should like clarification on one point <e> <s> what about sex change operations <e> <s> are they included <e>", "<cs> a friend of mine who is a consultant anaesthetist said that this should be put in under the exemptions <e>", "<cs> it was simply pointed out to me by a consultant anaesthetist that it should be clearly defined whether sex change operations are allowed or not <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon we are discussing one of the great assets of our island which so sadly is too little used its inland waterways many natural some manmade <e> <s> it is however our good fortune that the majority of this system created largely before the th century still exists <e> <s> indeed some waterways were already in use in roman times <e> <s> what in york we call staithes were elaborate quays which served a highly developed system of transport <e> <s> although water transport was one of the earliest methods of moving goods on a large scale after the coming of the railways and tarmac roads the waterways had little further investment and became the poor country cousin of rail and road transport <e> <s> as a result the potential of transport on waterways has almost been ignored i think to our future detriment <e> <s> i am very glad that in the past few years whichever government have been in power they have shown a slight but most welcome change of thought on our waterways potential <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that it has been possible for the noble lord lord kennet to introduce this bill a second time <e> <s> having spoken in the previous second reading debate i have only a little to say that i have not said before <e> <s> in the meantime i have been glad to have the comments of several african friends who were delighted by the principles of the bill <e> <s> however they found our constitutional procedures difficult to understand in that the bill did not become an act the first time <e> <s> i trust that this bill will have a fair wind both here and in another place and will become an act in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords while fully supporting all the safety regulations for making bicycles i hope that the noble lord will consider one or two other points <e> <s> if a white or phosphorescent rear mudguard can be fitted to bicycles it will certainly help to show up those bicycles in the dark <e> <s> i have seen some old bicycles with no mudguard at the back at all <e> <s> this means almost certainly that there is no rear reflector <e> <s> if a dynamo lighting system is used and for some reason the bicycle is being pushed the red tail-light is very often almost invisible without perhaps the person pushing the bike even realising the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there is a long waiting list for cardiac pacemakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly concerned about the effects of parts of this bill on certain sections of the population effects which appear to me to be adverse <e> <s> as i have been given to understand the government now propose to permit persons with no optical qualifications to engage in ophthalmic dispensing also to sell and supply ophthalmic frames and lenses to adults <e> <s> there are registered ophthalmic opticians <e> <s> there are also registered dispensing opticians in the united kingdom <e> <s> in almost every city and town there are several opticians in competition with one another and no chain which has anything approaching a monoply <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether there are now adequate safeguards in the law to stop such cases as operation snowball reported in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is aware of two incidents that occurred in public houses in yorkshire <e> <s> in the first two p pieces stuck together and passed as a coin <e> <s> in the other what was thought to be a coin was given in payment and only afterwards was it discovered to be made of lead <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord henderson of brompton is to be congratulated on his hard work and persistence in promoting a council for the disabled i wish him good luck <e> <s> i hope that such a council would not be just another pressure group <e> <s> there are plenty of them already perhaps too many for one to absorb easily <e> <s> i see the council primarily as a co-ordinating and fact-finding group one which would become a central exchange for facts <e> <s> for these reasons i hope that when members of such a council are being considered the majority will be drawn from those most affected the handicapped themselves <e> <s> especially i should like to see blind or partially blind deaf or partially deaf persons included <e> <s> with all the modern aids at their disposal blind or deaf people are quite able to participate in meetings <e> <s> in the case of the mentally handicapped one would hope to see a representative of the various pressure groups included <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is to be congratulated on having won the ballot for a short debate and for having chosen such an important and wide-ranging subject <e> <s> about two-and-a-half-years ago i was able to revisit kenya both the highlands and the coast almost up to the somali border after some years <e> <s> for about years i lived in what is now tanzania and then in ghana <e> <s> i have visited quite a number of other african countries some for considerable periods <e> <s> i went as a wife whose husband was working in african education <e> <s> much of our time was spent in bush villages very much more than in the towns <e> <s> i learned swahili and found this of great use as it meant that i was able to talk to anyone even to non-english speaking europeans <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i speak to support a bill to ban female circumcision in this country <e> <s> i hope this third time will be lucky and that we shall not seek to surpass the successful run of the mousetrap now in its rd year <e> <s> in two previous debates i have already given detailed reasons why i am convinced of the iniquity of this practice its cruelty to children and women <e> <s> in this view i know from direct social contact that i have the support and full sympathy of many african women who have told me of their experiences and their hope that it will soon fall into disuse <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord kennet why in his amendment no <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord mcnair has said <e> <s> he has said it very much better than i could <e> <s> for those reasons i cannot support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the hope of the noble lord lord kennet in arguing for a -month delay <e> <s> it could be argued that such a delay could benefit some but delay could also cause pain and suffering of a wholly needless kind to others <e> <s> i am more concerned with the pain that can be prevented rather than the pain that might be prevented <e> <s> for those reasons i cannot support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble baroness lady masham on having steered the bill through the house with such care and hard work <e> <s> the noble lord lord hatch says that he thinks he is the only one in the house who has lived among people who practise this <e> <s> he is wrong i and my husband lived for many years among them <e> <s> one of my reasons for wanting the bill to become law is that when we lived there one of my african women friends a nurse was very distressed that when she was at work she had to leave her two small children one a daughter with her mother <e> <s> she was terrified that her mother would have her small daughter circumcised <e> <s> the mother very much did not want that to happen because she had such problems herself <e> <s> she brought up the subject i did not <e> <s> i should also say that the african women speak only to women about these matters unless they have to go to a doctor <e> <s> the other reason is that when the bill becomes law i hope that it will save children a great deal of pain suffering and infections infections which can be with them all their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords todays debate quite rightly centres on the needs of the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped <e> <s> an aspect which is frequently overlooked is that both mental illness and mental handicap not only cause suffering to the sick or handicapped person but place a great burden on their families <e> <s> so far though professionals have long been aware of the pain guilt and stress in families where one or more members become mentally ill yet the health care services still concentrate wholly on the patient <e> <s> the need for appropriate help for relatives who are looking after a mentally ill member of the family is vital if they are to help that person make a full recovery <e> <s> the love commitment and stamina of the relatives are pegs on which the patients survival and recovery depend <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady mar and at her request i beg leave to ask the question standing in her name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble baroness for her reply may i ask whether the government appreciate the invaluable service given by those who care for the young chronically sick hours a day seven days a week and often for years without any relief <e> <s> do the government agree that high priority should be given to the setting up of special units in local health districts to provide cover for emergencies and to give holiday relief for the carers <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stallard has highlighted a series of very urgent problems <e> <s> as he said there are many problems of provision in the community for the mentally and physically handicapped and other multi-handicapped persons <e> <s> it is only possible to call attention to a few of the most urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords i happen to live in the largest county in england north yorkshire which is estimated to be second only to the london area in the tourist industry <e> <s> i was not born there but my husband first visited york as a teenager to stay with an uncle and aunt years ago <e> <s> it was then a sleepy old-fashioned cathedral city with no real attractions except architecture <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i hope that the government will consider the plight of the partially sighted with sympathy <e> <s> the noble baroness lady fisher in moving this amendment has covered so many of the points of worry concerning the partially sighted that there is only one matter i should like to mention <e> <s> it is that partially-sighted claimants would not automatically receive the disablement premium although some would receive it <e> <s> for example claimants who are classified as incapable of work would receive the disablement premium while those who are unemployed would not <e> <s> but surely a partially-sighted claimant is clearly disabled in either case and would have needs which should equally be recognised <e>", "<cs> my lords will horse-boxes which are being towed or for instance a trailer carrying goats such as my daughter uses still be confined to miles per hour <e>", "<cs> my lords although i do not live in york for the past years i have lived in a village miles from the city centre <e> <s> my husband lectured formerly in its university and is now an honorary fellow <e> <s> although the university is on the outskirts of the city it has several properties within it <e> <s> but my connection goes back nearly years when my collateral ancestor william grenville was archbishop after he had sat in this house as lord chancellor <e> <s> i thus have a great fondness for this historic city with its traditions which are so beautifully maintained by different bodies among its citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord hunter of newington should be thanked for asking this most important question this evening <e> <s> my research has led me from mr cove the oral surgeon of york district hospital who was most helpful but who so far had not come across the product in york <e> <s> he was interested and suggested that i contact professor hume of the dental school and hospital of the university of leeds <e> <s> they of course both knew about the skoal bandit and were concerned about its sale particularly to young people <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister see a report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the scheme for improvements as it now appears is the result of discussions with all interested parties <e> <s> is he also aware of the need for modernisation of the toilet facilities including provision of toilets for disabled people <e> <s> there is no such provision for the disabled at present as i saw for myself when i visited robin hoods bay last sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate this evening is being listened to by some of the blind in our midst <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell me how many children with mental handicap there are in the different authorities and whether he is satisfied with the provision for them now and in the long term <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the chassis plate should be on the rear and the front of the vehicle with the number engraved and not stamped on as is the case at present <e> <s> in those circumstances no one would he able to join two halves of different vehicles together after they have been written off <e>", "<cs> my lords of the many noble lords who have spoken this afternoon most are very concerned about one aspect or another of this bill <e> <s> clause worries organisations of and for disabled people <e> <s> they have argued since the passing of the social security act that it did not do enough for disabled people <e> <s> some severely disabled people claiming for the first time in april will receive considerably less financial assistance from the benefits system than they would have done under the present system <e> <s> in some cases their needs are so great that if no help is given their lives could be in danger <e> <s> the secretary of state for social services recognised that there were some people who would not benefit under the new system <e> <s> in the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the rate of discharge of such patients into the community has slowed down since the policy was established <e> <s> can he also say whether there is evidence that there is a sufficient number of nurses and social workers who are adequately trained to care for these patients in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> visually handicapped people seeking work have to compete on unequal terms in the labour market <e> <s> in the last decade there has been a dramatic fall in the number of visually handicapped people obtaining jobs in the blue-collar sector and sheltered employment has not taken up the slack <e> <s> it was concern about that which led the rnib the royal national institute for the blind to commission a survey which showed that visually handicapped people who are unemployed are out of work for a long time despite the fact that most visually handicapped people seeking work have a very creditable employment background <e> <s> they are not people who have nothing to offer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if supermarkets were to sell alcohol on shelves outside the main cash desk as some already do there would not be so great a crush and it would be easier to check on those buying the alcohol <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in people were admitted to hospital with schizophrenia and per cent <e> <s> of those were readmissions <e> <s> can he say whether there was adequate care for them in the period between their admissions <e> <s> is it the responsibility of the health authority or whose responsibility is it <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the bill pledges to encourage the participation of women and girls in the scheme <e> <s> in that case why can we not take this opportunity to demonstrate a similar commitment to make suitable provision for disabled people <e> <s> in the past special employment measures and training schemes have provided the few avenues through which disabled people have been able to obtain employment <e> <s> in building for sound employment prospects in the future the best practices from old schemes need to be carried forward into the new programme <e> <s> the amendment argues for participation not exemption and gives legislative backing to attempts to make provision for disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the very successful jorvik viking centre in york was set up four years ago with a loan of million and that that loan has almost been paid off as nearly visitors visit the centre each year <e> <s> therefore will the government lend support to the leading archaeologists who are pressing for the roman amphitheatre discovered underneath the london guildhall to be preserved in a national heritage centre on the scale of the jorvik centre in york <e> <s> perhaps discussions between the two cities would be of use <e>", "<cs> my lords coming late towards the end of todays debate i hope only to detain your lordships for a short time <e> <s> however there are some specific matters that i wish to mention <e> <s> in clause the key stages of testing children at seven and which have already been mentioned by several noble lords are a cause of concern for parents and particularly for parents with disabled children <e> <s> the stages at which they are tested should be flexible especially for those children who may have been out of school for short periods due to illness or to any treatment that they may need <e> <s> such disabled children may take longer than usual to reach the same level of learning as children who have no such special needs but that does not always mean that they cannot reach the necessary target <e> <s> however i believe that flexibility is essential <e>", "<cs> did i understand the minister to say that she did not agree with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is that one of the amendments which the noble baroness lady faithfull will bring back at report stage <e>", "<cs> may i ask for guidance <e> <s> if this amendment is agreed to why can i not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply which i should like to read <e> <s> as she has agreed to reconsider the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady faithfull in this amendment <e> <s> in deciding how many pupils a school should take account should be taken of children with special needs in the school <e> <s> special provision made for children with physical disabilities may affect the capacity of a school <e> <s> admitting more pupils to a school could prejudice the education which the school can provide for children with different types of special need <e> <s> the amendment is seeking guidelines from the secretary of state which local authorities must follow before they decide how many children a school should take <e>", "<cs> i should like to say a few words in support of these amendments especially amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i too agree with much that has been said in regard to this group of amendments <e> <s> the bill does not state specifically that special needs provision is a criteria within the delegation formulae and it appears that the need still exists for an explicit statement <e> <s> the argument against too much prescription in the legislation has been made repeatedly and yet the government have retained many powers by not allocating duties and responsibilities to others <e> <s> there will be need for some prescription <e> <s> it is better to know the areas which require it and ensure that the necessary information is made available to the secretary of state now and in the future through the appropriate legislation <e>", "<cs> i wish to support everything that the noble lord has just said <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lady darcy de knayth on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> the matter was not debated at report stage in another place <e> <s> does that mean that the government see the issue as being more appropriate for regulation and guidance <e> <s> the issue is as central to the integration of young people into mainstream education as is an entitlement to a balanced curriculum or right of admission to a school of their choice <e> <s> it is essential that architectural requirements are kept in mind so as to avoid costly alterations <e> <s> we need to ensure that disabled children are not restricted only to the accessible areas of schools <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> it seems from the arguments that have been put forward that it is trying to ensure that children who are already disadvantaged do not fall between two stools the local authorities and the health authorities <e> <s> surely the legal muddle should be sorted out now while we have the education reform bill before us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that the money released to reduce the waiting list for urology in central birmingham was used as effectively as it should have been in view of the bed closures and the reduced number of theatre sessions which had already been arranged <e>", "<cs> i too wish to support these amendments <e> <s> many disabled people want to take their full place in the community with everyone else <e> <s> however for a disabled person on a low income it becomes more and more difficult to play a full role if one is struggling to make ends meet <e> <s> surely it is far better to ensure that a disabled person has sufficient resources to play a full and active role in the community otherwise we may see some disabled people applying for residential care or returning to it as they feel that they no longer have the resources to stay in the community <e> <s> surely that is a situation that the government would not wish to see happen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state aware of what stress and sorrow his announcement will create in york <e> <s> is he also aware of how sad the men and women who work for rowntree will be to hear him say that he cannot assure them that their jobs will be safe <e> <s> it is sad not only for those who live in the city of york but for those who live in the surrounding villages <e>", "<cs> the womens committee of a city council has written to me expressing considerable concern about the joint and several liability payment of the tax <e> <s> as many women are financially dependent on their partners should a man leave his partner without having paid would the joint debt remain with the woman <e> <s> if a woman leaves her partner because of violence joint liability allows partners to see each others entry in the register therefore enabling her partner to trace her whereabouts and putting her in danger of more violence <e> <s> i ask the government to reconsider the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> standing in my name and that of my noble friend lady darcy de knayth the noble lord lord carter and the noble baroness lady warnock <e> <s> the amendment refers to the national curriculum council the curriculum council for wales and the school examinations and assessment council <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee said per cent <e> <s> of all our children at school will at some time or another have special educational needs <e> <s> therefore it is all the more necessary for a member who can represent their views and aspirations to be on all the councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her full and lengthy reply <e> <s> i am sorry that she feels she cannot accept the amendment <e> <s> i still hope that she may think of coming back at third reading with an amendment that would fit the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for his very detailed reply <e> <s> i wonder whether i dare hope that he may come back with an amendment at third reading particularly on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> secretaries of state come and go and the next secretary of state might not agree with this one <e> <s> therefore i believe that it should be written into the bill <e> <s> i shall read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support everything that my noble friend lady darcy de knayth and the noble baroness lady faithfull have said <e> <s> i hope that the government will feel able to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness does not feel able to accept this amendment <e> <s> i have tried hard to persuade her all the way through this bill <e> <s> i should like to see whether the house will agree with me on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support all that the noble baroness lady darcy has said <e> <s> will parents be informed when they can make a complaint or will they be expected to know <e> <s> the amendment is intended to ensure that it will be made clear and that they will know the complaints procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the noble lord in this amendment <e> <s> as he has explained very much better than i could there is an anomaly here which the amendment seeks to rectify <e> <s> i hope that the government will feel able to put it right by accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how many patients are likely to be transferred from hospital into the community in the next five years and what provision of care in the community there will be <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the atomic plant at sizewell could affect seals in the north sea <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the government are satisfied that local authorities will have sufficient funds and expertise for care in the community in view of the report of the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady mar has highlighted a matter of very grave concern to many people <e> <s> the change to benefit payments for people living in board and lodgings will leave many disabled and elderly people out of pocket <e> <s> this will cause severe problems for people living in so-called supported lodgings where the landlord or landlady provides a degree of care <e> <s> as the noble countess has said the dhss estimates that there are currently such claimants <e> <s> this is a form of care that is expected to grow as care in the community policies take effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on the report of the select committee on the european communities has been well explained by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale chairman of the committee <e> <s> it heard interesting and informative evidence from various groups concerned with disablement and independent living or living in the community <e> <s> it appears that there is no criteria for defining handicap which can be accepted throughout the community <e> <s> precise estimates of the number of disabled people are difficult to establish because no up-to-date statistics are available for all member states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the government on the rapidity with which they have produced the bill so soon after the butler-sloss report <e> <s> perhaps i may also say how pleased i am that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has introduced it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter has given us the opportunity today to discuss some aspects of care in the community for people with mental illness or mental handicap who are leaving care <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many museums will be grateful for the extra funding promised <e> <s> is she also aware that the museums association centenary conference is being held in york in and that the museums association was founded in the yorkshire museum in york <e>", "<cs> i support what the noble baroness lady faithfull has said <e> <s> the cleveland report noted that a child was a person and not an object of concern <e> <s> as many noble lords have said it is essential to seek the wishes of a child as long as the child understands what is being asked of it <e> <s> its home background is taken into account <e> <s> perhaps i may ask for clarification on one point <e> <s> the bill mentions many times the child but from time to time there is a line with him or her his or he <e> <s> i ask should it not be he or she and him or her as the case may be <e> <s> the bill mentions him his and he <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord mottistone has already explained the nspcc has been able to submit written reports to the court on behalf of local authorities in some areas from time to time when the society has been acting as a key worker for a child and family <e> <s> this again was noted by the cleveland report which thought that it was important legislation in seeking to bolster up existing good arrangements <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for all these amendments <e> <s> all children in local authority areas should receive the same quality services <e> <s> but a child in care may well need special attention for a particular problem <e>", "<cs> i am glad to support this amendment <e> <s> i cannot see why disabled people who are perfectly capable where necessary with the appropriate support services of raising a child should have to fight for this right via the courts <e> <s> with adequate support services and care assistance provided if necessary disabled parents will be able to raise the child without any detrimental effects on the child <e> <s> there are several cases where appropriate support has been provided and disabled parents are able to have the same rights as other parents <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i should like to say that some organisations dislike the word dumb in particular <e> <s> perhaps some other words can be found so that that word may be deleted <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for his reply <e> <s> i shall read it and perhaps we shall return to the subject at report stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord confirm that section includes elderly mentally infirm people <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> when a child goes into local authority care he may well be suffering from a deep physical or emotional trauma <e> <s> with the right kind of help the child is able to recover and lead a fulfilled and happy life <e> <s> children have very different kinds of needs and what is appropriate for one child may be quite unsuitable for another child <e> <s> common sense dictates that each child must have a plan which is designed to meet his or her individual needs <e>", "<cs> i support the noble baroness lady faithfull and i agree with what she has said <e> <s> it is an unfortunate development that the number of children fostered by relatives has declined as such children appear to do better and are better adjusted <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that the words assist him are better in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should also like to support the noble baroness lady faithfull in her amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i agree with her that people who leave care will need assistance with money and with finding accommodation <e> <s> as a parent i have frequently had to help my children with money and in finding them somewhere to live <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is felt by the nspcc that it is consistent for the child to take part in administrative reviews <e> <s> i think it is essential so long as they can understand their right to do so <e> <s> it is possible that the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will say that these matters would be better dealt with by regulations but i feel they are better dealt with in primary legislation <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the nspcc and the national childrens bureau believe that it is vital that interested parties such as relatives grandparents or a teacher should be able to make a complaint on the childs behalf <e> <s> that applies especially in the case of young children vulnerable young people and disabled children <e> <s> for example there may be a mentally handicapped child in a home who has been abandoned by his parent or parents <e> <s> in those circumstances there would be no one in the paragraphs a to d who could make a complaint about the childs treatment in care <e>", "<cs> these amendments seek to do two things <e> <s> they seek to allow local authorities to publish information on services provided by people other than the statutory authorities which often work in partnership with voluntary organisations <e> <s> given that many services particularly those for under-fives are provided by voluntary or community groups it would be useful if local authorities thought it appropriate for these services to be widely known about <e>", "<cs> i should like to support in particular amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> the social work profession is i understand still smarting from the governments <e>", "<cs> we have debated previously the right of the child and other family members to appeal against the making of an order or the variation of orders <e> <s> thererfore it would seem consistent where the child or another person has exhausted all other <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very timely that the noble baroness lady cox should ask this question about the measures being taken to ensure satisfactory standards of care for the infirm elderly in the community <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister who is to reply knows what unease if not anxiety there is within the community on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i support these amendments <e> <s> as has been made clear by the noble lord lord mottistone they are to ensure two very important duties for the local authorities first to identify and secondly to take steps to prevent children suffering neglect or abuse <e> <s> these are in the primary legislation and are not to be subject to alteration by the secretary of state <e> <s> awareness of the problems of child abuse is very high arid a matter of major public concern <e> <s> the vast majority of people want to see local authorities doing all they can to prevent child abuse <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> radar thinks that although the number of disabled people directly affected by the amendment is likely to be fairly small the issue is a major anxiety for some people with disabilities <e> <s> i am sure that the matter would be dealt with in regulations but i suggest that it should be included in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting the noble lord lord mottistone i should add that the debates in committee highlighted the fact that the words as they consider appropriate would mean that it would he impossible for a court to determine whether a local authority is adequately fulfilling its duty <e> <s> setting clause within the context of a local authoritys general duties may make it easier for courts to get a grip on a local authority which is providing inadequate services for children <e>", "<cs> my lords all these three amendments seek to ensure that local authorities are placed under a duty to ensure that there is day care <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier during the consideration of this bill the problem of children drifting in the care system is a widely recognised one <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has already mentioned that point <e> <s> i support the amendment and the noble lord has explained it so well that there is nothing further to say <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull and i said in committee that the number of children fostered by relatives had declined <e> <s> that is sad because such children appear to do better and and are better adjusted <e> <s> one of the elements of the amendment is to enable an allowance to be paid to relatives <e> <s> that is important when children are living with relatives under voluntary arrangements in circumstances where it may not be appropriate for the relatives to be assessed as foster parents and therefore to receive the foster allowance although they may be in desperate need of money to look after the children <e> <s> the amendment provides a better solution than sending the children to stay with strangers <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness and the noble lord have already mentioned last week we were able to meet some young people who had left care <e> <s> they were concerned that when a young person leaves care he or she generally faces quite different problems from those who have lived at home with their families <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble baroness lady faithful <e> <s> as regards this amendment <e> <s> it is most important that young people should know how to go about getting their rights and that they should know what assistance they can have <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add in support of the noble lord lord mottistone that the government have already agreed to amend the bill so that young people are informed of their rights on leaving care <e> <s> this amendment seeks to ensure that young people are informed of their right to a court order in order to leave care <e> <s> i hope that as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has shown care and thought in putting down amendment no <e> <s> he will be equally thoughtful in accepting this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord mottistone in all that he has said and to emphasise in particular the principle that a child is far less likely to drift if he is the responsibility of a named officer of the authority or a local voluntary group <e>", "<cs> my lords if the nspcc cannot take care proceedings what happens to a child in circumstances where the local authority for one reason or another is unable to initiate proceedings <e> <s> the child and his or her family would be left in limbo <e> <s> much of the emphasis of the bill is on speeding up care proceedings in the court process <e> <s> if neither of the two agencies is able to take care proceedings and act where does that leave the child <e> <s> this clause as drafted takes away an added safety net for the child <e>", "<cs> my lords the finer report on one parent families has begged for a comprehensive family court since it reported in <e> <s> although that is not proposed in this bill there are some very hopeful signs especially if the noble and learned lord is prepared to say a little more on how the guardian ad litem service will help the court to decide which cases should be heard in which level of court <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> the child assessment order should not be viewed as an <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord mottistone on this amendment <e> <s> at present the clause works on the presumption that the applicant and the local authority will both agree that it is in the childs best interests for the order to be transferred <e> <s> that might not always be so <e> <s> as the noble lord said the amendment has the advantage of making explicit that both the original applicant and the agency seeking to have the order transferred must be in agreement that the proposed transfer would be in the childs best interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for explaining these three codes of recommendation of the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food for the welfare of goats farmed deer and livestock sheep <e> <s> i wish to speak particularly about goats <e> <s> here i must declare an interest <e> <s> my elder daughter breeds goats in our stables and supports us with butter milk and cream which i may say are delicious <e> <s> it is not a commercial enterprise <e> <s> she is a member of the british goat society and during the last season won numerous rosettes and a silver cup with her goats so she knows how goats should be looked after and she is very concerned about the conditions of some goats <e>", "<cs> my lords is enough assistance being given to training in other communication skills such as finger spelling for the deaf-blind and lip-reading and lip-speaking for the deaf both of which are supported by the council for the advancement of communication with deaf people <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment establishes preventive work as a general principle and will focus the minds of local authorities and the public on the importance of preventive services <e> <s> services which prevent the abuse and neglect of children are the cornerstone of this bill and should be firmly placed at the beginning of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these amendments <e> <s> may i refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> at an earlier stage in the bill i said that many organisations were not happy with the word dumb <e> <s> it may be that it has a rather unkind meaning in the sense that children may tease one another by saying you are dumb <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord will be able to consider the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in understanding that the government amendment to revise the nurseries and child-minders regulation act is to be introduced shortly as part of the children bill to take over fives out of registration legislation <e> <s> can the noble and learned lord reassure the house that this will not involve the deregulation of provision for over fives because unless the legislation for registration is built into the children bill instead of improving the protection and quality of day care for over fives the new legislation could lead to lower standards and less provision <e>", "<cs> my lords some voluntary agencies are concerned that there is nothing in the bill or regulations to ensure that local authorities work in partnership with parents nor is there enough to encourage local authorities to use voluntary arrangements except for very short periods <e> <s> adolescents who cannot live at home are often in voluntary care at the moment and they can remain there for three or four years at a time <e> <s> if the parents have to give notice that they wish to have them back it gives everybody a period of time to arrange for the young person to return home or for the local authority to take some form of legal action if they do not want the child to return home for one reason or another <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> at present the nspcc is able to initiate care proceedings where the child is accommodated by the local authority <e> <s> if a child is in need of long-term protection and there is complete local agreement that that is so it seems very odd to cut off one avenue of achieving that end <e> <s> in circumstances in which the local authority cannot allocate cases the nspcc is still able to act <e> <s> that arrangement works well in many areas and it would be a great pity to alter existing working practice <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendments <e> <s> in the real world of social work there may be occasions where dispute is the best way of caring for or protecting a child <e> <s> these disputes may be few and far between but some mechanism must be established to resolve them quickly and fairly <e> <s> this is an appropriate area for regulation which does not conflict with any other principle in clause and provides a step towards the practical implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support this amendment <e> <s> every time there is a child abuse inquiry the recommendations in the report highlight the need for improved training <e> <s> it is a matter of major public concern and the general public want to see highly skilled and trained social workers <e> <s> the matter should be kept under review by parliament perhaps every three years as the noble lord lord seebohm would like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble and learned lord for his kindness in always answering any queries that i may have had throughout this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords can the secretary of state say whether the employment prospects for disabled young people leaving yts schemes will be improved once the training and enterprise councils come into being <e> <s> can he say when those councils are likely to start <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that in introducing the bill the government have proposed a number of amendments to the law relating to social security and to occupational and personal pension schemes <e> <s> it has long seemed to me that some things needed tidying up <e> <s> so far as the pension schemes are concerned there is just one point that i should like to make <e> <s> this concerns the case of people who have enjoyed widows pensions for which their deceased husbands have compulsorily paid <e> <s> why should they forfeit them if they re-marry <e> <s> that seems to me to be anomalous <e> <s> i know of several cases where naval military and colonial service widows have found it more convenient not to re-marry but simply to cohabit in order not to lose financially <e> <s> i realise that this situation has been long in existence but it seems rather odd that there should be regulations which some find to be a bar to marriage <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord stanley of alderley in his amendment <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister can tell us in his reply why domestic consumers of water whether in rural or urban areas should not pay the same amount <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the post office makes the same charge whether it delivers mail in the street where the sorting office is or in the remotest area of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady turner for raising this important subject for debate <e> <s> a recent survey carried out for manchester city council found that nine out of mothers thought that the council should provide more child care facilities so that mothers who wished could return to work <e> <s> one problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i ask the minister whether the deaf-blind can be included in a similar interim measure as those who are to receive the mobility allowance until the age of instead of <e> <s> i should have thought that being deaf-blind is a sufficient disability without the trauma in most cases of having to prove their inability to walk alone <e> <s> they should receive the mobility allowance automatically if they wish to apply for it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the controls will i understand hit hardest those organisations with high needs for capital expenditure in particular community transport and dial-a-ride in some areas known as ring-and-ride <e> <s> those projects among others need loans for vehicles and for capitalised repair and maintenance contracts <e> <s> those are vital services for many elderly and disabled people and could be hard hit by the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the noble lord lord seebohm in his amendments <e> <s> unlike the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i can think of several friends over who have great difficulty in filling in forms if they do not have help <e> <s> i am sure that many people over do not receive help they have no one to help them <e> <s> so i hope that the minister will consider this amendment with sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this amendment will not have the effect of opening a local authority to charges of illegally holding a child if a parent refuses to honour a written agreement <e> <s> perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor whether that is so <e> <s> if so is it not rather important to local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for the noble lord lord prys-davies and his amendments <e> <s> i also think that the age limit should be raised to years <e> <s> is there something magical about the age of eight <e>", "<cs> i support the amendments <e> <s> i shall speak in particular to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> disabled graduates are likely to have a lower disposable income because of having to meet the extra costs of the disability <e> <s> they will also have more difficulty in finding full or part-time work in the vacations in order to minimise their borrowing <e> <s> the costs of disability can make large inroads on an individuals income <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to make only a few small points about what is a wide-ranging bill <e> <s> as was said by the noble lord lord winstanley and my noble friend lord seebohm perhaps it should have been two bills <e> <s> my comments concern part iii on community care <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> people with a recurring mental illness and in particular severe schizophrenia are unable to cope with the ordinary everyday practicalities of life such as paying bills <e> <s> they will need the help of the local authority social services especially if they have no caring relatives or friends to help them <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> as my noble friend lady darcy de knayth and the noble baroness lady david have already said deaf students not only find it harder to <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> in recent years it has been hard to escape from the image of homeless people sleeping rough in our major cities <e> <s> as noble lords have heard all too often many have a history of mental illness <e> <s> for them community care has meant no more than a doorway in the earls court road or in cardboard city around waterloo <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment <e> <s> rural communities are characterised by small numbers of people scattered over a wide area <e> <s> costs are high because of the large distances involved in travelling into and out of rural areas and in moving from one location to the next <e> <s> in north yorkshire distances are great and there can be difficulties with snow and ice particularly black ice <e> <s> that must add to the costs and risks of those travelling for example the distance that a district nurse might have to travel <e> <s> as was pointed out by the noble baroness lady faithfull the situation is more difficult for those providing meals-on-wheels and home help <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> it is very important for the person concerned to have the right to appeal against such decisions <e> <s> the association of directors of social services supports the right of appeal against decisions made on an individuals behalf <e> <s> the association said <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> the majority of adults with mental handicap live with their parents many of whom are frail and elderly themselves and very much pressure can be put on them <e> <s> therefore respite care is essential but it is thin on the ground <e> <s> mencap has found that of adults with mental handicap and living at home only had any respite care <e> <s> it is also necessary that a range of residential care is available for adults with mental handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment which would enable local authorities to make payments directly to disabled people to buy their own care arrangements <e> <s> as my noble friend lady darcy has said such a scheme would obviously not suit everyone as it requires an ability not just to deal with everything related to employing people but also to cope with the money <e> <s> however it should be an option that is open to everyone as it would give a feeling of independence <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the amendment would give severely disabled people the independence and above all the dignity which can sometimes be missing or denied them with other types of care schemes <e> <s> it may not suit everyone but it should be an option for those who are able to manage this kind of scheme <e> <s> in order that the local authority can check if they so wish how money is spent the recipient could have a specific bank account open to inspection <e> <s> this would enable the local authority to be accountable for the money that is spent <e>", "<cs> i support amendment no <e> <s> in particular <e> <s> there are about people in britain who are both deaf and blind <e> <s> they cannot obtain access to information very easily <e> <s> they cannot read regular newspapers watch television or listen to the radio <e> <s> in this respect i quote the deaf broadcasting council <e>", "<cs> my lords i support my noble friend lady darcy de knayth in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i understand that many viewers find no inconvenience in having sign language on their screens <e> <s> all the different people i have asked say they do not mind and that it does not interfere with viewing <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his kind words in accepting the amendment on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the rnib is the largest producer of braille in europe <e> <s> is she further aware that the organisation often produces small items such as student examination papers for example for which it is unlikely to receive funding from commercial institutions <e> <s> therefore will the government reconsider their decision and return the grant to at least its original amount <e>"]
