["<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the question of transferring the games elsewhere is quite impracticable at this short notice <e> <s> as an organiser of the london games which i was i know some of the problems on these occasions <e> <s> is the minister also aware which i expect he is that the games do not belong to the host country but to the international olympic committee and that the moment the games start when the flag goes up they are handed over to the international olympic committee and to the international federation <e> <s> is he also aware that they are backed by olympic committees in the world and they are controlled by the representatives of the various sports in their countries and there are of these sports <e> <s> this is a matter which does not affect something merely on the surface but affects millions of people in the world <e> <s> does he realise that international sport is the one great worldwide generally accepted movement through which the young can get together in friendship and understanding and that it would be a tragedy if we were to do something to damage it <e>", "<cs> my <e>", "<cs> my lords to clear up a misapprehension on the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i clear up one extra point <e> <s> the olympic games do not belong to the host countrythey belong to the international olympic committee <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the international olympic committee take over all the stadiums <e> <s> that is why when hitler was there in all the propaganda was taken down in the stadium under the instructions of the international olympic committee <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the international olympic committee and all the federations which run the technical side of the sports which are completely worldwide own the games <e> <s> the facilities are provided by the host country and naturally if they do them well they are proud of them as all other host countries have been in times past <e>", "<cs> my lords may i clear up a misapprehension <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep you more than a few moments but there is obviously a great deal of miscomprehension as to what the olympic games actually are <e> <s> they do not belong to the country which organises them <e> <s> the country is given the privilege of doing that and they provide the facilities <e> <s> when the games start they are taken over by the international olympic committee the international federations of the sports concerned and the national olympic committee and this is the crest of a gigantic mountain <e> <s> to give your lordships some idea the athletic one has member countries <e> <s> that is only one of them admittedly it is the largest <e> <s> if you like to take the olympic committees in this country the sports in the summer games have lcubs <e> <s> there are many clubs and bodies supporting it <e> <s> there are millions and millions of people all over the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the list here this is from the international olympic committee <e> <s> i have got their statement here and i have counted them up myself <e> <s> i do not know where the noble earl has got his information from <e> <s> at any rate that is what has happened <e> <s> i felt always that this was right and it has worked <e> <s> i have been as head of the world athletics in practically every country in the world and many

with the people there <e> <s> they live in the olympic village <e> <s> admittedly they have language difficulties but they become friends <e> <s> it does bring i people closer together <e> <s> there

right than any others you might get anywhere in the world because they are the people who run it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clear up that point <e> <s> from the moment of the opening ceremony the games have nothing to do with the host city <e> <s> the host city has only to provide the facilities <e> <s> the international olympic committee the international federation and the national
