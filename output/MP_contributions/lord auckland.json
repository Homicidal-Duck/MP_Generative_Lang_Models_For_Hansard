enormous distinction in the medical field in the social field and in senior positions of administration <e> <s> fools rush in where angels fear to tread and i feel that in intervening here with my own

ireland for several years but having seen the results of what i might call some botched-up tattooing jobs on minors in great britain i tell your lordships that the sights are terrible to behold and as my noble friend has said plastic surgery is needed to remove them <e> <s> it must also be recognised that in northern ireland at present doctors have enough to do apart from having to remove tattoo marks whether they be from minors or indeed adults <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i thank him for his very full answer to my question <e> <s> while accepting that the post office must run as a separate entity will he <e>", "<cs> my lords the debt of gratitude which this house owes to the noble earl lord halsbury for instigating this debate this afternoon is very much more considerable than many people think because we have had bills quite sincerely meant from the other side of the spectrum but nothing in those bills have ever given any real alternative to saving lives and to decreasing the numbers of deaths and disablements through malignant disease <e> <s> now at last we have a bill which we hope will in due course reach the statute book if not in its present form in something like its present form because it has very much merit in it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most opportune time to discuss the problems facing the bbcs overseas services particularly in the light of the substantial cuts which her majestys government are being forced to make in many areas and which the vast majority of responsible people regard as being a necessary evil <e> <s> but my lords there must be some discernment as to where these cuts are to take place <e> <s> in recent years this country has been the butt of some scurrilous denigration much of it within our own shores but some of it alas <e> <s> from overseas and some of it from sources overseas where one would least expect it <e> <s> how better to counteract this kind of problem than not to cut but to strengthen our overseas broadcasting services <e> <s> in times of difficulty the thing that really matters is communication <e> <s> communication between countries is the linchpin of the democratic way of life revealing credit where it is due and this is revealed all too infrequently now and debit where it is due which is sometimes overdone <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kimberley has chosen <e>", "<cs> my lords the two maiden speeches to which we have listened today have been of unique distinction <e> <s> my noble friend lord erne talked of hospitals and medical services in a very troubled part of the country where nurses and doctors have to cope not only with what one might call conventional patients but also with those who are victims of bombs and other

sussex and so on i agree with my noble friend lord gridley that it is the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer which was the type of answer which i expected from the treasury i should like to ask him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first is he aware that the ingredients for confectionery cocoa chocolate sugar and so on can all be obtained zero-rated and that if people decide to make their own confectionery they can also obtain those ingredients zero-rated <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that the confectionery industry contributes a great deal of educational value towards the hygiene of teeth and so on and that although there are a number of particularly obnoxious cream cakes available in various places <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my own debt of gratitude to my noble friend lord hunt of fawley for enabling us to debate this very important subject this afternoon as a prelude to what will be a much more comprehensive and no doubt highly controversial selection of discussions when the national health service bill reaches your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me much pleasure to be the first from these benches to congratulate the noble marquess lord tweeddale on his distinguished maiden speech <e> <s> it had all the ingredients which a maiden speech should have it was brief it was factual and when it is read it will be seen to be a model of clarity <e> <s> the house will hope to hear from the noble marquess on frequent occasions <e> <s> the house will also be grateful to the noble lord lord paget for enabling us to discuss a most interesting and important subject even though if i may say so to the noble lord with respect not everybody will completely agree with the conclusions which he drew <e> <s> like many of your lordships i had experience of national service from to and i then did six years in the tavr <e> <s> all of it was served in the ranks because if i had wished to take on a commission in the army i would have had to sign on for two years and i felt it was time for me to earn my living in a civilian capacity for most of the time but spend some time in what was then the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the satisfactory situation at kingston hospital can my noble friend say whether there are other hospitals which are being encouraged to adopt this scheme and particularly newer hospitals with a well equipped accident and casualty unit <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friends attention been drawn to paragraph of the report which seems to imply that physiotherapists need no special training and no special skills even although as my noble friend will be aware they have to undergo three years of training for which many of them receive no pay <e> <s> will he convey to his right honourable friend the disgust <e>", "<cs> my lords amid the tremendously important national and international debates that we have had in the past few days this bill may seem very modest <e> <s> my noble friend lord inglewood not for the first time has brought up a measure

lords some people may think that this question has been bandied about <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the tributes paid to my noble friend lord chandos on a most distinguished maiden speech as we might have expected from a member of the very distinguished family from which he comes <e> <s> the more we hear him speak in this house the better the house will be <e> <s> i intervene briefly in this debate for two reasons only <e> <s> first for some years i was a trustee of a repertory theatre in surrey near where i live <e> <s> secondly for a few years i was a chorister at my school and therefore have a particular love of music <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say first whether there are adequate supplies of this vaccine particularly in rural areas <e> <s> secondly are tests on this vaccine being tightened up in view of the very few but tragic accidents which have happened as a result of these vaccinations <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene briefly in this short debate which brings a little levity after our rather heavy discussions on more controversial legislation but which nevertheless has some serious connotation to it <e> <s> i speak first as an honorary vice-president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents and also as a member of the joint committee on statutory instruments although i was abroad on business when this particular order came up <e> <s> i do not think any of us wants to see prohibited the delightful novelties which a shop in high holborn not so very far from here used to display and which gave immense pleasure nationally and internationally but there are certain inherent dangers in some of the substances used in them <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that those of us who saw excerpts on television will have noticed that there was a ft wire fence over which these people who may well have been doubtful value to the research people and were probably not interested in it at all managed to clamber <e> <s> while there is an inquiry to take place may i ask whether my noble friend could ascertain if in the view of his department <e>", "<cs> i rise to support what the noble baroness lady robson has just said <e> <s> i well remember speaking on the reorganisation bill in this house and speaking on it in a highly critical manner <e> <s> having served until then on the house committee of

bill <e> <s> the amendment which we are discussing although it has some shortcomings is one which i hope the government will consider further because the disruptions and the disputes within the health service over both <e>", "<cs> i approach this clause with some misgivings although i think broadly speaking bearing in mind that we are living in an inflationary era nationally and internationally that the clause is necessary <e> <s> but in the last analysis it is the voluntary effort the voluntary contribution which not only raises the funds but raises the morale <e> <s> my noble friend lady macleod mentioned the leagues of hospital friends of which she is the very distinguished national chairman and i know from experience what excellent work the leagues of friends do particularly in the long-stay mental hospitals <e> <s> they provide teas for long-stay patients and parents and other relatives on sunday afternoons <e> <s> in fact my wife and i have in the past helped out in these various functions <e> <s> so i think it would be a great pity if the voluntary spirit of raising funds was lost <e> <s> at the same time as my noble friend lady macleod said very often the matron or <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> there are many wives who are first-class secretaries <e> <s> they can deal with patients who may be nervous about seeing the doctor <e> <s> the wives can give comfort help and assurance which often a receptionist no matter how qualified she may be may not have the skills to do <e> <s> she may not be as mature as the wife who may have a family of her own <e> <s> i never realised and i do not suppose many members of the committee realise until i saw this amendment that this anomaly existed <e> <s> it seems to me and i like many members of the committee have a wife who is a fully qualified secretary that such people could do an excellent job and improve substantially the quality of a doctors practice and be of enormous help <e> <s> this is one of the most vaulable amendments to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it was given a second reading in the other place in june of this year by my honourable friend the member for brecon and radnor in a very short time an even shorter time than the bill moved by my noble friend lord kinnoull <e> <s> but this in no way should be taken as suggesting that the other place did not consider the bill very carefully because it was considered mid-week at half-past ten in the morning by standing committee c which represented all the main political parties <e>", "<cs> my lords nobody could argue that this bill has not had a very good airing in your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i would not wish to detain your lordships for more than a few minutes on this second day of summer which is just about what it is <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> my lords on the committee stage my noble friend lord mottistone spoke in some detail on this amendment <e> <s> he has asked me to convey his apologies that he is not able to be present <e> <s> as one who also spoke on committee i join him in thanking the government for at least going some way towards correcting what i think was formerly something of an anomaly <e> <s> there are problems as the noble lord lord winstanley with all his experience has outlined <e> <s> i can only think that the general practitioner will be able to give a much better service to his patients particularly nervous ones or those who have a distressing complaint <e> <s> the wife of the practitioner particularly if she is medically trained in an urgent case may be able to run off a quick letter rather than waiting for further secretarial help to come along <e> <s> on those grounds i should like to thank my noble friend and her department for going a long way to bring in a valuable part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i suggest that we need also be concerned with the question of the viewer <e> <s> this is a very technical amendment and i realise i am speaking among a plethora of noble lords who have interests financial or otherwise in the television and broadcasting world <e> <s> i certainly think that there is a case for the amendment of the noble lord lord winstanley although the word production covers an extremely wide area <e> <s> are we dealing with the production of a drama or a feature programme or a variety programme or what <e> <s> i rather wonder and i throw this out as a complete greenhorn as one who has viewed television frequently but who has not served on any authority whether the person to be appointed should not be someone who has recently retired from the television scene rather than someone currently involved in programmes that undoubtedly are becoming more and more controversial <e> <s> though normally i like to see small boards or companies since we are going into something very new like other noble lords i am a little concerned as to whether three is the right number <e> <s> these people will have to investigate a large number of complaints presumably by way of statutory notice if the bbc is any guideline <e> <s> there is i believe on sunday mornings a certain programme that deals with complaints from radio listeners and i believe that there is one that deals with television complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the reply to my noble friends question will give satisfaction in the sense of the reduction in the number of persons at present held in custody but can he answer two supplementary questions if not now possibly by letter <e> <s> are there shortages of staff qualified to carry out the examinations which are making these figures still disturbingly high and if so can my noble friend comment whether there are regional shortages and if so whether the home office have any plans to counteract this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> as the mover of the bill it might be convenient to the committee if i were to make a few observations at this stage <e> <s> i have listened with great interest particularly to the speech of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby who has spoken with his usual erudition and has made some interesting comments <e> <s> first i should like to reiterate what i and others said on second reading about the constitutional proprieties or otherwise of the bill <e> <s> it is of course true that in the other place it received very little debate <e> <s> but as i pointed out on second reading it was considered in full standing committee at in the morning and not at five oclock in the morning as does happen in another place on some bills <e> <s> therefore it was quite open to anyone on that committee to give his view particularly as it was as are all standing committees in the other place so far as i am aware an all-party committee <e> <s> so i do not with respect feel that the attitude of the other place either to this bill or the bill which we discussed previously where similar observations were made is really quite germane to the question which we are considering <e>", "<cs> a person with a gun licence is normally a qualified person <e> <s> there may be reasons for tightening up on gun licences but there are severe penalties as i understand it for not having a gun licence or a firearms certificate <e> <s> so i think that that in itself would obviate that difficulty <e> <s> on the question of rifles i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will have something to add when clause is dealt with <e> <s> however there are here problems of enforcement <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> in point of fact we are on clause <e> <s> as i understand it rifles come within another amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord massereene and ferrard who is not in his place will i am sure undertake to enter into discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords we are up against a great difficulty here and i can speak with some experience as i handled a private members bill only the other day which through lack of a quorum foundered i may say that it was not nearly such a convincing bill as that of my noble friend <e> <s> but again we have this <e>", "<cs> my lords anybody who has had experience of mental hospitals and i recognise that these are special hospitals will welcome this report even though like me many have not yet had a chance of seeing it <e> <s> would my noble friend accept that the chief nursing officer at rampton and the devoted staff behind him have been sniped at in a most irresponsible way on many occasions <e> <s> in view of the dangerous job that they do this report will be most welcome <e> <s> can my noble friend comment on a report which appeared in the press that the chief nursing officer has been criticised by the prison officers association on some grounds or another which were not made clear <e> <s> in view of the very difficult task he has to perform and the generous tribute that he paid to his nursing staff is this not a very unfortunate state of affairs <e> <s> finally may i ask my noble friend whether it is not desirable that since the rampton hospital is very much the concern of local people as many local people as possible should be concerned with this inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the thanks extended to the noble and learned lord lord fraser of tullybelton for having enabled your lordships to discuss this very important subject <e> <s> it is a highly technical subject for someone who has been to the eec countries only once and who is not a member of the select committee <e> <s> however i have a small interest to declare in that i have spent most of my working life in the insurance industry though with very little experience of product liability itself and i suppose that if one is looking at the matter from the insurers point of view there can be fewer more contentious items in the field than product liability and the amount of litigation which can ensue therefrom <e>", "<cs> my lords inevitably a debate on foreign affairs on the occasion of the gracious speech has ranged far and wide and that is surely a very healthy sign in view of the tremendous national and international problems which the free world together with the world which is not so free face today <e> <s> my lords i should like to concentrate most of my remarks on an area which i do not think has been touched on so far that is the caribbean <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate on the bill of my noble friend lord nugent who is as he said the honorary president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents is a most valuable one <e> <s> i declare a completely non-pecuniary interest as one of the several honorary vice-presidents of rospa although my own main interest has always been in home safety <e> <s> but i believe that safety cannot be taken in isolation <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill rightly said safety in the factory too can rightly be considered with a motion of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that satisfactory answer and perhaps i may ask him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first will he do what he can to persuade his department to encourage more british business people to visit finland <e> <s> which is one of the few countries where we have a trade balance deficit and where enormous opportunities prevail in a very friendly country <e> <s> secondly can there not be a repetition of the very successful britain in finland year which was instigated years ago and which considerably increased our export potential <e> <s> thirdly will he do ail he can to publicise the fact that finland is one of our closest allies <e>", "<cs> my lords in the last session of parliament i was asked to promote a bill similar to the one which my noble friend lord inglewood is promoting today but largely through lack of parliamentary time and as a result of the high and responsible advice which i sought from people in the licensing profession lawyers and so on to the effect that the drafting was not entirely adequate i decided not to pursue the bill further <e>", "<cs> basically this is an amendment which is very worthwhile but there are two points which ought to be made <e> <s> one concerns subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend give the figures as to the amount of blood products imported in the last months what they are used for and whether when they arrive in this country there is the absolute minimum of delay in the checking of these samples <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady david merits the thanks of the house for enabling us to debate a most important topic especially so soon after the budget <e> <s> i should like briefly to add my own name to those who would congratulate the noble lord lord swann on his splendid maiden speech which was characteristic of a person who has given many years of service to academic life in all its spheres <e> <s> among all the academics i use that word very broadly who have taken part in the debate i must confess that i did not go to a university but did my national service instead <e> <s> however one of my children perhaps many of your lordships have this in common with me is a teacher and has been for three years at a comprehensive school in nottingham <e> <s> i have visited the school and while in ideal times much needs to be done to it structurally and in other ways it is a school of some to children and seems to function quite reasonably well <e> <s> but we are not debating today the general consensus of education although i believe this is a subject which is always admirably debated in your lordships house and it is vitally important that this should be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords for many years the noble earl lord longford has taken a very practical interest in the subject of mental health and allied causes and once again this evening we are very grateful to him for raising this extremely important question <e> <s> there have been in this debate members of your lordships house who are far more clinically and professionally connected with this problem than i but for nearly years i served on the house committee of a large mental hospital in the epsom area of surrey where as some of your lordships may know there are seven or eight of these hospitals <e> <s> i should like to say just a few words about the particular hospital in which until the reorganisation of the national health service i was concerned because i believe it has an important bearing on this question

"<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory answer <e> <s> is he aware that despite obvious political differences between our two countries relations trade-wise with romania should be enhanced at every opportunity <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether the construction industry which is suffering a down-turn at the present time was involved in these talks particularly in view of previous work in the danube basin and also the chemical industry where there is surely quite a potentiality in that particularly lovely country <e>", "<cs> my lords may i on a point of elucidation ask my noble friend whether he is aware that it comes i think from ancient rome where they had strong links <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to thank my noble friend for his courtesy in personally seeing me regarding this question <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that his answer is not very satisfactory <e> <s> is he also aware that many of our nurses who work literally hours a day in many cases come from abroad and live many miles away from their hospitals <e> <s> would he not agree that good service to patients can be improved considerably by providing decent accommodation at reasonable rental for nurses <e> <s> is he further aware that in many cases the amount of rental is ludicrously disproportionate to the quality of the accommodation <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend as soon as financial commitments allow to look into this matter very urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady elles has opened this important debate with a characteristically cogent and apposite speech <e> <s> i shall make my own brief remarks in relation to trade because as my noble friend rightly said the madrid conference itself has hardly been made very public <e> <s> what will happen as regards the future of the conference is anybodys guess <e> <s> divergent opinions which inevitably exist between countries should not always be counter-manded by trade embargoes always provided that the principles of business etiquette are observed on both sides notably in the realm of finance and delivery dates <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to revert back to amendment no <e> <s> because that was very widely discussed <e> <s> however as an honorary vice-president of rospa i strongly support the amendment which my noble friend has made to the bill <e> <s> i should like to ask my noble friend and this really relates to my noble friend lord mottistones amendment how quickly will we get a design of seat belt particularly for children which comes within the proper government regulations <e> <s> will the road research laboratory or whatever organisation it is which deals with this matter consult with the seat belt manufacturers <e> <s> it is very important having passed amendment no <e> <s> that we get as soon as possible and especially for children particularly in the front seat of cars seat belts which really are safe and which as my noble friend rightly said are also comfortable <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise in his absence to my noble friend lord belstead for the fact that due to the rearrangement of trains on british rail i may have to leave your lordships chamber before the end of this debate as i have an important business engagement in surrey tomorrow morning <e> <s> inevitably this has been a long debate it has been a contentious debate and i have been doing some arithmetic here and i have ascertained that the bill has clauses nine schedules and parts of acts to be repealed <e> <s> i join forces with those noble lords who have criticised this measure as being unduly complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that with the increasing amount of trade particularly in san francisco and los angeles and of tourism representation by one information officer in san francisco and two in los angeles is completely disproportionate compared with the representation elsewhere in america <e> <s> will he review the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence on this particular order because i have never been to antigua or still less to barbuda and i apologise for saying that that is a name that was not familar to me until fairly recently <e> <s> however i have been to other caribbean islands including st lucia barbados and jamaica <e> <s> it may well be that part of the problem here is the granting of independence to these islands many of which have relatively small populations <e> <s> i am thinking particularly of an island such as dominica with a population of about which has had considerable problems due to hurricanes and so on since this happened <e>", "<cs> i have first to apologise to the committee because i was not in my place when the debate started because of an important engagement with the commonwealth parliamentary association <e> <s> but i have listened to most of the second reading debate on this bill and also to the amendment the noble lord lord rochester has posed <e> <s> in addition i have had experience of management consultancy and of running consultancy courses <e> <s> i do hope that the government will take note of at least some of the points contained in the rather lengthy amendment which the noble lord lord rochester and his noble friends have put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords before the amendment is decided on i wonder whether i may ask my noble and learned friend one question <e> <s> as i understand it we are talking here about people who are probably on indeterminate service as opposed to diplomats and others who may be on a fixed term contract <e> <s> bearing that in mind is there any special consideration for those who are not on fixed term contract as opposed to those as mentioned in this amendment who may be abroad for several years and may have families while they are over there because even under clause i cannot quite see how they are to be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to your lordships for not being in my place when the debate on third reading started this afternoon <e> <s> a very important business engagement kept me away <e> <s> i think that the government are to be congratulated on at least endeavouring to tackle this very difficult and inevitably controversial subject of nationality <e> <s> whether they have tackled it in the right way is quite another matter <e> <s> there are members of your lordships house from all sides who can speak on that topic with far more expertise than i can <e> <s> however i am particularly worried about the effect of this bill on the commonwealth <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gridley with his customary clarity and thoughtfulness has asked a question of major importance <e> <s> however i suggest we must be very careful in these times of racial and other kinds of troubles not only in this country but internationally to measure our words very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords a controversial session of legislation is now before your lordships house but while there is much that will inevitably be politically controversial and since i entered this house in i do not know of a gracious speech which has not been <e>", "<cs> my lords a longstanding engagement at new zealand house will mean my leaving your lordships chamber almost immediately after i have spoken but i shall try my utmost to return for the final speeches <e> <s> i should like to add to the congratulations extended to my noble friend lord elton on his appointment to this important if relatively lowly office an office which i think he will fulfil with distinction <e> <s> it is certainly not going to be an easy passage for him and having been involved in a very small way with mental health legislation in your lordships house over a number of years i cannot see this bill presenting any less problems than any other bill on the same subject notably that which became the very important act which of course this bill largely consolidates <e> <s> indeed i remember that after my speech on the bill and i had been in your lordships house for only a short time i was summoned to the woolsack by the late lord kilmuir <e> <s> i wondered what transgression i had committed <e> <s> he said to me i enjoyed your speech very much but would you please speak up in future <e>", "<cs> i think the important thing about this amendment is that it is made firmly according to law in other words it must be made to stick legally <e> <s> in a number of these hospitals one has patients from overseas countries where there are no relatives and perhaps no next of kin living in this country <e> <s> therefore we are up against the difficulty that it may involve perhaps the legal friends of the hospital or somebody of that kind <e>", "<cs> presumably the patient would go straight to a very senior consultant who would have the power to order an injection of largactil or whatever the drug is if it is part of an emergency procedure <e> <s> not being a doctor like others of your lordships who are taking part in this debate i am not medically qualified but i should have thought from my own very limited experience of a committee of a mental hospital that there is a senior medical officer on call who could prescribe a suitable drug in emergency <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend would confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming these figures may i ask whether my noble friend can say what the situation is as regards the non-teaching hospitals particularly in the so-called grey areas <e> <s> is there a reduction in the waiting lists in the non-teaching hospitals that is comparable with the reduction in the teaching hospitals <e>", "<cs> like the right reverend prelate the bishop of norwich as one who is not professionally medically experienced i find myself in some difficulty over this amendment <e> <s> however i think that it is an amendment which needs considerable thought by the government <e> <s> is it not the case that if physical defects are examined and investigated early they can very often assist considerably in the mental defects of the patient concerned and particularly the young <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite wrong that all the emphasis should be on the mental defects and that the physical defects are not given the attention which they merit if in fact that is the case <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy about clause as a whole <e> <s> certainly i have not had the recent experience of being concerned with mental hospitals that many of my noble friends and other noble lords on all sides of the committee have spoken of in the past few moments <e> <s> however i wonder whether i might ask my noble friend what consultation there has been with the mental hospitals themselves and with the area health authorities about the setting up of this commission <e> <s> as my noble friend lady faithfull said there is no reference in the white paper to this commission <e> <s> i wonder whether the area health authorities are not the right people to deal with these cases <e> <s> if we set up this commission it is going to cost a fairly substantial amount of money <e> <s> these people as it states in clause will have to be paid and i make no complaint about that because it seems to me that they are going to carry a very large burden of work <e>", "<cs> my lords in support of the figures which my noble friend has given will he undertake to try to ensure that the children who are still in these large institutions will be as far as possible put into villa-type care where the wards concerned can be made to look far more cheerful and suitable for children than can the large institution <e>", "<cs> my lords we must bear in mind that we are dealing with very highly disturbed patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is a very important amendment particularly in regard to areas where there is a concentration of these hospitals because many of these patients have become separated from their families particularly those who may not have been born in this country but who have come here to settle <e> <s> their families may be in their country of origin and when they are released they have no close relatives to whom to go <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord winstanley with his extensive medical knowledge always commands the greatest respect from those of us who are laymen but who nevertheless have had experience of sitting on committees of hospitals and particularly mental hospitals <e> <s> i wonder however whether the amendment is not rather sweeping <e> <s> as i understand it it would give the patient the sole right of decision as to whether he should have treatment <e> <s> those of us who are laymen are obviously under a difficulty here in deciding how competent a detained patient is when it comes to a decision of that kind <e> <s> while accepting the principle behind the amendment that as much freedom as possible should be given to the patient i wonder whether this is perhaps not going a little too far <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that advice but nevertheless i wonder whether it might not be better if the amendment were agreed to for a voluntary worker or some other such worker who knows the patient to have an interview or discussion with the patient first before any final decision is taken on what is a very important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment very strongly particularly because since the reorganisation of the health service community health councils which do a very good job have replaced the hospital management committees <e> <s> those committees were much smaller bodies and it was then easier for voluntary organisations to play a large part <e> <s> so this amendment is now more essential than ever particularly in the case of the long-stay patients who may not have living relatives or anybody else close to them to care for their needs <e> <s> whichever the voluntary bodies may be whether it is the league of friends or other organisations they can play an enormous part in the welfare and probably the therapeutic welfare of these patients <e> <s> this is a most important amendment and it should be accepted by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords in the years that i have been a member of your lordships house i do not think that there has been a more important or far-reaching bill than this one with the possible exception of the act on which i made one of my first speeches <e> <s> what we have to remember is that the vast majority of patients detained in these hospitals are there through no fault of their own <e> <s> it is therefore incumbent upon parliament to do all that it can for their welfare <e> <s> this has been very largely done in the course of the passage of this bill which i believe has substantially improved on the act <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mcnair not only on initiating this very important discussion but on his most interesting and informative speech <e> <s> new zealand has been mentioned <e> <s> my wife and i spent a month in the north island of new zealand in on an official visit <e> <s> it did not involve anything to do with pitcairn island but had we then known about it we should certainly have made further inquiries <e> <s> i am also a member of the new zealand society and i hope that the society reads this debate or i shall see that they do with the very greatest of interest since quite clearly new zealand must have a considerable interest in this island <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lora hunter of newington has received a large number of accolades today and by any standards the noble lord has certainly earned them <e> <s> this has been a marathon debate but i think an extremely valuable one <e> <s> i suppose that since i have taken part in about eight or nine debates in your lordships house on the national health service <e> <s> some years ago i initiated one myself <e> <s> this has been the longest but i believe the most productive and at the end of an almost wagnerian-type opera it is almost time for wotans farewell so to speak before the front bench reincarnate themselves if that is the way to put it <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill which we are discussing today is both very important and highly unusual <e> <s> as i see it it is the first time that we have an old commonwealth country virtually being given at least a very large degree of independence <e> <s> i must confess that i myself have never been to canada <e> <s> however i have been to a number of other parts of the commonwealth and i am a very dedicated member of the commonwealth parliamentary association which brings me into touch with a number of canadians <e> <s> i know new zealand quite well <e> <s> there are certain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that last september i went to finland and spent an afternoon at wartsil shipyard <e> <s> is my noble friend further aware that this is a very efficient shipyard both in management and in union matters <e> <s> would my noble friend accept that the tendering for this particular vessel could surely lead to a reciprocal arrangement <e> <s> and would he convey to his right honourable friend the desirability of a british team of shipbuilders visiting wartsil to see what progress they have made there and <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that our honorary consuls in many countries particularly in america and scandinavia do a first-class job <e> <s> on that basis would he convey the congratulations of the house to his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend and relative lord henley for his clear exposition of this bill <e> <s> i should state that am not a horse rider or at least i have not been since <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the figures he has given are very encouraging so far as they go but is he further aware that in the long stay mental hospitals particularly in the grey areas there is still an acute shortage of trained and student nurses <e> <s> what plans have the government to try to put this situation right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his helpful reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he is aware that there are many overseas nurses working in our national health service whose home literally is a nurses home <e> <s> will he bear that in mind in the context of this question <e> <s> may i further ask him whether in the case of nurses who live out there can be some arrangement for rent allowance or some other allowance bearing in mind the quite proper severance on nurses pay at the present time to give them at least some help in the present very difficult conditions in which nurses live <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for enabling a subject of the utmost social importance to be discussed this afternoon <e> <s> on one thing there will be broad agreement in this house and elsewhere and that is that the amount of unemployment in this country has reached an unacceptable total <e> <s> the main question is as to how all this problem is going to be resolved <e> <s> whether or not the admirable youth task group report will be able in itself to contribute to a reduction of this social evil on any scale remains to be seen when one bears in mind that unemployment today has grave international implications <e>", "<cs> my lords while accepting that the offer to the nurses within the pay code policy is a reasonably generous one may i ask whether my noble friend does not accept that the increased rents increased laundry charges and increases in other charges too have largely swallowed up the pay increases <e> <s> will he bear that point in mind <e>", "<cs> i think that we are in somewhat of a difficulty here because i believe that a very important matter has been omitted from subsection and that is prison workshops where mattresses postbags and all kinds of things are being made where one gets sacks and other materials <e> <s> the ventilation in these places particularly in the summer can be quite appalling <e> <s> i take the point of my noble friend lady trumpington <e> <s> it will obviously take a great deal of time and rebuilding to bring these older establishments up to the standards which the amendment i believe quite reasonably requires <e> <s> but i wonder whether my noble friend can say that in our newer prisons such as long lartin <e>", "<cs> and as my noble friend says the six to be built every facility will be given for standards of the kind envisaged in the amendment of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> this applies not only to the prisoners themselves but to the prison officers and others who have the custody and the training of prisoners <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend not agree that with the growth of tourism not only in the more popular countries such as spain and portugal but in the efta countries such as iceland it is very desirable for her majestys government to liaise with the governments of these countries to see whether some equitable arrangements along similar lines can be made <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that this would boost our own exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene with some trepidation not being a member of the legal profession <e> <s> i seem to recall that in scottish law or days is often awarded by the sheriff court for an offence like poaching salmon which is always a far more serious offence in scotland than in england <e> <s> in the courts-martial system or days detention is awarded and so far as i am aware i speak as a complete layman here among some very distinguished lawyers that does not have a very deleterious effect on the defendant <e> <s> having examined the amendment i hope the government will look at it again whatever period of time is imposed be it in weeks months or days there must be certain difficulties with any of them because days imposed for short sentences would appear to result in a provision of greater clarity <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> but is he aware that for the past months or so i have had a no day named motion on the order paper and this is a kind of hors-doeuvre in the hopes of a fuller debate in the future <e> <s> may i ask my noble friend two supplementary questions first could he comment on the relationships and discussions between the various tourist boards and the hotel industry particularly in development areas and does he think there is sufficient rapport here <e> <s> secondly with regard to the hotel and catering industries training board can my noble friend say what advice is being given to school-leavers and others as to the advantages of the catering and hotel industry in this country and they are many bearing in mind that british cookery and catering is very often second to none <e>", "<cs> my lords serious as the situation is in the teaching hospitals would my noble friend not agree that in the non-teaching hospitals particularly in rural areas the situation is still more critical <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend to pay special attention to these hospitals where there is often a shortage of staff in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords like a number of noble lords who have spoken in this debate i am an honorary vice-president of the royal society for the prevention <e>", "<cs> my lords although this is a very important question directed towards a relatively narrow point and has been asked by my noble friend lady macleod with her usual sensitivity and compassion this particular very disturbing question raises wider issues although i do not propose to go into that situation this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords the gracious speech envisages some very important legislation in what could be the penultimate session of this parliament <e> <s> the legislation itself is in some cases far-reaching <e> <s> certainly the legislation regarding relations between the police and the community is of great importance <e> <s> so i believe is the legislation envisaged on the youth training scheme <e> <s> i comment on this particular item of legislation because we do not know what form it is to take but much will surely depend on the jobs available on what we can sell and as a result where we can send apprentices and those who are to learn <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse the tribute paid to the right reverend prelate the bishop of bath and wells on his most distinguished and moving maiden speech <e> <s> last summer my wife and i had the great honour of attending evensong at his beautiful cathedral an area where as the right reverend prelate said this problem may not be quite so acute as it is say miles from your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord orr-ewing not only on enabling us to have this very important debate but on using his own considerable technological experience in introducing it in such a lucid manner <e> <s> i also wish to pay tribute to the three excellent maiden speakers <e> <s> in some ways we are this afternoon and this evening

take part has the whole house in his debt for initiating such a very important and timely debate <e> <s> the speech which we have just heard from the noble lord lord hunter of newington has covered some very interesting medical aspects of the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i crave the tolerance of your lordships for indulging in two debates today <e> <s> i believe this to be a very important debate and i should like to add to the congratulations already extended to the noble lord lord polwarth who over the years has done so much for the arts <e> <s> the insurance companies have been

short debate <e> <s> though my noble friends may not agree with all of his conclusions that does not in any way <e>", "<cs> asked her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very wide-ranging debate it has almost generated into a defence debate and it is none the worse for that <e> <s> but i think we must be very careful in how far we exceed the powers of the advertising standards authority <e> <s> i have been reading through their book which contains very stringent controls on advertising and particularly on products <e> <s> we are concerned with the motion of the

presentation of <e>", "<cs> my lords two excellent maiden speeches and the most stimulating speech of the noble lord lord marsh who opened the debate have turned this into a very thought-provoking session <e> <s> i join other noble lords and noble baronesses in my love of trains <e> <s> my mind goes back to the journeys from euston to kingussie in inverness-shire or from euston to sterling

thirdly is there any chance of more hospitals being able to treat this condition which if it is treated in its early stages can often i understand be completely cured <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one further question <e> <s> he mentioned that further hospital facilities are being provided <e> <s> it was very good to hear that but can my noble friend say whether any improvement is foreseen in the outlying areas of the country <e> <s> i am thinking of the north of scotland and north wales for example <e>", "<cs> my lords there is just one point about these regulations in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister say what guidance if any is given by local or area officers of health to schools on this matter since this is a very unpleasant illness and to what effect <e>", "<cs> i live in an area of surrey in which there are a number of organisations for the disabled some of which are to say the least quite unsuitable for housing those who are residing there <e> <s> i mean no disrespect to the organisations themselves which are doing their very best <e> <s> my noble friends amendment could go a long way to offsetting this <e> <s> i can

hunter of newington with his considerable medical expertise for raising this very important debate this evening <e> <s> i should like to preface the few remarks which i have to make with a tribute to mr albert spanswick whose tragic death was recorded yesterday <e> <s> it so happened that he and my wife sat on the same magistrates bench and although his views and mine and those of many of my noble friends will be considerably at variance i believe the contribution which mr spanswick made to cohse and to the health service in general should be put on public record <e> <s> i believe that the health service will be the poorer for his passing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend the

between the sports council and these leisure centres bearing in mind the large grants which private funds are making into leisure centres sports and the arts generally <e> <s> finally has he any news of the eec development fund in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly since few of us have had a chance of seeing this report it would be inopportune to ask too many questions at this stage <e> <s>

noble friend lord peyton of yeovil for enabling us to discuss a most important subject <e> <s> airports are always a matter of top interest <e> <s> one of the worries at present is the verbal or written battle taking place between the chairmen of two of our major airlines which has to some extent clouded the issue as to what really matters about our airports <e>", "<cs> althought it has become apparent that i am no friend of the bill i believe that the amendment is on the whole a sound one <e> <s> i address the committee as one who has had no practical experience in local government

lordships know in the precincts of london bridge station and other stations one finds hawkers who are peddling video tapes and other things <e> <s> let us suppose that there are tapes of an indecent nature being peddled and a crowd gathers around the person selling them <e> <s> there is surely likely to be an obstruction particularly during the rush-hour with people getting to the station <e> <s> therefore the clause in the bill would as i see it enable the police to make an arrest where something which is indecent is being sold be it video tapes or any other object <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can comment on this <e> <s> i realise that this is a very legalistic aspect of the bill but i can see some validity here <e>", "<cs> as this is a very important part of the bill i wonder whether my noble friend the minister could answer two brief questions <e> <s> first if a child has his or her fingerprints taken can the parents or the guardians insist upon being present at that time <e> <s> secondly i wonder whether my noble friend can say <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously without a sight of the white paper it is difficult to comment very much on this statement

people particularly those who live in areas where channel cannot always be received <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i

only three years in which to absorb some formidable details and i wonder whether my noble friend if not now at a later date can inform me and if necessary the house which departments will be involved

lordships house this afternoon and this evening <e> <s> i refer to the proposals in the gracious speech to deregulate the cinematograph industry <e> <s> british films have earned a great deal of finance in the export market and i think that these measures of course we can judge them only when we see the bill concerned will give a great deal of incentive to our film producers technicians and actors and hopefully will mean that some of our cinemas which have been closed will be reopened and possibily that new ones will be opened <e> <s> these are measures to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords i must be one of the very few members of your lordships house taking part in this debate who is not a farmer <e> <s> my only experience of farming was during the school holidays during the war

interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that answer which is satisfactory as

progress on the villa system as opposed to the long institutionalised wards <e> <s> can he also say what provision is being made for elderly geriatric patients who will spend most of their lives in these establishments <e> <s> can he finally say what provision is being made for employment particularly through industrial workshops in regard to these hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very welcome statement but a rather complicated one <e> <s> i realise that the matter is going to be debated in the near future but i wonder whether i may ask my noble friend the minister one question <e> <s> bearing in mind that presumably many of the residents of these establishments will need medical attention i should like to ask my noble friend whether there will be qualified medical staff to deal with any conditions such as hypothermia which may arise <e> <s> what qualifications will be needed by those who will presumably be needed for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment moved by my noble friend and i shall do so briefly because it was discussed very fully at the <e>", "<cs> the committee is being asked to consider an interesting amendment but one which raises a number of problems <e> <s> we are asked to agree that the device we do not know what the device is should be supplied free of charge <e> <s> will it be supplied by the local water authority

people will some benefit from a free supply and possibly reduced water rates while others do not <e> <s> i believe there is a danger here of discrimination <e> <s> while there is originality in the amendment i believe that the enforcement of it will present enormous problems for local authorities and certain water undertakings <e>", "<cs> i should like to associate myself with the amendment which the noble baroness lady masham has moved and with the comments by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> there is always the danger of frivolous complaints being made at times <e> <s> one accepts this it happens in all walks of life in the services or in the health service or anywhere else <e> <s> but there should be a definitely laid down procedure here and in the bill as i read it the procedure is not convincing enough <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the number of tourists visiting both this country and america can my noble friend say whether our embassy in washington and the american embassy in this country are communicating about the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the tributes paid to the noble lord lord parry for the characteristically erudite speech with which he opened this very important debate <e> <s> i have had lying fallow on the order paper for about three years a debate on the hotel and tourist industry

my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that informative answer to my question <e> <s> is he aware that several years ago i went to czechoslovakia under the auspices of the inter-parliamentary union with several noble and honourable friends from the other place <e> <s> during that time <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend the minister inform the house whether the rural areas have higher waiting lists than the urban areas and also whether there are bigger waiting lists for conditions such as hernia than for the more acute cases <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord shepherd has made a very powerful case for this amendment <e> <s> it is not often that i find myself in agreement with the noble lord but i will explain briefly to your lordships why i do so on this occasion <e> <s> i have no interest to declare in that part of the world of a financial nature but i have seen the system in operation and can vouch for its undoubted success particularly in how it copes with the disabled <e> <s> in an area such as tyne and wear this is an especially important aspect <e> <s> six to seven thousand persons with varying disabilities travel each day on this network <e>", "<cs> my lords although the noble lord lord mellish is not in his place i should like to associate myself with the congratulations which have been expressed to him on his notable maiden speech <e> <s> i do so for one particular reason that is i happen to be an associate director of a company situated in rotherhithe and i have seen it grow considerably over the few years in which the noble lord lord mellish who once so admirably represented that part of london in the other place has been responsible for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is much to commend in this statement <e> <s> is he aware that there is an urgent need for some kind of tax relief for provincial repertory theatres and those who are benefactors towards them <e> <s> is he aware that many west end productions begin at small repertory theatres such as one in surrey of which i am a former trustee <e> <s> will he encourage the treasury or whoever it may concern to treat this as a matter of extreme urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite an achievement in these days of political strife that we have a bill which has broadly speaking united just about all political parties at least in your lordships house <e> <s> i join unreservedly in the welcome to this bill <e> <s> as with all legislation there must be some reservations and i am sure that we shall have a useful committee stage where we can vent these views <e>", "<cs> there is nothing worse than legislation which contains long and irrelevant <e>", "<cs> it is common ground i think that we all want to see qualified people carrying out these experiments whether it is the giving of anaesthetics or anything else <e> <s> i think there are existing provisions in the bill which ensure this <e> <s> clause b says <e>", "<cs> on second reading i drew attention to clause concerning the granting of personal licences at the age of <e> <s> since then i have had consultations with both the chemical and the pharmaceutical industries and have been considerably reassured <e> <s> but i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can indicate briefly or if it will take time will write to me some of the experiments which a person of the age of can carry out <e> <s> i am still not clear from the bill what supervision will be required <e>", "<cs> i am much obliged to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> for my part he has completely reassured me <e>", "<cs> since is the minimum age at which project licences can be granted presumably the number of children to which this amendment would apply is very limited <e> <s> if you are going to get youngsters into this industry it is necessary that they should start as young as is reasonably possible <e> <s> provided that they are not called upon to undertake work that is outside their calibre it seems to me that secondary schoolchildren and i come into contact with many of them as some of your lordships do should if they are suitable be given the experience of at least seeing how such experiments are carried out <e> <s> they could then gain some idea about how the pharmaceutical and chemical industries and other industries that need to undertake animal experiments do so so that when they become qualified or are able to help in such experiments they will have been able to see for themselves what the atmosphere in an industry is like <e>", "<cs> is it or is it not the case that some companies specialise in a certain product for a certain condition be it arthritis blood cancer cystic fibrosis or whatever <e> <s> i presume that the purport of the amendment is to prevent project licences being issued to companies when a dozen or so companies may be doing research into the same condition <e> <s> but there are surely some companies which specialise in a certain condition and carry out research into certain conditions be it arthritis or whatever <e> <s> certainly if that was the case i should consider this amendment to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i think that the committee will have followed with much interest the very pertinent words of the noble earl lord halsbury but i wonder whether we are in danger of getting words mixed up <e> <s> is there a difference between beauty and cosmetics <e> <s> my understanding is that tests for cosmetics also include tests on things like toothpaste and shampoo and after all dental caries particularly among young people is still a very serious complaint and so is alopecia <e>", "<cs> i believe that clause largely meets the purport of this amendment <e> <s> in any case it is my understanding that fewer animals are being used now than were used say years ago <e> <s> i should have thought that leaving aside the guidelines clause which certainly covers cats dogs and primates which are the most emotive concern of this bill and quite rightly so would solve the problem <e>", "<cs> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord melchett certainly deserves study <e> <s> i wonder whether my noble friend the minister can tell the committee how many of these animals are wild animals as defined in the amendment as opposed to those which are bred and kept in this country <e> <s> i assume that it is mainly monkeys that are referred to <e> <s> i visited an establishment recently where monkeys are bred and kept for the purpose of research as i mentioned on second reading <e> <s> with two honourable friends from the other place i visited the cages where these animals are kept <e> <s> i can only say to the committee that the standards of hygiene and comfort were very high indeed <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that any major pharmaceutical company operates a -hour service around the clock including christmas day and at holiday time and that there is normally either a duty veterinary officer or somebody who is an acknowledged expert on animal welfare available at all times <e> <s> we are of course talking about registered pharmaceutical companies <e> <s> i should be very surprised and of course it will be for my noble friend the minister to confirm this if there were not some qualified person available day and night to deal with these matters <e> <s> it is important to raise this point but as one who has visited a number of pharmaceutical companies and who has served on hospital committees and so on i should be very surprised if what i have said were not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister

experiments there would then be much substance in this amendment <e> <s> my noble friend the minister will confirm or deny whether the number of live animals being used in experiments is on the decrease <e> <s> i do not know whether he has any figures available <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was discussed in committee <e> <s> it has quite reasonably been brought back at this stage <e>

different from our own <e> <s> on a recent visit to a pharmaceutical company with two honourable friends from another place this was one of the questions that we put to those who were showing us around <e> <s> in fact this company has -hour surveillance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add to the tributes expressed to the noble baroness the minister on the report itself which i have not seen because it has only just been published <e> <s> will the noble baroness accept that those who watched last nights world in action programme and particularly those of us who are concerned with long-stay hospitals will have been very disturbed by much of what was contained in the programme <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a welcome and very necessary bill <e> <s> any bill which updates an act going back as far as is extremely welcome <e> <s> it is an achievement of your lordships house that this bill has passed through all its stages without any major dissension <e> <s> we all look forward to the day if it ever comes when experiments on animals become <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble viscount lord hanworth for having tabled this interesting motion <e> <s> it is a very wide-ranging motion particularly for a short debate and the cure for the problem which the motion sets out is clearly much more difficult for any government to undertake than the diagnosis which is often the case in medical science particularly for what is frequently the simplest of ills <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that this is a very vicious disease can my noble friend the minister say whether she has any figures of the national incidence of this complaint <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> does he not accept that worker participation in share ownership is becoming more and more important these days <e> <s> will he encourage this particular shipyard which is very important to follow that line of thought and will he encourage generally industries of this kind to go in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords this is one of the most important debates that this house has had for a long time <e> <s> it is a great pity that it comes in the form of an unstarred question because it puts my noble friend the minister who is dedicated to her department and to the national health service in the difficult position of having had a number of questions and brickbats thrown at her <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be much indebted to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for enabling us to discuss this important matter <e> <s> as my noble friend lord mancroft said in his speech which was as usual most erudite we all receive a multiplicity of appeals for well-meaning charities <e> <s> that brings one to the question of whether there may not be too many registered charities <e> <s> i instance two aspects <e> <s> one is mental health in which i have a particular interest and the other is cancer research <e> <s> i want to make it quite clear that i believe those involved in the charities even in the multiplicity of appeals are dedicated people <e> <s> but such multiplicity makes the work of the charity commissioners much harder <e> <s> it also makes it much more difficult for the general public be it individuals or corporate bodies who receive the appeals to make up their minds as to where to subscribe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that helpful answer <e> <s> will she not agree whether she has seen the programme or not that the bbc is to be congratulated on producing a programme with real nurses and real doctors taking part <e> <s> does she also agree that the programmes will be an enormous reassurance to those who have to enter hospital for an operation

she aware that in this programme there was a nursing sister who gave enormous reassurance to an old lady recovering from a corneal graft <e> <s> does not that plus the very heavy pressure on the junior doctors make the results of the next review body a most vital occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the original question may i ask my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords has my noble friend taken note of the part played by invisible exports particularly in insurance and banking <e> <s> has he any figures as to how they are contributing within the terms of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that we import a large number of fashion goods of excellent quality from the nordic countries and scandinavia can my noble friend say that incentives are given to exporters to export in particular to countries such as finland where we can export fashion goods of as good a quality if not better than these we import from such countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate myself with the tributes that have been paid to my noble friend lord campbell of croy not only for initiating this debate in his usual very convincing manner but for the timing of it because the tourist season is now just about upon us <e>", "<cs> although this is a wide-ranging amendment i believe that there is much merit in it <e> <s> the three most important parts of the amendment are diet hygiene and accident prevention <e> <s> i believe that those subjects are more important than what we were discussing recently political education <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very welcome statement <e> <s> however as my noble friend has said we have not yet had an opportunity of studying the consultative document <e> <s> i should like to put to her two questions <e>

new doctor <e> <s> this is sometimes quite a problem especially in rural areas <e> <s> does the report contain any fresh information concerning this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this bill has accomplished one important achievement <e> <s> it has virtually united the pharmaceutical industry the chemical industry and all the industries concerned with the manufacture of many of the products to be used under the bill with many of the animal welfare societies <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby my noble friend the minister and my honourable friend the member for putney have had much to do with this happy situation <e> <s> at a time when there is much legislation which is extremely controversial it is an achievement of both houses of parliament to get on the statute book a piece of legislation which really is important <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it we are concerned here with imports of food <e> <s> can my noble friend the minister say whether other imports from the soviet union such as toys and other items which could be subject to radiation are included <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is very much indebted to the noble lord lord henderson of brompton not only for initiating this debate but also for the very cogent way in which he has presented this very important subject it is a subject of which parliament should always take account because disablement despite the progress of medicine will always be with us be it congenital be it at source or be it already established <e>", "<cs> i approach this as one who has never been a member of a trade unon but like most of your lordships i have done a certain amount of flying <e> <s> the pilots members of balpa particularly have enormous responsibilities <e> <s> i should like to

within half a mile of an intersection in surrey consider that road safety is much more important than increasing the traffic on the motorway <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the enormous improvement in the standards of british catering <e> <s> is he also aware that i recently visited a yts scheme in peterborough and saw some of the youngsters in training for the catering industry <e> <s> can my noble friend give an assurance that everything will be done not only through the restaurateurs but also through the catering colleges and through hotels themselves to promote more employment for british cooks in particular <e>", "<cs> my noble friend the minister has given a generally very informative reply to this amendment but i wonder whether she can qualify paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that commendably brief answer <e> <s> i

was in your lordships house and took part during the passage of the medicines act as it now is <e> <s> my understanding of the medicines act is that it was brought in to ensure that pharmaceutical

obvious objection that your lordships house is not an elected chamber and that therefore complaints going to the commissioner could come from a body of people who are not in any way elected <e> <s> it

surely an important legal problem crops up <e>", "<cs> as i see it the amendment applies mainly to the record industry <e> <s> as i said on second reading i have no interest to declare except that i am a collector of records as opposed to tapes <e> <s> it seems to me that what the committee has to decide is whether the record industry is being hit through home taping <e> <s> one has only to go to a record shop in ones lunch hour to see how many people still buy records cassettes and compact discs <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this is a welcome statement in many ways <e> <s> without attempting to turn to nurses pay which is one of the focal points of the national health service and is the subject of a future pay review may i ask him in relation to the major projects

the noble earls very encouraging answers can be say what amount is being diverted to paediatric care in particular in great ormond street hospital where perhaps my noble friend and others saw the recent television programme there is a great deal of concern especially by the local regional health authority <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will be grateful to the noble lord lord kilmarnock

on prescription <e> <s> is the drug in question not one which should be discouraged in any case <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his rather disappointing reply to this amendment <e> <s>

consider whether i should table something else at the next stage of the bill <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say what provision is being made in areas where there is a concentration of local mental hospitals <e> <s> i instance epsom near where i live and i declare my interest as the president of the friends of one such hospital <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that enormous attempts are being made to integrate some of their patients but that there are funding difficulties <e> <s> can he say whether any special provision is being made for these areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very informative reply <e> <s> i declare a non-financial interest in that i am a long-standing member of the anglo-finnish parliamentary

friend to hold a trade fair there to increase exports even further <e>", "<cs> my lords although the hour is late the house will be very grateful to the noble lord lord parry for raising what is a

association <e> <s> needless to say it is the other anzac country to which i have more affiliations <e> <s> i hope that the city bearing my name will one day be able to mount an exhibition of this kind <e>", "<cs> having as i do family in the hotel and public house trade i agree that the amendments contain implication which give rise to some concern for family life <e> <s> after all sunday is a family day and sunday lunch in the home is desirable <e> <s> however one thing that the amendments seek to do is to maintain standards in public houses which have improved so much over the years <e>",

and i shall be brief <e> <s> for years i have commuted from my home in surrey to one of three of londons stations on the southern region <e> <s> therefore i have encountered some of the problems envisaged in this admirable bill which i believe will have general support throughout the country <e> <s> however i am concerned about several aspects most of which have been dealt with by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> the first concerns the rush hour <e> <s> there are a number of small suburban stations in surrey hampshire and sussex where the population has expanded but where the area around the ticket office is still small <e> <s> in the area machines would be far from easy to install and there always exists the problem of a machine breaking down <e> <s> those noble lords who use the london underground know that the ticket machines break down and that during the rush hour it is often difficult to summon the man in the ticket office to regain the coin <e> <s> even in this age of high technology there always exists the danger of the machines breaking down and that is a real problem during the rush hour <e> <s> i believe that the select committee must look into that matter most carefully before the bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords as for years i have been resident in the diocese of guildford i hope it will be in order for me to add to the congratulations given to the right reverend prelate the bishop of guildford on his very compassionate and impressive maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister make any comment about the present position of pinewood studios <e> <s> it has produced some of the finest british films of all time <e> <s> it now appears to be largely american-orientated <e> <s> are there any moves afoot to encourage british film makers to make in particular educational films in these admirable studios <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask what guidance has been given to the regional health authorities in respect of patients in hospitals with regard to advice on carrying donor cards in return for the admirable treatment which the national health service gives to patients from all communities <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the tributes that have already been paid to the noble lord lord hunter of newington who by no means for the first time has enabled your lordships to debate an extremely important matter <e> <s> reports on the national health service as such there have been many are much less complicated at least to my brain than this report from a committee which was chaired by sir donald acheson <e> <s> nevertheless i think we should all pay tribute to him for enabling the first report on public health for many years to be available <e> <s> according to my researches there is certainly no shortage of evidence

regarding tuvalu <e> <s> is there any increase in the aid being given to tuvalu at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in the thanks accorded to the noble lord lord molloy for initiating this debate <e> <s> although we have had in past months a number of debates on the national health service in both this house and in another place the national health service is a matter

a signatory to the amendment i shall detain the committee for a short time only as the committee has now spent minutes on the amendment <e> <s> it is of course a vital amendment to the bill <e> <s>

parliament have six major bills to discuss of which this is one <e> <s> i believe that it is incumbent on the committee at least to consider the amendment carefully <e> <s> it has been said that it offers no alternative to what the government are producing <e> <s> in the manifesto the vaguest possible words were used a fairer community charge but nothing has been properly laid out as to what that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to declare my interest as a non-executive vice president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents <e> <s> has the minister any evidence of unguarded electric fires and old-fashioned oil heaters which i believe are illegal anyway being in evidence in such properties <e> <s> if so have any recommendations been made concerning them at inquests into such tragedies <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever defects this bill may have at least it has one thing in its favour it is mercifully brief <e> <s> according to my reckoning it has only clauses and two schedules unlike some other major and controversial bills in this session <e> <s> with the advance of modern technology the dhss and an ever-expanding national health service are almost in a no-win situation <e> <s> to that extent i have a great deal of sympathy for the minister and his department because obviously the most controversial part of this bill concerns the optical and dental charges <e> <s> having thought this out very carefully i do not necessarily criticise these charges <e>", "<cs> we have had the education reform bill as well <e> <s> we are living in times when there is insufficient consultation with those who have the duty to implement the legislation <e> <s> ministers and civil servants have a very important part to play but ultimately it is the

patient response to the many questions put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name down to speak in this debate <e> <s> i am a longstanding honorary vice-president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents <e> <s> i support the bill wholeheartedly <e> <s> my wife and i have six grandchildren and our two daughters are fanatical supporters of rear seat belts

place when the noble lord moved the amendment in committee and i apologise to the house for having just now missed the first few moments of his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords having supported the noble lord lord wallace in his amendment on report i too wish to thank my noble friend the minister for having brought forward this amendment which goes a long way towards encouraging the leagues of friends

will take on board the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the government will give serious thought to the amendment moved by my noble friend lord caldecote and supported by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> medical research is becoming more and more important in the country <e> <s> although the pharmaceutical industry with which i have no financial connection is often slated by governments because of the enormous profits it makes much of the research which the industry carries out is responsible for the decrease in death from childhood cancers and other illnesses <e> <s> i believe that the amendment will encourage more medical research <e> <s> it is right that the government should give it very serious thought in view of the amount of valuable research carried out these days <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be obliged to my noble friend lord renwick for having given a very cogent and comprehensive presentation on the second reading of this important bill <e> <s> i do not intend at this fairly late hour and with very important business to follow to go into the details of the bill <e> <s> i take part in this second reading first because i am a former master of a livery company and secondly because i have spent all my working life within the city of london <e> <s> therefore i am naturally interested in any legislation which the city of london promotes <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be obliged to my noble friend lord brougham and vaux <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble lord lord mcgregor of durris for having enabled this subject to be debated at a tragically opportune time <e> <s> i must declare that i am not a newspaper journalist or a proprietor and nor do i intend to write my memoirs <e> <s> i approach the debate purely as a consumer of newspapers both national and regional <e> <s> in fact i believe that the regional and local newspapers in this country set a very high standard <e> <s> very often the news coming from fort william or fowey is of more interest or even sometimes better presented than some of the news which is presented in our national newspapers <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble earl lord russell and to my noble friend the minister for intervening in this debate at a late hour <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of the tourist industry in this country and the need to encourage conferences can my noble friend the minister say how much help has been given to women who wish to set up hotels particularly small ones in view of the fact that many such hotels are now run extremely successfully by women managers or deputy managers <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many british studios are at present producing british films <e> <s> does he not agree that british films have an important export potential <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt my noble friend is aware that the additional million is extremely welcome but can he say whether the district general hospitals will receive a reasonable share as well as the teaching hospitals <e> <s> is he aware that at the moment the district general hospitals have many difficulties with funding <e>", "<cs> my lords although there are no diplomatic relations between taiwan and this country is my noble friend the minister aware that there is a taiwan trade centre in the west end <e> <s> is it possible for her majestys government to make representations through that source <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that partially satisfactory answer <e> <s> however is she aware that as an opera lover and a one-time chorister i visit the english national opera as a consumer from time to time <e> <s> is she also aware that some people attend the english national opera each year and that it is a british opera company with british singers <e> <s> is she further aware of the remarks made by her right honourable friend the minister for the arts to mr palumbo the new chairman of the arts council that the english national opera is one of the countrys artistic flagships <e> <s> can the minister say whether the government intend to stand by those remarks practically <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the white paper is set out admirably and clearly and for the most part is an admirable document on the complete reorganisation of the national health service <e> <s> however is he also aware that there is some concern about the timetable for implementing the white paper proposals particularly as they concern the hospital service <e> <s> will he given his attention to that aspect of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to speak briefly as a member of the all-party parliamentary chemical industries group <e> <s> the record of the pesticides industry and its allied organisations is a good one <e> <s> what slightly worries some people about the bill are the powers given to the government <e> <s> it is surely possible for the industry itself to set up a task force to generate the data required by the government and be self-regulatory as opposed to the government doing the job <e> <s> that would decrease the amount of time required <e> <s> any organisation which failed to provide the data would not be exempted from the levy <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend the minister will look sympathetically at the amendment <e> <s> those of us who have seen this accommodation and i must confess i have seen it only on the television screen will be aware of the problems faced by those who run such hotels and boarding houses <e> <s> anyone who has had experience in the hotel industry i have family involved in the hotel and catering industry although not necessarily the type about which we are talking is aware of the problems of running these establishments and being able to provide adequate accommodation feeding and so on <e> <s> i therefore believe that subsection of the amendment is especially vital <e>", "<cs> my lords there are many members of your lordships house and another place who have worked with the deaf the blind and the severely handicapped over many years both on hospital committees as i have done and therapeutically <e> <s> i do not propose to go into the constitutional argument here except to say in fairness that the other place has accepted at least in part although perhaps not to the extent that many of us would like a considerable number of amendments from your lordships house <e> <s> i speak with years of experience in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend and to the house for that freudian slip <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend and kinsman for that very helpful answer <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house would wish to congratulate him on his ministerial elevation <e> <s> is he aware of the very moving television programme shown about six months ago on this splendid place <e> <s> arising from that can he say what consultations there have been as a result of the ministerial visits to budapest <e> <s> have there been reciprocal visits from hungarian ministers and paediatricians <e> <s> will encouragement be given to paediatricians from this country to visit hungary and vice versa <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in the debate on the amendment with some diffidence because the house will have listened to the noble lord lord mccarthy with his considerable experience of these matters with great interest <e> <s> i declare two interests first as an honorary vice-president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents and secondly as a non-executive director of a small civil engineering and construction company <e> <s> i should point out to the house that the views i express are entirely personal <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend accept that for years i have travelled from my home in surrey through clapham junction station at least times a week <e> <s> cynical as it may seem is he aware that many people believe that it is a miracle that this is the first time such a major accident has occurred in the area <e> <s> will he also accept that it is due largely to the skill of the railway workers even though the report which i have not had an opportunity to see makes obviously justifiable criticisms which we must debate at a later date <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend have any figures as to the comparison between teaching hospitals and the district general hospitals where junior doctors are sometimes working quite exceptionally long hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend and kinsman for that answer which is partly satisfactory <e> <s> will he accept that there is general agreement that there has been improvement in the upgrading of casualty departments <e> <s> further is he aware that at weekends there are real problems both of accommodation for the staff and for patients waiting for treatment particularly in regard to road accidents altercations and other such serious problems <e> <s> can he also say where additional staff particularly doctors have to be brought in on a short-term or long-term basis that regional health authorities will not be penalised and that extra funds will be available <e> <s> does not the minister accept that by doing that a more efficient service will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords food is something that is consumed by all of us from the cradle to the grave and this is therefore a bill of the utmost importance <e> <s> i shall not go into the protection side of it because frankly not being a scientist i do not understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for not being present at the opening of his speech due to a board meeting which i had a longstanding commitment to attend <e> <s> i have already apologised to him personally <e> <s> however i shall read his speech as i am sure will all noble lords with the very greatest of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the government on the figures for new hospital building <e> <s> can the minister give an indication particularly for district hospitals in the country areas of expenditure on extensions to present hospitals <e> <s> these are important in areas of new towns anti where the population is growing <e>", "<cs> i believe that the committee has some difficulty here <e> <s> first amendment no <e> <s> seeks to insert the adverb knowingly <e> <s> it is unusual to say the least that a manufacturer would knowingly implant in food something injurious to health <e> <s> we have heard of supermarkets where something has been maliciously inserted glass implanted into baby food is an extreme case <e> <s> i do not know whether that is the target of the amendment <e>", "<cs> if these amendments especially those put forward by the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley were accepted i venture to suggest to the committee that enforcement would be extremely difficult <e> <s> some noble lords may have watched the most interesting television series which is shown on tuesday evenings called food and drink <e> <s> one recent programme dealt with additives in confectionery <e> <s> like many noble lords i am quite partial to certain kinds of confectionery since i am a non-smoker <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that while many people are critical of some aspects of the nhs under all governments a record amount of money is now being put into it and that more doctors and nurses are being recruited <e> <s> while i and others are critical of some aspects of the nhs recruitment must be considered in context <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give figures showing the extent of tuberculosis in this country in comparison with similar countries <e>", "<cs> my lords in declaring my interest as a non-executive director of a small construction and civil engineering company may i urge my noble friend to make representations that the announcement is made soon <e> <s> is he aware that the industry needs many young people to keep our very fine construction industry going <e> <s> when the reconstitution takes place will the youth training scheme play an important part <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view this amendment is rather like the curates egg <e> <s> i think it is true to say that it is to some extent well meaning but it is much too widely drawn <e> <s> for example what are food authorities <e> <s> do they represent the catering industry or the manufacturing industry <e> <s> moreover the cost of what is proposed would be phenomenal <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that helpful and informative answer <e> <s> is he aware that i am the vice-president of new zealand in britain <e> <s> that committee includes at least a dozen very distinguished members of your lordships house including i believe at least two former prime ministers <e> <s> arising from that is my noble friend aware that the commonwealth games in a city not unknown to me were a great success <e> <s> following the celebrations of th march can my noble friend say what plans there are to increase trade with the commonwealth particularly in agricultural products <e> <s> while the european community is very vital does he agree that the commonwealth also has a very important part to play in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords two subjects have been debated in your lordships house on frequent occasions over the past decade or so <e> <s> one is the national health service and the other is transport <e> <s> i do not believe that your lordships house need make any apologies for that because they are both vital subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin my observations with an apology on two counts <e> <s> i shall not be able to remain to the end of this debate partly through constraints on travel to the home counties and partly because i returned only last sunday having spent eight days in new zealand as a guest of the new zealand branch of the commonwealth parliamentary association <e> <s> that meant fulfilling engagements from the bay of islands to christchurch which involved some hours of flying time <e>", "<cs> i intervene in the debate with some diffidence because i have served only on a house committee and as president of a league of friends <e> <s> although i support the principle behind this amendment i can see enormous difficulties in its implementation <e> <s> i live in the mole valley which is a conservative area at the present time anyway <e> <s> where the late and lamented gentleman the member for ebbw vale who initiated the national health service lived there is a very strong labour catchment area <e> <s> in two such areas how is one to obtain suitable political appointments <e> <s> that is my first point <e>", "<cs> i believe that there needs to be a distinction in this amendment between urban authorities and rural authorities <e> <s> in a large conurbation although i have never served on a local authority i should have thought that it is much harder to appoint suitable people with the time to serve on those authorities than it is in rural communities where local authorities and the local hospitals and the cottage hospitals may be much closer <e> <s> i should be happier if the amendment was a little more flexible <e> <s> i believe half is too large a figure but having said that i believe every encouragement should be given for nominees from local authorities to become involved on these committees particularly in rural areas <e> <s> there is need for more flexibility so far as the amendment is concerned <e>", "<cs> the amendment is tabled in the names of distinguished scientists and doctors <e> <s> however it may be for the convenience of the committee if someone from the second tier who is merely a member of this chamber intervenes at this stage <e> <s> i believe that this amendment is of fundamental importance <e> <s> of course we must avoid overloading these committees with too many people <e> <s> but it is surely the case that research and i development is the absolute crux of the health service <e> <s> without it doctors and nurses cannot function and for those reasons i hope that notwithstanding what happens tomorrow in the select committee the government will give the most serious consideration to the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is particular concern regarding the amendment in areas such as epsom and st albans where there are a number of long-stay hospitals for mental patients and some uncertainty as to the future of those hospitals <e> <s> in this area successive governments have done a great deal about community care for those who are discharged into the community <e> <s> with her experience the noble baroness lady masham quite rightly said that there is often a lack of services when people can be employed for example in industrial therapy <e>", "<cs> it may well be an assumption of any government of any political party faced with an enormous reorganisation such as this in relation to the national health service that it is taken for granted that certain services are to be provided under legislation <e> <s> we are told by the government and i think it is fair comment that not all of this bill is coming into force in april <e> <s> it is to be a phased bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with others in thanking the noble lord lord hacking for introducing this very important question in his usual very persuasive manner <e> <s> i am one of the few members of your lordships house taking part in this debate who is not a doctor or a scientist has no interest to declare in the pharmaceutical industry and has not been a minister shadow or of substance <e> <s> however my family for many generations had a great interest in the medical industry <e>", "<cs> i have general sympathy for the amendment moved by the noble lord lord walton <e> <s> my view is that paragraph b is more relevant than paragraph a <e> <s> how many people read leaflets whether in a doctors surgery in this chamber or anywhere else <e> <s> i believe that there is far more chance <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in the debate more in sorrow than in anger <e> <s> i apologise to my noble friend the minister for intervening late in the day but i was not sure what the parliamentary timetable would be <e> <s> i have no direct financial or any other interest in the westminster hospital but i am aware as are most noble lords of patients who have been there <e> <s> over the years i have known various nurses nursing sisters and doctors who worked there <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot but agree wholeheartedly with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i have recently travelled in the nordic countries australia and new zealand <e> <s> is my noble friend the minister aware that those countries have a far smaller population than this country but our nursing recruitment is much better per capita than that in those countries which have a nursing shortage particularly in rural areas <e> <s> is she further aware that as regards exploitation <e>", "<cs> my lords although my family symbol represents the kiwi rather than the koala bear i give this bill a very warm welcome <e> <s> we are very much obliged to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his very clear exposition of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have visited a number of pharmaceutical installations and quite apart from its safety record the pharmaceutical industry does a great deal for this countrys exports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little concerned about the amendment <e> <s> any reorganisation of the health service or any other body will obviously need evaluation <e> <s> as has been said many times it is the first reorganisation of the national health service in years <e> <s> but i am worried at the burden that it will put on those who have to undertake the evaluation every year <e> <s> i am not sure about the exact length of time of the evaluations or whether it will vary <e> <s> but i should have thought that a triennial review would be much better <e> <s> it would allow the matter to proceed more smoothly <e>", "<cs> my lords anyone who has close family and friends working therapeutically within the health service is clearly very concerned about the implications of the amendment <e> <s> i seem to recall that the problem of junior doctors working hours has been continuing for some years <e> <s> it is not a new matter <e> <s> similarly those of us who do not work therapeutically in the health service are equally bothered about how the situation will be resolved <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter put his finger on the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady masham of ilton has addressed your lordships on many occasions <e> <s> however i submit that she has seldom raised a more important matter <e> <s> i am an honorary vice-president of the royal society for the prevention of accidents although i have not consulted it about the bill <e> <s> i rode during the war years but not successfully and have not ridden since <e> <s> my eldest daughter rode for a number of years before having a family <e> <s> she has not ridden since but was then a good rider and always wore headgear <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that commendably brief answer <e> <s> is he aware that i was invited to meet the prime minister of fiji during his recent visit to this country and that he is particularly anxious that the excellent relations between great britain and fiji should continue <e> <s> can my noble friend say what is being done to promote more trade between britain and fiji <e> <s> what is the situation as regards sugar and the interchange of students and technical personnel such as engineers <e>", "<cs> my lords i oppose this amendment <e> <s> i do so not for quite the same reasons as those of the noble baroness lady blackstone although i have considerable sympathy with the views she expressed <e> <s> i have listened to every word of the debate <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that i do not propose to revert to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i approach the issue from the point of view of practicalities <e> <s> i have spent a lifetime in the insurance industry for which we have an ombudsman indeed the previous ombudsman was a great personal friend of mine <e> <s> the insurance industry is needed by everyone we all have to carry insurance <e> <s> there is a genuine need to have such a person available to deal with complaints <e>", "<cs> my lords i have rather more sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> than i have with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i say that in the face of speeches made by the noble lord lord rea who is a distinguished general practitioner and my noble friend lord colwyn who is a distinguished dentist <e> <s> some of us have experience of children and grandchildren who naturally like sweet foods <e> <s> incidentally there is no real definition in the amendment of the term sweetened foods <e> <s> i hope i may dare mention mars bars which many of us eat including myself <e> <s> i presume they come into the category of sweetened foods <e> <s> i personally would like to see the television authorities pay more attention to the advertising of toothpaste and toothbrushes <e> <s> however i think this measure is taking the matter a little too far <e> <s> one could of course always make the point that at say five oclock or six oclock in the afternoon children should be concentrating on their homework rather than watching television even though there are some good childrens programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is deeply indebted to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow not only for initiating this debate but for a most impressive speech <e> <s> where are our priorities <e> <s> we have had debate after debate on the european community and i have no quarrel with that <e> <s> it is
