["<cs> my lords it is with some trepidation that i address your lordships house today <e> <s> last saturday i was presenting prizes at gresham school in norfolk <e> <s> i cannot remove from my mind the words spoken by the head boy a young master kemp <e> <s> in a short but witty speech he chose to give advice about maiden speeches <e> <s> his advice to the assembled company was this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the question has been posed tonight by my noble friend lord mersey because i want to address the relationship between central and local government that has been much touched upon in the debate so far <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that instead of asking the government to give advice to boroughs such as merton and others which are involved in this practice the time has come for us to rally behind the governments reforms which do away with the need for them to advise local authorities and which strengthen the accountability to the people whom the local authorities serve <e> <s> it should be for the people to pass judgment on the local authorities and not for us to sit here in this house and ask the government to give advice <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to start my remarks by saying that it is an understatement that the bill has taken so long coming <e> <s> with the intervention of the statement it has taken an even longer time <e> <s> it has taken a long time to set out a framework for a statutory body to manage the norfolk and suffolk broads and i for one welcome its arrival in this house for a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to congratulate my noble friend lord belstead and offer him the warmest possible wishes for a successful tour of duty <e> <s> i am also strongly in support of the bill and am a staunch supporter of local government <e> <s> i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> if the noble lord is saying that those people are threatened but is claiming that they are doing the best possible job and if we are saying that the right of the local authority to determine the level of services is not to be impeded by the bill then those people will not be threatened by the bill <e> <s> the local authority has the right to determine the level of service <e> <s> if those people are providing it they will win the contract <e>", "<cs> this amendment is no more than a licence for prevarication <e> <s> there is no doubt in my mind that what is being asked for is an opportunity to use this time not for getting a better service but to thwart and prevaricate <e> <s> for those authorities which are both philosophically and politically opposed to the idea of opening their services to more competition it gives a greater opportunity to delay what we believe ought to be brought about <e>", "<cs> of course it is the governments intention to make sure that all local authority services are subject to competition but what is important is the requirement on local authorities to make sure that the defined level of service is open to tender <e> <s> it may well he and i am sure will be the case in many local authorities that direct labour will get the work <e> <s> if that direct labour is not competent efficient or effective both in terms of the cost and the operation of the service the work may well go to the private sector <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord lord dean of beswick a question <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill as proposed that does not allow a local authority to determine services for its people <e> <s> therefore if it has a view that it should subsidise <e>", "<cs> in fact the noble lord misquoted me <e> <s> i did not say that local authorities would have the power to determine charging policy <e> <s> i said that the local authority would have the power to determine its degree of subsidy which is a very different matter <e>", "<cs> i am prompted by the way in which that particular amendment was put forward to pose one question <e> <s> who or what steps into the breach when direct labour downs tools <e> <s> for example it may shut off the heating fail to provide school meals lock up the school gates so the children cannot actually come into school <e> <s> what arrangements are to be made then and what recourse do parents have in that situation <e>", "<cs> i rise to endorse the comments of my noble friend lord trafford and also to say that it is not my intention in any way to deprecate the work of direct labour organisations <e> <s> i believe that direct labour will win much of the work across the country <e> <s> i think it is important to put on record that the tenor of the amendments before the committee today implies at least to me that noble lords opposite believe that the public sector has the monopoly of good service <e>", "<cs> i have no vested interest in terms of whether the work remains with local authorities or goes to private contractors <e> <s> the responsibility of local authorities is to ensure that services are well provided at a cost that can be afforded and at a standard predetermined by the local authority itself <e> <s> we should not fear that <e> <s> the best local authorities should not fear that and the worst should be worried and rightly so <e>", "<cs> i think the similarity between this amendment and the previous one is only in so far as these vehicles are about preventing accidents or making life safer for people who move about on our roads <e> <s> where the similarity ends is in the complexity of the vehicles <e> <s> almost every speaker on the previous amendment concentrated on two things the complexity and the history of the vehicles and the necessity for them to be absolutely on the dot for responding to an emergency <e>", "<cs> i too think it is a responsibility of this chamber to be concerned about the unemployed but i share the view of my noble friends on this side of the committee that the amendment is not a solution to that concern <e> <s> nothing in the bill as it is presently drafted invalidates the work going on in sheffield as described by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> the co-ordination work done by local authorities with local commerce and industry will continue <e> <s> if one couples with that all the work on the training front one sees that a great deal is being done to help those who are unemployed and without skills to gain the necessary skills to compete favourably for the vacancies <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to believe that virtue is all on the side of local authorities <e> <s> the industrial relations between a local authority and its workforce are of course a prime responsibility of the local authority <e> <s> i am not so sure that i agree that local authorities should use their precious time and resources in taking a detailed interest in the relationship between the management and workforce of either their potential contractors or even their actual contractors <e> <s> their responsibility is to ensure that they get the best possible service as prescribed by the local authority in the form of the specification for the contractor to see and that it is delivered to the standards that the local authority has predetermined <e>", "<cs> could the minister tell me or ascertain for me how many local authorities that manage direct labour forces belong to professional associations <e>", "<cs> with respect that really was not my question <e> <s> i understand that people who obtain professional qualifications belong to their professional associations <e> <s> we have been talking all evening about plumbers bricklayers house builders and the workforce <e> <s> i simply wish to know how many local authorities that employ people on that level of the workforce employ people who belong to the associations that have been mentioned throughout the debate <e> <s> in othe words if we were on the other side as contractors seeking the employment of local authority workers would we be secure in the knowledge that all local authorities employed as members of their workforce at all levels and not just <e>", "<cs> i hope that this is my last word on this issue but we have suddenly moved from plumbers electricians and bricklayers to chief architects surveyors and the rest <e> <s> i am talking about people who do work on behalf of the people of this country <e> <s> whether that work is done in local authorities on behalf of the public or in private companies on behalf of the public i am simply questioning the present practice of local authorities and comparing that with what we are about to impose on private companies <e>", "<cs> i rise as a woman to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i oppose it because i do not think it furthers the cause of women <e> <s> i oppose it also on <e>", "<cs> as a representative in local government i am finding this debate rather interesting <e> <s> if the government had built into the bill the premise that local authorities on the grounds of race of discrimination in favour of women and of the disabled would have to go through the process of sending out questionnaires considering responses asking for written submissions to substantiate evidence and then considering those i believe that those people who say that local authorities can do all this do not need the resources have all the manpower they need and are doing it now would scream from the rooftops about more resources more personnel and the fact that local authorities are already working to their capacity in all areas <e> <s> we are talking about a whole new raft of duties and responsibilities <e>", "<cs> no that is not what i am saying <e> <s> i am saying that at the moment the case is being made that there is a great deal of capacity in local government to take on the extra work <e> <s> i believe that members opposite are the same members who will argue strongly the other way to say that local government does not have the capacity for extra work <e>", "<cs> i am reminded of something that was often said to me as a young girl dont you people have homes to go to <e> <s> in the light of the hour i am going to be very brief <e>", "<cs> i believe that the committee is in danger of assuming that the appointees from for example the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission are the only people on the newly appointed broads authority with conservation interests <e> <s> when i first became involved with the bill i was particularly impressed with the interests of norfolk county council as regards the problems set out by the noble lord <e> <s> it was concerned about the loss of wildlife and it was particularly concerned about the state of the broads <e> <s> because of that it initiated the former bill and that is why it is anxious to see this bill through <e> <s> rather than being concerned specifically with the nature conservancy council or the countryside commission we should be concerned about the conservation of the broads <e> <s> when the bill passes through this house we must make sure that the issue of conservation is well and truly recognised in this document <e>", "<cs> it is with great trepidation that i rise possibly to counter a most respected friend my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> however may i first say that there is no difference between any of us in the committee about the importance of protecting this beautiful area of our land <e> <s> conservation is a very real issue <e>", "<cs> i said boating but i used the word loosely because the two people who will represent the great yarmouth port and haven commissioners will not necessarily be concerned only with boating <e> <s> the condition of the waters too is a factor <e> <s> again that is an aspect which has deteriorated over the years and about which there needs to be a management plan and a management concern <e> <s> therefore i simply say that there are two specifically with water interests and port and haven interests and three with conservation interests <e>", "<cs> i rise to mention one point <e> <s> i believe that by re-hybridising the bill the real risk is that we shall lose it altogether <e> <s> the chances of the bill coming back through parliament again are slim indeed certainly in the foreseeable future <e> <s> i should like given that all things in the end are compromise to plead with the noble baroness not to press her amendment <e> <s> i was sympathetic at the beginning because i hoped that outside the bill a form of words could be found that would give people the impression that conservation was at least a real objective of the government in passing the bill <e> <s> but i understand that once a bill is enacted what counts is what is inside it and not what is outside it <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> earlier in the debate it was said that laws were made because of the authorities or individuals who abuse <e> <s> if one were to think of the worst kind of example of that to which the noble lord was referring it is using great works of art not as such but to promote homosexuality <e> <s> in other words the works of art are the focal point of the teaching or the influencing and i include young people <e> <s> it does not include great plays which incidentally contain homosexual people or descriptions of homosexual acts <e> <s> there are great works of art which are there to be enjoyed and there is no intention on the part of the bill or on the part of those who support clause to prohibit that from continuing <e> <s> however we have heard today of examples of some individuals within the educational system or some local authorities who would specifically use selected parts of the works of art to exploit promote and further the cause of homosexuality <e> <s> that is what is to be outlawed by the bill and not the works of art themselves <e>", "<cs> with respect i would advocate that my children and anyone elses children should continue throughout the future years to study the beautiful pieces of literature the shakespeare sonnet <e> <s> i would absolutely and violently disagree where somebody uses the sonnets to advocate and promote homosexuality <e> <s> that is not how i expect them to be used or taught <e> <s> it is in the hands of the person influencing somebody else <e>", "<cs> it is true that our briefcases are lined with correspondence on the subject <e> <s> it is also true i listened to members of the committee as they exchanged notes on who had heard from whom and about what that that correspondence has come from a relatively small percentage of the community and almost entirely from homosexuals with some exceptions <e>", "<cs> perhaps members of the committee on the opposite side of the chamber have had more correspondence from people asking to support the bill than those of us who have received correspondence urging us to oppose it <e> <s> the bulk of my correspondence has been in terms of please support clause <e> <s> however i believe that members of the committee have all received the same letters from the same people <e> <s> very few letters have come in saying please do what you can to make sure that clause stays in the bill <e>", "<cs> i am saying that if the people putting on the play have the intention and purpose to promote homosexuality then i believe that the motive is questionable <e> <s> if the motive is simply to present a play to the public and no more than that schools or theatre companies may be producing a whole season of plays then there is no danger <e> <s> the motive for putting on the play in the first place is the matter at issue <e>", "<cs> many of my letters actually start with the phrase i am a homosexual <e> <s> perhaps i have had a different set of correspondents <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that all the problems outlined by most of the speakers this evening are very real <e> <s> what we have to discuss tonight is whether the licence be it the continuation of the licence at its present rate or putting it up to or will sweep away all those problems <e> <s> it is my view that it will never sweep them away <e> <s> we shall still see cruelty to dogs sadly which is a punishable offence anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that almost daily we have indignant criticism from noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments have been described as giving the secretary of state powers to listen <e> <s> i suggest that he may be listening for a very long time and local authorities may be talking for a very long time <e> <s> the phrasing suggested in the complicated document the matrix that was referred to by the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey is to bring about an ordered implementation of these proposals <e> <s> therefore no local authority in the country is required to do more than put out one of the suggested headings to competitive tendering in the course of a little over a year from now <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that that is the case <e> <s> i think we have to consider the jobs which are to be done and make sure that the mechanisms are there to see that the jobs are done whether that is an emergency or whether it is not <e> <s> certainly our statutory obligations must be addressed <e>", "<cs> i was not suggesting that the noble lord was telling untruths <e> <s> i was suggesting that he has misinterpreted the legislation and the effect it will have <e> <s> as regards his competence in local government he has been the local councillor for a number of members of my own family <e> <s> i know of his competence in the local authority on the isle of wight <e> <s> i meant to cast no aspersions whatsoever on that competence <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to ask a question before the minister replies <e> <s> is there any reason at all why for example the statutory requirements upon an authority should not be built into a catering contract <e> <s> it should be a requirement of putting contracts out to tender <e> <s> i would welcome the reply of the minister <e> <s> in passing i cannot resist saying how much i welcome the response of sheffield and other local authorities mentioned by the noble lord which are now taking such an interest in emergency planning <e> <s> it is something of a turn-up for the books <e>", "<cs> my lords some of us on this side are sympathetic towards the amendment <e> <s> but the noble lord lord dean of beswick is making it rather difficult for us to remain sympathetic <e> <s> there was a pretty wild interpretation of what is envisaged by the clause that it is wished to amend <e> <s> i do not believe there is any suggestion i certainly should not support it of securicor making a kind of panda car trip round the schools <e> <s> that is certainly not what the noble lord read from <e>", "<cs> my lords it still says nothing about people making security trips round primary schools when the children are not there <e> <s> what the minister i believe was saying when he replied on the previous occasion is that technically there is no reason why the job of a caretaker who also does cleaning in precisely that form should not be managed by somebody else <e> <s> it is a matter of who employs that person to do precisely that job properly prescribed <e> <s> what is absolutely essential is that the management and accountability line between the person who is responsible for security and responsible for cleaning the school should go to the head of that school <e> <s> that is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely certain that that was a particularly pleasant remark <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the remark made by the noble lord was anything other than insulting to a member of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate is turning into a discussion about whether there is discrimination against women <e> <s> indeed there was a debate earlier today about whether there is discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords the one thing that is probably more responsible than anything else for bringing local authorities into disrepute is their tendency nowadays to discuss national and international issues <e> <s> i believe that local authorities should be organisations which provide local services for local people <e> <s> in so doing they are guardians of other peoples money not their own but other peoples money <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he permit me to ask a question <e> <s> does he agree that heterosexism awareness courses or anti heterosexism training are a good use of ratepayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords it seeks to suggest that one lifestyle is desirable over another <e> <s> anti heterosexism is certainly promoting lesbian or gay existences <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i want to echo the comments of the noble viscount <e> <s> there are some of us call it prejudice if you like who feel serious disquiet at the description of two females in a sexual relationship bringing up a small child <e> <s> clearly there is considerable support required for that child in the circumstances in which it finds itself and there are particular difficulties for the teacher in handling that situation <e> <s> i should be seriously concerned if it were being advocated that such was any kind of a normal relationship and a desirable family relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for subsection of the bill as it stands seems to me to be perfectly explicit <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some diffidence and rather nervously to make a point which i suspect will make me unpopular in what has been a one-sided debate thus far <e> <s> i do so for this reason <e> <s> i have every sympathy with all the points that <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that a review is considering some of the problems already addressed this afternoon and the funding of the health service <e> <s> is it not also true that it is a poor use of your lordships time to discuss in isolation a very emotional case without the background knowledge of how the millions that are going to the manchester area health authority are being spent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend lady cox for posing what i believe is a very <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not attacking that gentleman i was attacking some of the things that he advocated <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may put a point to him <e> <s> he questioned the efficacy of teaching re to unreceptive children <e> <s> on that basis we would not teach maths and probably would not even send our children to school <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> does he not agree that while no governing body of any school was able to support the policy of positive images a way round that has been found by funding with ratepayers money organisations such as the reading matters bookshop which does all the promotion that the positive images policy would have done within the local authority <e>", "<cs> i rise to give the amendment the strongest possible support <e> <s> i am surprised that it is even contentious because it seems to me that it is in the interests of all those people voting whatever way they vote that the result should be truly reflected <e> <s> i suspect that we shall be challenged before the end of the debate on the amendment as to whether irregularities can be proved or whether it is necessary to pursue the question of irregularities in recent elections <e> <s> i believe there is disquiet in the minds of the public and certainly in the minds of some voting members of the unions <e> <s> therefore we must have a vested interest in seeing that not only should this operation be done properly but that it should be seen to be done properly <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted before the minister replies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply but it was rather short and i had hoped that he would be a little more forthcoming <e> <s> is the minister aware that this organisation and a sister organisation operating from the same address purport to be improving the education of the public in haringey and north london generally but that in practice it is a vehicle for producing propaganda subversive literature promoting homosexuality supporting positive images is a cover for troops out of ireland and produces literature such as this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to the question <e> <s> i have asked one question and am in the throes of asking my second <e> <s> will my noble friend the minister agree that this is the best possible justification for the local government bill that has recently passed through your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend the minister aware that although reading matters bookshop is not a charitable organisation the other organisation is indeed receiving money from reading matters bookshop which is directly funded by haringey council <e> <s> therefore both directly and indirectly ratepayers money is being used to propagate such literature <e> <s> if the bill is intended to deal with censoring that kind of literature then it has my full support <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to todays debate and to the debates during the whole of the bills passage through the house <e> <s> there is no doubt about the strength of feeling shown in this house and in the other place <e> <s> i was encouraged to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that has just been made <e> <s> first i believe that if we include the amendment there will be a tendency to believe that we have done our bit by the disabled <e> <s> anything that detracts from the review will be inadvisable <e> <s> secondly there is almost nothing in the amendment that cannot now be done by local authorities <e> <s> it has been said again and again in the debate by the noble lord lord campbell of croy the noble baroness lady lane-fox and by the disabled that all the things that we would desire of the amendment can now happen <e> <s> local authorities can ask such questions of the private sector <e> <s> another worry is that they will ask them of only those companies with whom they have direct dealings <e> <s> there is a raft of companies outside that will be caught by the review <e> <s> there should be momentum from national government as opposed to individual local authorities a very small minority of whom may use the provision for the wrong reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first public opportunity i have had this afternoon to stand up and make an apology to the house for having done something which almost marks my anniversary in this chamber <e> <s> i made the mistake of walking through the wrong lobby on an amendment earlier on <e> <s> the significance of that is that the amendment in question was amendment no <e> <s> which as i understand it succeeded with a majority of only three <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of that <e> <s> however what i am saying is that there is a perception abroad that all is not well <e> <s> therefore to have this exercise overseen will surely do away with any such suspicions about what may happen in those circumstances <e> <s> it is only right that there should be proper scrutiny from the start of the exercise right up until the finish <e> <s> in that way any doubts that people may have will be swept away <e>", "<cs> my lords my concern is not only that the exercise should be done properly but that it should be seen to be done properly <e> <s> the amendment is about seeing that it is performed properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> it would seem that since i first put down my question it has been overtaken by events <e> <s> however i am reminded of the survey in <e>", "<cs> my lords as the th speaker out of a total of about it will be very difficult to say anything original <e> <s> i was tempted to scratch from the list of speakers but i understood that if i did there would be a lemming-like activity and we should all have a day off tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that interruption but i am referring to approximately speakers who have been fairly derogatory in their comments about the secretary of state and the consultation process <e> <s> as a parent of children in the state system i do not remember mrs shirley williams engaging in a long consultation process when as secretary of state she dramatically changed from a dual system to a comprehensive system <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> there are two issues at stake this afternoon <e> <s> we have those members of the committee who want no prescription and who say that if there is to be any prescription it should be confined to the three core subjects english maths and science <e> <s> the other issue and this is the genuine concern of the category of members of the committee to which i belong is about flexibility <e> <s> at second reading i joined with the noble lord lord joseph on this issue <e> <s> there are those of us who are concerned about a degree of flexibility in the application of these proposals especially at the top end of the secondary schools and in particular for the less academic child <e>", "<cs> i take the point about prescription <e> <s> i had intended to mention it <e> <s> there is no doubt that there will be a high degree of prescription for the three core subjects <e> <s> there will of course be a degree of prescription for technology history geography and so forth <e> <s> there will be much less prescription for music art pe and religious education <e> <s> each time the degree of prescription is lowered more flexibility is allowed <e> <s> that taken with the time in school that is not taken up by the core curriculum i am convinced at least at this stage will ensure that there will be enough time in the week to <e>", "<cs> perhaps before the right reverend prelate sits down i may ask a question and make an appeal <e> <s> he has set great store by the standing advisory council for education advisory committees at local level continuing with the agreed syllabus leaving the responsibility to them <e> <s> unless an amendment comes back to the house which inserts the word christianity somewhere on the face of the bill many of us will find it very difficult to support it <e> <s> the requirement as the bill stands and as the religious education requirement stands is that the agreed syllabuses can be drawn up <e> <s> there is no requirement whatever for teaching christianity at all <e> <s> many of us are concerned not so much with the mechanisms for drawing up a syllabus but with the content <e> <s> that is the appeal that i wish to make to the right reverend prelate <e> <s> i hope that he will come back with an answer <e>", "<cs> one of the difficulties is that there have been so many pleas to have subjects included in the list of foundation subjects <e> <s> those we have had so far are health and physical development family life and parenthood economic awareness social and civic responsibilities in a multi-racial society environment world citizenship first aid and accident prevention home economics life skills social cultural and sex education <e> <s> a serious difficulty arises if we consider any of those as foundation subjects in isolation with one being mutually exclusive of another <e>", "<cs> there is a great deal of emotion over the subject of testing <e> <s> listening to the debate it seems there is a belief that somehow or other because the bill requires that children should be tested four times in a school lifetime almost nothing else should happen in the form of testing finding out how a child is performing or even finding out where the childs strengths and weaknesses are <e> <s> summative testing as it is known in the jargon and diagnostic testing are not mutually exclusive <e> <s> diagnostic testing is not something which starts when the child is seven <e> <s> it is something which has happened a number of times before the child is seven indeed it continues throughout the educational life of a child <e> <s> a teacher is always trying to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the child so that the strengths can be built on the weaknesses can be dealt with and the programmes of study modified accordingly <e>", "<cs> returning to the debate on the first day in committee i seem to recall references being made to a degree of prescription that it would be very much more detailed for the core subjects and for four foundation subjects geography history technology and a language and much less prescriptive for the remaining subjects of music art and pe <e> <s> we are talking about degree of prescription <e> <s> the bill is talking about the powers of the secretary of state to set up committees to determine programmes and targets to be achieved <e> <s> therefore the degree of prescription would fall within that <e>", "<cs> the committee has so far established that there shall be a national curriculum and that there shall be testing to define objectives <e> <s> it seems perfectly appropriate now that we put upon the secretary of states department the powers to determine the programmes of study which shall be more or less prescriptive according to subject <e> <s> i think it has been mentioned that the core will receive the greatest detail <e> <s> it may just be that the additional word core in the first part of subsection might make <e>", "<cs> i speak against the amendment <e> <s> unless i misunderstood the noble lord lord dormand of easington he was suggesting a form of representation on the councils <e> <s> i set aside for the moment the argument about numbers <e> <s> i wish to speak about how the teachers find themselves on the committee and the idea that they should in some way be representative of the bodies to which they belong the nut the amma the pat and so on <e>", "<cs> in the light of what has been said i do not believe that i have misunderstood the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i wish to say that there is a significant difference between the system as it is at the moment and the system proposed in the bill <e> <s> the difference is that local authorities at the moment do have the power to restrict admissions to schools <e> <s> they have the power to agree admission limits to schools <e> <s> i can give the committee a very real example of a school in cambridgeshire which has had up to two forms of entry restricted in order to prop up another school which is failing to attract pupils <e>", "<cs> much has been said about cambridgeshire which i found quite interesting as one who was there when the full-blooded pilot scheme was sent on its way <e> <s> i should like to make some reference back to the fact that it has taken since for the cambridgeshire scheme to be refined <e> <s> i must say to the committee that those of us who in had tried a very limited scheme for local financial management became most frustrated <e> <s> that was not out of our own sense of frustration but from picking up the sense of frustration of those schools which were operating a very limited scheme <e> <s> they were asking why is it that we cant have more delegated powers and responsibility for our budgets <e>", "<cs> i am arguing that we need to get all our schools into the scheme because people will never get over the fear of the unknown <e> <s> it is only when schools are in the scheme and are responsible for their budgets that they will realise the positive advantages of the scheme <e> <s> i am referring to some of those consequences <e>", "<cs> my only reply to that point is that i believe that the freedom to adapt individual schools to the national curriculum will be greatly enhanced by their having power over their own budgets <e>", "<cs> i should like to add to that particular point by saying that whatever the level of resources may be one can be sure that they will be better used at school level than they will be at local authority level <e>", "<cs> in my view this amendment applies mainly to secondary schools in terms of the type of flexibility which a secondary school will have <e> <s> i believe that the amendment if passed would put an unnecessary restriction upon secondary schools <e> <s> most decisions about allocation of resources in schools that have their own budgets are taken by a finance committee either a sub-committee of the main governing body or possibly the whole governing body <e> <s> on the committee sit representatives of the staff the head teacher the parent governors and the governors of the school <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to join my noble friends lord beloff and lady young and defend not the indefensible but i believe the defensible <e> <s> much has been made about the objectives of this bill and i think that the reference made by at least one member of the committee was that the objective was that all our schools or as many as possible of them should contract out <e>", "<cs> i am speaking precisely to the amendment <e> <s> i am speaking about the effect of a minority of parents initiating the process for opting out <e> <s> i am also talking about the majority who have been referred to many times in this debate <e> <s> i am simply saying that if the majority show such a degree of apathy that they do not take part in that vote that also says something about the school <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will not be minded to accept this amendment <e> <s> there seems to be a compromise here judging from some of the remarks that have been made by noble lords opposite <e> <s> they were asking are parents the right people to be judges of education <e> <s> i happen to believe they are <e> <s> i also happen to believe that parents have a value as governors of schools immediately their children have left <e> <s> there is a period and it would not be more than a maximum of three years beyond when a parent could be a governor of a school <e>", "<cs> i can give the direct example of myself <e> <s> my children left school last year <e> <s> if i had been a parent governor rather than an lea governor i believe that my contribution to the school this year when my children are not at the school and perhaps up to a maximum of three years could be really valuable <e> <s> i had a child go all the way through the school <e> <s> i believe that if i had the backing of the body of parents who had voted me into office <e>", "<cs> a maximum of three years which would be appropriate in this case <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> the parent when elected would have to be a parent of a child in school for that first election <e> <s> but if their child happened to leave school during that time i believe they could continue to be a valuable asset to the governing body <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall be forgiven for being suspicious and for pressing this point <e> <s> the reason is that there has been the most incredible reluctance to accept predominantly christian when it comes to religious education in school even given all the accommodation for other religion in our schools that has been built into the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support much of what the noble lord lord somers said but also to take the matter a little further <e> <s> however tempting this particular amendment i hope that the government will find it possible to resist it <e> <s> i believe that it will limit musical tuition in schools and not extend it <e> <s> in my mind there is no question but that we should protect music within the curriculum and that any music that is taught should be free from a charging policy <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that this bill will allow more choice to parents and to pupils <e>", "<cs> i want to support the amendment brought forward by the minister but i am concerned about the possibility of a technical loophole for <e>", "<cs> i am interested in the interpretation put on clause by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding because if that interpretation is right i should certainly wish to support it <e> <s> however i am minded to agree with at least the question mark raised by my noble friend lord renton because as i understand it an individual who has sole residence on a particular day and who is receiving care or treatment is exempt and the means <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl lord russell has ever served in a local authority <e> <s> i am a member of a local authority <e> <s> i welcome the idea of being more accountable to the local electorate <e> <s> the first port of call for that accountability is the cost of services <e> <s> i suspect that where the cost of services impacts on an individual that becomes the first hurdle <e> <s> if the cost is excessive the individual moves on to the question is it producing value for money <e> <s> a further judgment is therefore made not simply on cost but on whether or not the cost is producing a service that an individual considers is worth paying for <e> <s> i do not believe that accountability stops on the bottom line of cost <e> <s> it moves on to making judgments about the quality of service <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord mind repeating how it is that someone can be caught for two community charges <e> <s> i did not quite understand the case that was being made <e>", "<cs> members opposite underestimate the ability of local authorities substantially on this point <e> <s> i do not believe that it is beyond the wit of any local authority to have a view either about an individuals circumstances such as whether or not in the case of a single person living in one house who goes into hospital and has already paid a community charge it should levy up to the maximum of two charges <e> <s> it is not beyond the wit of a local authority to have a policy about the general circumstance and then relate it to a specific person <e>", "<cs> i am fascinated that in order to press the case against clause standing part of the bill the reference is not being made to second home owners tied houses or people who have to work abroad but in order to get back at the noble lord lord jenkin the second home owner is referred to as rich <e>", "<cs> is it not true that nurses in newcastle and so on will be paying rates at the time referred to by the noble lord opposite when the scottish people will be paying the community charge <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to press the same point as my noble friend lady carnegy but it seems to me that a point is being missed here <e> <s> already my noble friend the minister in his reply has said that for the purposes of determining rebate the allocation that will come via the job training scheme will be disregarded <e> <s> therefore i cannot imagine a young person who would not fall into the rebating scheme <e> <s> if a young person to take the example that was used earlier by the noble lord lord dean of beswick is left with per week net after tax having disregarded the allocation from the scheme i suggest that as a person in training he is rather well paid <e> <s> the reply given by the minister leaves me with the impression that a young person who perhaps works as an assistant in a shop and earns very low pay is considerably disadvantaged by comparison with a young person on an msc scheme who has that allocation disregarded for the purposes of rebate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may suggest that it is riot a question of having it wrong <e> <s> the only indeterminate factor is that raised by my noble friend lady carnegy namely will the government take into account the per cent <e> <s> which students will have to pay in allocating grants <e> <s> apart from that it will mean something different for each individual student <e> <s> it will depend how much they are at present paying in rates and whether or not it exceeds the per cent <e> <s> the example given by the minister based on a survey already carried out shows that the majority of students will be better off <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord dean of beswick rather than pressing this amendment will wait to see as must the rest of us whether or not the per cent <e> <s> will be taken into account by the government in allocating grants and the effect that it will have in scotland <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the concessions made by the government but i want in particular to refer to the comments of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i think that there have been some crocodile tears shed this afternoon as regards concern for small businesses <e> <s> the noble lord will know that his colleagues in council chambers up and down the land have said that rates are not an issue for business and commerce that they are a small percentage of turnover <e>", "<cs> i am referring to the precise comments that were made by the noble lord lord mcintosh when he commented on a centrally collected uniform business rate <e> <s> i simply want to say that i have long argued that the health and wealth of business and commerce to the country as a whole is too important to be left to the vagaries of local government and it seems to me that where there have been rate increases in the london area of up to per cent <e> <s> and in my own county of one-third that that cannot continue either for charities or for local businesses and our shops in the high street <e> <s> to refer specifically to the concessions that are now being suggested for charities i think we have the best compromise of the uniform business rate being a national concern but giving local authorities the particular discretion to know the local charities in their areas and to suggest rebates right up to per cent <e> <s> i support that process <e>", "<cs> i feel that most of the speakers tonight are speaking for the amendment <e> <s> i believe it behoves someone not to speak against it i do not <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness continues perhaps i may say something that has not been mentioned by any member of the committee today namely that the government meet per cent <e> <s> of the actual costs of police pay <e> <s> that has not been mentioned at all <e> <s> they pay per cent <e> <s> of the actual cost to the local authority whatever it is <e> <s> we are talking about having a kind of blank cheque in advance of funding local government <e> <s> we are trying to get away from that blank cheque policy <e> <s> it is not an attack on local government <e> <s> local government still has a very real input into negotiating bodies as it did into what was the burnham committee <e> <s> it is for the local authorities to go to the negotiating bodies with sums that people can afford to pay whether they <e>", "<cs> considering the record of the burnham committee it was a good thing too <e>", "<cs> this is a point with which i have always had enormous sympathy <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman and i have attended the same meetings and we have been well briefed by one highly-regarded local government officer from my own authority <e> <s> since those meetings i have done a great deal of thinking about the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the proposals which are outlined and which are being challenged at the moment by the noble baroness will go an enormous way to help in the shortage subjects by getting people with science and technology backgrounds into the classroom with the appropriate training <e> <s> the proposals will also meet some of the requirements of the new curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply and i congratulate the government on a particularly exciting programme <e> <s> with effect from th may and the launch of this scheme we are dealing with teachers who are in training but who are not yet in the classroom <e> <s> i ask the minister whether the scheme can be extended to those teachers who are willing to participate in the scheme and who are already in the classroom <e>", "<cs> my lords in the bill paragraphs a and b in my view cover all that is required of the educational system to prepare our children for the society in which they live <e> <s> it seems to me that if we get right much of the debate which we have been dealing with earlier today the religious education debate and if we encourage the full spiritual moral cultural mental and physical development of our young children as individuals that will make us a much healthier society <e> <s> it will promote tolerance and a healthy attitude to minorities whether they are ethnic minorities mentally or physically handicapped children or whatever <e> <s> this breeds a tolerance and understanding and a harmonious way of living for our children <e> <s> it will make ultimately for a better society <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree at least with the concern of the noble baroness that it is absolutely essential that whatever comes out of this bill should be compatible with that very successful innovation in our schools tvei <e>", "<cs> my lords perspective is very important to this debate and i agree with my noble friend lord swinfen that the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee expanded his introduction to the point of being unrealistic <e>", "<cs> my lords assumptions have been made during the debate that schools somehow operate in isolation <e> <s> that is far from the practice both now in the present system and as proposed in the new system <e> <s> a good local education authority and a school should share the same objectives that is to deliver the best possible education to the children which means employing the best possible staff available to teach the children <e> <s> if that is a shared objective of both the local authority and the school and if the local authority also employs as most of them do i cannot think of a single local authority that does not a personnel department both to advise and to help and in the education department has an advisory service both to advise and support i see no problems <e> <s> i cannot think of a better place to make determinations about the competence or otherwise of a teacher than at the level at which the teacher operates which is at the school <e> <s> therefore it would be a keystone in the management process for both the head teacher and the governing body to have a direct interest in whether a teacher was performing adequately <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house which i believe i must have in order to reply to the noble lord with or without the leave of the house i shall respond i believe that the assumption <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the government will not be persuaded to accept this <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to ask a question of the minister <e> <s> in the light of what my noble friend lord renton said as the amendment is worded can i ask what is the status of people such as members of the peace convoy <e> <s> i believe that these are people who would have the means to pay per cent <e>

amendment no <e> <s> requires the registration officer to act lawfully <e> <s> it seems inappropriate to put that on the face of any bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may apologise unreservedly for approaching the officials box <e> <s> i was asking for some information that had nothing to do with what we are currently discussing <e> <s> if that was out of order i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down if the noble lord is to use specific figures for the purposes of his argument i understand that the inner london boroughs average would be from about to <e> <s> the governments notional average to offset the per cent <e> <s> would be about <e> <s> therefore the amount required to be paid would be about and not <e> <s> if one is to use specific figures then i believe that it is important that they should be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to acknowledge that i share the concern about the wide-sweeping nature of the amendment and also to pose two questions <e> <s> first i should like to repeat a concern that has already been put <e> <s> there now appears to be some confusion about the cost of the amendment in the minds of the noble lords who may be required in a moment or two to record their vote <e> <s> it is very important that we know more precisely what the cost is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise not with a vested interest in the subject nor to support the notion of special pleading because i do not believe that this is about special pleading <e> <s> it is a matter of consistency <e> <s> one government department treats this group of people for taxation purposes as part of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fascinated by what seems to be a precise set of figures based on a revaluation that has not taken place <e> <s> therefore the precision must at least he questionable <e>", "<cs> my lords to take my authority as an example two years ago we put up the rate to all people including small businesses by eight times the rate of inflation <e> <s> one year ago we put it up by twice the rate of inflation <e> <s> whatever the interregnum in my view the difficulties arise in moving from the present postion to the situation when the bill is enacted that is the transitional arrangements <e> <s> once that point is reached the guarantee that the rate of increase will never be greater than the rate of inflation must surely be the prize for small businesses <e> <s> i think that more damage has been done to small businesses under the present system than we can ever do under the proposed system <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord ennals on rather weak ground in raising the issue in quite this way in view of his partys record of funding the nhs and on the aspect of bed closures in particular <e> <s> would not his energies be better employed in joining the government in determining a positive way forward for the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the thinking behind the amendment flies in the face of the way in which local authorities work although i do not question the noble lords knowledge <e> <s> there are finance sub-committees and main finance committees <e> <s> there is a long process to be gone through before an issue arrives at the stage where the chief executive has any involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords it has already been said in this debate that one mans charge is a cost on someone else <e> <s> it is important before we take a final decision to say a few words about the effect on business particularly small business <e> <s> i have to say that the government are being exceptionally generous on this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh will not be surprised by my remarks <e> <s> i believe that considerable tensions will be set up across the country <e> <s> some have already been referred to <e> <s> if local shopkeepers in our villages and towns one-man businesses man and wife businesses see that their local school is to be exempt or is to receive per cent <e> <s> across-the-board mandatory relief with the possibility of even more relief from the local authority and if they see that it applies too to their local social club ostensibly a charity but actually running a club with bar facilities in direct competition with local hostelries that are also struggling to make a living the tensions will be considerable <e>", "<cs> the thing which has united everyone who has spoken both for and against the amendment is the importance of visits to the dentist <e> <s> that must go unchallenged <e> <s> the details which were given by my noble friends lady gardner and lord colwyn contained a list of a number of specific matters which may be detected by dentists <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mcintosh and other noble lords are absolutely right to take any opportunity in this committee to expose the worst landlords in the system <e> <s> certainly mr van <e>", "<cs> i happen to come from a part of the country where this system is already in operation <e> <s> the objective of the exercise is to see that the maximum opportunity is given to every single individual to exercise his vote <e> <s> it is possible that when such individuals are called upon by that independent body they will say that they have positively chosen not to vote and that is an end to it <e> <s> it may well be that a particular tenant has not received a ballot form in which case it will be up to the electoral reform society to see that he or she receives a ballot form <e> <s> it may well be that the tenant does not understand how to exercise the vote <e> <s> this covers the point mentioned earlier by members of the committee who are worried about the inadequacy of people in connection with knowing how to exercise their votes <e> <s> it is not concerned with canvassing or the presentation of a case because all that goes before the vote <e> <s> the system has worked perfectly properly and people did vote as a result of being called upon independently by the electoral reform society which saw to it that everyone had a chance to exercise the vote <e>", "<cs> as an english person i enter into this debate on scottish education with some trepidation <e> <s> i make a plea for the rejection of this amendment and i ask that the chamber accept the bill as it is set out because it provides the necessary flexibility <e> <s> this matter has been referred to once or twice as an experiment but it must be said that the equivalent of school boards governing bodies have been going for a very long time in england with very many more powers than are set out in this bill <e>", "<cs> no i did not say that <e> <s> i think it is important that a proper job is done by the clerk to the board <e> <s> however someone performing this job in a voluntary capacity does not necessarily give a less professional service than someone who is paid <e> <s> indeed i can think of people who are paid who do not do such a good job as some people who do a job in an entirely voluntary capacity <e> <s> the job that needs to be done must conform and be consistent with all the requirements of the legislation <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is exaggerating what i mean <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the criticisms of noble lords opposite have something of a hollow ring <e> <s> i mention in particular the governments record when the noble lord lord ennals was in office when their spending on the nhs as a percentage of gnp fell when nurses pay fell by one-fifth when spending on hospital buildings fell by one-third and when waiting lists in particular the subject of this question rose by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to have intervened to ask the noble lord for an explanation <e> <s> what did he mean first when he spoke about the gentleman who returned his medals being denied the right to vote <e> <s> secondly what did he mean when he said that if the entleman votes he loses and if he does not vote he loses <e> <s> if he votes for exclusion from transfer he will be granted that as an individual if he votes for transfer he will be transferred <e> <s> therefore i cannot understand how that gentleman is denied his right to vote <e> <s> he has a right to vote for or against <e> <s> he also has a right to abstain but he is warned of the consequences of abstention <e> <s> i cannot understand what the noble lord means when he says that the gentleman will be denied his right to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> who decided that they would like to remain where they are in fact as individuals get their vote <e> <s> after all it is almost inconceivable when one reads the procedures that one has to go through to arrive at this vote that anything like per cent <e> <s> would not vote other than positive abstainers <e> <s> therefore anybody who votes in this electon wins <e> <s> it is hard to see who the losers will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the minister will not succumb to this amendment <e> <s> again it seems to me that there are a variety of reasons why this situation should come about <e> <s> one is mismanagement of its stock by the local authority <e> <s> it seems to me quite wrong that if the particular development does not command a market price which is comparable to its value and therefore leaves the local authority either in a more favourable financial position or relieving it of its obligation to continue to spend the government should pick up the negative bill <e> <s> for that reason i hope that the government will not be persuaded automatically to pick up what may well be a deficit for the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should say that it may be that i misunderstood him the first time round <e> <s> however i thought he said that the government should compensate local authorities if there is a negative situation and the local authority is left with a financial burden after the transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that as the community charge system comes into place the people of brent may make their presence felt and demand a service at least comparable to that of the people of wandsworth <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to a number of very persuasive speeches and there is now some confusion in my mind as to who in fact is being discriminated against <e> <s> for example a distinction has been drawn between a disabled person who lives in a house that is not adapted and a disabled person who lives in a house that has quite clearly been adapted <e> <s> i take issue a little with the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> some houses have had considerable amounts of money spent on them by way of adaptations in others there is special equipment and very minor adaptation has been required <e> <s> some local authorities have spent considerable sums of money <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that most encouraging reply <e> <s> however does he not agree that the problem at present for many employers is that of recruitment and that the challenge is to produce and improve the skills of those who are still unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for a second encouraging reply <e> <s> can he suggest when we might see some of the results of the improved efficiency in order that together with the governments policy of targeting benefits those in greatest need also benefit from an improved dhss counter service <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> perhaps i may add that the take-up has been significantly successful for this new vaccine <e> <s> will he encourage links between the health education council and schools so that a younger age group can be reached in preaching the importance of preventive medicine which will have an impact on our young people while they are growing up <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is important to secure a route through kent or elsewhere surely we must not lose sight of the significant importance to the economy of having a link between london and the tunnel and therefore not waste too much time in establishing that link so that we may enjoy its benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as a relief to the noble lord lord dean of beswick that i shall not compare bradford with cambridgeshire <e> <s> i shall talk about democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the cohort of young people going through university at the moment consists of the same young people who have been innocently at the receiving end of industrial action throughout their secondary school career <e> <s> the action that is being sponsored and supported by the association of university teachers is ill-advised and counter-productive <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving me a few seconds of his precious time <e> <s> has he taken into account the tucs decision not to become involved in the governments training schemes <e> <s> it was invited to do so but chose not to become involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall start by declaring an interest in that i was one of the people who appeared in an honours list in i think when i received the cbe and also later in when i was elevated to the peerage as a working peeress along with the noble baroness lady blackstone and <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that the government are presently talking to the water authorities about accelerating their programme for cleaning up our beaches <e> <s> is it not also true that the establishment of the nra will be much more effective in ensuring the delivery of such a programme <e> <s> will my noble friend give some figures which compare the expenditure with that of <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that there is a distinction between the scottish and the welsh leagues <e> <s> it is unfair to dismiss that as not being the case <e> <s> when this matter was last discussed i refer to col of <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue is not whether old age pensioners are potential hooligans <e> <s> the whole point has been missed in particular by the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> contrary to what he said earlier about me i am against the government on all exemptions <e> <s> i believe that they are bureaucratic <e> <s> i support my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> they are patronising especially for old age pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was not objecting to the fact that they are given a reduced rate for going into the match <e> <s> i was saying that the issue of identification cards would be a protection for them rather than singling them out as potential hooligans <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree <e>", "<cs> given that the noble lord has predominantly talked about national parks the elan valley the peak district and the lake district and taking into account local enactments and the duties on the existing water authorities which are to be transferred to the new water plcs and strengthened and in addition the planning controls is he suggesting that the national parks the elan valley the lake district and the peak district are under threat as a result of the bill <e> <s> this case attracts some <e>", "<cs> the duties of the nra and the remit for it are well set out in the bill and in great detail <e> <s> the idea of having to produce a plan publicly presumably for the secretary of state or someone to peruse is the kind of interference in operational management that i believe we are trying to get away from <e> <s> to accept the amendment as set out is a recipe for more of what we have at the moment namely some kind of external interference in operational management <e> <s> i am surprised at the noble lord lord ezra advocating this way forward <e> <s> we should be setting the framework within which the nra will operate and leave it to manage operationally itself <e> <s> it will be accountable <e> <s> the remit for it is set out in great detail in the bill <e>", "<cs> on the point which the noble lord makes about paying dividends to shareholders does he not agree that it will not be possible to pay dividends to shareholders at the expense of not meeting standards set by the regulatory body even to the extent of having the licence taken away if those standards are not met <e>", "<cs> the two explanations which we have just received from the noble lord lord mcintosh are most helpful <e> <s> they emphasise just how much the main objective is shared by all participants in the debate that is continuity and continued access to all of these sites <e> <s> but the amendment goes a little too far <e> <s> subsection refers to any land any buildings objects flora fauna and any river reservoir and so on <e> <s> it seems to suggest that if the amendment were accepted again it would be helpful to have further clarification there would be no varied land use of any piece of land or any building which could be owned by a water authority either prior to the passing of the bill or subsequent to its enactment <e> <s> therefore i think that that provision would be too all-embracing <e>", "<cs> the last remark probably makes the point <e> <s> the word protect in amendment no <e> <s> is an uncompromising alternative <e> <s> while the road may not have a deleterious effect its excavation works and building certainly will <e> <s> if the amendments <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> i shall withdraw my comments and leave them as read when the amendment is dealt with <e> <s> i believe that amendment no <e> <s> is included in the group <e> <s> again the absolute constraint of preventing any deleterious effect thwarts any short-term operational work which will be required to be undertaken by the companies <e> <s> therefore such an absolute constraint is not acceptable and one must return to what is suggested in the bill that a duty should be put upon the operators to have regard for reinstatement and restoration <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may ask him a question about the example which he gave of the area within his own former constituency which extends over a number of district council boundaries <e> <s> if there were to be a change of use the planning departments of each of those authorities would be involved and there would automatically be liaison with each local authority <e> <s> does he agree that they would all be involved in any change of use policy <e> <s> he appeared to rule that out <e>", "<cs> given that the sites of special scientific interest are already protected under section of the wildlife and countryside act is it necessary to include them in subsection a of this amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps the committee will permit me to ask a question at this late stage <e> <s> if this amendment means that the national park authorities and the broads authority would be allowed to give notification in respect of all land in their area is that what is intended or even desirable <e>", "<cs> i support what has just been said by my noble friend lord renton but i should like to share another concern with the committee <e> <s> clause states <e>", "<cs> i want to deal with amendments nos <e> <s> a and b <e> <s> clauses and already provide for standards of performance and for payments to those affected where the standards are not met <e> <s> the amendment requires payments by the undertaker to the secretary of state in the event of a breach of standards <e> <s> why the secretary of state <e> <s> the appointment contains a framework within which the undertaking is enabled to meet the required standards imposed under clauses and <e> <s> there are other clauses which provide for payment of damages if the undertakers fail to meet those standards for example clause which deals with requisitioning of water mains and clause which deals with the supply of water for domestic purposes <e> <s> is it not better that any penalties that are to be paid for a breach of standards should be paid to the person affected by those breaches rather than to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that very encouraging reply <e> <s> perhaps i may refer to a new development and ask my noble friend whether he will take the same deregulatory lines in the development of phones on the move <e> <s> what safeguards can he promise to ensure that given that there is overcrowding with the present system of mobile telephones which have benefited most of us there will not be the same overcrowding with the new system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the house will be indebted to mr david harris member of parliament for st ives who as long ago as th december in an adjournment debate in another place highlighted a deficiency in the common land act and also to mr tony favell member of parliament for stockport for introducing a bill to deal with what can be described as an iniquitous situation affecting the basic rights of many individual citizens <e> <s> it is due to the persistence of mr harris and mr favell and the tenacity of many individuals who have suffered as a result of the defect in the act that this bill <e> <s> has arrived on the floor of your lordships

about the objective <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend the minister for his promise to look without prejudice into the suggestions made during the debate <e> <s> however the warnings given by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and myself and even the reference made by my noble friend lord monk bretton about half a loaf being more acceptable than no loaf at all should be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging and comprehensive answer <e> <s> does he agree that two factors are important <e> <s> first there should be not merely a european commitment but a global commitment to strategies for the environment <e> <s> secondly is not a strong economy important in being able to do something about the environment <e> <s> the green party talks caringly about the environment but advocates an economic policy which simply could not deliver <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i shall give three brief examples as to why i wish to do so <e> <s> for example a warehouse alongside a brewery could at present be used as garages and have very low water consumption <e> <s> the brewery owners could subsequently decide to use that warehouse for bottle washing <e> <s> as garages the daily consumption of water in the warehouse could have been say gallons per day but as a bottle-washing plant the consumption of water could rise to perhaps gallons a day <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister gives some thought to this amendment between now and the next stage of the bill i think my noble friend lord cranbrook has reinforced the point that there is a misunderstanding about the two types of mains <e> <s> i do not intend to press this amendment tonight but i am concerned that by not accepting this amendment we are allowing unnecessary and cumbersome references to the director which could be avoided by not placing a duty on the water undertakers <e> <s> i ask my noble friend the minister just once more whether he will give some thought to this amendment before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply from my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there is considerable sympathy for the case being put <e> <s> however i should like to interject a note of balance into the discussion because so far it has been very one-sided <e> <s> it is important to realise that this is an absolute situation <e> <s> there shall be no disconnections of water for domestic purposes <e> <s> i know that the exemption has been made for non-domestic purposes <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however i remain a little worried <e> <s> if the clause remains in the bill as drafted i accept his suggestion that there are reasonable grounds <e> <s> i am however concerned that not only is there a legal requirement to notify the local authority but also that there will also be a legal requirement on the water companies to prove a reasonable exemption from having disconnected unnecessarily <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i am trying to be sweet and reasonable <e> <s> there is a concern <e> <s> it is not my view that the water companies are looking for an absolute defence against doing nothing to prevent damage from drought or frost <e> <s> where they need considerable understanding is that it is possible to have damage to pipework for no better reason that that it was laid at too shallow a level <e> <s> it could be that the water companies know that in advance <e> <s> what i am trying to rule out is a requirement on the water companies to put every inadequacy of the th century right immediately because that would be taking all reasonable precautions in advance of any damage or should there be any damage that it can be taken if i read my noble friends comments aright that as long as all other reasonable steps are taken the companies would be exempt from any kind of breach or offence <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much for that clarification <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain that the words of the bill convey precisely that meaning but i shall read what has been said and if the wording is not correct perhaps my noble friend will bring forward a different form of words on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the analysis as set out by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> however i raise a question mark over the solution he gives <e> <s> we all want to see the problem resolved <e> <s> i presume that my noble friend is assuming that simply extending pipelines to two kilometres will somehow or other resolve the problems all round and that the pollution will not reach our beaches <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the late hour i shall read with interest what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is it not true that the code of practice referred to by my noble friend the minister will include information about tariffs and such other terms on which those services are provided <e> <s> this includes information about payment of bills about handling complaints about testing and accuracy of meters about emergency procedures and about the <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that a good part of the massive loan debt that would have been bequeathed to the new plcs was inherited in the transfer and that freeing up the necessity to service that considerable debt will be a direct benefit to the customer <e> <s> while the plcs are obliged to service this massive debt the calls on any other moneys either to improve services or to give a better service to the public will be impaired <e> <s> it seems to me that possibly more indirectly for the noble lord opposite there will be a direct impact on the cost of services to the public and the ability of the plcs to meet the obligation to improve services to the customer <e>", "<cs> i am concerned with the practicalities of the issue <e> <s> according to amendment no <e> <s> the nra would have a water development fund which it would then dispense to the water plcs for particular projects <e> <s> the amendment appears to ignore the fact that flotation proceeds from authorities some large some small will differ as will the needs of those authorities <e> <s> sometimes the needs will be disproportionate to the flotation proceeds <e> <s> it appears that those particular aspects have not been taken into account in the amendment <e>", "<cs> if the distinction between control and ownership is the securing of more than per cent <e> <s> of the shares how will the noble lords party select the unsuspecting shareholders from whom they will secure presumably by compulsory purchase per cent <e> <s> of the shares <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree with me that for a governing body to be effective it should create and develop a healthy independence from its local education authority <e> <s> however that is not to say that it should not work with its local education authority <e> <s> does he further agree that too much training laid on only by the local education authority will thwart that independence and that there will not be a genuine interface between parents school and local education authority <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i am not entirely clear on the two assurances he has given but i should like to study them in detail <e> <s> as the hour is late i shall not press my amendment <e> <s> however i wish to reserve my right to return to this matter at a later stage <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies i should say that clause b places a duty on the nra to make proper use of water resources <e> <s> it appears that this amendment refers to the proper use of land resources <e> <s> it also appears to place a general duty on the nra to secure the proper use of land not in its ownership <e> <s> i would welcome some comment on that when the minister replies <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the water resources act at present gives power to water authorities and in the future that will be the nra to revoke licences <e> <s> whereas i understand the comments made by the noble lord lord moran that that power has not been used effectively in the past it could have something to do with the rationale behind the bill <e>", "<cs> it would seem that all the amendments we have had of late are concerned about and addressing the point of over-abstraction <e> <s> it might help to require the nra to produce for consultation plans for all river basins in addition to minimum and acceptable flows <e> <s> that could also include classification of rivers according to character and use and classification under clause which relates to quality of water <e> <s> some similar classification as to quantity character and use of water may be needed and some method of assessing the requirements of its various users <e> <s> that could be followed by publication of a river management policy for each catchment area and form the basis for controlling abstractions and preserving adequate residual flows below abstraction points <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his sympathy and good measure in that comment <e> <s> i do not intend to press the amendment at this late hour <e> <s> i shall read what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if that is an assurance that consultation will take place as the bill stands and <e>", "<cs> my particular interest is effective management in public authorities <e> <s> that has been my abiding interest for a long time <e> <s> i believe that as in local government freedom to manage within a framework is important <e>", "<cs> there is some concern about paragraph b of the amendment on the part of water authorities <e> <s> some might say that there would be wouldnt there <e> <s> i believe that they have good reason <e> <s> the paragraph provides that there is no alternative <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> on the suggestion that undertakers should enter into an easement with the landowner on each and every case it needs to be noted that mains and sewers last for many years and it is not possible to envisage the future use of land when they are laid <e> <s> moreover to negotiate an easement in all cases would defeat the object of having power to lay mains and sewers following the serving of notices <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> those assurances are reasonably clear to me <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friend will forgive me if i say that i had difficulty in following his remarks <e>", "<cs> i have often contemplated a speed reading course but i shall go in for a speed listening course <e> <s> i will read that reply with great interest and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for that reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that had a labour government been in office for the last years and not a conservative government this country would by now be almost defenceless <e> <s> is it not further true that the likelihood of the russians reducing anything is minimal <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that to use benefit levels as the definition of poverty is misleading and intellectually disingenuous and only serves to hamper the governments attempt to target resources to those truly in need <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise entirely with the sentiments expressed by my noble friend lord renton and lord crickhowell <e> <s> i invite my noble friend the minister in his reply to the amendment to give us an assurance that the terms of reference for the financial memorandum will reflect the widest degree of operational management consistent with good management given that the government have to have a view about the overall financial parameters <e> <s> one would expect that to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords clause already lays a duty on the undertakers to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to argue indeed i do not wish to do so with the need to protect flora fauna and objects of archaeological and architectural interest <e> <s> however taking all these amendments together it would be difficult to argue other than that the water authority should now shut up shop and go home <e> <s> they make it nearly impossible for them to carry out their normal duties <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house if the noble baroness will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i was not arguing against the desire to protect these buildings <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> a seems to put a duty on the water companies whether or not they are working on these sites or buildings to conserve them <e> <s> i think that that is unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> certainly does expand and make a little clearer the definition of associated waters <e> <s> i cannot speak for my noble friend lord cranbrook <e> <s> i suspect that he will wish to read what the minister said <e> <s> i also accept the technical defect that one is not speaking of underground mines <e> <s> i believe that there is scope for some thought between now and third reading for us all to think about a form of words that will catch and encompass all the interests of this group of amendments <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment and therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that this government more than all their predecessors have done more for the teaching of languages in schools by making a foreign language compulsory in the curriculum <e> <s> this does not preclude the learning of a second language <e> <s> would it not be better to concentrate energies on securing more teachers of foreign languages and improving the teaching of foreign languages <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh certainly echoes the wishes of the whole house and the public when he speaks of his concern to reduce pollution in the treatment of sewage <e> <s> therefore on that point there is no disagreement whatever <e> <s> what we are talking about is the means by which we achieve those ends <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton has already referred to this <e> <s> it seems to me that if one addresses the task which the water companies have to undertake the task of compensating for neglect it is probably fair to say that there has been neglect by all parties but particularly during the latter part of the s when the labour government made cuts in this very area of the reduction of pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful albeit out of order for the support i have received <e> <s> however i take issue here <e> <s> i do not think that there is something missing i think that there is something here that should not be here <e> <s> to delete the word new would bring this bill into line with the act <e> <s> that is what we seek <e> <s> i am absolutely certain from the reply that my noble friend the minister gave that we all know what we want and we are all in agreement on that <e> <s> we do not wish to lay an unreasonable duty on the water companies <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend the minister will consider my request that if he cannot accept the amendment as set out perhaps he will ensure that this bill is consistent with that requirement of the act <e> <s> i apologise for being so persistent <e> <s> we simply want the bill to be consistent with that requirement of the act so that an unreasonable duty is not put upon the water companies <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i accepted a nod as an agreement that something would take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am not quick enough to take into account the reference that he made at the very end of his explanation about clause <e> <s> therefore i should like to read what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a kind offer and i shall accept it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> what has been suggested will be a useful performance measure when it comes to the customers committees making judgments about the performance of their particular company <e> <s> it is also a case of just occasionally persistence paying off <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be permitted a question <e> <s> if i understood the minister correctly he is saying that it is reasonable to assume that the water companies will make every effort to bring antiquated old apparatus up to standard but it cannot be expected to be done overnight <e> <s> therefore they need to convince a court that they have a reasonable programme of improvements <e> <s> if there were damage to a piece of apparatus that the company had not started restoring or bringing up to the new standard would that be grounds for defence against a charge of negligence for example <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is true that in order to do something about improving the environment rather than just talking about it it is necessary first to co-operate with our european partners and other countries and secondly to have a strong economy <e> <s> on both counts does the minister not agree that the government have achieved a considerable measure of success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am encouraged by the ministers reply <e> <s> i think that it is in everyones interest that where there is positive or wilful pollution some kind of swift and positive action is taken <e> <s> i think that expectations have now been considerably raised <e> <s> i also believe that there is support on all sides of the house for making the polluter pay where it can be proved that there has been a wilful or positive breach of conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords there appears to be agreement that there has been a difficulty and that the management of the sites could be improved <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his answer <e> <s> i clearly need to read the bill more carefully to see whether the objectives that i wish to achieve by the amendment can be achieved by the bill as drafted or by the changes that may be brought about by the government <e> <s> the pollution control arrangements are not sufficiently stringent <e> <s> i hope that the new arrangements and the powers given to the nra particularly by injecting conditions into the licence which i believe to be important will be sufficient <e> <s> i shall read carefully what my noble friend has said and re-read the bill <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be appropriate if i spoke to amendment no <e> <s> c just as a safeguard <e> <s> i tabled an amendment to schedule in committee <e> <s> the minister agreed to bring back an amendment and has done so <e> <s> i am grateful for amendment no <e> <s> which has now been accepted but i can see no reason why this same amendment should not apply to schedule <e> <s> it has already been said that if the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley is accepted it will pre-empt my amendment <e> <s> i shall therefore wait in anticipation of his amendment being accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the new clause in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however i should like an assurance from my noble friend that the designation power will be used readily for land which is of the same importance as national parks such

deals with the issue of local <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house that was the local authorities and that matter has been dealt with <e> <s> however this set of amendments refers to the nra and sewage undertakers in addition to the water undertakers <e> <s> i wondered whether that presented the same problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that full and detailed reply and for his offer to look again at the matter between now and third reading <e> <s> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to draw attention to a possible inconsistency between the english scottish and welsh provisions <e> <s> clause places a restriction on prosecutions <e> <s> it would appear that that measure is not included in the scottish provision <e> <s> i am not sure whether the government intend to bring the provision of the bill that applies to england into line with the provision for scotland or whether they intend the provisions to remain different <e> <s> there may well be particular reasons why the provision that applies to scotland should be different <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> i think that it is important to say that our silence does not necessarily mean assent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the ministers reply <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that clarification <e> <s> perhaps the confusion is all mine i am not sure <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i rise tentatively to take a different view on the amendments <e> <s> it is important to make the distinction between somebody who is not actively seeking work where the judgment made is a legitimate one and somebody in respect of whom an error has been made <e> <s> that is why i have some sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> whether days is the right amount of time i do not know but where a judgment has been made that somebody who is unemployed has not actively been seeking work it is important that the appeal should be heard and the judgment substantiated or not as soon as possible <e> <s> i hope that there will be some sympathy for the proposal that the appeal should be heard quickly <e>", "<cs> may i add to the list of questions that have been posed to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> first it is a very serious business to stop the benefit of somebody who is unemployed <e> <s> therefore anything that can be done to speed up the process to determine whether it is a legitimate thing to do seems to me absolutely essential <e> <s> all that we can do to speed up that process should be done <e>", "<cs> i rise not to speak to the amendment but to comment on something said by the noble lord <e> <s> his reference to shooting in the back of the neck as being a chinese custom was flippant and in thoroughly bad taste <e> <s> to use it in relation to this debate was absurd and wholly inappropriate <e> <s> i should like to think that the noble lord would see fit to withdraw his comments <e>", "<cs> the joke was a very sick one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend the minister for bringing this amendment to the house <e> <s> as i said when i pressed my own amendment most cut-offs occur within the -hour limit <e> <s> i think this provision will eliminate a large number <e> <s> of occasions when local authorities would have to be notified <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that if an area of land conformed with the criteria to become an sssi it could be recommended for such status and if it acquired that status it would enjoy that protection under this bill <e> <s> if that is so not only is there the protection enjoyed by sssis as the amendment sets out but there is also the assured protection should an area of land conform <e> <s> however i am not sure about that and i should like some confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for the changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed with that reply <e> <s> it seems to me that the person receiving the consent that is the person with the ownership of the consent needs to be vigilant about how that consent is discharged or in other words about who will use it <e> <s> i am absolutely in agreement with my noble friend the minister that whoever the polluter is he should be penalised if the pollution is in breach of a consent or if it is unauthorised <e> <s> but i should like to think that the owners of a consent would be as vigilant as possible about the way in which it was used <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that there has been considerable over-emotion on this subject <e> <s> to suggest that this is not a transitional arrangement is simply not a serious statement <e> <s> this is a transitional arrangement and the year of grace suggested in amendment no <e> <s> is not a year in which nothing will happen <e> <s> those of us who oppose amendment no <e> <s> do so because we see the year of grace as a year in which the improvements that we all want to see will take place <e> <s> we all know that there are some sewage treatment works which do not comply with their consents <e> <s> therefore something must be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> the percentage was rather higher than i expected <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me given the popular view mainly held by the benches opposite that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer whether the pensioners share in this new-found wealth <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask my noble friend a question although it may be difficult to obtain a reply straight away <e> <s> we seem to have honed down the problem to the allowance being adequate if there is access to cooking facilities and to whether it is adequate for eating out seven days a week <e> <s> the allowance for two parents and one child would be just over a week to provide two meals per day for those people <e> <s> it seems to me that with access to cooking facilities that is possible <e> <s> it is not ideal but it is possible <e> <s> clearly if there is no access to cookers there is a problem <e> <s> are we talking about a high percentage of people who are boarded out by local authorities where there is absolutely no cooking facility whatever <e> <s> it seems to me that if that is the problem we should address the practical problem of perhaps providing some assurance even within legislation that if a local authority must accommodate a family in that kind of accommodation there will be access to cooking facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords in my mind there is no doubt that this is at worst a wrecking amendment and at best it is certainly a delaying amendment as my noble friend lord renton said <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord mcintosh and his colleagues have done much to create a perception which distorts the real situation <e> <s> therefore i want to deal with some of the misinformation that has been propounded throughout the whole passage of the bill through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as a relatively new girl i am not sure of the rules of the house <e> <s> if it is not in accordance with the rules of the house i apologise <e> <s> i am saying that there has been large scale scaremongering and misinformation on this issue <e> <s> drinking water in this country is drinkable and is safe <e> <s> i drink it and i have survived <e> <s> there are many noble lords a great deal older than me who have drunk our drinking water and they still survive <e> <s> we should get the whole issue into context <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to oppose the amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friends on the front bench will remain firm <e> <s> i do not oppose the amendment because i envisage that any local government officer who wishes to get into the business of politics will always be of a liberal or labour persuasion <e> <s> this matter cuts across party lines <e> <s> i have no doubt it is possible that there are as many conservatives as members from other parties who will be offended by our words this evening <e>", "<cs> i must take issue with the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> we find ourselves in agreement on so many things but not on this issue <e> <s> there is a distinction between being a member of a party and a member of government and being a member of the civil service serving that government <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the point at issue the naming of a sum of money of <e>", "<cs> i think i confused the noble lord in saying what my personal preference would be <e> <s> my personal preference would be to include all teachers in the provision <e> <s> however i have deliberately restricted the provision because i think it would disenfranchise a very large number of people in the country as a whole and i am not sure that it would succeed in obtaining the support of the committee <e> <s> i also believe that one needs to start with the two posts that set the tone for an institution that is the head teacher and the deputy head teacher <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> his reference to the amendment being a restriction of democracy is no greater or lesser a case than that of the local government officers whom we have been discussing for most of today <e> <s> perhaps i should say to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that i have spoken publicly about the amendment for a long time including at the local government conference of the conservative party in march when the press including both television and newspapers were present <e> <s> i said then that i intended to do something about the matter when the bill came before the house <e> <s> whenever i have been invited to speak in various parts of the country i have also mentioned my concern about it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his generous comments <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was right in one respect <e> <s> he said that this was not necessarily a matter of public services being bad or public services being good <e> <s> i could not agree more with that <e> <s> i believe that we have some very fine local authorities who managerially and in every other sense are serving their local communities extremely well <e> <s> equally there are some fairly awful private companies with poor management and poor delivery of service <e> <s> i suppose that the difference is that if a public company is poor it usually finds itself going out of business <e> <s> sadly if local government management is poor the ratepayers or community charge payers next year pick up the bill and the authority continues to exist <e> <s> the tab is always picked up and that is the difference <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord withdraws his amendment can he show me the words in the clause that prevent the chief executive the chief officer or any officer of the council giving advice to a member or members and the members being allowed to hear the advice but not heed it <e> <s> there is nothing in the clause that prevents that from happening <e>", "<cs> i still do not see what there is in this clause that prevents that from happening <e>", "<cs> there seems to be some misunderstanding about the purpose of the clause <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton was surprised and i think probably also saddened that the early clauses in the bill were necessary <e> <s> however perhaps we should take the country as a whole and look across local authorities <e> <s> let us take for instance the example i gave to the committee earlier <e> <s> i heard a leading local authority member say that a members job was to determine policy and whether it was legal or constitutional or illegal or unconstitutional it was the officers job to implement that policy <e>", "<cs> i must make it clear that i was not referring to the city of westminster i was referring to any local authority anywhere contemplating either wittingly or unwittingly a particular proposal which may well turn out to be illegal or unconstitutional <e> <s> it seems to me to be appropriate that someone within the authority should have the responsibility to advise and try to prevent such a situation from occurring <e> <s> further where a particular member or members insist upon a particular proposal then it is absolutely necessary to invoke this clause and to present a report <e> <s> moreover i believe that it is right that that should go to the whole council <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to rise because i thought we were going to have a definition of the word core <e> <s> i have the same difficulty as my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall set aside that point and the definition of core <e> <s> i think that we could go round in circles discussing whether it has a proper place in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i too am blissfully ignorant of the programme that was screened last night neither have i read the press this morning which apparently catalogues the happenings at westminster council <e> <s> i understand that the situation in westminster is <e>", "<cs> i find some difficulty with regard to this amendment because i do not approve of political advisers at any price <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh ran a local authority <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not he ran it with paid political advisers <e>", "<cs> perhaps i ascribe greater things to the noble lord than i ought to <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord was leader of his authority <e> <s> i wonder if the leader of the authority ran it with paid political help <e> <s> many local authorities throughout the united kingdom function extremely well without the help of paid political advisers <e> <s> it is possible to obtain political advice if it is required but i do not think it right to use ratepayers or community chargepayers money to pay for political advisers <e> <s> it is not just that one is employing an individual one has to provide office space office equipment and very often clerical assistance etc <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be allowed to ask a question on behalf of the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> we may both be interested in the answer <e> <s> given the prescriptive mechanism for setting up political advisers and allocating them to particular groups and the mathematical calculations that will have to be done if a minority group was unfairly treated <e>", "<cs> but the fact that it is on the face of the bill would give protection to the minority groups <e> <s> they would not need something as dramatic as recourse to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the amendment because i believe the bill goes further than any other framework we have had in the past to protect the rights of minority groups <e> <s> that is right <e> <s> but there are practical difficulties and i see two <e> <s> one is where the per cent <e> <s> in numbers turns out to be such as in my local authority members <e> <s> the idea that they could be represented on every single committee that is greater than five would be a physical task beyond the ability of just seven members <e> <s> there is another practical difficulty which i do not think would be excluded under the bill <e> <s> my own local authority allows each individual group the <e>", "<cs> i can speak only of how it happened in cambridgeshire <e> <s> it was thought that for the officers to be available to give advice and information to the ruling group alone was not appropriate <e> <s> the rules are very specific <e> <s> the meetings must be recorded and they must take place within shire hall <e> <s> we discovered that one group on the council was having meetings in the private homes of councillors <e> <s> party members attended those groups and officers advised <e> <s> we felt that that was unhealthy so we came to an all-party agreement that individual groups could have access to information and advice from officers but that information and advice from the same officers would be available to the whole council <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend continues perhaps he will allow me to add a further point <e> <s> there appear to be considerable inconsistencies between the brief which he has presented to the house and the facts which are there to be challenged presented by noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i think that there are sufficient inconsistencies for my noble friend at least to go back to the secretary of state and say that taken together they are grounds for further investigation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may inject into the debate a note of confusion in my own mind namely the distinction between what may well be a purely administrative matter and what may well be partly an education matter <e> <s> it strikes me that if one puts oneself in the shoes of the customer an injustice is an injustice <e> <s> if we put into effect legislation that at least allows for a grievance to be heard and an injustice to be righted we should not be in the business of making distinctions <e> <s> as more autonomy goes down to school level it is important that the customer the parents and/or the young person has somewhere to go other than occasionally the local education authority which is in the business of defending its schools and its own responsibilities <e> <s> there is therefore a case for there being recourse to the ombudsman <e> <s> i see no reason for the exclusion or for the distinction <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i do not know whether or not it is technically correct <e> <s> however the one argument used over the years with which i agree against any kind of sanction beyond that of printing in the local press that the local authority has refused to comply with the recommendations of the local ombudsman has been that the number of recalcitrant local authorities is so small that it is better to leave these matters to the voluntary system <e>", "<cs> i wish to add one point to what was said by my noble friend lady carnegy who spoke in favour of the limitations as indeed did my noble friend who has just spoken <e> <s> i think that is right <e> <s> the other point i wish to make is that i do not believe that local authorities should be frustrated by the limitations set out in clauses and <e> <s> the one provision that local authorities can make to promote the economy in the area is to provide good services <e> <s> the provision of good schools the building and maintenance of roads and the provision of other services does as much to promote the economy of an area as the provision of direct promotional activities <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that there should be a frustration <e> <s> the limitations are important <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty with the amendment <e> <s> i agree with the principle that the local authorities should have the freedom to make judgments about their local advice-giving services and to fund them <e> <s> i have seen no difficulty in the past <e> <s> i should like to plead for the right for a local authority to make judgments about the quality of that advice-giving service and to make up its own mind about whether or not it wishes to fund and to what level <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord agree that if the birmingham exhibition centre is to work in either the short the medium or the long term there is no reason why it should not attract private finance <e> <s> if it is not going to work in either the short the medium or the long-term should the birmingham city ratepayers or community charge payers be left to pick up the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have spoken in the debate <e> <s> one point has clearly emerged <e> <s> there is all-party support for the proposition that there should not be specific political groupings formed by the staff of our national local authority associations <e>", "<cs> my lords i find what the noble lord lord mcintosh says slightly more worrying <e> <s> workplace branches are not conducive to the independence spoken of by my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> the associations are there to serve local authorities of all political persuasions <e> <s> their views advice and comments are substantially compromised if they are seen overtly to be behaving politically in the workplace <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was persuaded against putting forward my amendment again at this stage <e> <s> my personal feelings on this subject are well known <e> <s> i believe that involvement in political activity by a member of the teaching profession should come under the specific ban contained in the earlier part of the bill <e> <s> i do not think that there should be an extension of the exemptions in this clause and i hope that my noble friend can be persuaded not to accede to one <e> <s> anyone who has been involved in a local education authority will know that advice is frequently taken from members of institutions such as colleges and schools <e> <s> the difficulty would be in selecting who should and who should not be subject to this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will not accept any extension of the exemptions contained in this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the ministers statement in calculating what each authority may spend in councils allowances a flat rate allowance will be taken into account plus a definition of approved duties <e> <s> therefore a sum of money would be needed to cover that in addition to a responsibility allowance subsistence and travelling <e> <s> if that is properly taken into account by each authority then authorities will be well satisfied with their allocation <e> <s> i believe that there are very few local authorities in the land which could not look to the frequency and purpose of meetings <e> <s> that would be an important area for local authorities to look to <e>", "<cs> i also rise to support the amendment <e> <s> this issue has exercised my mind since when i first entered local government <e> <s> i do not think that anyone can possibly understand the injustice felt by a member of the public who goes to the local ombudsman with a complaint against a local authority only to discover to his horror that although the authority is found guilty after a full investigation and although he thinks he has won the case no action is intended and moreover there is no requirement for it <e> <s> the greatest punishment such authorities can receive is to have the felony exposed <e> <s> however the kind of local authority which would take no regard of what an ombudsman is saying is impervious to that kind of exposure it is really not very worried about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure how my noble friend the minister will reply to this amendment but i want to speak strongly in support of the thrust behind the amendment <e> <s> it is reasonable to expect that this year there will be delays in getting to local authorities information that they require for making their budgets <e> <s> if the bill remains as drafted then instead of information getting to local authorities by the beginning of the financial year it could <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he knows that i am sympathetic with the plea to government about getting information to local authorities n time for them properly to plan their expenditure <e> <s> therefore i want to ask the noble lord lord mcintosh whether he would not think again about the reply that he received <e> <s> given that this year is a special case in terms of this legislation i would argue very strongly on the side of local authorities that we do not delay this legislation and that it is put into place as quickly as possible <e> <s> also i urge that we should accept the assurances that the aim will always be to have the information out well before christmas of the financial year in which the new legislation applies <e> <s> it would be unfortunate to press the matter to a vote because of all the arguments about a specific date in the year <e> <s> with all the support that i can muster for the plea being made by the noble lord lord mcintosh i ask that information should be made available to local authorities as early as possible in order to enable proper planning <e>", "<cs> my lords i have some sympathy with the case put forward by the noble lord but to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am enormously grateful to my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i am also grateful for the co-operation of the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe this amendment started life as the jopling amendment <e> <s> it found considerable support in the other place and in this house <e> <s> there is no doubt that there is widespread support from all parties to resolve the rural housing problem <e> <s> i do not wish to sound a dissenting note but i wish to pose some questions to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> i hope he will deal with them when he replies <e>", "<cs> my lords if a purchaser is staircasing a home it will need to be repurchased for it to be sold to somebody else who will then have the benefit <e> <s> therefore there will be repurchasing costs <e> <s> the costs will come from a housing association or a local authority <e> <s> they will be competing for resources that could be spent for the development of other properties <e> <s> i am trying to work out in my mind whether we are talking about the difference between the limit on staircasing and what would be the per cent <e> <s> figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> i do so because it makes absolutely clear that the starting point for recruiting a teacher is that he should be professionally qualified <e> <s> secondly there is no confusion about the conditions for approval for the consents <e> <s> subsection aa of the amendment provides that the teacher must <e>", "<cs> my lords since i have put my name to amendment no <e> <s> together with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i should like to take the opportunity to thank my noble friend and the members of his department for their co-operation regarding the inclusion of the new clause to allow local authorities to use electronic transfer for documents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion for a humble address in reply to her majestys most gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that even setting aside the system of allowances detailed by him there is discrimination between pre- war widows and post- war widows <e> <s> does he also agree that if the difficulty is one of precedent and perhaps opening the floodgates for other groups of people it must be possible to have a proper clear definition of a war widow and that the appeal that has been made from all sides of the house should refer exclusively to war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that optimistic answer <e> <s> however does he agree that more could be done by the tourism industry to make available positive and current information to young people when they receive careers advice in schools and colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that it is not governments which clean up cities but people and that more self-discipline and education is required of people to make our cities and countryside cleaner and litter free <e> <s> it is not simply a question of leaving the government doing something about litter in our cities <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady vickers is not present in the house today <e> <s> many noble lords will know that she has been ill for a long time <e> <s> the noble baroness is president of the war widows association of great britain <e> <s> i know that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that given effective management of resources including staff the resources made available should be sufficient to allow proper provision to be made in every local education authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his congratulations and commiserations <e> <s> i think that i shall need them in good measure in the current weeks <e> <s> it is important to put the matter into perspective <e> <s> there is no teacher shortage which would cause a crisis <e> <s> vacancies have stayed within a narrow range for many years <e> <s> secondary vacancies in january were per cent <e> <s> the same as in january <e> <s> resignations which are running at about per cent <e> <s> are not out of line with previous years <e> <s> about half of those resigning move on to other teaching posts <e> <s> the proportion of teachers leaving full-time service in maintained schools has remained constant in recent years <e> <s> many initiatives are being introduced to address the issue of teacher supply <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i do not agree <e> <s> the governments record on teachers pay is considerable <e> <s> teachers pay has risen by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since <e> <s> in cash terms since <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his congratulations and all that <e> <s> indeed i thank the previous noble lord for his congratulations <e> <s> there are two particular problems with tower hamlets <e> <s> one is housing and i know that the government are trying to address that problem in consultation with the education authorities <e> <s> another is that tower hamlets has not made the proposition a very attractive one for teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords the problems for schools will be different in different places <e> <s> it would be wrong to have one policy to cover the united kingdom <e> <s> the problems in scotland would be very different from those in england <e> <s> the range of the policies provided by the government reflects the differences between regions <e> <s> it would be for local education authorities to reflect the nature of the problems in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his congratulations <e> <s> i hope that they will continue to come from my side of the house <e> <s> he raises an interesting point <e> <s> the government are involved in a great deal of promotion to encourage teachers back into the profession and indeed to encourage those already in the profession <e> <s> but there is a good deal of negative comment on these matters which i believe does no service to the marvellous work done in many of our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his unoriginal but nevertheless very welcome congratulations <e> <s> i understand his concern about the national curriculum <e> <s> it relates not only to funds but also to the time involved and the enormous challenge that the national curriculum presents to teachers <e> <s> however it is important to say that teachers are not starting from scratch <e> <s> there are considerable skills and resources already available within the teaching profession <e> <s> the hope is that together with the new resources that are to be applied such skills and resources will be adequate for the task in hand <e> <s> the sooner that these proposals and reforms are put into place to benefit all the children the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for his kind words but his question strays from that on the order paper <e> <s> however i should be pleased to deal with it if he would be kind enough to table it <e>", "<cs> my lords teaching in inner london has not been the most attractive proposition <e> <s> that is first because of the housing difficulty and secondly because of the difficulty presented by the attitude of some leas to education in inner london <e> <s> i shall leave my comments on the report at that <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have understood the question correctly my noble and learned friend refers to the movement of children around the country <e> <s> it is a matter for individual leas which are constantly coping with demographic change <e> <s> in some areas enormous pressure will be applied for the closure of schools while in other perhaps developing areas such as my own in east anglia pressure will be applied for the building of new schools <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to say immediately whether i agree with the statement <e> <s> however when in local government i was trained to treat the comments of cipfa with caution but always to take them into account and certainly to use them as a starting point <e> <s> again in deciding whether the statement applies to it each lea must make up its own mind in terms of managing its resources <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks me to take that into account and i give him an unequivocal yes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is wide of the original question <e> <s> i do not intend to ask my right honourable friend to increase the sum of money suggested by the interim advisory committee <e> <s> all the issues relating to its remit were taken into account <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we believe it has <e> <s> in there were recruits to postgraduate chemistry courses <e> <s> in there were <e> <s> in the first year of the chemistry bursary the numbers increased to <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the statement from the royal society of chemistry <e> <s> it is always most useful at this point in a scheme to have some feedback <e> <s> as regards teachers generally over the country as a whole there are sufficient primary school teachers and a few problems with shortages <e> <s> nevertheless there are problems in some areas especially inner london <e> <s> recruitment to primary initial teacher training continues to be buoyant and there should be sufficient teachers overall to meet demand in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to give a specific answer to that question <e> <s> however i should like to think that following the introduction of the national curriculum that is treating all boys and girls equally we shall see no differential between the two sexes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the specific information to which the noble baroness referred <e> <s> however i can confirm that there were difficulties with this particular subject <e> <s> that is why the government introduced the bursary scheme in the first place <e> <s> there are encouraging signs that the bursary scheme is working and i hope that it will continue to do so <e> <s> it is worth repeating that as the implementation of the national curriculum settles <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right to point out the difficulty as to whether the scheme is working <e> <s> the government are constantly reviewing the situation <e> <s> indeed it was as a result of the review that chemistry was brought into the bursary scheme and it is likely that other shortage subjects will be included <e> <s> therefore i can promise her that review is a continuing process <e>", "<cs> my lords again i cannot answer the specific question <e> <s> however i know that accommodation is a particular issue in inner london <e> <s> the cost of housing is a problem but the hope is that as the housing market settles down it will become much easier for teachers to make that decision <e> <s> however i also know that the government are addressing the problem together with local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by thanking those noble lords who have extended their good wishes to me on my appointment <e> <s> i only hope that the remarks of the noble lord lord ennals will still stand at the end of the debate <e> <s> i thank those noble lords who share the anxieties of my noble friend lord mottistone for the understanding way in which they have expressed those anxieties <e> <s> like the noble lord lord winstanley i believe that the debate has been most useful <e>", "<cs> my lords there is to be a single framework of assessment for pupils at the age of whereby pupils will be assessed within levels of achievement on the national curriculum scale <e> <s> the main form of assessment will be the gcse and pupils will be awarded a gcse certificate if they achieve level or better <e> <s> gcses will be available in single subjects and also in combinations of subjects <e> <s> the schools examinations and assessment council is developing revised gcse national criteria embodying the statutory attainment targets and programmes of study for the foundation subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has picked up a concern expressed by all our secondary schools <e> <s> that was the single most common concern that has come back from the secondary schools <e> <s> i am happy to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state responded positively to that concern in his speech to the society of education officers on th january <e> <s> he has called for a broad and balanced curriculum flexibility to meet the needs of all children from the most able to the least able and another important feature continuity between stages of education primary secondary further and higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know about the report <e> <s> i have not seen it but it has probably not kept up with the pace of change <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state intends to amend the information regulations to introduce the flexibility called for by teachers with regard to what is known in the jargon as key stage for all children aged between and <e> <s> i am convinced that if the noble lord reads the speech which is deposited in the library he will be heartened by the detail in which it sets out the flexibility that will apply to children of all abilities <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is sticking to the original suggestion that core subjects plus technology and modern languages will have to be studied to the end of key stage <e> <s> however for the brightest pupils there will be flexibility to substitute subjects during that key stage and for the least able there will also be flexibility to introduce other subjects <e> <s> to that end btec city and guilds and royal society of arts qualifications will also be considered to dovetail into the attainment scale <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble baronesss point about the need for flexibility <e> <s> that is important but it is also important that we do not return to the bad old days of so much flexibility that nothing is studied in any depth <e> <s> the balance between core foundation subjects and flexibility with the non-core foundation subjects is problably the best bet for our young children <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will forgive me for not yet having read that document <e> <s> the house sat until about three this morning i was in my bed at am on the road again at quarter to eight and have been at meetings ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords i have however read in detail the whole speech made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state on th january in which he dealt in great detail with the overcrowding fragmentation and certification issues <e> <s> i should prefer to return to that question when the noble lord has read the speech in the same detail as i have done <e>", "<cs> this will be a convenient moment for the house to hear the statement and therefore i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by wishing the noble lord a very happy birthday <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the question is yes <e> <s> in order to implement the national curriculum in a reasonable timescale it has been necessary to conduct the consultations so far at a brisk pace <e> <s> nevertheless there has been a considerable volume of responses <e> <s> however in future we intend to allow more time for comments on national curriculum proposals wherever necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the education reform act makes it clear why history and geography are compulsory subjects within the national curriculum <e> <s> the group referred to by the noble lord is an independent body set up to make recommendations to the secretary of state <e> <s> there has been no question of dictating what those recommendations should be <e> <s> however it will be perfectly right and proper for the secretary of state to respond to the groups provisional proposals when they are made known to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> if i can obtain the answer i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to note the concern of the noble lord about this rather vexed subject <e> <s> it is also worth noting that there was widespread concern before the education reform bill came before the house about the subject and how it was taught <e> <s> therefore i hope that he will agree with me that to have a proper framework within which to teach the subject and for the secretary of state to be properly advised about the content of the subject is a positive way forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that remark <e> <s> it is true that the secretary of state listens to the anxieties of teachers <e> <s> all the points are being noted particularly those raised at question time <e> <s> we have a secretary of state who is responding to the anxieties of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i always raise my eyebrows when the noble lord lord peston rises to speak <e> <s> i know what an authority he is on the subject of education <e> <s> one of the anxieties that existed before the education reform bill became an act was the degree to which british history formed part of the syllabus <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord bottomley will agree that that was dealt with in the interim report <e> <s> it has been established that there should be a balance of per cent <e> <s> british history and per cent <e> <s> world history in any new curriculum <e>", "<cs> point noted my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely take the point of my noble friend and i shall convey her remarks to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am honourable and noble <e> <s> the point raised by the noble lord is very interesting and i am certain that it will form part of the content of any history syllabus <e>", "<cs> my lords virtually all lone-parent families receive child benefit but many also receive other benefits <e> <s> i shall arrange for a table showing the most recent information for the main income-related benefits and for one-parent benefit to be inserted in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say that the governments record in addressing multiple problems concerned with lone parents is good <e> <s> certainly the range of benefits available to lone-parent families who do not work and to those lone-parent families involved in part-time or full-time work takes into account the housing needs and the numbers and ages of children <e> <s> the pursuit of the absent parent who does not meet his financial responsibility is probably a measure welcomed by members on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the government certainly take seriously the issue of take-up rates <e> <s> all noble lords will be aware of the high-profile campaign to increase awareness of rights to benefit <e> <s> it is a pity that some members of the party opposite in another place were critical of the campaign <e> <s> however the evidence shows that a much higher number of people are claiming benefit <e> <s> the take-up of family credit is a good example take-up today far exceeds that of its predecessor benefit family income supplement <e>", "<cs> my lords in relative terms one person will always be poorer than another but i must reiterate some points that i made in my original answer <e> <s> there are a range of benefits to meet the different and varied needs of lone parents according to for example the numbers and ages of children and the amount of interest paid on mortgages <e> <s> i would mention housing benefit community charge benefit income support and family credit <e> <s> the governments response and the way in which they address the problems have been good <e> <s> they continue to pursue all ways of making it possible for lone-parent families out of work to exist and to encourage lone-parent mothers who wish to return to work to benefit financially from doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend will notice that i referred to lone parents without distinguishing between men or women <e> <s> however it is true to say that the absent parent is predominantly <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine that that is true <e> <s> however we are talking about the financial obligation <e> <s> there is no requirement for the father to have physical contact with the parent but there is a financial responsibility <e> <s> it must be noted that there is a considerable burden on taxpayers who meet that bill exclusively <e> <s> there must therefore be a balance between the cost to the taxpayer of meeting that bill and the proper obligation of the absent parent to meet responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that there is general concern in the house about the uprating of child benefit <e> <s> however it is not relevant in the context of helping single-parent families because the application of income support and family credit compensates for whatever the level of child benefit happens to be at any given time <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are not receiving income support they must be above the level to qualify for it <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is at all possible i shall certainly make sure that it happens <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular criticism to which i referred was criticism of the high profile campaign to increase awareness of peoples rights to benefit <e> <s> i believe that it has been a good campaign that is increasingly shown to be effective <e> <s> benefit is therefore reaching more people who are entitled to it <e>", "<cs> my lords changes from the traditional home help providing mainly shopping and cleaning services to a home care service able to provide personal care have been introduced by many local authorities to enable the service to offer a higher degree of support <e> <s> that helps dependent people to continue to live in the community in a home of their own <e> <s> at the same time authorities are moving towards remodelling their services so that resources are concentrated on those most in need of support <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that cleaning services are a vital support to keeping elderly and disabled people in their own homes <e> <s> inevitably the change to the new type of home care service will mean that some people who have received help with cleaning will no longer have it provided by the local authority <e> <s> however i hope that local authorities will recognise the importance that many recipients attach to that home help cleaning service and that where they deem it to be essential cleaning services should not be removed or where they are removed alternative arrangements and other ways of providing them should be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two responses to that point <e> <s> first it is important to remember that domestic services for those people have not disappeared from the job description of the new kind of home care service <e> <s> secondly my noble friends point is well taken <e> <s> for many elderly people who have traditionally looked after their homes the most distressing part of growing old is to see that their bathrooms are not clean and that their floors are not cleaned and swept <e>", "<cs> my lords the key issue here is proper management of change <e> <s> it is the governments policy to keep disabled and elderly people in their own homes <e> <s> this is an essential part of that service <e> <s> it is therefore right that we continue to ensure that an essential part of the service is not lost in the course of managing the change <e> <s> however the needs of the elderly are now more complex and it is therefore right that a more professional approach to keeping people in their homes is retained while not ignoring the essential part of the domestic side of their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord appreciates that i sympathise considerably with the point made in the question <e> <s> local authorities should be reminded of their obligation to the governments policy of keeping in their own homes people who are dependent on that service <e> <s> it is also worth remembering that the home help service has expanded from about whole-time equivalents in to about in <e> <s> however having said that the business of determining priorities and assessing needs is very much a matter for local authorities <e> <s> they approach that work in good bad and indifferent ways <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the previous question proves that there has not been a cut in the service <e> <s> there has been a considerable expansion in the service <e> <s> the noble lord may be referring to the situation where needs change and to the fact that a person whose need for home help has increased rather than a person whose need has diminished will obtain the service <e> <s> there may be a gap in the services in the way in which local authorities approach explaining the situation to their clients <e> <s> there is probably considerable scope for improvement in the way that the complexities are communicated <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that by accusing me of agreeing with everyone the noble lord does not think that i am compromising myself on each point <e> <s> it is important to make clear that as i said in reply to one question domestic duties of the home care service have not been removed from the job description <e> <s> i understand that there is some genuine criticism about in the country that elderly people are confused about why they are losing domestic services and why they are being replaced with services which some might say are not perhaps as high a priority in their lives <e> <s> there is scope for local authorities to look carefully at the way in which they determine priorities how they deploy their resources and how they appropriately address the needs of their clients <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course draw the comments made today to my departments attention <e> <s> it is also worth saying that there is an inspectorate which is concerned about the burden on local authorities to absorb all the changes in the field of community care <e> <s> it is already moving in alongside local authorities to help with the management of change and to give guidance on the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give that assurance that the department will play a real part in monitoring as also will the local authorities themselves <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has recently described the flexibility which will be available to schools in the last two years of compulsory education <e> <s> his purpose has been to establish a broad framework which will enable schools to plan for all the national curriculum subjects and religious education and for optional subjects such as those mentioned by the noble baroness <e> <s> he has invited the national curriculum council and the school examinations and assessment council to undertake a number of tasks which will help achieve that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give an encouraging answer to the noble baroness who has raised an important topic which was discussed during proceedings on the bill and has since been a continuing concern of teachers <e> <s> in his speech to the society of education officers on th january my right honourable friend spelt out in great detail the kind of flexibility which the noble baroness requires <e> <s> i can promise her that the flexibility to satisfy the needs of the most able and the least able and to introduce all the subjects mentioned by her will be accommodated <e> <s> it is important to note that all courses once approved will build on attainment targets and programmes of study so that they will all be brought into the framework of the national curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises another interesting point <e> <s> it is true that the secretary of state who wishes to achieve flexibility will go as far as he can under the present regulations <e> <s> however he also has intentions to amend the information regulations <e> <s> from what i have heard from your lordships i believe that they will be approved by this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say that the noble lord has the advantage of me in terms of procedures of the house <e> <s> i do not know in what form the matter will come before the house <e> <s> however i know that there will be an opportunity to make representations on the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it is entirely within the framework of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i dare not say that the study of economics is not of benefit to mankind <e> <s> what is important is not only the study of economics but also vocational studies <e> <s> city and guilds btec and rsa courses will all be submitted for approval and will be brought into the framework of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends comments are noted <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friends on this side of the house would say almost the opposite <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to resume the house <e> <s> in moving that the house be now resumed i suggest that we reconvene the committee stage on this bill not before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the city technology colleges programme continues to make excellent progress <e> <s> kingshurst ctc opened in and two more ctcs at teesside and nottingham opened in <e> <s> at least a further colleges will open in and <e>", "<cs> my lords i think there is a philosophical divide between the noble lord and the government on this question <e> <s> first the money that is being spent on ctcs is new money and not money which would otherwise have been spent on educational establishments <e> <s> it has also generated a maximum amount in fact an unprecedented amount of money from commerce and industry to support a most interesting educational innovation <e> <s> the signs so far are that this innovation is most effective <e>", "<cs> my lords by new money i mean that money was extracted from the treasury to <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a most valid point <e> <s> it is true that this programme is proving exceptionally opportune at this time when we need more technologists and scientists <e> <s> the scheme builds on the arrangements of tvei which is operating in our schools <e> <s> however i believe that it is quite wrong to deny this facility to some of our children if we cannot apply this innovation to all our children at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords question time allows us to be rather simplistic about our statements on these affairs <e> <s> it is important to remember that the government allocation for schools is only one part of the process <e> <s> local authorities themselves can supplement the sums that are spent on their schools <e> <s> another key feature is the way in which local authorities actually manage both repairs and capital spending on their schools <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend and the government set out to establish these <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord overstates his case <e> <s> it is important to say two things <e> <s> first i do not believe that there has ever been more money spent on education <e> <s> the record compares most favourably with that of the party of the noble lord opposite <e> <s> secondly it is a question of effective management of resources on the part of local education authorities in making the most of the allocation that is given by central government <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that it is difficult for teachers to teach in schools which are falling down <e> <s> i said that there was scope for managing resources rather better in many of our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords two issues are ignored by that comment <e> <s> the first is that the benefits that will be brought to brighton by the existence of a ctc need to be measured once that college is up and running and its contribution to commerce and industry in the area can be assessed <e> <s> secondly the point made by the noble lord also ignores the enormous contribution that is to be made by commerce and industry to the capital project <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for implementing this requirement rests with the head teacher of each county school in consultation with the governors <e> <s> in doing so the head is required to take into account the family backgrounds ages and aptitudes of the pupils concerned <e> <s> schools are not required to submit information to the government on the nature of the worship they provide <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state receives information on the quality of school provision generally through the reports of her majestys inspectors of schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i give an unequivocal yes to the monitoring of the quality of religious education in schools <e> <s> her majestys inspectors will do so in their routine full inspections <e> <s> early indications are that schools are making an effort to implement the act and the reports coming back are favourable <e> <s> the reports of full inspections will be made public and religious education will form part of that process <e> <s> any breach of the law on the part of the lea the school or the standing advisory council will be followed up by the department of education and science <e> <s> there is also a mechanism for parents themselves to complain in the first instance to governors then to the lea and in the final analysis to the des itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i detect a note of facetiousness in that question <e> <s> clearly it would be difficult to monitor the quality of prayer <e> <s> however i think it is true to say that parliament decreed that there should be a spiritual dimension to the education of our children that it was important that it should be wholly or mainly christian and that there should be flexible arrangements for those children either in groups or whole schools who are of another faith <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the des is awarding over million in the current year for training <e> <s> i entirely agree with the right reverend prelate that the quality and liveliness of teaching in the subject will be paramount <e> <s> i think that good and lively teaching will lead to a better quality of prayer and perhaps that answers more fully the previous question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not hesitate to say how much those efforts are welcomed <e> <s> indeed there are some exciting initiatives in this respect <e> <s> the strength of the act is that it involves parents and allows teachers who feel unhappy with this subject to bring in outside people who can enhance the quality of religious education in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can encourage the noble lord <e> <s> i understand that the first returns are expected in september <e> <s> therefore there will be some reporting back about the religious education situation and about the numbers of schools which have submitted a bid to have the requirements of the act lifted <e> <s> in that case there will be some feedback in the matter <e> <s> however of all the subjects which are to be taught in our schools i think that the involvement of parents and the standing advisory council in this one will go a long way to ensure that monitoring is very much a lively and continuing process <e>", "<cs> my lords i must stress as strongly as i can that i do not accept the premise that the majority of people in this country are not christians <e> <s> having said that i think that the facility of opting out is very well known in our schools <e> <s> moreover the incidence of taking up that option will rebut the statement made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that the noble lord is wrong in his assumption <e> <s> it is true that a parent can complain in the first instance to governors <e> <s> they can make reference to the standing advisory council to the lea itself and in the last analysis to the department of education and science <e> <s> moreover because this falls within a framework of law if there is found to be a breach of that law then action can be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed a serious matter <e> <s> i humbly attempt to answer the question in the presence of my noble and learned friend on the woolsack <e> <s> if a parent having complained to the governors in the first instance the school the local education authority and the des receives no help whatever i believe that in the last analysis he or she can go to law <e> <s> i say that because religious education the way in which it is taught and the conditions under which it is taught are actually embodied within a framework of law <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course there are many mechanisms for making such a complaint <e> <s> however if all those efforts fail and there is still an aggrieved parent who feels that there has been a breach in the law i believe that he or she can resort to the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that situation is rare <e> <s> however where it exists the head teacher is under an obligation to seek outside help to ensure that the requirements of the act are met <e> <s> if a head teacher cannot secure either outside help or help within the school i understand this to be extremely rare then he or she would have to consult the department of education and science and seek help and guidance from her majestys inspectors <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> it is almost inconceivable that there would not be someone within the vicinity of a school who could come in and assist in the matter <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that it is impossible <e> <s> i think that if there is a genuine will to find someone to do this work a way can be found to meet the requirements of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords for million is available in annual capital guidelines for capital expenditure on local authority maintained institutions <e> <s> this compares with only million under the old system of allocations for <e> <s> it represents an increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> it is for local education authorities to decide how to divide their capital resources among schools colleges adult education institutes and youth services <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree that demand for that service is increasing <e> <s> however it is reasonable to say that it is for local education authorities themselves to determine priorities <e> <s> they have annual capital guidelines but they are able to <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point about uncertainty <e> <s> this is a difficult time for local education authorities and for the youth service <e> <s> however it is very much up to leas to determine their own priorities <e> <s> the party of the noble baroness has said many times that we at central level should not be prescriptive about how local authorities spend their money <e> <s> therefore it is very much for local authorities to respond to the needs in their local areas <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly a backlog has been identified but i must refer to my original answer which displays the governments concern about the need for extra capital expenditure which is up from million to million <e> <s> it is also fair to say that leas can supplement that expenditure by using capital receipts <e> <s> the way in which capital receipts work now for local authorities means that they can spend per cent <e> <s> on capital projects and they can use the other per cent <e> <s> to reduce debt which in turn releases revenue to be spent on capital projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the specific problem that my noble friend raises <e> <s> however i can say that paragraph of the report states that there is a need <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the premise of the comments made by the noble lord <e> <s> i have given the figures for the money that is allocated from the government <e> <s> those figures have increased year on year <e> <s> it is very much a matter for local education authorities to determine how that money will be spent and to determine their priorities <e> <s> in some areas the money will be used within the local community and in other areas it will be used for local schools <e> <s> therefore i cannot agree on a particular mechanism <e> <s> an alternative would be for the government to prescribe how the money should be spent <e> <s> i do not think the noble lord would agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the government take a <e>", "<cs> my lords city technology colleges are another matter <e> <s> however i think the noble lord will know that i am an enthusiast of this innovative educational experiment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that <e> <s> i believe that the government are concerned about youth and adult education <e> <s> it may be appropriate for me in reply to this point to say that the department of education and science is developing a policy on the youth service in partnership with leas and voluntary organisations through a series of national conferences <e> <s> the first of these on the theme of a youth service curriculum was addressed last december by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state from the department of education and science <e> <s> there will be other conferences <e>", "<cs> my lords the use of the report will be widespread throughout the education service <e> <s> it may be appropriate for me to point out that the quote in the question asked by the noble baroness comes from paragraph <e> <s> it does not refer to the youth and community service at all <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to read out the whole sentence which states <e>", "<cs> my lords the sentence continues <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to make a personal statement <e> <s> in my reply yesterday to the noble baroness lady lockwood referring to the annual report of her majestys inspector of schools i said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for local education authorities to provide the necessary resources in the light of the annual local authority grant settlements and within the statutory framework and in particular in the context of pupils with special educational needs the education act and the education reform act <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will understand if i resist the temptation to quote from that particular document in my reply today <e> <s> the point that the noble baroness has raised is very important <e> <s> i see that report as a management tool not only for the government in considering its policies and determining whether they need to be modified but also for the local authorities <e> <s> it will allow them to examine how they provide for children with special needs and to decide if and when to make modifications in that provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i would resist the temptation to go back to the document <e> <s> however i believe that the noble lord overstates the case <e> <s> if the document as a whole is taken into account he will find many positive indications that a great deal is being done <e> <s> this group of children is vulnerable in our schools and it is very important that the act is implemented <e> <s> there is reference in the document to the fact that some local authorities have not given that matter the highest priority <e> <s> the importance of the document is that it highlights the need to ensure that everyone looks at the way in which they set policies and that not only the act but also the act is properly implemented so that those children will be less vulnerable in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be difficult for me to answer the point specifically <e> <s> the noble baroness lady warnock who is not present today was responsible for a report which identified some per cent of our children as being in need of special education <e> <s> of those per cent were severely in need of special help <e> <s> speech therapy is a very important part of serving the needs of some of the other per cent and i know that it is part of the provision <e> <s> however i am afraid that at present i am not able to answer that specific question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am prepared to take a more positive view of the state of the education system <e> <s> it is quite true that far from just talking about the state of the education system this government recognised as the previous government recognised that something had to be done <e> <s> this goverment have acted <e> <s> the government also recognise that there is a long way to go <e> <s> in the area of shortage of teachers the problem is being tackled <e> <s> in the area of pay the problem is being tackled <e> <s> in the area of buildings allocations are greater than they were <e> <s> in the area of standards the national curriculum with assessment testing will go a very long way to improving the state of education in our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i still believe that the noble lord has taken a rather negative view <e> <s> it disregards the enormous amount of excellent work that is going on in our schools for the more vulnerable children <e> <s> the importance of the report is that it highlights areas where there could be improvement <e> <s> i hope that both the government and local education authorities will look at the way in which they provide for vulnerable children and improve their service <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady carnegy is absolutely right when she refers to the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an important point which is entirely apolitical <e> <s> when formulae are presented to government for approval it is a requirement to take into account the special needs of children <e> <s> he is therefore absolutely right <e> <s> the government will have a view about how local education authorities provide that service so too will the local education authorities when individual schools exercise local management of their budgets <e> <s> i look forward to the day when special schools enjoy that facility to have some control over their own budgets <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have made extra provision <e> <s> it is up to manchester to improve its management of the resources that it has to deploy <e> <s> the government are concerned about that issue as can be seen in most of the answers that i have given to previous questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the senior chief inspectors report is a survey of the state of the education service in <e> <s> it has many positive things to say particularly about progress with the education reforms <e> <s> the government are already acting to tackle many of the weaknesses revealed in particular to raise standards of achievement and reduce teacher shortages <e> <s> my right honourable friend will of course take into account the reports findings in the future development of the governments education policies <e> <s> he looks to the other partners in the education service to consider the messages addressed to them <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer is something of a repetition of a previous answer <e> <s> the value of the report is that it is a tool in the hands of the managers <e> <s> they must look at and build on the strengths <e> <s> they must look at and address the weaknesses <e> <s> it is difficult not to take a political view on this question but if one compares the record of the present government on any of the aspects of service mentioned by the noble lord with that of the last labour government one sees that this governments record is favourable <e> <s> teachers pay rose considerably under the present government it rose under the labour government by only per cent <e> <s> spending on schools fell by per cent under labour and rose under the conservative government <e> <s> total expenditure on schools in real terms over the period of the labour government fell and rose under the conservative government <e> <s> the number of children in full-time nursery education fell under the labour government and rose under the conservative government <e>", "<cs> my lords the best point that i can make in response to that question is that it is not just a matter of money <e> <s> it is very much about the way in which money is deployed and the attitude of everyone working in the education service <e> <s> all the reforms in the education reform act are designed to achieve the objective of a better education service for our children <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that this should not be a political debate bul the noble lord will forgive me if i say that i am constantly attracted to the dispatch box to answer questions which relate purely to resources <e> <s> it is a question of how people behave in the education service <e> <s> it is right that the special needs of children should attract special resources <e> <s> those resources are provided by the government to local education authorities in order to provide the service to our children <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord makes an important point and i cannot disagree with him <e> <s> perhaps i may draw his attention to a press release on th february from the secretary of state who on the first page makes some positive comments about the good work going on in our schools <e> <s> however on the second page he goes on to say that at the same time the report shows areas in which we have a long way to go <e> <s> he refers to the inspectorates concerns about the state of schools teacher supply and other points <e> <s> the secretary of state has noted those points and it is very much the responsibility of his department in collaboration and partnership with local education authorities and schools to ensure that the document is used as a management tool in order to achieve a better education for our children <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no present plans to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware that there is a burden on parents that needs to be addressed <e> <s> it is probably right to say at this time that much of the debate for the next few hours will address that concern <e>", "<cs> my lords any change to the ceiling on mortgage tax relief helps only a very small number of people <e> <s> those above that threshold will not necessarily be affected by being brought into the grant and those below the ceiling will not be helped at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i addressed that point in my previous reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i always take the messages i receive to my right honourable friend <e> <s> if it is an idea that can simplify matters that is important but simplification can often introduce even more rough justice <e> <s> that also must be kept in balance <e> <s> however the system which is used at the moment to arrive at a fair assessment assesses gross income with a number of required deductions <e> <s> i have no doubt that that matter will be addressed later today <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble earl that there is concern as regards those parents who have an obligation to pay their contribution but who do not meet the obligation <e> <s> it is for that reason that the top-up loans scheme is being considered <e> <s> again we shall have ample opportunity later today to discuss that aspect of the top-up loans scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot resist the temptation of saying that we have had something of a surfeit of debate on higher education over the past hours starting with the question of the noble earl lord russell early yesterday afternoon followed by hours of debate on student loans and now this debate initiated by the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> i ask myself whether it is too much of a good thing <e> <s> i think not <e> <s> this has been a most useful and interesting debate <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord annan for presenting the opportunity to the house widening out yesterdays discussions on higher education <e> <s> however i stand here rather tentatively before an impressive presence of heavyweights from the world of academe <e> <s> a range of concerns has been expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords dr <e> <s> pages committee was commissioned by the government to assess the future need for veterinarians and the implications for the intake of veterinary schools <e> <s> we have accepted all the main recommendations of the page report by removing the ceiling on the intake to veterinary schools and discontinuing associated manpower reviews <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his first comment <e> <s> it is appropriate to thank all noble lords in this house who assisted in that process in particular the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for extension of places in the schools has been well made <e> <s> the flexibility of the recommendations of the page report will make it possible for the schools themselves to respond to the need for an increased number of vets in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises a very important point that was established by the page committee <e> <s> in addition to overseas vets coming into the country and the speeding up of the processing of those applicants measures that may help in the short term are flexibility in encouraging part-time workers the encouragement of people to work beyond the age of retirement and a possibly increased role for the veterinary nurse <e> <s> the extension of places will help in the longer term <e>", "<cs> my lords we are pleased that the threat which hung over the two schools has been lifted <e> <s> there is no intention to discriminate as regards fees <e> <s> however if the intention is to introduce top-up fees that will be across the board with mechanisms to meet the particular hardships of individual students <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an important question about the flexibility of access to our institutions which was fully discussed last week <e> <s> perhaps that point will also be taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be an appropriate moment to move that consideration on report be now adjourned until half past eight <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcomed the report of this working group and accepted all recommendations that it made <e> <s> ten of the recommendations have been implemented and work on a further three is nearing completion <e> <s> the remaining recommendations call for continuing attention over time <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not routinely collect information centrally about the location of secure facilities other than those related to regional forensic services <e> <s> however we intend to do so as part of a forthcoming comprehensive review of secure provisions <e> <s> it is for each district authority to determine the levels and patterns of local services <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly prepared to bring that aspect to the attention of my right honourable friend but i am not absolutely certain of the point of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the department and the home office seek to ensure that mentally disordered offenders receive the most appropriate treatment certainly we must all agree with that and timely placement <e> <s> our common aim is to ensure that where possible such offenders are dealt with without resort to the courts or failing that without resort to the penal system <e> <s> we recognise that there is scope to increase the level of diversion <e> <s> that can best be done by increasing local awareness of non-custodial options and encouraging closer and more effective working relationships between all the professional agencies and individuals involved <e> <s> guidance has been drafted by the home office <e> <s> it is being discussed with the lord chancellors department and other bodies <e> <s> i understand that the guidance is likely to be issued soon <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raises an important point <e> <s> we know that at any one time a relatively small number of prisoners about i understand is likely to meet the criteria for detention under the provisions of the mental health act <e> <s> we know also that there is widespread concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the frustration behind the noble lords question that much has been done but over a long period of time <e> <s> we must not detract from the achievements so far made and nor must we detract from the incredible push given by this house in making sure that a proper service is delivered <e> <s> concern has been expressed for example about the closing down of the larger institutions and the way in which appropriate provision has been made on the discharge of a person but without the proper follow-up aftercare <e>", "<cs> i think that this would be an appropriate moment in which to hear a statement which is being held in another place <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> perhaps this would be an appropriate time to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that the committee should not return to the bill before five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the supporters of the amendment as with others that we shall debate later are clearly concerned that the loan scheme will adversely affect certain groups participation in higher education <e> <s> there is no evidence from the operation of loan schemes in other countries that they have had that effect in practice <e> <s> on the contrary the government scheme is designed to increase participation <e> <s> it will do that in two ways first by increasing the resources available to students and secondly by relaxing the constraint on the number of students the taxpayer can afford to support <e>", "<cs> it is probably an over-simplification to say that education is free <e> <s> we know that in the combination of parental and state support a large number of students have a shortfall because parents are not meeting their obligation to the student <e> <s> in that case students resort to banks and other institutions for their loans at very high rates of interest and indeed have to cope with repayments while they are still students <e> <s> if we add to that the students who are in receipt of full grant by a combination of parent and state support but who still resort to expensive loans whichever way one looks at it to describe the situation as a free service is not entirely correct <e>", "<cs> the government are committed to broadening access to higher education <e> <s> mature students are presently among the groups which are under-represented <e> <s> we all accept that it can be especially difficult to study and at the same time care for young children but to make additional provision in the form of a bigger loan would be inequitable because students with children would be faced with relatively larger repayments <e>", "<cs> paragraph two of my reply may be more helpful <e> <s> instead we shall retain the dependants allowances payable with mandatory grant <e> <s> the allowance was worth up to for a spouse or adult dependant or a first child where there is no dependent spouse or other adult dependant <e> <s> additional allowances are payable for other children depending upon their age <e> <s> the allowances range from for a child under to to a young person aged or over <e> <s> eligible students will also continue to receive the mature students allowance worth up to in <e> <s> the level of the allowances will be announced shortly <e>", "<cs> i take my noble friends latter point first <e> <s> with regard to the person studying from home maintenance costs would probably not apply <e> <s> grant would apply and allowances would continue to apply depending upon the particular circumstances of the person concerned <e>", "<cs> the overall effect of schedule taken as a whole is to provide for all courses of higher education below post-graduate level to attract the loan subject to being provided on a full-time or sandwich basis and being of at least one years duration <e> <s> the fact that the schedule takes more words to say that is due to the need to make it quite clear which courses these are in practice <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are making available substantial support for training for this important reform <e> <s> it is for each local education authority to decide on the nature and extent of training for lms having regard to its particular circumstances <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state is encouraged by the way in which local education authorities are responding to the issue of management training <e>", "<cs> my lords the training is addressing all the issues that will be involved in managing education authorities budgets and in particular schools budgets <e> <s> the noble lord is venturing into whether the sum of money allocated to schools is actually enough for the transition when under the formula schools will either gain or lose <e> <s> most education authorities are finding a way of stepping those schools which lose to the point of the budget that they will receive <e> <s> those schools which gain will gain by not more than a percentage of their budget in any one year <e>", "<cs> my lords the training will address that point <e> <s> there is a programme of training for governors themselves for support staff for <e>", "<cs> my lords it is additional money to the normal allocation for training <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very good point <e> <s> it will be necessary for local education authorities to respond under the new system to the need for less bureaucracy at the centre than before <e> <s> i cannot comment on whether that money will be transferred to schools <e> <s> it is for each local education authority to determine allocations for each school <e> <s> but it will be necessary in regard to the ancillary allowances given to each school to think very much in terms of a bursarial post <e>", "<cs> my lords the capital moneys for the kind of problem addressed by the noble baroness will be retained centrally <e> <s> minor maintenance money will be allocated to individual schools <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer implied that individual schools will not have to take on full responsibility for capital moneys for major maintenance <e> <s> local education authorities themselves will have to manage that issue and many are doing it very well <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend is aware of all the issues and challenges for teachers and for head teachers in particular especially in the primary school sector <e> <s> a school management task force has been set up specifically to advise the secretary of state on all the management issues that are to be involved <e> <s> there is a challenge for schools and there is the issue of whether the support staff is adequate at school level but that will continue to be monitored <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is not the question on the order paper <e> <s> the question asks what progress is being made on the training front <e> <s> i can say that considerable progress has been made on training and all the aspects of what teachers governors and support staff are being trained for will be addressed <e> <s> the allocation of resources is another matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount of money available to local education authorities has always been a finite sum <e> <s> when it was controlled from the centre there was great frustration at school level about the management <e> <s> it has been proved certainly in my authority over the past nine years that the way in which it is managed at school level brings about greater value for money and better management of resources than is the case when it is managed centrally by the local education authority <e>", "<cs> i cannot agree with the noble lord lord addington that there has been little or no information about the bills details <e> <s> my noble friend the paymaster general has given considerable information during the committee stage on second reading and in the papers that preceded the bill coming to this place <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can help the noble lord <e> <s> the point i was making was that when the loan scheme is at its maximum the loan at current prices is expected to be about a year <e> <s> therefore the total of the debt will be greater than was envisaged at the beginning of the scheme <e> <s> when that happens in order to keep the repayments at around about at current prices one will have to extend the number of years over which it is to be repaid <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that a definitive maximum time period over which a loan can be repaid has been established other than the basic principle that the level of repayment should not exceed around in any one year <e> <s> therefore as the size of the loan increases the period over which it is to be repaid will be extended <e>", "<cs> i understand the concerns that lie behind this amendment <e> <s> we have heard expressed fears that the government wish to abolish the mandatory grant <e> <s> i assure the committee that this is not our intention <e> <s> as members of the committee know we have uprated the grant by per cent <e> <s> next year <e> <s> the loan facility that we will provide in will be on top of that uprated grant <e>", "<cs> this governments intention is that there should be a balance <e> <s> this government have no plans once that level is reached to go beyond that <e> <s> it will be for the government of the day in the light of all considerations to make that decision <e>", "<cs> i can repeat that the governments intention in this bill is to take the loan to the level <e> <s> however because of the points pressed at this time i shall if the committee will accept that i do it without commitment speak to my right honourable friend in the meantime and report at a later stage <e>", "<cs> with respect i think i intend to discuss with my right honourable friend the pressing <e>", "<cs> i can assure the committee that i will faithfully report everything said in the debate and the feeling behind what has been said <e> <s> i will consult with my right honourable friend and report back at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i can be brief in my remarks <e> <s> it is our intention that the repayment period should initially be five years <e> <s> that would mean that a student on a three-year course starting in who has a debt of about on leaving the course <e>", "<cs> i believe i said that it would constrain the secretary of state from helping students who started their courses in <e>", "<cs> i believe this would be an appropriate time at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that the committee stage be resumed not before five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the ho use do now resume <e>", "<cs> the amendment would ensure that liability for the loan could not transfer to anyone other than the original borrower <e> <s> i must remind the committee that there will be a contract between the borrower and the student loans company <e> <s> there will be no provision in the contract making anyone other than the borrower liable for the loan <e> <s> even if there were it would be ineffective unless the other person agreed to accept liability <e> <s> nor will there be any provision in the contract making the referees liable for the loan <e> <s> again if there were it would be ineffective unless the referee accepted it <e> <s> nor is there any provision in the bill that could override the contract so as to transfer liabilities <e>", "<cs> the government have designed a loans scheme that will be suitable for all eligible students regardless of course of study or future profession <e> <s> any graduate earning less than per cent <e> <s> of national average income will enjoy deferment of repayments <e> <s> if the scheme were in operation today that would mean deferment for those earning less than a year <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes a very good point <e> <s> i dealt with whether the scheme would act as a deterrent for people entering those occupations <e> <s> i also made reference to the options that employers could take <e> <s> if i may put it this way it seems to me that the difference between us is whether one has an across-the-board on-the-face-of-the-bill special treatment for those named occupations or whether one allows the employers to determine particular shortages and special treatment for particular recruits <e> <s> in other words i think that it is still a matter for employers <e>", "<cs> i still think that the same point applies <e> <s> if one says that teachers are in short supply to have something on the face of the bill or even allowing the secretary of state a power to name a whole occupation whether it be teachers nurses or social workers and have an across-the-board exemption from the scheme or special treatment within the scheme is probably not as effective as determining particular shortages and having individual remedies or ways of attracting people into those professions <e> <s> i do not think that there is a great deal of difference between us about the importance of attracting people to occupations where labour is short <e> <s> we are probably arguing about the means to an end <e>", "<cs> the reference to per cent <e> <s> of national average wage does not signify government thinking on what teacher salaries should be <e> <s> it was determined at a level of salary that allowed for a repayment of about a year at todays prices being a reasonable repayment cost in any one year <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> the point was not meant to be nitpicking <e> <s> i was trying to give some costings and i had to take an interpretation <e> <s> i therefore took the low and the high <e>", "<cs> amendment nos <e> <s> a and d are two of a number of amendments for example the grouping of amendments nos <e> <s> b b and which we have recently debated that would require the secretary of state to cancel the liability of a certain group of borrowers <e> <s> my arguments against these amendments are similar to my arguments against other such amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness addresses herself to one part of the loan scheme and not another <e> <s> the loan will not substantially increase in real terms <e> <s> in real terms the effect is neutral <e> <s> but at the same time per cent <e> <s> of the national average wage will also increase over a period <e> <s> therefore the actual effect of the repayment scheme will be neutral to the student <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> the two amendments are almost identical <e> <s> there is one small difference to which i shall refer shortly <e> <s> as the committee will know the first set of regulations relating to deferment will be subject to affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> first i think i made the point about how complex some of these issues are <e> <s> while they are being resolved all i can say on the second point is that the committee won the concession for us to resort to an affirmative resolution <e> <s> i suspect that we shall have to take as much time as it requires in order to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord flowers has stated the amendment would require the secretary of state to consult with representatives of the higher education institutions and to agree with them how the certification process should operate <e> <s> however contrary to what the noble lord lord adrian said we have consulted widely at all stages of formulating our policy on student loans <e> <s> we have listened carefully to all representations and taken account of all views put to us both before the introduction of the bill and since <e> <s> even where we have not thought it right to incorporate such views in the scheme we have been grateful for them <e>", "<cs> this amendment is in two parts <e> <s> the effect of the first part is that the student loans company would when exercising its right to recover loans from borrowers in default have to pursue them through the courts <e> <s> the second part would compel the courts to order the company to cancel some or all of a borrowers outstanding loan if it appeared to them that repayment could not be secured by reasonable arrangements made by them for staged payment by the borrower <e>", "<cs> i think that the deferment scheme would work <e> <s> if they were not working for whatever reason whether through accident illness or simply not being able to get a job the deferment scheme would work <e>", "<cs> the level of income assumed to be reasonable for someone to repay at the rate of at todays prices a year is <e> <s> if for whatever reason a person is earning at that level or above there will be a requirement to repay the scheme <e> <s> if through illness or any other reason a person is not able to earn up to that level then the deferment part of the scheme would apply <e>", "<cs> it appears to me that throughout the first day of the committee stage and indeed today i have given a number of assurances that monitoring of the scheme will take place <e> <s> we regard monitoring as extremely important <e> <s> the details of the scheme are not set in stone and the bill is designed to permit a swift response through regulations if changes are required <e> <s> the effect of loans on participation is one of the major areas in which the monitoring effort will be concentrated <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have considered alternative proposals but have concluded that the top-up loans scheme is the best way to provide more resources to students while sharing at the same time the cost of student support more fairly between taxpayers students and their parents <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to hear me say that i do not agree with anything that he has just said <e> <s> i believe those parents who now find support for students a great burden will welcome the changes that will be brought about by the education student loans bill as will some of those students who do not enjoy the full support of their parents who have an obligation to support them <e> <s> it is a great pity that the noble lord has not been able to take part and to put his point of view in the debates on the bill so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the point that my noble friend made is the subject of an amendment to the bill <e> <s> all such detailed points are being considered as the bill proceeds through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the question is superfluous at this time <e> <s> so far we have spent three days on the bill <e> <s> we shall spend most of next monday on the bill and then there will be third reading <e> <s> there has been every opportunity for the noble lord to put forward his points in that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it will disrupt higher education <e> <s> if the noble lord is interested in the detail of the matter i suggest that he sits through the debates <e> <s> he may learn the answer to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated a similar amendment a week ago <e> <s> i have as i promised reported the views expressed then to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i ought first to say that limiting the eventual value of the loan in the way proposed in the amendment is not as straightforward as noble lords have suggested <e> <s> in particular we intend the loan to be available more widely than the mandatory grant <e> <s> therefore if a student receives no grant and we are to limit his or her loan to the per cent <e> <s> of public support referred to in the amendment such a student would receive no loan at all <e> <s> it is a statement of the obvious that per cent <e> <s> of nothing is nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will forgive me if my response is somewhat repetitious of the answer i gave in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a most important issue <e> <s> almost every speaker has stressed the value of having mature students in the system and more particularly women mature students <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated this amendment at committee stage <e> <s> it is one of those that would insert into the bill special provision for a particular group in this case students with children <e> <s> we understand the concern of the noble baroness lady seear that family responsibilities should be no bar to studying <e> <s> that is why we make special provision for students with dependants in the existing student support arrangements <e> <s> but we do not think it appropriate to write further special terms into this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be an appropriate moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> i suggest that we do not reconvene before oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the sections of the mandatory awards regulations to which this amendment refers have been established solely in order to assess income for the purposes of providing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware of the fears that prompt this amendment <e> <s> there is concern that graduates will not wish to enter low paid professions if they have loans to repay <e> <s> but noble lords are aware that there will be a generous income threshold of per cent <e> <s> of national average income or some a year in todays circumstances below which graduates will be able to defer repayments <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to provide interest free loans during a students period of study or put another way it is a loan with a negative rate of interest <e> <s> at the end of the period of study the amount left owing would in fact be less than the value of the amount borrowed at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and were debated and subsequently withdrawn by the noble baroness lady david at committee stage <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was tabled but not subsequently moved at committee stage by the noble lords lord peston and lord addington <e> <s> the effect of the amendment of the noble baroness lady david would be to confine the administration of the student loans scheme to a body called the student loans company while removing any element of administrative discretion which the company might enjoy <e> <s> the effect of the amendment of the noble lord lord peston would be to ensure that the government will always retain ownership of and control over the person or body having responsibility for the administration of the loans scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that point <e> <s> i shall disregard amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a full and illuminating debate on this amendment at committee stage and i believe that it was explained to the committees satisfaction that there was no question of referees being asked to act as guarantors for a loan taken out by a student under the scheme <e> <s> i think that that point has been taken by the noble lords who have so far spoken in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of education and science is commissioning a survey of school visits over the past two years <e> <s> if there is evidence that pupils are being denied valuable educational opportunities because of the way the law is being applied the government will be ready to consider ways of improving the position <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right there is concern on many fronts about those activities <e> <s> however it is important to wait for the results of the survey <e> <s> it is likely that other factors must be taken into account <e> <s> for example many teachers are now concentrating their energies on bedding-in the new policies in the education reform act <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is something of an overstatement to reach such a black and white conclusion <e> <s> there is some evidence of considerable buoyancy for the more cultural and educational activities <e> <s> there has been a distinct falling off and i think this relates to the point made by the noble baroness in the number of trips abroad <e> <s> a distinction needs to be made between those which are cultural/educational and those which are purely pleasurable trips <e> <s> all those points will be taken into account when the study is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu for making that point <e> <s> there is considerable buoyancy for those providing a quality service and it is for schools to make a judgment about the service being provided <e> <s> however i take on board that there is concern on this matter and that is why the study has been put in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of what is said by the offices of arts and libraries on this issue <e> <s> that will also form part of the survey <e> <s> however it is fair to say that as regards visits to the theatre or ballet they are very important in educational terms to all children <e> <s> however it is only reasonable when priorities are having to be determined by both schools and education authorities that when it is possible for a family to make a contribution it should do so because if the service was free to all children then the position would be severely limited <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given an assurance that this survey is in hand <e> <s> however the point of the visits is not to prop up the theatres but for the children themselves to benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords as always my noble friend makes a very pertinent point <e> <s> however i have very painful memories of having a pleasurable day out and then having to write an essay on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that some of us would agree with that but unfortunately cases were often referred to the courts in order to resolve a particular problem <e> <s> however it is true that schools were imaginative in providing visits for the children <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i can give an assurance that all those factors will be taken into account <e> <s> voluntary activities on the part of schools teachers parents and sometimes even the children form a comprehensive part of that provision for our young people <e>", "<cs> my lords a total of licences have been granted since the arrangements were introduced in september last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the frustration experienced when one is waiting for a reply <e> <s> however the scheme started only in september <e> <s> while my initial answer to the question sounded a little gloomy it is important to note that approximately leas have now applied and the allocations were sent on th march <e> <s> on that date a list of allocations to leas was also sent setting out the bids which were made by them <e> <s> we shall find a different picture this time next year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are taking seriously the present difficulty in recruiting teachers <e> <s> there are a number of initiatives including the licensed and the articled teachers schemes <e> <s> there are special bursaries for teachers in shortage subjects and education support grants to help with recruitment and retention <e> <s> special assistance is being given to teachers for london <e> <s> there is also an interesting innovation whereby ilea entered into an arrangement for housing for teachers in london <e> <s> indeed the secretary of state intends to help with the housing of teachers in london <e> <s> help is also provided to encourage mature people to return to the profession and the teaching as a career unit is helping substantially with the recruitment and retention of teachers <e> <s> the campaign is most vigorous and i hope that in the future we shall see a buoyancy in the recruitment of teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords the pay for teachers while they are training will vary according to the experience of the particular person <e> <s> some come highly qualified and are already graduates when they enter teacher training <e> <s> they will do the equivalent of a pgce although it will be more school based <e> <s> my understanding is that once a graduate is trained he will be treated as a graduate teacher <e> <s> non-graduates who achieve trained teacher status will be treated as non-graduate but qualified teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a specific answer to my noble friends question <e> <s> nor do i suspect that it will be possible to single out a specific number of teachers <e> <s> a large number of teachers are involved in special needs teaching and some of that will be for children with dyslexia <e> <s> however my noble friend may be interested to know that next week there is to be a specific debate on the teaching of dyslexic children <e> <s> i shall try to bring as much data to that debate as i can <e>", "<cs> my lords the particular training for a licensed teacher will largely depend on the knowledge which a teacher has at any time <e> <s> a teacher may well come in with advanced qualifications in the first instance <e> <s> it will then be a matter of teaching him to teach children <e> <s> therefore the programmes will vary according to the particular teacher <e> <s> however i can assure the noble lord that no licensed teacher will achieve qualified status unless he has the appropriate knowledge the personal qualities for teaching is competent and has classroom experience <e> <s> it will not be until those factors are satisfied that the status of qualified teacher will be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that nothing i have said has downgraded the importance of the teacher in the school <e> <s> i am not entirely in agreement with the noble lord who believes that only people who attend a four-year training course are competent <e> <s> i believe that there are considerable talents outside the classroom <e> <s> with some training those people will make excellent teachers <e> <s> i am not competent to comment on the legal profession but my lay understanding is that there is an articled legal process <e>", "<cs> my lords all the initiatives which i have outlined in the course of answering this question at least show that the government take very seriously the issue of supply of teachers <e> <s> all the imaginative and innovative steps that are being taken are designed to provide more teachers competent in the classroom <e>", "<cs> my lords there is much in what my noble friend says <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an interesting point <e> <s> we need to break the mould of view that only teachers who go to teacher training college for four years are competent to teach in our schools <e> <s> there are many ways into the classroom <e> <s> the important thing is a good knowledge of the subject competence and an aptitude for teaching children <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems that the government cannot win in the view of noble lords opposite <e> <s> the governments policy is that teachers should receive a formal training for teaching <e> <s> that is desirable <e> <s> however there is a particular problem at this time which has been identified by your lordships that is a shortage in particular subjects and a reluctance for people to enter the profession <e> <s> i believe that we have a list of imaginative schemes to get people into the classroom <e> <s> at the end of the day as long as they are qualified to teach our children we should welcome those initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords do not tempt me to comment on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say that i admire the persistence of the noble baroness in this matter <e> <s> i hope that my reply will help her <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had extremely detailed discussions on who shall be qualified <e> <s> off the top of my head i believe that a mature student who might not necessarily qualify for grant would have access to the loan facility <e> <s> i cannot be precise at this moment but we have mentioned many people who may have access to the loan facility for higher education but would not necessarily qualify for a grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i am receiving from the box the right kind of nods which i hope will reassure the noble baroness on that point <e> <s> the imporant point is that the bill now makes it possible not to go beyond that level of parity and that should there be any intention to do so it would be important for both houses to have a view about what should happen beyond that level <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed do so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a technical amendment <e> <s> the bill now contains two sets of amendments that were passed on report against the governments wishes those inserted by the noble earl lord russell who unfortunately is not with us today about amending the regulations which are the subject of the present debate and those inserted by the noble lord lord peston and the noble earl lord russell about the treatment of some students for housing benefit purposes <e> <s> noble lords will not be surprised to hear that the government are considering the position in the light <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would require the secretary of state to consult <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reference to access funds in the bill <e> <s> therefore for that reason the amendment is technically defective <e> <s> however that is not the main point i wish to make <e> <s> i believe the amendment is otiose for a number of reasons <e> <s> my right honourable friend intends to issue guidelines on the distribution of the access funds not only to the two funding councils but also to lea maintained and other institutions which fall outside the ambit of the funding councils <e> <s> the amendment of the noble baroness does not include the further education sector <e> <s> however i trust that is an oversight rather than a desire to prevent the issuing of guidance relating to the further education access fund <e> <s> the guidance has already been drafted and my right honourable friend intends to discuss it with the funding councils and others in the near future <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is correct <e> <s> the amendment is technically defective but i also believe it is unnecessary and inappropriate <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble baronesses lady david and lady seear will feel able to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it would be appropriate for me to answer in detail the specific instance raised by the noble lord <e> <s> i can say however that in real terms public support for universities has risen by per cent <e> <s> since and that support in is per cent <e> <s> higher than for <e>", "<cs> my lords the universities funding council is a very new body therefore it is important to see how it settles down to its work <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is frustrating if universities are kept waiting for information about their allocations <e> <s> however the government are changing the framework to make it easier for universities to respond to the needs of students and employers in three ways by shifting the balance of public funding towards the student fee by encouraging the ufc in its introduction of a funding method which contains an element of competition and by encouraging higher education to establish a broader funding base <e>", "<cs> my lords to my knowledge data are being collected all the time <e> <s> however as we now have a new system running it is important that the government continue to monitor it to see how it is working <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will agree that it is better to have less rather than more government interference with the ufc <e>", "<cs> my lords bloomsbury health authority has agreed to a service plan for designed to make savings of million so that it can clear its recurrent income and expenditure deficit <e> <s> no decisions affecting the specific services for mentally ill people will be agreed until the authority discusses the districts mental health strategy at its next meeting later this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the government are well aware of the concerns he has expressed in this exchange <e> <s> in fact i can go further than that by mentioning some of the statistics <e> <s> thirty per cent <e> <s> of the acute mentally ill in-patients in bloomsbury are homeless which presents a particular problem <e> <s> i believe that the question is precipitate at this time in that there is a great deal of reorganisation taking place with regard to health provision in this part of london as the noble lord well knows <e> <s> the department is reconsidering its policies in relation to the homeless and the mentally ill <e> <s> i believe that much of what is being done in the bloomsbury health authority is designed to produce better more effective and more efficient services for this category of patient <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an issue which concerns noble lords on all sides of the house <e> <s> it is an especially difficult area of provision for the health service <e> <s> as regards the resources which will go the health service generally it is not the amount of resources which is important but their deployment <e> <s> much of the reorganisation and reconsideration of the current strategy for patients is designed to make better use of the resources <e> <s> therefore in that sense the question is precipitate <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be specific in my answer <e> <s> however i can say that there are extra resources and that their application will be interesting <e> <s> i say that because much of the application will be in exploratory areas to ascertain the most effective way of bringing treatment to these people in london <e>", "<cs> my lords the small number of participants in the debate has more than been made up by the quality of the contributions that we have heard <e> <s> it has been one of the most interesting debates we have had in this house for some time <e> <s> i agree that this basic and fundamental subject is overwhelmingly important <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> of course i include that organisation in my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> i cannot comment on the correspondence between the secretary of the association and the chairman of education <e> <s> i can say that dudley education authority has a responsibility and an obligation in consultation with timothys parents to ensure that appropriate provision is made for his future <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i suggest that we reconvene in committee upon the bill at half past eight <e>", "<cs> statutory arrangements for consultation already apply to the appointment of scottish health board members and are not changed by this bill <e> <s> i shall repeat my first sentence as it is important <e> <s> statutory arrangements for consultation already apply to the appointment of scottish health board members and are not changed by this bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science has approved of the proposals for grant-maintained status which have so far reached him for decision <e> <s> more schools have now been approved for grant-maintained status than the number of secondary schools in over half of english leas <e> <s> some schools were in being last september and there are now such schools <e> <s> a further eight will open in september and a further proposals have been published and will reach ministers for decision in a few weeks time <e> <s> a further five more proposals are awaited following parental ballots which have gone in favour of grant-maintained status <e> <s> in total ballots have taken place in schools of whch have voted in favour of grant-maintained status and have voted against <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday i heard the shadow secretary for education declare that that was the intention of the labour party <e> <s> however it would be difficult to square with the idea that people should have a choice in these matters <e> <s> we would certainly oppose any denial of choice <e>", "<cs> no my lords not without notice <e> <s> however the information regarding which schools have opted out and where they are situated is available <e> <s> i can send the noble lord a list of the schools if he wishes it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course early days yet but certainly all the signs are encouraging <e> <s> it is right to say that in every single case applications for places at the grant-maintained schools are substantially greater than in previous years <e> <s> in most cases applications have increased by or per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case <e> <s> it is certainly true that some of the schools which have opted out have been threatened with amalgamation or closure but only per cent <e> <s> of the schools which have been approved for opting out were scheduled for closure by their leas at the time of the parental ballot <e> <s> of those schools only three of the schools where ballots have been held but where decisions have not yet been taken were scheduled for closure at the time of the ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle of choice is a real one but as regards giving every single child in the country the finance to attend the school of his parents choice within certain constraints parents have the widest possible practicable choice <e> <s> however specific rules are set down as regards providing transport for pupils <e> <s> it is not open to all children to have transport to any school of their parents choice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is correct in that assumption <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> figure that she mentioned refers to central costs for running education <e> <s> when a school becomes grant-maintained it receives a percentage of its bureaucratic costs from the authority <e> <s> on average that amounts to about per cent <e> <s> of its direct running costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that this matter represents a form of bribery <e> <s> i know that the grant-maintained sector which is growing all the time obtains a proportion of the capital moneys which are available to schools <e> <s> many schools which are not grant-maintained will have received large sums of money such as the sum mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> i cannot comment specifically on the case of audenshaw except to say that the school is proving a great success and is very popular with the children within that area <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be precipitate of me to make a statement before the parliamentary question is answered later today in another place <e> <s> however i can say that the choice of school to which to send their children is one that should be exercised fully by all parents <e> <s> i am not prepared to comment specifically as to whether or not that choice is made on the basis of race <e> <s> i believe that the principle of being able to choose the school to which one sends ones children should be upheld so far as is practicable <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an interpretation that i accept <e> <s> if parents do not wish their child to go to a particular school for whatever reason and it may be that they do not have to give a reason for choosing a school though i prefer to think of it as a positive rather than a negative choice in favour of a particular school then i believe that that choice should be upheld <e> <s> the alternative would be to legislate for parents not to make a choice and to have a category of reasons for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that <e> <s> it is not a good interpretation of what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe very sincerely that it frees schools from the dead hand of local authorities <e> <s> i have spent a good deal of my time in committees dealing with operational matters affecting schools <e> <s> schools should not have to wait for a local education authority committee to determine operational matters affecting them <e> <s> it should be for the school head staff governors and parents to make operational decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords the thrust of the education reform act is to pass operational decision-making to school level <e> <s> i support that <e> <s> i believe that there are some very real examples of the effect of the dead hand of the local authority <e> <s> i prefer to see the local authority working alongside schools being supportive and advising but not becoming involved in the operation of the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed and do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> in lieu thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for most of the comments that have been made in this short discussion <e> <s> perhaps i may first answer the query of the noble baroness <e> <s> i gave two reasons for the minor but important changes <e> <s> first a requirement is put very specifically on the secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science held a series of meetings which were very constructive with the teacher unions and employers toward the end of last year <e> <s> he is considering carefully the points put to him and will make a further statement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised to hear that i do not agree with his description of the waiting time <e> <s> the government have been actively seeking a solution to this problem <e> <s> it is essential for the future of education in this country that we get the new arrangements right <e> <s> it is not a simple matter and there are no easy answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i profoundly disagree with everything that the noble lord said <e> <s> i believe that there is widespread agreement that the burnham committee did not serve teachers very well at all and that the hope is that when a solution is found to the problems of negotiating teachers pay it will be a lasting and effective one <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that one of the options was a reference to greater local flexibility in pay and that indeed would answer the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed very modest about my own contribution in these matters <e> <s> however i believe there is widespread agreement that the national curriculum framework and the issue of assessment are very important to our education system <e> <s> the secretary of state is constantly meeting interested parties in this matter and will continue to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole thrust of the education reform act was to provide a good and effective service for our children <e> <s> i hope that we shall continue to keep in mind the children of our country when we discuss these issues <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the government will continue to support teachers in the way that they have done so far and will fund through the revenue support grant <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very important point <e> <s> the vast majority of teachers in this country serve our children very well indeed <e> <s> i think that the point made by the noble lord was that sometimes in our debates we forget that it is children about whom we are talking <e> <s> that is the point that my noble friend was making <e>", "<cs> my lords the parents of our school children will be distinctly depressed about a major union that has decided well in advance of the coming pay rounds to take strike action <e> <s> i hope that that can be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely happy to repeat that we believe that the vast majority of our teachers do a very good job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree <e> <s> i believe that talk of strikes and actual strikes have a damaging effect on the education of our school children <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that on this issue there is more to unite us than divide us <e> <s> certainly the debate that was begun by the noble lord lord callaghan has been effectively acted upon and parliament has decided in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords in defending my noble friend i have to say that sadly it is the minority who grab the headlines and the minority who set the tone in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords for a fourth time i am happy to pay tribute in this debate to the vast <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment to take a break in the committees proceedings <e> <s> i suggest that we reconvene at pm <e>", "<cs> if we have smiled a little during the course of this debate i hope that i can assure the noble baroness her noble kinsman and all members of the committee that it does not detract in the slightest from the seriousness of this issue <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for raising this important issue which gives me the opportunity to offer reassurance and to emphasise that the government recognise the importance of the issues she has raised <e>", "<cs> this amendment calls for a unified complaints system for health service users <e> <s> the national health service is not however a homogeneous body <e> <s> it has two separate wings in the hospital and family practitioner services each with its own structure and employment conditions making the imposition of a single complaints procedure impracticable <e>", "<cs> i meant the scottish version <e>", "<cs> the first subsection of the amendment is unnecessary because regional health authorities already perform the functions which the amendment seeks to transfer to the new body <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to establish another national quango whose purpose would apparently be to separate regional health authorities from their responsibilities for funding and overseeing the work of community health councils <e>", "<cs> i shall begin by speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and b on accommodation <e> <s> it has long been government policy that hospitals should have facilities to enable parents to stay with children <e> <s> nothing in <e>", "<cs> in the future as now the majority of patients will receive treatment locally <e> <s> under the new arrangements when there is the opportunity to obtain a better quality of treatment for example because it can be provided more quickly a patient will be given the choice by his or her doctor of going to a hospital some distance away <e> <s> a district health authoritys objective will be to place contracts in line with gps preferences <e> <s> that will ensure that patients do not travel for treatment unless it means better treatment <e>", "<cs> the committee will be aware that this issue was debated in some detail during consideration of the health and medicines act in <e> <s> the governments position remains essentially the same <e> <s> the vast majority of regional and district health authorities conduct their business in as open a manner as possible <e> <s> they are already required by law to do so <e> <s> all regional and district health authority meetings are at present and will continue to be subject to the public bodies admissions to meeting act <e> <s> this requires health authorities to give public notice of the time and place of their meetings to supply copies of the agenda to any newspaper that requests it to provide them with reasonable reporting facilities and to open their meetings to the public unless the authority resolves they should be excluded because of the confidential nature of the business to be transacted <e>", "<cs> i wish to make one comment <e> <s> there is a very real commitment on the part of the government to openness in all matters concerning the health authorities <e> <s> in the course of my reply i spelt out a rather cumbersome and expensive system <e> <s> it is a matter of striking a balance between getting the maximum amount of openness and not putting on health authorities an unnecessary financial burden <e> <s> i have given a promise that i will read very carefully what has been said <e> <s> in the meantime i hope that the amendment can be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to those already expressed to the noble baroness lady david for allowing this very important subject to be discussed <e> <s> although few members have spoken in the debate it has certainly not lacked quality <e> <s> as i know most of the speakers personally i know that the experience they have brought to the debate is considerable <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i listened with care and interest to the points made by the noble lord lord hunter and the support that he enjoyed from the noble lords lord butterfield and lord kilmarnock <e> <s> i note the points that he made including that relating to the experience in canada <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> in so doing i suggest that the committee does not reconvene on the bill before twenty-five past eight <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> gps in a fund-holding practice will be able to purchase for their patients certain hospital inpatient and day-case treatment as well as a majority of outpatient services and diagnostic tests <e> <s> the cost of prescriptions will also be met from the fund <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> we have considerable sympathy with the aim of the amendment which is to improve the availability of organs for transplant surgery <e> <s> the government are committed to the organ transplant programme and are anxious to see the supply of donor organs increased <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate and i am encouraged by the narrowness of the gap that divides the governments views from what has been said during the debate <e> <s> the nature of the gap relates to how public accountability and quality assurance are achieved <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> the issue is not that there should not be some monitoring of the quality of service <e>", "<cs> i referred to that point specifically <e> <s> however perhaps i did not mention the noble lord lord kilmarnock in doing so <e> <s> that is <e>", "<cs> i addressed myself at length to the issue of monitoring standards <e> <s> i still believe that the debate centres on how that should be achieved <e> <s> i also mentioned that some bodies will be as indpendent as possible from the national health service <e> <s> one hopes that the professional institutions operate at more than arms length from the accountability and managerial responsibilities of the national health service <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make two brief comments in response <e> <s> first there will be an incentive for the district health authorities to obtain the best value for money <e> <s> i know that that causes concern but the two factors that will have to be taken into account are the quality of services and the cost effectiveness of those services <e>", "<cs> i note the noble lords comments about what he deemed to be the inflexibility of the governments response to points made <e> <s> he attempted to pre-empt my reply <e> <s> perhaps i may say that this chamber does an effective job as a revising chamber <e> <s> much legislation leaves it revised and better for the effectiveness and flexibility of the responses from these benches <e>", "<cs> i agree with almost everything that the noble baroness said <e> <s> there are a number of initiatives and campaigns one has only to think of the look after your heart campaign <e> <s> smoking has an impact on heart conditions <e> <s> no smoking in hospitals should be the norm and the governments circular asked all health authorities to introduce no-smoking policies <e> <s> an increasing number have done so and we are aware that the anti-smoking activities of health authorities have increased in recent years <e> <s> we are reconsidering how to update our advice to health authorities <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i suggest that the committee stage of the bill be resumed at pm <e>", "<cs> there is no doubt that child care facilities can have a major impact on the ability of employers including health authorities to recruit and retain staff <e> <s> they can also have an impact on the ability of women to combine raising a family with paid employment outside the home <e> <s> it is only right therefore that we should be concerned as is the amendment with seeking to ensure that where child care is provided it is safe caring and educationally stimulating <e> <s> that is provided for in the children act <e> <s> the act updates and modernises the regulation of both private and voluntary child care and childminding facilities for children aged under eight years <e>", "<cs> it is fair to say that nhs establishments will not be able to neglect the issue if they want nurses back in their hospitals <e> <s> if a need is proven the schemes will be established <e> <s> we say that it should not become a requirement on all establishments to set up such a scheme because there is a cost <e> <s> where local need is proven local schemes will be established <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the clause consists of a number of technical amendments to the national assistance act <e> <s> their general thrust is to make it clear that local authorities can make arrangements for the provision of services with both the private and voluntary sectors <e> <s> as such they form one of the corner-stones of our new community care policy because they give local authorities the power they need to develop a mixed economy of care <e> <s> by using their considerable purchasing power skilfully local authorities should be able to promote the <e>", "<cs> i can give an unequivocal answer <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> whether the person is suffering from an alcohol-related problem from drug abuse or whatever it may be if a local authority deems there to be a need for provision it is the local authoritys duty to respond to that need <e> <s> those groups are included <e> <s> it will be for local authorities to determine first the need and secondly the provision <e>", "<cs> in response to that we shall look at the point most carefully between now and the report stage <e> <s> i can say that if there is deemed to be a need and the problem is one of mental handicap then the local authority has an obligation to respond <e>", "<cs> i must confirm that there is no intention of excluding any group that is deemed to require community care or nursing provision <e> <s> i said that we need to think further about how best to ensure that the service is effective <e> <s> that will probably take the form of guidelines but i wish to return to this at report stage <e>", "<cs> that will be taken into account <e> <s> i must emphasise that it will be for local authorities to decide how they plan to make provision for all client groups deemed to be in need in the community care plans <e> <s> therefore it would be difficult to name a group <e> <s> by naming one we suggest implicitly that the others have been excluded <e>", "<cs> as we have discussed in going through clause the clause covers the provision of accommodation and welfare services enabling local authorities to make arrangements for the provision of care in private and voluntary homes for people assessed as needing that form of care <e> <s> it enables authorities to employ as their agents in the provision of welfare services individuals and organisations as well as voluntary organisations <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that the purpose behind making these provisions is to encourage local authorities and enable them to select from the full range of available provision that which best meets <e>", "<cs> there are two responses <e> <s> first it is my understanding that all employers are bound by the race discrimination laws and those regarding discrimination against people with disabilities <e> <s> therefore all employers would be bound in any event by the law as it stands <e> <s> equally it would be open to any local authority when making contractual arrangements to determine their own parts of the <e>", "<cs> the authorities would be entirely free to concern themselves with such factors <e>", "<cs> so far as i am aware there will be guidelines <e> <s> however if i have misled members of the committee in any way i shall put the matter right at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> in so doing perhaps i may suggest that the committee meet again not before pm <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this is an important issue <e> <s> there is no doubt that the introduction of reforms can be unsettling not only for the staff but also for the recipients of the service namely the patients <e> <s> therefore i hope that i can assure members of the committee about the governments concern in the area <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by assuring the noble lord lord peston that i do not intend to respond to the amendment as an issue of resources but more one of genuine concern that the needs of any client group or individual will be excluded from the planning process and thereby will be denied health or community care provision <e>", "<cs> i am greatly comforted by that intervention <e> <s> when i saw the amendment i had to ask what it meant <e> <s> i believe that it is accepted that we are talking about those illnesses from which few people suffer <e> <s> we are also concerned with complex cases in which somebody may have a main illness which may be a mental handicap and also suffer from one of the illnesses which have been described or from multiple disabilities <e> <s> we are anxious that people with substantial care needs should not be overlooked in our local authority provision <e> <s> we have already in connection with clause talked about which people are covered by the broad term community care services <e> <s> we reassured noble lords then and i do so again now that we include any person for whom it appears to a local authority that it may provide or arrange for the provision of community care services <e> <s> that includes disabled people which in the terms of the national assistance act covers people with communicative disorders which would include blindness and <e>", "<cs> i listened with care to what the noble lord lord carter had to say about the interrelation of services for children and community care services <e> <s> the government share his concern that the two sectors should be managed as effectively as possible and that the boundary between the two does not cause any problems <e> <s> it is a well-established fact that territorial disputes are most unproductive <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend will accept that i am unable to give a specific reply to that question at this time <e> <s> in view of the promise that these amendments will not be pressed this afternoon we shall all have time to consider that point <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend and make the reply available to the noble lord lord carter <e>", "<cs> i think that my response addressed the issue of properly serving the needs of both children and adults and also the transitional point where children become adults <e> <s> we are all concerned about effective working relationships that transcend both the provisions for children and for adults <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> in so doing perhaps i may suggest that the committee resumes not before ten minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> this is an important subject which has exercised the minds of members of this chamber on many occasions <e> <s> we have already outlined what we see as the major purpose of clause in requiring local authorities to prepare and publish plans which are compatible with those of other agencies involved in the provision of community care <e> <s> we will be issuing more detailed guidance on the interface between health and social service authorities <e> <s> essentially we want them to agree on how they will handle arrangements for the care of people in whom they have a mutual interest <e>", "<cs> i understand the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i certainly take it on board <e> <s> if during the course of my response i have not adequately addressed her point then we shall see where the amendment leads us and perhaps meet in order to discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> i understand that if problems occur in this respect the direction-making powers in clause can be used to address them <e> <s> however i <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require the social services authority to carry out an assessment whenever it is asked to do so <e> <s> clause as drafted provides that a local authority must carry out an assessment whenever it appears to it that a person may need community care <e> <s> the wording was deliberately chosen to reflect the situation in which a person presents himself to a social services department and asks what can be done for him <e> <s> at that stage the social services department does not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite wrong to suggest that the bill does not lay an obligation on local authorities <e> <s> clause does just that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is raising his expectations of what may happen from here on <e> <s> the discretion that he is reading into clause is there for precisely the reason raised by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e> <s> where the local authority deems that there is no case to take the assessment further it may choose not to do so <e> <s> the obligation to make an assessment where it is needed is contained in clause <e> <s> i do not believe that there is any more to consider on that matter <e>", "<cs> we are in sympathy with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> clearly people requiring an assessment of their needs and those caring for them need to know quite clearly and understand what services the local authority may be able to provide to meet those needs <e> <s> i am sure that many authorities will quickly institute the kind of written procedure that the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> the guidance which the department of health is in the process of preparing will take on board this and other points from our discussions in committee in order to advise and support local authorities in setting up the systems they will need to have available for assessment <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i did not hear the end of the noble lords question <e> <s> perhaps he will be kind enough to clarify his request <e>", "<cs> when considering this amendment one must refer to a corresponding provision in the chronically sick and disabled persons act together with section of the act <e> <s> a duty is imposed on local authorities to assess a disabled persons need for day and domiciliary care and other forms of support to enable them to remain in their own homes <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that it is preferable if at all possible to keep such persons in their own home and that that should be the first priority <e> <s> only if that is not possible should residential care be resorted to <e> <s> the amendment precludes that <e>", "<cs> we appreciate the friendly atmosphere in which these amendments are being discussed but the remarks of the noble lord lord peston belie the enormous amount of work and thought that have gone into the responses from these benches <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords the facts simply do not bear out anything that the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i shall deal with just one inaccurate figure that the noble lord gave concerning agency staff <e> <s> of all staff employed in the national health service only per cent <e> <s> are agency nurses and of that figure per cent <e> <s> are employed in greater london <e> <s> as i said in my initial answer there will always be particular difficulties with specialisms in certain areas but the facts that <e> <s> i gave in that answer do not bear out anything that the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that nurses leave the health service for retirement pregnancy family reasons and other reasons <e> <s> however the figures again show that there has been a net gain to the nursing service <e> <s> some nurses a year leave nursing in england but in to that figure was mors than covered by new nurses qualifying <e> <s> in addition nurses returned to nursing <e> <s> that made a total of nurses <e> <s> that represents a net gain to the nursing service <e>", "<cs> my lords i can list a number of things the government are doing as regards improving recruitment and retention of nurses <e> <s> a massive advertising campaign is being conducted and has already produced inquiries about nursing as <e> <s> a career <e> <s> there are a number of district health authorities which are targeting mature entrants and re-entrants to the service <e> <s> pay has increased in real terms by per cent <e> <s> there is a pilot scheme of flexible pay arrangements which enables more money to be paid for particular specialisms and scarce specialisms <e> <s> there are local initiatives flexible working job sharing schemes and child care schemes <e> <s> the department of health is supporting the open colleges return to nursing project which is offering a package of resource materials that will be launched in september <e> <s> i could go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to particular shortages <e> <s> i have described some of the ways in which those shortages are being addressed by different district health authorities <e> <s> a considerable amount of work is being carried out in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i have read the press reports published today <e> <s> i believe they did a great disservice to the amount of work that is being carried out in many district and regional health authorities <e> <s> i checked one of the reports concerning a health authority which was deemed to be the fourth worst in the country <e> <s> i must report that that authority had qualified staff in post at the end of march this year <e> <s> that is nurses up on the previous year <e> <s> that figure represents the highest number of qualified staff at the end of the year <e> <s> if one asks health authorities whether they are having difficulties in recruiting nurses the answer is yes <e> <s> however if one asks them whether nurses are in post after many of the efforts that i have outlined have been made the answer is that the nurses are in post <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have covered the particular difficulties experienced by some local authorities <e> <s> i have also outlined the enormous efforts that are being made by many district health authorities to improve recruitment and to face up to the difficulties that will occur when a shortage among the people available for nursing arises due to the fall in the numbers of year-olds in the population <e>", "<cs> my lords it is much too early to give a specific answer to that question <e> <s> however eventually all nurses will be trained under the auspices of project and will receive the maximum relief for the community charge <e> <s> if a special case were made for nurses it would discriminate quite considerably against many young people who earn the same as student nurses <e>", "<cs> my lords the department is in touch with all those bodies all the time <e> <s> i believe that that is right and should continue <e> <s> however i also prefer to deal in facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the remarks of the noble lord were comments rather than a question <e> <s> however had that part of the question been addressed i could have proved that there was no exploitation of these young people <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is a misunderstanding about the purpose of this clause <e> <s> its purpose is to provide to persons authorised by the secretary of state the power to inspect certain premises <e> <s> the persons authorised will normally be members of the social service inspectorate or nursing and medical staff of the department of health in england and their opposite numbers in scotland and wales <e> <s> the premises are those premises in which community care services are provided and in respect of which no power of inspection exists in other legislation <e> <s> this means unregistered residential care homes and day centres and similar establishments <e>", "<cs> i believe that what i said was consistent with what my noble friend said on the previous amendment <e> <s> first the provision covers those premises that are not subject to inspection premises where the local authority will have contracted to provide services <e> <s> therefore three things are being inspected the premises themselves the provision that is provided from those premises and the way in which the local authority has exercised its function in contracting with those premises <e> <s> my noble friend on the other hand is concerned about the specific provision for a particular patient and the records that pertain to that patient <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to permit someone who is authorised by the secretary of state to examine any medical records which are held on premises being inspected whether or not they relate to care or treatment that is provided on those premises <e> <s> it is that blanket approval to examine records that is causing concern <e> <s> however there is a further confusion here to which the noble lord lord winstanley referred <e> <s> a doctor may be concerned about the medical condition of a particular patient <e> <s> he will have access to the medical records anyway if he is the patients doctor <e> <s> if he is not the patients doctor but is concerned about the care that the patient is receiving no doubt he will alert the patients doctor to that problem and the case will be investigated <e> <s> we are confusing again the inspection of premises and the inspection of the quality of care that is provided on those premises and access to medical records concerning the treatment of a particular patient <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peston referred i use his words to bumbling along with the gifted amateur <e> <s> that reference was unfortunate and i was grateful to the noble lord lord winstanley for his qualification and the subsequent confirmation from the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i was also grateful for the comments made by my noble friend lord mancroft who referred to the special contribution made by the voluntary sector which is very often significant and complementary to that of the professionals <e> <s> it is therefore important to place on record the value of the voluntary sector and we must lay the ghost of the reference to bumbling along <e>", "<cs> i say with equal vigour that a considerable part of the voluntary sector with or without our help makes a significant contribution <e> <s> we do not have to bumble along with them <e> <s> their training needs are often met from within their own organisations <e>", "<cs> i believe i addressed the point in terms of how one local authority will work with other local authorities in this area <e> <s> it is important that there is now a qualification of what ordinary residence means <e> <s> i must also refer to the sums of money that will be passed to local authorities which will increase their budgets and enable them to cope with community care <e> <s> there will be more money available and it will be important for local authorities to address the problem of the very people of whom my noble friend is speaking when making their plans for their areas <e> <s> that will include people whether or not homeless who reside in those areas at the time of need <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed and in moving the motion i suggest that the committee meet again at quarter past eight <e>", "<cs> this amendment would require the secretary of state to set up an inquiry if asked to do so by any disabled organisation which alleged that a local authority had failed to provide community care <e> <s> we believe this to be wholly unrealistic and the amendment is cast in far too wide and general terms <e> <s> the secretary of state would have to respond to any request by setting up a full inquiry in accordance with this provision <e>", "<cs> certainly i am not against offering the possibility of talks between now and report stage <e> <s> the particular concern is that any grievances can be heard by an individual carer or an organisation <e> <s> the question is whether we put on the face of the bill a power which any organisation can simply request namely a full inquiry <e>", "<cs> at this moment i cannot give the specific power <e> <s> however there is a right for people to complain <e> <s> i need to come back to give details of the specific part of the bill which gives an individual the right to bring a complaint against an authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the few moments of respite in order i hope to meet the very real concerns of all members of the committee who have spoken <e> <s> i understand that the power for complaints will be a new clause contained within amendment no <e> <s> fc <e> <s> i am also advised that organisations or carers can bring complaints or make representations on behalf of other service users <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord renton will be keen to make sure that that is legally correct <e> <s> i am advised legally speaking that the term person includes a body of persons corporate or incorporate so that organisations can make representations on behalf of a client <e> <s> i hope that with that assurance the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that amendment no <e> <s> fc will put a very proper formal complaints procedure into this bill <e> <s> does my noble fiend feel able to absorb the impact of that amendment before deciding whether to press this one <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may point out to the noble lord lord ennals that section aa ends with the words <e>", "<cs> in the light of what has been said this evening we shall certainly look again at the wording <e>", "<cs> i understand and sympathise with the objective underlying this amendment which as i understand it is that the director of social services shall have the necessary authority and accountability for the discharge of his responsibilities <e> <s> i entirely endorse the objective <e> <s> the question is whether it can be achieved by statute <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i can comment specifically on tower hamlets <e> <s> i can confirm to the noble lord that the secretary of states approval is required where the social services take on functions <e>", "<cs> i was trying hard not to become embroiled in the instances concerning this particular authority <e> <s> i shall repeat what i said earlier if the director of social services is to carry out other functions the authority must have the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> if an authority embarked upon any unorthodox activity i am sure that the social services inspectorate would wish to watch closely to ensure that services were delivered effectively <e> <s> i have recently been advised that approval has so far been withheld by the secretary of state in tower hamlets <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i think that we are indeed discussing two different matters <e> <s> i think that i made clear in my first answer that social services directors must be free to organise their departments either on a patch basis or by some other arrangement so long as the structure is understood and the services are delivered effectively into the community <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to increase the basic weekly rate of severe disablement allowance to the basic rate of invalidity benefit <e> <s> both the benefits are available to people who are long-term sick <e> <s> people who have been in recent work qualify for invalidity benefit after they have been receiving statutory sick pay or sickness benefit <e> <s> severe disablement allowance is aimed at people who do not have the necessary record of national insurance contributions to take them on to invalidity benefit <e> <s> in other

allowance because of the test and we have already made special arrangements to help those families meet the presence conditions <e> <s> i went on to give a particular example of a family which had spent a number of successive postings out of the country but nevertheless a way was found to establish residence qualifications in this country <e> <s> that is a point which will be part of the review

the point that the student loan system more than made up for the loss of benefit <e> <s> the same arguments apply to the normal student as to the deaf student <e> <s> on that point we have to disagree

support payable and indeed also for assessment of supplementary benefit previously any maintenance received is taken fully into account <e> <s> in this respect it is similar to most other types of income <e>", "<cs> my job has almost been done for me <e> <s> this amendment seeks to reduce the scope for action available to the courts in proceedings taken by the secretary of state to enforce a

non-dependent deduction made from that persons housing benefit <e> <s> the amendment is flawed in two respects <e> <s> first and most obviously there is no guarantee that such an amount would be paid over to the person remaining in the prisoners former dwelling <e> <s> secondly there would be administrative complexities involved in identifying where a deduction continues to be made <e> <s> i shall return to that point in a moment <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to change the provisions for and year-olds by providing unlimited entitlement to income support for young women at any stage of pregnancy unable to secure a yts place <e>", "<cs> it is not possible to reply specifically because i do not know the reasons why the young lady refused the place <e> <s> the training agency would be

comprehensive health services for children as the amendment proposes <e> <s> the secretary of state already has a clear duty to provide a comprehensive range of health services under section of the act <e> <s> that duty will be delegated to health authorities through the definition of their primary functions <e> <s> the definition must include services for children <e> <s> district health

will be a requirement to provide an integrated comprehensive child health service to meet the needs of children within the area <e> <s> it will make demands on the education services on the social services departments of councils and on the medical services <e> <s> there must be a strategy to meet those needs across the board <e> <s> we all agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of

are not met they will be picked up through management accountability <e> <s> there are powers in the bill which are more than sufficient to back up matters and ensure that thsoe needs are met <e>",

large we are talking about medical needs because some of the educational needs are also medical needs for example young children with dyslexia <e> <s> there will be some quantification of those needs

social services department <e> <s> i suspect that the powers are peppered throughout the bill <e> <s> i am not being very specific and if that answer is incomplete i shall write to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me if i am suspicious of his flattery <e> <s> of course i am totally seized of the sensitivity <e> <s> i hope that he will not as i believe he did cast doubts on my sensitivity in the answer that i shall give <e> <s> once again the noble baroness has raised this important issue and has done so in a most sensitive way <e> <s> it is a difficult issue to talk about in isolation and one that she strongly feels has been neglected under the present system <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble baroness is making the same point made by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> one very small part of the service has been identified and it is desired to deal with it in detail on the face of the bill <e> <s> i suspect that there is not a health authority in the country that does not have to deal with problems of incontinence in the community and therefore that subject must be addressed by health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has been very tolerant <e> <s> with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that the distinction we made in the past on that issue was the distinction between guidance and guidelines <e> <s> guidance is by far the stronger of the two <e> <s> i was referring to guidance <e> <s> i should also say that with guidance and the combination of the new reforms there is a much better opportunity to first identify the needs and publish plans secondly ensure that that service is properly delivered and where it is not delivered ensure that there is a mechanism to see that something is done about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the first paragraph of the amendment puts on the secretary of state the duty of setting up an authority to establish and fund community health councils <e> <s> the national health service act does much the same in section and the secretary of state in the community health <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made a number of accusations indeed he has certainly done so during the course of the evening <e> <s> i think that he referred to the fact that we were denigrating the role of chcs <e> <s> i give him an absolute assurance that that is not what we have sought to do <e> <s> my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary made clear only two days ago that the government have no plans for changing the role of community health councils let alone denigrating them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the first grant maintained schools started in september <e> <s> by september there will be at least in existence <e> <s> therefore the grant maintained sector will have more than doubled in size within one year <e>", "<cs> my lords we regret that some leas have certainly chosen in the past to be obstructive <e> <s> i am sure noble lords will agree that it is very much in the interests of all our children that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble baroness that all factors are taken into account <e> <s> they would include the views of people in the local community of the schools of the governors and of the parents <e> <s> after those factors are taken into account decisions are then made <e> <s> only this morning for example highwood school had its application for grant maintained status rejected on the grounds that the application was believed to be damaging to provision in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be specific for each of those schools because the spending per pupil in each lea differs between leas and between schools <e> <s> however i can promise that average and specific spending figures will be sent to the noble baroness <e> <s> funding of grant maintained schools is carried out on precisely the same basis as for other schools within an leas control <e> <s> the only difference is that grant maintained schools are allowed to spend a percentage of the moneys that would normally have been spent centrally which is an average of per cent <e> <s> that additional money is often put to much better use when it is spent by a grant maintained school as an individual institution <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figure is higher that can only be due to the fact that the grant maintained schools spend an additional per cent <e> <s> of money that would normally be spent centrally <e> <s> therefore that says something about what is being spent centrally rather than on schools themselves <e> <s> there is a criticism that too much money is being spent by local education authorities centrally and not w here it really matters which is at the chalk face to benefit children <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the point i have just made <e> <s> the grant maintained schools are putting that per cent <e> <s> of money which was previously spent on bureaucratic matters to better use <e> <s> the money that is being held centrally is perhaps not reaching the areas that it should reach which is the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is an understanding between the government department and schools <e> <s> however many local education authorities are still withholding too much money centrally <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a good point <e> <s> it is possible for grant maintained schools to work happily and constructively alongside other schools within local education authorities <e> <s> the government are enthusiastic about this policy and hope that local education authorities and grant maintained schools will work together in the interests of the children <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply cannot agree <e> <s> the evidence so far shows that grant-maintained schools are playing their full part within the community <e>", "<cs> my lords the money received by education authorities from national and local sources is considerable <e> <s> if the noble lord means that there is a case for reducing bureaucracy at both national and local level i have to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord explained the purpose of the amendment is to increase the basic weekly rate of severe disablement allowance to the basic weekly rate of invalidity benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not comforted by the fact that i did not spot that mistake in my previous presentation <e> <s> i am only comforted by the fact that so many other people did not spot it <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment if carried would prevent the government from carrying out their policy of withdrawing income support and housing benefit from most students <e> <s> by doing so it would lead to a substantial increase in public expenditure and maintain the inappropriate administrative burden that student claims place on local authorities and department of social security local offices <e> <s> the amendment goes even wider <e> <s> it would maintain against our intent the current position whereby students can claim income support during the summer vacation <e> <s> top-up loans are intended to provide financial support over the whole academic year <e> <s> to allow able-bodied students to have recourse to an income maintenance benefit such as income support would result in an element of double provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give assurances on both points <e> <s> the regulations will not be laid until this bill has received royal assent <e> <s> it is my pretty firm understanding that they are subject to the affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> my lords whether a student works in the vacation is very much a matter for the student <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment if carried would prevent the government from carrying out their policy of withdrawing unemployment benefit from most students <e> <s> that would lead to a substantial increase in public expenditure which alone would be unfortunate but the effect of this amendment goes even wider <e> <s> it would recreate an entitlement that was withdrawn in <e> <s> it would enable students to receive unemployment benefit not just in the summer vacation but also at christmas and at easter <e> <s> that would result in an inappropriate financial double provision by the state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am looking for some confirmatory nodding heads but my understanding is that a mature student would receive benefit until his contribution element ran out <e> <s> however it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> in moving this motion i suggest that the report stage should not be resumed before pm <e>", "<cs> my lords clause is a provision which relates specifically to widows <e> <s> the amendment seeks to extend the effect of the provision to widowers <e> <s> in doing so it reflects in part an opposition amendment which was put down in another place and was subsequently withdrawn after debate <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was raised and debated at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> it proposes that of any maintenance payments made in any week in respect of one or more children should be disregarded when calculating income for benefit purposes <e> <s> this will be a change from current practice whereby the full amount of maintenance paid is taken into account

think of donated assets but i cannot think of a liability at the moment <e> <s> therefore if there is confusion on that point we shall wait for a very quick example which may come from the box but if not i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i say that i have not changed my answer but expanded it as a result of the question <e> <s> i confirmed that the assumption made by the noble lord was that there was a general power there which allowed the secretary of state in one-off cases and if particular circumstances were appropriate to exclude other assets or liabilities <e> <s> as a rule they will be used only for donated assets <e>", "<cs> my lords homeless people have exactly the same rights as anybody else to health and social care

stronger than guidelines <e> <s> my understanding is that if an authority did not take note of guidance the secretary of state has the power to make directions <e> <s> in other words guidance is expected to be followed <e> <s> in the absence of it being followed and there being breaches the secretary of state can use powers so to direct <e>", "<cs> my lords it is absolutely true that effective consultation will be the key to the success of the reforms <e> <s> on that point there is no difference between what this amendment wants to achieve and what the government are looking for <e>", "<cs> my lords we have discussed on a number of occasions the difficulty of specifying some details and not others <e> <s> that leads to the risk that people will interpret the items that are not there as not being for the agenda <e> <s> another risk is that undue prominence may be given to those items that are listed in the bill <e> <s> people may believe that those items that are not listed in the bill are somehow or other less important <e> <s> as i have said local authorities are already required by the bill to consult district health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords when debating clause at committee we discussed the need for assessment for community care services to be available on request to any person <e> <s> i explained on that occasion that that was virtually the effect of the clause as drafted since it requires any local authority to carry out an assessment of any person for whom it appears the authority might arrange community care services <e> <s> the provision was intended to be as wide-ranging as possible and not to deny anybody making a request for an assessment the opportunity to have one <e> <s> the form of the assessment is of course left to the local authority to decide <e> <s> that being so i do not see the point of this amendment which does no more than require the local authority to observe a time limit on deciding whether an assessment is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to alter the present arrangements for resourcing the national health service largely through general taxation <e> <s> with regard to the assumption made in the question that per cent <e> <s> of its resources is from general taxation i put on record that per cent <e> <s> is from taxation and allocated from the consolidated fund per cent <e> <s> is nhs allocation from national insurance per cent <e> <s> is from charges and per cent <e> <s> from miscellaneous which includes land and property sales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the statement made in the preface to <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we live in a free country <e> <s> it will be for the private sector to continue to grow at the rate at which it wishes to grow <e> <s> the hope is that we shall all work together for the benefit of patients <e> <s> with regard to the assumption that the noble lord makes about underfunding i do not accept that premise <e> <s> spending has risen from billion to billion in the lifetime of this government an increase of per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> even as a percentage of gdp the record is better now than it was years ago <e> <s> as <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the statement that was made on the radio this morning <e> <s> however i cannot agree that the workers have been neglected in the pay awards this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know of any plan to charge for bed and board in the nhs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> whatever sum of money is available there will always be a demand for it <e> <s> however it is right to repeat that in terms of what the country can afford i believe that the record at the moment is second to none <e> <s> spending stands at billion <e> <s> of course if there were more money it could be spent <e> <s> it might also be interesting to note that each time taxes have been lowered revenue has been increased and spending on services has also been increased <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure i understand the particular point that the noble lord makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that he is saying that the majority of those people use it and that all taxpayers pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords it does indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat relieved that i may be encouraging to the bma <e> <s> i believe that the bma have done more to talk down the national health service than almost any other organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords however the noble lord made the case for the reforms almost as well as i did <e> <s> if we are to spend large sums of money we wish to see them spent in the most cost effective way so that they will benefit the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no hesitation in paying a tribute to all who work in the national health service <e> <s> i wish to make the distinction between those who work in the national health service and some of the quite overt and very public scaremongering that has been done in the name of the bma and which frankly has let down many professional colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i absolutely agree <e> <s> i add one factor <e> <s> i believe that money spent on prevention is also money very well spent <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a short but i believe important and very interesting debate <e> <s> it has ranged quite widely and it may be of help to remind your lordships that the order we are considering this afternoon is needed to bring into force the new rates of pay for school teachers to have them in their pockets with effect from st april <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness raised an important point <e> <s> i believe that i can meet almost all her objectives short of putting the amendment on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the debate it is clear that we still have a communication problem <e> <s> on this issue there are some perceptions which are wrong <e> <s> one perception is that local authorities will conduct all the assessments themselves <e> <s> that clearly will not be the case <e> <s> without the voluntary sector local authorities cannot cope with some of the specialised assessments that will need to be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope to receive the answer to the second part of the question before i finish speaking <e> <s> on the first part i am only just in receipt of the draft guidance that went out on friday <e> <s> i understand that it will be in the library of the house and it is available to noble lords now <e> <s> i am reluctant to quote from the draft guidance because it is up for consultation <e> <s> it is in draft form and therefore any comments that noble lords may wish to make will be welcomed by the department <e> <s> i promise to write to the noble lord on access to the complaints procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house my understanding is that in terms of finance the local authorities will contract with voluntary organisations for a general service <e> <s> in other words they will be involved in general assessment work and funds will be made available for that <e> <s> there will also be flexibility to engage in contracting for individuals <e> <s> if i am misleading the noble baroness in that reply i shall put it right in correspondence with her <e> <s> i believe that the whole essence of the contractual arrangements between the local authority and the voluntary body is to have flexibility so that all the agencies are brought into play in serving needs <e> <s> clearly the application of resources will be important <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome references to the draft guidance although we appear to be entering into criticism of it early in the day <e> <s> the department will welcome any comments which noble lords may make during the course of the documents circulation for consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to elucidate <e> <s> voluntary bodies will need to ensure that local authorities are aware of their services and the expertise which they can offer <e> <s> there will be opportunities for them to do so as part of the planning process <e> <s> as i have said that will be mentioned when drawing up specifications for services <e> <s> and there the voluntary organisations will play a role <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> where the person is ordinarily resident and is walking the streets of lambeth blackpool or manchester the place where they are when the need arises is their place of residence <e> <s> that local authority will have the responsibility of meeting the needs of that person <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation the amendment will be withdrawn <e>", "<cs> my lords that is my understanding <e> <s> a schizophrenic may well be suffering from amnesia and not know his identity or why he is in that place <e> <s> if he has a particular need to be met the authority in whose area he is is found must meet that need <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are speaking of two categories of people <e> <s> there are those who are possibly vagrants and happen to be in a particular place because they have no other place to reside and therefore are nomadic and wandering about the countryside <e> <s> there is another group of people for whom a local authority may buy in the services of a drop-in centre <e> <s> those people have a place of residence and are known in a particular area but their needs are best met by the local authority which will contract with the day centre or a particular provider of the services <e> <s> in that case money will change hands between the purchasing and providing authorities <e> <s> we are talking about two categories of people genuinely homeless nomadic people in a particular place who have a particular need and those who are properly registered who have a home address but whose need is met by the local authority purchasing services across county boundaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am muddled <e> <s> we are confusing different categories of people <e> <s> we began by discussing vagrants or schizophrenics who at a particular moment may not have a place of residence <e> <s> in that case wherever they happen to be will be their place of residence <e> <s> i believe that we are now talking also about people who pay charges who have a home in another part of the country but who happen to fall ill or have a particular need while en route to somewhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can provide an answer to that question off the cuff <e> <s> i can say for example that where a person has registered for and paid the community charge is not necessarily relevant <e> <s> it will depend on where the person has decided to live when the need for the service arises <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given a large number of answers with the leave of the house <e> <s> the questions are coming thick and fast and we are making no progress on the bill <e> <s> perhaps the noble lords will be patient and allow me to answer their specific questions in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an amendment that we discussed in some detail in committee <e> <s> the noble lord and others have expressed the view that the purpose behind the amendment is to ensure that respite care would be available if this seemed the best way of meeting a users need <e> <s> one of the great hopes of the new system as opposed to the old one is that where a local authority feels that it makes economic sense a point made by my noble friend lord swinfen it will be forced to consider respite care more seriously as a provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to oblige the noble baroness <e> <s> as i said at committee stage we shall take this anxiety away and see whether the wording of the bill can be amended <e> <s> i shall be happy to move the amendment standing in my name which inserts words into the new section c of the local authority social services act similar to those at present appearing in section of the national assistance act which is to be repealed by the bill <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will find that reassuring <e>", "<cs> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science is still receiving budget statements prepared under section of the education reform act from local education authorities <e> <s> as soon as he has received the great majority of returns the information requested by my noble friend will be published <e>", "<cs> my lords ec transport ministers agreed a second stage of air transport liberalisation measures and committed themselves to a single market in aviation by <e> <s> regulations on fares market access and capacity sharing and on the application of the competition rules to air transport were agreed <e> <s> agreement was also reached on a mandate for the opening of negotiations in aviation matters with efta <e> <s> commitments were made to adopt measures to liberalise air cargo services by st march and to deal with predatory activities by airlines <e> <s> the commissions proposals on denied boarding compensation were not however discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the generous comments of the noble baroness about the pressure by this country in respect of these matters <e> <s> i can absolutely assure her that we shall keep up that pressure <e> <s> we have been leading and will continue to lead in the field to bring about the maximum degree of liberalisation which will lead to a free fair and open competitive market in aviation <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals on denied boarding compensation will be issued for consultation and we shall hear more about them <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be precise about the date <e> <s> however i believe that there is a council meeting in july but that of course will be too early for this set of proposals <e> <s> therefore the matter will be dealt with at a meeting much closer to the september date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until five past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a fast developing area of medicine <e> <s> what were termed neonatal intensive care cots in bear little relationship to cots and their associated equipment today <e> <s> however experience has shown the number of neonatal intensive care cots at st thomass hospital to be adequate to meet most demands <e> <s> on rare occasions because of short periods when staff are not available or because there are unusually high numbers of babies requiring intensive care there may be a need to seek cots elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the press comment to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> there is an unpredictability about demand for those facilities <e> <s> as i have said on rare occasions babies will have to travel some distance for treatment <e> <s> however the facts are that infant mortality rates are improving <e> <s> it has to be said that many more babies are being treated successfully today who would not have survived only a few years ago <e> <s> we are not complacent as i think the noble lord was implying <e> <s> we are acutely aware of this area of medicine <e> <s> research and development continues <e> <s> most health authorities in particular that for south east thames have positive plans to develop that service <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the whole area of health spending needs to be put into perspective <e> <s> since waiting lists are shorter by per cent <e> <s> more patients are being treated the figure has increased by per cent <e> <s> infant mortality is down <e> <s> resources have risen since from billion to billion <e> <s> there are more doctors nurses and specialist units than ever before <e> <s> we are not complacent <e> <s> we believe that there is much to be done <e> <s> however the reforms will create an even better framework within which to build on the success of the nhs <e> <s> they include better planning and better management <e> <s> i believe that they will prevent the lurching from crisis to crisis that we have seen under the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not denying the statement <e> <s> i believe that the reference is to press comment <e> <s> it is not part of my duty to respond to that <e> <s> i am aware that more cots are needed in the area <e> <s> i have just said that the health authority in question has positive plans to develop the service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends comments <e> <s> stories that rely exclusively on death do nothing for public confidence <e> <s> they cause needless anxiety to patients and it does no service to those who care for the patients <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my nobel friend lord mccoll puts what we are talking about in perspective which is most valuable <e> <s> i believe that he is a stout defender of the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords my comments were aimed at those who spend their time exclusively talking about the negative aspects of the national health service and who pay no credit whatever to its success <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those comments <e> <s> st thomass hospital is in the forefront of pioneering research in maintaining babies for longer periods in their mothers womb so that when they are born their weight is greater they are more robust and that eliminates or reduces the need for intensive care unit facilities <e> <s> my noble friend is therefore absolutely right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> we must not be complacent but it is a matter of perspective and that is important <e> <s> i am also reminded that a few days ago the noble lord lord mellish said that there would be no moment in time when the resources that are available however generous could be enough to meet all the demands of the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords again i am grateful for those comments <e> <s> i am more than happy to join with the noble lord in his great praise for the staff of that hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to agree with my noble friend in those comments <e> <s> the people who are denigrating the national health service are those who concentrate exclusively on the negative <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never deny the noble lords right to bring these matters to the attention of the house <e> <s> my criticism concerned getting the right balance in the debate <e> <s> the noble lord has been highly condemning of a record of which we can be proud that is that waiting lists are shorter more patients are being treated more resources are being put in infant mortality is down and there are more specialist units than ever before <e> <s> there are also more doctors and nurses <e> <s> a little credit for that record would not go amiss <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the noble lord is referring to press reports of a private study made by mr michael joy consultant cardiologist at st peters hospital chertsey <e> <s> the report of this study has not yet been seen by the regional health authority <e> <s> we remain determined to tackle long waiting times for all forms of treatment <e> <s> the governments special waiting list fund of million over four years has enabled hundreds of thousands of extra patients to be treated from the waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords the specific question on the order paper refers to some independent consultants <e> <s> i believe that the particular consultant referred to is not independent but is a paid member of the health authority <e> <s> i referred to the waiting list <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an important point <e> <s> he is emphasising the need for preventive medicine <e> <s> enormous strides are being made by all health authorities which believe that a good use of resources would be to do more in the field of preventive medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i am again grateful to the noble lord for those comments <e> <s> they touch on some of the answers that i gave to the first question <e> <s> the advance of technology has meant that people are not dying because they are on waiting lists they are being saved when they otherwise might have died <e> <s> again it is a matter of perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to my noble friend i may say that i was almost tempted as a tailpiece in my response to the noble lord lord mellish to say that despite all the education and all the research we still drink too much smoke too much and do a great deal that we know will shorten our lives <e> <s> the noble lord argues for freedom i believe that debate will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord refers to industrial action <e> <s> clearly that does nothing at all for waiting lists other than exacerbate them <e> <s> on the second part of his question i agree to differ with those who believe that the reforms will not make for a better national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords again the noble lord has gone back to press comment <e> <s> he read from reports in the press regarding the consultant concerned <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord longford when speaking informally with me the other day referred to having overheard i suspect a rather chauvinistic noble lord saying that this place is becoming too heterosexual <e> <s> i take it that the remark was made in response to the number of lady peers <e>", "<cs> my lords i took the remark as being a slip of the tongue and that it was a response to the number of ladies entering the chamber <e> <s> i have to say along with many other noble lords today that we have had a veritable feast of maidens this morning <e> <s> my noble friend baroness cumberlege gave a very lucid sensitive and perceptive speech bringing to bear a wealth of experience in a most effective way <e> <s> along with others i acknowledge her outstanding contribution to the national health service and other public offices <e>", "<cs> my lords that point is noted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i too congratulate the noble lord upon having his amendment discussed at a civilised time of day <e> <s> we have twice previously discussed the amendment at a very late hour of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that by the time i have responded to this amendment i shall have addressed three important points <e> <s> i believe those who refer themselves to centres should receive treatment and that confidentiality should be observed in all cases <e> <s> i shall also address the point of funding <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord seeks reassurance on three points access to services confidentiality and the mechanism for funding and whether there will be guidance <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that there will be guidance <e> <s> work is also continuing on the making of contracts and the role of district health authorities in the making of those contracts <e> <s> i can also give an assurance that all points that have been made throughout the debate on this subject will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the principle underlying the bill is that district health authorities should seek advice from a wide range of authoritative sources before determining a pattern of services for their resident population <e>", "<cs> my lords evidently i was not quite persuasive enough at report stage to deter the noble lord from raising the matter again today <e> <s> on the earlier occasion the noble lord argued that the need to take into account religious persuasion racial origin and cultural and linguistic background was not sufficiently recognised <e> <s> he mentioned the importance of information being available in languages the local community could understand and that services were offered in a way which was sensitive to cultural religious and ethnic differences <e> <s> we fully accept that there are some short-comings in these respects which need to be rectified <e> <s> what divides us is whether it would be helpful to expand the text of the bill in the way the noble lord proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that the noble lord lord kilmarnock will be kept busy responding to the draft guidance i hope so because he raises many important points <e> <s> as i explained when we discussed the issue previously we think that the best arrangement would be for the receiving authority to be approached before someone who needs community care services moves into its area <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment before us tries to deal with two different cases first where the local authority decides that a person is not a person for whom they may provide community care services and as a result declines to carry out an assessment and secondly where a person is dissatisfied with the result of the assessment <e> <s> in the second case the complaints procedure as set out in clause of the bill already covers that contingency <e>", "<cs> i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until five past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will bear with me i should say that i believe that the copy he has is an accurate record although it has manuscript annotations <e> <s> if he will bear with my initial presentation of the regulations i shall make reference to the point he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords at this moment i do not know why the noble lord does not have todays copy of a completely perfectly printed copy of the regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told it was available this morning <e> <s> i have two copies here <e> <s> the joint committee on statutory instruments which met two weeks ago to discuss these regulations was not quorate on the day it discussed them <e> <s> that lost the committee one week <e> <s> as a result of some modifications which we knew were to be discussed on that day i shall refer to that in my presentation these draft regulations were relaid in their correct form <e> <s> i shall refer to the corrections in some detail <e> <s> the typed-up notes that noble lords have are the result of this weeks meeting of the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> they relate in detail to the difference between the original regulations that were laid and the ones that are before your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords the printed version which most noble lords have in their hands today has been available in the printed paper office since monday <e> <s> since then some modifications have been made following discussion between the department and the statutory instruments committee <e> <s> noble lords have a detailed memorandum on that document complete with manuscript amendments <e> <s> since then the document has been reprinted and that is the document which was not available to all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall propose to the house that i accept the suggestion from the acting chief whip on the opposition benches that the house should adjourn for minutes while the matter is discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will now have in their hands a clear copy of the regulations <e> <s> in content the printed copy is identical to the version laid in the printed paper office on monday and considered by the joint committee on statutory instruments on tuesday <e> <s> i hope that this copy is easier for noble lords to use <e>", "<cs> my lords despite its difficult start this has been a useful debate because it will allow me to clarify some points that still need clarification <e> <s> it may be helpful if i restate the principles of the scheme <e> <s> the government are budgeting for a substantial increase in student support <e> <s> we have already announced that the grant will be uprated in the usual way this autumn <e> <s> on top of that will come the loan <e> <s> that will provide million or even more if take-up exceeds per cent <e> <s> the final sum will be determined by demand and is not cash limited <e> <s> on top of that will come million for the access funds of which million is for students in the ambit of the loans scheme <e> <s> the saving from the removal of social security benefits if it goes ahead is expected to be million in respect of students in the scope of the loans scheme <e> <s> therefore the net increase is of the order of million <e>", "<cs> my lords if a college or university deliberately <e>", "<cs> or even unwittingly misled a student there would be an inquiry <e> <s> one hopes that the matter would be put right <e> <s> i am waiting for a specific answer to the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords yes only deferment is possible <e> <s> the loan would not be waived entirely <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell asked a specific question about the definition of the metropolitan police district <e> <s> i am assured that the london rate for loans is precisely the same as the london rate for grants <e> <s> students at the royal holloway and bedford new college can receive the london rate of grant and they will also be able to borrow at the london rate of loan <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said the government are not involved as to whether students take paid work in term or holiday time <e> <s> that must remain a matter for the individual student <e> <s> i doubt whether any single college in this country can ban a student from taking paid work either inside or outside of term time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government provide an adequate level of support for a student to be maintained without work during the course of study <e> <s> however it is the choice of many students who choose freely to work during term time and/or holiday time <e> <s> that must continue to remain a matter for the individual student <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply repeat what i have just said <e> <s> the requirement in the act is for the secretary of state to specify the interest rate that appears to him i emphasise that requisite for maintaining the loans value <e> <s> at the moment he has concluded that the use of the latest actual rate of inflation is the most appropriate way to meet that requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the information that is involved in applications through the mandatory award system will suffice for the vast majority of students <e> <s> we are talking about a very small number of students where it may be necessary to resort to other methods of identification <e> <s> i now turn to the points raised by the noble lord lord kilmarnock and the noble baroness lady white <e> <s> they made heavy weather in references to the administration and access to access funds <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate my noble friend lord brentford on bringing this bill forward for our consideration today <e> <s> the bill is short and straightforward and it makes a small but important change to the marriage law of england and wales under it many couples would become able to marry in the buildings where they regularly worship <e> <s> they cannot do this at present where the building is not a separate building because the present law prevents it being registered for the solemnisation of marriages <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have the highest regard for the achievements of the hospice movement <e> <s> we are firmly committed to improving the public funding of voluntary hospices and we are making additional resources available to the health service in / for that purpose <e> <s> the timetable and detailed funding arrangements will vary from country to country <e>", "<cs> my lords this years allocations are million for england million for scotland and for northern ireland <e> <s> they are additiolal to the money that is already being paid to hospices by health authorities <e> <s> the health authorities and boards in england and northern ireland have been asked to work towards a position in which their contribution to the revenue costs of agreed services matches that from voluntary giving <e> <s> no timetable has been specified but we shall continue to review the position in the light of progress reports from authorities <e> <s> since st april hospices in scotland have been eligible for public funding of per cent <e> <s> of <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house will welcome the comments made by the noble lord lord mellish <e> <s> i cannot state too often that one has the highest regard for hospices <e> <s> they specialise in caring for people at the difficult time when they are in the last stages of dying <e> <s> the government are committed to the hospices and to increasing their resources <e> <s> however it must be said that many hospices pride themselves on their autonomy <e> <s> although they want government funding they also wish to have policy and admissions control for their institutions <e> <s> that is also most important to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should expect nothing else from the noble earl <e> <s> we shall join in the debate which will be positive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to give the guarantee that it will always be regarded as a high priority area <e> <s> however we must never lose the voluntary aspect of the hospice movement because that is its strength <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be specific about particular hospices <e> <s> however the funding for hospices from health authorities varies from as much as per cent <e> <s> to nothing if the noble lord is right <e> <s> i do not know whether particular hospices have applied for money and been refused or whether they wish to have complete financial and operational <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> the hospice movement concentrates on living rather than on dying <e> <s> its work began by making life as comfortable as possible for people who were in the final stages of dying <e> <s> however more recently the work is being moved out from the institutions into the community with a tremendous range of support services which allow people to remain longer in their homes <e> <s> when the time comes at which they need total support then there is room for them in the hospice <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness lady lockwood as i am sure the house is for the opportunity to debate the select committees report <e> <s> we congratulate her and her committee on this excellent report <e> <s> we thank her in particular for the way in which she opened the debate <e> <s> the depth knowledge and insight which have characterised the report not to mention the force of the views which have been expressed and which will be brought to the governments attention have been impressive <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> we are talking here about government legislating for the compulsory teaching of a language in primary schools <e> <s> given all the changes that are taking place in our schools now i believe that that is too early <e> <s> i can give the noble lord the partial assurance that by not legislating we have not in any way precluded experimentation crash courses or the introduction of teaching a language in primary schools <e> <s> that is not against the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords the assisted places scheme is now in its ninth successful year <e> <s> i can assure noble lords opposite that any doubts which they may have about it are not shared by the many parents whose children have benefited and will continue to benefit from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about the income that is taken into account when allowances are deducted <e> <s> nevertheless a salary of by anyones standards even taking allowances into account is a very low salary <e> <s> the level of is the net salary <e> <s> i shall ask for more details which may come before the end of the debate <e> <s> otherwise i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am assured my lords that it is a gross figure <e> <s> as a gross figure it supports even more the case that i was making earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be more specific when i write <e> <s> i shall take proper note of the question <e> <s> what i said was not entirely irrelevant because most of those young people have assisted day places and inevitably they will go to a local independent school <e> <s> in the north east one would expect that the children attending would come from the north east <e> <s> however we shall give the noble lord a breakdown of the children in the system <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state seeks to help the whole of the youth service to develop a secure educational foundation and clear framework for meeting the challenges of the s <e> <s> the development of a single strong comprehensive body through which government funding can be channelled to provide support at national level is central to achieving that <e>", "<cs> my lords first i do not agree that it would necessarily decentralise <e> <s> we were talking about replacing centralised bodies many of them with one agency <e> <s> the reasons for that include better use of resources better co-ordination of support services strengthening of the partnership between the voluntary and the private sectors as well as the local authority sector strengthening support services to the youth movement generally throughout the country and to community education improving the quality range and effectiveness of services and making the responses to government priorities even better <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have the privilege to be the first to welcome him from the dispatch box <e> <s> i look forward very much to his involvement in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know the funding has changed for all youth bodies operating nationally and will continue for the agency <e> <s> the funding will be based on work submitted to the government and approved by them <e> <s> the organisation with which the noble lord has an involvement has chosen to remain separate under the new arrangements and will continue to be separate <e> <s> therefore the way in which the british youth council operates outside the national agency will be very much a matter for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to be able to assure my noble friend that the decision to exist alongside the national agency as an independent body is very much a matter of choice <e> <s> the agency will be based on the national youth bureau and on the council for education and training in youth and community work <e> <s> those two bodies will be subsumed under the new agency <e> <s> however the national council for voluntary youth services and the national association of young peoples counselling and advisory services have opted to remain separate but nevertheless to work constructively with the agency <e> <s> the british youth council has also opted to remain separate outside the agency <e> <s> they all wish to work constructively with the agency <e> <s> i believe that it will be a very profitable arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been discussions with the five organisations <e> <s> all of them have responded <e> <s> all the local authority associations have also been consulted <e> <s> the proposals are being brought forward on the basis of all those consultations <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government and government funded bodies have taken a number of additional steps which should facilitate soviet and east european studies including measures which should benefit the learning of russian in schools measures to address the shortage of language teachers the expansion of educational exchanges with the soviet union and eastern europe and the expansion of the economic and social research councils funding for research and postgraduate support in soviet and east european studies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure i entirely agreed with the noble lord when he said that nothing was happening <e> <s> an interesting debate took place in this chamber only a few weeks ago when noble lords on all sides agreed that much had to be done as regards improving the teaching of languages especially in our schools <e> <s> the government have made the learning of a modern european language central to the national curriculum <e> <s> as that works through the system many more young people will be engaged not only in learning russian but also in learning many other languages <e> <s> i am not aware of any recommendation of the committee that the government do not agree with <e> <s> the government are addressing those recommendations which were put before them <e> <s> i understand that the universities funding council and the polytechnics and colleges funding council are already consulting with their individual bodies and will act on those recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the wooding report and the committee on the teaching of modern languages have done great service <e> <s> i repeat that we all agree that there is much to be done and that there has been a great insularity among the british people about learning languages and becoming interested in the ways of other countries <e> <s> my noble friend has made an interesting point and i shall pass his suggestion on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to be an unfair criticism of the governments very positive response to the wooding report <e> <s> i have the report here and i have read it recently <e> <s> government funding is helping to develop soviet and east european studies <e> <s> as a result of the report the prime minister announced the creation of the additional lectureships during her recent visit to the soviet union <e> <s> the scheme is to be administered by the british council through a special advisory committee whose members will include dr wooding <e> <s> dr woodings work is well recognised and valued by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot be specific but i understand that the response is on all fronts so that i would expect erasmus to be used <e> <s> i shall let the noble baroness know if i have misled her <e>", "<cs> my lords it is an important subject there has been a major study <e> <s> the government for the first time have made modern languages central to the national curriculum <e> <s> i believe that much is being done <e> <s> as i said there is more to be done and we shall continue to regard the subject as very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that new lectureships alone are not enough <e> <s> however a great deal more is going on <e> <s> i repeat that the approach is on all fronts <e> <s> the central bureau for educational visits and exchanges has received more money to meet the demand for teacher exchanges to enable teachers to go to russia to net up school links and enable the quota for school exchanges to be met <e> <s> in other eastern european countries as well as providing the central bureau with funds to expand activities money has also been made available to develop exchange programmes <e> <s> those include teacher study visits to poland to set up school links summer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am feeling slightly battered but i am enormously grateful for those comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the wooding report was commissioned by the universities funding councils predecessor and therefore there have been discussions between the ufc and the government <e> <s> the ufc and the polytechnics and colleges funding council are holding discussions with their individual institutions <e> <s> funding will come from government through those agencies <e> <s> when individual students bid for funds clearly the wooding report will have an impact on how funds are allocated as the individual institutions respond to its recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether the government have spoken to the cvcp with that item on the agenda <e> <s> i should be surprised if they have not but if i have misled the noble lord in any way i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords the speed with which i answer questions has much more to do with wanting to get question time over having suffered yesterday <e> <s> the noble lord made a very important point <e> <s> the government believe that if they were to set up such a committee it would usurp the role of the funding councils given that the funding councils commissioned the report <e> <s> nevertheless the government also believe that it would be a matter for the funding councils if they felt that such a body was worth setting up <e> <s> there is something in that thought <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will reserve his criticism of the response to the wooding report <e> <s> it is still relatively new and has to be responded to not just by government departments but by the whole school sector the university and polytechnic sector and of course commerce and industry too <e>", "<cs> my lords my answers are not meant to obscure their content <e> <s> i believe that there is some urgency and that people are responding <e> <s> in terms of funding in the current year the universities have received per cent <e> <s> over the previous year <e> <s> it is also a matter of priorities for the individual institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the government contracting out of their obligations to play their part in achieving those objectives but the government have made it clear from the outset that the objectives will be achieved only if they are tackled globally <e> <s> we shall continue our efforts globally and shall also play our part as a nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that global warming will continue to be a problem <e> <s> what we have done as a country in addition to trying to make sure that there is a global response to this problem is to do what is achievable and realistic as well as within the means of this country to achievable <e> <s> it is better to do something achievable than to engage in aspirational targets which are not achievable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends lord renton and lord jenkin for the points they made particularly about the undesirability of using primary legislation for the kind of appointment outlined in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall be able to convince all noble lords that the government are very serious about the issue <e> <s> while the intention behind the amendment is understandable it is largely unnecessary <e> <s> the practical effects of its adoption could actually be harmful <e> <s> the amendment is also inappropriate because it takes a provision which gives the secretary of state powers to react in a flexible manner to damaging industrial processes and requires him to use them in a particular way and for one particular set of processes with little or no flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness give way <e> <s> i am grateful to her <e> <s> what i actually said was that the developing or underdeveloped countries would need an extra years <e> <s> during that extra years we believe we could come to their aid with the recycling of cfcs <e> <s> it will not be the production of cfcs but their recycling and use rather than these countries having to develop their own factories as a result of this kind of inflexible legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords the ultimate purpose of the amendments seems to be to secure that processes prescribed and authorised under part i do not cause unacceptable pollution <e> <s> i can agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh on that point and i am delighted to remind him once again that the whole of part i of the bill is directed to that very end <e> <s> however it is right to consider whether the detailed provisions of this part on scheduling processes and granting authorizations are watertight in that respect <e> <s> i am certain that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> in moving the motion i suggest that the house sits again on report at oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of this series of amendments demonstrates the common purpose that unites us today in our consideration of the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh with the support of the noble lord lord addington has explained the <e>", "<cs> my lords the list of considerations put forward by the noble lord lord mcintosh at first sight seems unexceptionable <e> <s> for example integrated pollution control is about the minimisation and indeed where practicable the prevention of pollution <e> <s> similarly the fourth item on the noble lords shopping list is the reduction minimisation and acceptable disposal of waste <e> <s> what is part i of the bill about if not this <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments are unnecessary and could well put us in breach of the european community directives that cover this subject <e> <s> vehicle emissions would be brought within the purview of the bill but there is sufficient statutory control for controlling them through regulations under the road traffic act <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has already made regulations that will apply the tightest standards possible to new cars by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is statutory power to make regulations but we are bound by the european directives <e> <s> i can say in advance of those directives that we are ready and committed to achieving what is called for by the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if it is helpful to my noble friend lord renton and to the noble lord lord mcintosh we are obliged to introduce the directives <e> <s> we halve no choice but to introduce them <e> <s> but i am saying more than that <e> <s> we are pressing for the directives <e> <s> we are absolutely committed to implementing them <e> <s> we do not need primary legislation <e> <s> we have all the powers to make regulations as soon as is possible <e> <s> we are pressing for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what useful function this amendment is intended to achieve <e> <s> once environmental standards quality objectives and process and substance requirements have been set by my right honourable friend the secretary of state it will be incumbent on everyone within government as well as elsewhere to meet those obligations <e> <s> let there be no misunderstanding about the duty on government departments in this respect <e> <s> our proposals on the application of the bills provisions to the crown in clause have put beyond doubt our determination that all operators of prescribed processes including the crown will fully comply with tough authorisation conditions designed to achieve the maximum practicable environmental protection <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very complex issue and i hope that noble lords will bear with my rather lengthy response <e> <s> first i deal with an outstanding point raised by my noble friend lord lucas <e> <s> the external considerations such as environmental quality standards which have to be taken account of do not entail the overruling of a best practical environmental decision of an inspector <e> <s> it is a method of ensuring that essential considerations relating to one medium are met <e> <s> that does not undermine the position of hmips in any way <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i made it clear in part of my answer that if the process fails the batneec test and the bpeo is triggered off that is if it actually fails and is damaging to the environment by one medium or another by emissions into one medium or another it would simply fail to be authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall not disappoint my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> the noble lord lord norrie returns to a point he raised in committee <e> <s> his amendment would require a statement of environmental impact to be attached to any plan made to limit national emissions of a particular pollutant <e> <s> those plans however would generally operate over a number of years <e> <s> the one which is currently out for consultation that to implement the large combustion plants directive will cover the period up to <e> <s> it deliberately does not prescribe the methods which will be used over that period to achieve the cuts in emissions required by the directive over such a long period <e> <s> instead it sets out a clear strategy backed up by legally binding controls for ensuring that the targets are met but allows some flexibility to the pollution inspectorates and to operators over how those targets will be met <e> <s> we do not believe that it could sensibly and reasonably adopt any other approach <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to give a specific answer to a specific question but i am informed that the alkali inspectorate is an old name for hmip <e> <s> the inspectorate for which the noble lord has such high regard has been subsumed in hmip <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that views will be sought from all sources <e>", "<cs> my lords our first objective must be to ensure that hmip is an effective inspectorate so that it can continue to raise the quality of the environment <e> <s> so although we considered institutional change in the white paper we concluded that the benefits were not strong enough to outweigh the disadvantages of further administrative upheaval at a time when the inspectorate is beginning to get into its stride <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend for spotting these anomalies <e> <s> he has made a good case and i have no hesitation in accepting the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that a report of an investigation into pollution of the environment will be made publicly available <e> <s> the regulations we are preparing will certainly require simple monitoring data collected by the enforcing authorities specific to a particular prescribed process to be placed on the register <e> <s> if a fuller report is prepared which relates to the environment around one particular process then that too should go on the register along with other information about that process <e> <s> but if the report is more general and does not relate to a particular prescribed process then there is no need for the information to go on the register <e> <s> however the information will be made available to the public in line with the requirements of the european commissions directive on public access to environmental information which this government did so much to support and which was agreed earlier this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the noble lord <e> <s> the amendments looked convincing from a drafting point of view when i first saw them on paper but despite the arguments that the noble lord has advanced today i do not think that it would be right to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are certainly aware that there is considerable speculation about the incidence of salmonella coming from terrapins and turtles <e> <s> i understand the difficulties but it is hard to be certain about the evidence in this country <e> <s> there are no reliable data available for us to assess the degree of the problem <e> <s> the department of health is issuing public information leaflets on the welfare of animals and how to care for them which cover in particular the transmission of diseases from animals <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we are already considering tightening european regulations as regards the trading of terrapins and turtles <e>", "<cs> my lords my education was completed this morning <e> <s> i understand that splinter leonardo raphael michael angelo and donatello who are the teenage mutant heroes of the day have indeed given rise to a great deal of trading in terrapins and turtles <e> <s> that raises more serious difficulties <e> <s> one is the transmission of disease <e> <s> that is why we ought to increase our efforts to tighten our controls on the import of these creatures and increase the information on looking after animals that we make available <e> <s> i also understand the problem that people do not quite know what to do with these creatures when they grow too large to keep as pets <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely at a loss as to how to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend raises a very important question which applies not just to terrapins but to the ownership of all animals as pets <e> <s> certainly the government take the problem seriously <e> <s> the department of health has taken very seriously the question of advice to people about the care of pets and the transmission of disease from pets to humans <e> <s> as i said in answer to my noble friend lord campbell of croy regulations exist which cover the importation of animals and trading in them <e> <s> at present we are engaged in trying to tighten and extend those regulations to cover the importation of terrapins and turtles and trading in them <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply say that if they follow the advice in the information leaflet from the department of health they are in no danger at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> and reflect the concern of the house that part ii should control all aspects of pollution of the environment by waste <e> <s> in this case as in others my answer is that the matter is already covered in the bill or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i will make that rather brief statement available to the noble lord in time for him to use it later in the debate <e> <s> with the leave of the house perhaps i may answer another of the noble lords questions <e> <s> the regulations will cover any kind of vehicle <e> <s> whether materials are in or are falling out of a skip if a skip is being transported on a vehicle the regulations will cover that vehicle <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by welcoming the comments made by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding on the government amendments <e> <s> i agree with him that that way forward is a real one <e> <s> i also noted with some feeling the points that he made first about the urgent need this point was also made by my noble friend lord lucas for the guidance and the fact that the industry is anxious to receive it <e> <s> i can give the assurance that the department is actively making arrangements to staff up for the implementation of the bill as soon as possible and the preparation of the guidance is very much in hand <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the point is that to stipulate that the authorities should be called regional authorities would cause confusion because of the very point made by my noble friends lord balfour and lady carnegy <e> <s> if we stipulated that they should be called regional or joint authorities there would be a difficulty <e> <s> choosing the name will be a matter for local determination <e> <s> what is essential is that the committees work and deliver the service <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take my noble friends point first <e> <s> we have tried hard not to be over-prescriptive in the matter and to provide for different parts of the country which will differ as to the size of the areas they cover <e> <s> however i take note of what m y noble friend said <e> <s> i shall take the wording back and look at it between now and third reading without commitment as she will understand <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh seeks to exempt lawdcs from the local authority capital finance controls <e> <s> this is a subject which was explored during earlier debates in another place on this bill and before that in very full debates in your lordships house and in another place during the passage of the local government and housing bill now the act <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take on trust that there is nothing sinister in the power being given to the secretary of state <e> <s> the example i can give whether satisfactory or not is that where a lawdc is formed and another is formed close by and they are not viable in the commercial sense it allows the secretary of state with agreement with the lawdcs to vary the direction so that they may re-form as one lawdc <e> <s> therefore the secretary of state would have the power to vary or revoke the original direction <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house perhaps i can come back to that example <e> <s> perhaps the phrase with the permission of the lawdc was not the best one to use <e> <s> i withdraw that phrase from my explanation <e> <s> nevertheless the important point is that when these companies are set up they should be viable and commercial <e> <s> the amendment allows the secretary of state to vary his direction in the formulation of the lawdc <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house this is an important point i gave that example as the kind of situation when the secretary of state may require the power <e> <s> there may be other examples that we have not considered at this stage <e> <s> to write that one example on the face of the bill would not be appropriate <e> <s> it is important that the secretary of state achieves the objective that the lawdcs formed are formed as viable entities <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> is a most ambitious proposal which calls for local registers of waste producers <e> <s> the governments position is that such a control is impracticable because it would be unworkable and cumbersome <e> <s> even with the exclusion of domestic households which the amendment does not provide for the register would be a list of every firm in the country <e> <s> we already know that we are all waste producers so what is the point of listing us all <e> <s> what will local authorities do with a list of every firm shop and office in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i largely dealt with the matter when answering the noble lord lord mcintosh on amendment no <e> <s> which proposed a register of producers <e> <s> we are fully alert to the need for information and enforcement of the duty of care <e> <s> on enforcement i have explained how in the governments view the duty of care will be largely self-enforcing <e> <s> it will be the responsibility of every person bound by the duty to police themselves and one another and they will have every incentive to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not in my mind but i understand it is in the minds of other noble lords <e> <s> so long as there are noble lords in the house there will always be the democratic right to question ministers about policies and therefore the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> for the first time all parts of the system of waste control and management will be more <e>", "<cs> my lords opposition amendment no <e> <s> asks us to extend the period of time after which a licence holder who has applied for a licence modification may appeal against the refusal <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i am grateful to my noble friend lord jenkin not only for his enthusiasm for the subject but also for his contribution in particular to the nawdc conference <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and b are inappropriate <e> <s> it is not necessary to revoke or suspend a licence because of a failure during the course of the licence to guarantee that funds will be made available to finance requirements under the licence <e> <s> an authority should establish the financial soundness of the applicant before issuing the licence and furthermore should ensure that the guarantees required by clause c cannot be circumvented by rearrangement of the companys accounts by bankruptcy or by any other means <e> <s> there is a variety of ways there are a variety of ways <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> there is a variety of ways in which this can be achieved and they will be the subject of guidance to the authorities from the secretary of state under subsection of that clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> not only am i corrected on the quality of my english but also on the quality of my mathematics which has gone awry <e> <s> there is a partnership between the companies and the government which is important <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps it would help if i said that my understanding is that my noble friend lord balfour was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a and that i would eventually speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house my understanding is that my noble friend spoke to both of his amendments amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to respond to amendments nos <e> <s> a a a and at the same time speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> a and a in the name of my noble friend lord balfour make the perfectly reasonable point that a waste collection authority should be able to achieve savings through the implementation of a waste recycling plan particularly in later years when the initial capital costs have been met <e> <s> some authorities already claim that their recycling operations are making a surplus although their accounting practices do not always make it possible to assess the situation clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am getting an affirmative nod that the results of the survey will be made available <e> <s> i understand that it is still continuing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall address first amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> these regulations will be crucial <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is right <e> <s> this is a very important subject <e> <s> regulations are already in place which require reports of incidents concerning the actual or potential loss into the sea of dangerous goods harmful substances and marine pollutants <e> <s> the form of these reports has been agreed internationally through the international maritime organisation and there is no need to duplicate these requirements <e>", "<cs> last week the countryside commission announced the site of the ancient needwood and charnwood forests as their preferred location for a new national forest in the midlands <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment has promised that the scheme will receive government assistance and that work on the forest will start next year <e> <s> this will be an important contribution to a national drive to increase the area of our country made up of woodlands <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to pre-empt what may or may not be in the gracious speech in a very short time therefore i cannot be specific about timescale <e> <s> however the governments proposals as they are set out at present include a return to free negotiations <e> <s> therefore the time to discuss alternatives to that or alternative ways of meeting the machinery of providing teachers pay will be when that bill comes before this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can anticipate that there has been a promise that measures will be brought before this house shortly <e> <s> that is all i am prepared to say and all i shall say <e>", "<cs> my lords there is the principle of differential pay to meet a host of issues <e> <s> one is teacher shortages one is particular subject areas where it is difficult to recruit teachers and the other facet is to pay for performance <e> <s> the idea of variable pay is very much a principle upon which this government are proceeding <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to come to the dispatch box to answer for anybody outside this chamber <e> <s> my duty is to reply on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand by the statement i made at that debate <e> <s> this governments record of responding to the business of teachers pay is a fine one <e> <s> the remit given to the interim advisory committee for the coming year includes a general increase for teachers modifications for selective pay which includes the number and value of incentive allowances that are to be increased with respect to teacher shortages and to take into account rewarding good classroom teachers <e> <s> therefore i believe we are addressing all the problems of teachers including the levels of teachers pay <e>", "<cs> my lords again i believe this governments record on teachers pay is a good one <e> <s> the government have set up some effective interim machinery for it <e> <s> they have proposals which will develop those ideas even further <e> <s> i agree that paying teachers for the job they do which is a very important one and most teachers do that job extremely well is an important part of those proposals <e> <s> the proposals the government have put on the statute book in the form of the education reform act and the proposals to take forward machinery for teachers pay are radical and will work <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important point <e> <s> again this government have done more to take government off the back of education than any other government <e> <s> the grant-maintained part of our education reform act does just that it takes government out of the classroom and puts the teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe it is necessary <e> <s> we live in a free world and if teachers wish to do something alongside their teaching career that must be a matter for them as individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords the proposals allow for freer negotiations than ever before <e> <s> lying behind the noble lords question is the question of whether we believe that there should be available a totally blank cheque for the new machinery to determine teachers pay <e> <s> as long as taxpayers money pays the salaries at the end of the day there must be some finite statement regarding the level of resources <e>", "<cs> my lords to date the ncc has spent approximately on preparations for reorganisation in the current financial year <e> <s> this expenditure forms part of the nccs existing budget of for reorganisation costs this year which itself forms just over half of the total budget of million in to meet reorganisation costs this year incurred both within the ncc and the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is a loss to the amount of money that is available for conservation <e> <s> the noble baroness may be referring to the possibility that the money made available this year for the reorganisation may not be sufficient <e> <s> however the government are keeping the position under constant review <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree that it is a disastrous bill <e> <s> sufficient resources will be made available and i shall address that point in more detail when we reach part vii of the environmental protection bill next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the figure of million which was referred to by the noble lord <e> <s> i shall answer that question in more detail when we come to part vii of the bill <e> <s> it is too late in the progress of this legislation to be speaking of a major omission from the bill and moving this part of the bill into the white paper <e> <s> it is important to remember that this is a very good step on the way to ensuring that wildlife and the countryside are protected and that the white paper allows an open door for yet further development <e> <s> it has not closed doors on anything in either an institutional or a development sense for both those important areas <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have commissioned a number of studies to achieve a very scientific and objective measurement of the costs that will be incurred <e> <s> i do not believe that they are even approximate to million <e> <s> however that debate will take place in great detail next week <e> <s> i can promise the house that i shall come forward with all the evidence that the government have at their command and it can be challenged in this chamber during the course of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to say at the moment the form in which that information will be made available <e> <s> but information as to how we arrive at the sums will certainly be made available <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> of course it is parliament that determines these matters <e> <s> i simply say that there has been great institutional change <e> <s> i believe that it has been widely welcomed although i know that there is still opposition to some of the changes <e> <s> however my view is that those changes should be allowed to take place now <e> <s> it is important that the white paper allows those developments to continue and does not close the door on some of the ideas that have come from this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give as much detail as possible and be as precise as possible when it comes to part vii of the bill <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble baroness will chide me if i do not give enough detail <e> <s> the studies that have been commissioned will be as objective as possible <e> <s> however i am not sure that i can say that the level of anxiety will decrease as a result of them <e> <s> it is right that we should continue to be anxious that the resources are made available for those measures to work <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will appreciate that i am very new to this part of the bill <e> <s> my understanding is that the million about which we are talking is expenditure in this financial year which would not include the building for the jncc <e> <s> of course if i am wrong i shall certainly write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords the conclusive work is not available <e> <s> however i am assured that information is available and i shall be as disappointed as the noble baroness if i have to come to the dispatch box without it <e> <s> what information i have i shall deliver from the dispatch box during the course of that debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the frustration behind the suggestions made by the noble baroness <e> <s> we shall always consider any way that will expedite the process <e> <s> i am sure the noble baroness will understand that co-operation is essential not only in negotiating the designation of an mnr but also in its later management <e> <s> unless there is co-operation between all concerned the later management will be damaged <e> <s> therefore bearing in mind the fact that we prefer a negotiated settlement we shall consider any ways of expediting the proceedings without losing the co-operation of everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the management of mnrs is important and therefore we prefer to have co-operation at all times <e> <s> as regards menai i understand that a new consultation document based on the fairly major objections is about to be put out <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the frustration felt on all sides about the slowness of designation the difficulty in obtaining a consensus and the degree of co-operation required in order for the management to be effective <e> <s> one or two of the sites are operating well in a voluntary way prior to formal designation <e> <s> however again i take into account the noble lords comments <e> <s> we shall do what we can to expedite the matter without losing sight of the fact that co-operation will be essential <e>", "<cs> my lords also at the risk of boring the house as the noble baroness repeated a point i must repeat my answer <e> <s> i am conscious of the fact that we must look at all ways of speeding up the process <e> <s> however unless we receive a high degree of co-operation the problems that existed prior to designation will continue afterwards <e> <s> we must avoid that situation if possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to be specific in my answer to the noble lords question so i shall be guarded and say that if i am wrong i shall write to him <e> <s> i understand that the sub-aqua divers have been satisfied and have reached an accommodation <e> <s> i believe that in this case the yachting fraternity is holding up the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the government i do not believe in the premise on which this question is based that is that the plans to abolish the glc and to put in place other arrangements are wrong <e> <s> strategic planning guidance is presented by government <e> <s> within that framework of guidance unitary development plans are prepared by the boroughs <e> <s> the london planning advisory committee interfaces those two bodies advises the government and liaises with boroughs beyond the boundaries of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend because he brings us to the nub of the reason that the glc is not alive and kicking today <e> <s> this question is more about the mechanics and not about policies and plans for london <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is right that planning does not stop at the borders of london <e> <s> that is why we have set up a framework which starts with guidance for london but moves out liaises and co-ordinates with planning well beyond the borders of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is the noble lords nd wedding anniversary today <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the whole house we hope that it continues to work for a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords there are not co-ordinating bodies but london boroughs which happen to be situated in london <e> <s> those boroughs are making good progress in their unitary development plans which are carried out in a framework of guidance which pertains to london <e> <s> cross-boundary problems are being sorted out <e> <s> government departments meet together on london issues <e> <s> the department of the environment gives a leadership on those matters <e> <s> the doe liaises with the borough planning officers <e> <s> senior staff from the departments of transport the environment employment trade and industry and the training agencies all meet to discuss london issues from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take the points in reverse order <e> <s> the question concerns devolution <e> <s> the government have devolved responsibility to the boroughs not centralised it <e> <s> perhaps i may say that the reason for abolishing the glc was that it was an ineffectual bureaucratic overlay on london government <e>", "<cs> my lords transport issues for london are dealt with at government level <e> <s> there is a great deal of liaison among london boroughs on the strategic policy formulation which is produced at government level <e> <s> regarding waste management if the noble lord will bear with us a considerable amount of time has been spent on the environmental protection bill to do exactly what he is suggesting that is to produce a regional framework of guidance within which waste management is incorporated <e>", "<cs> my lords lady porter is among those referred to as one of many people but i suspect that many more people believe that london government is better served without an overlaying bureaucratic structure <e> <s> lady porter believes that there should be some overall promotion of london and that is the view of just one person <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was whether the arrangements in place are right for london <e> <s> we are discussing the mechanics of government not the proper policies and planning for london <e> <s> the arrangements in place need time to work <e> <s> it is my view and i am confident on behalf of the government that they will work <e>", "<cs> my lords strategic planning is dealt with by the government presenting guidelines <e> <s> many of the issues mentioned by the noble lord in what i do not believe was a question are still better dealt with at borough level <e> <s> the boroughs know their locality best <e> <s> housing policy is certainly better dealt with at that level than at what would have been glc level <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question on boundaries <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to table a question i shall deal with it at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need to put on the face of the bill the definition of a statutory nuisance contained in the first part of the amendment <e> <s> there is the commonly understood meaning of what constitutes a statutory nuisance <e> <s> it is grounded in a body of case law going back over years <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> combustion processes which give rise to pollution are already adequately covered by existing or proposed controls <e> <s> under the clean air acts there is already a sufficient armoury of controls over smoke emissions from premises including open land which are the primary pollutant in most cases of combustion <e> <s> the emission of noxious fumes from prescribed processes will be controllable under part i of the bill <e> <s> local pollution from premises arising from fumes or gas emissions not controlled under part i can be dealt with under paragraphs c and d of clause <e> <s> i trust that that deals with the point made by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> what this amendment would catch that is not already covered by existing controls under the clean air acts or proposed controls under parts i and iii of the bill would seem in practice to be confined to emissions from either moving or static sources on the public highway <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me <e> <s> he said before my noble friend sits down <e> <s> he is introducing a new point <e> <s> he is not asking a question <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is out of order <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> seeks to carry over provisions similar to those in section of the public health act by virtue of which the award of costs can be mandatory if it is proved that the nuisance existed both at the date of service of the abatement notice and at the date that proceedings were instituted <e>", "<cs> my lords i may well be responsible for the confusion about the grouping <e> <s> if i had heeded the advice given to me by the noble lord lord ross we might not have had such a grouping <e> <s> however i dealt with the amendments in the way that they were proposed <e> <s> i dealt with amendments nos <e> <s> and together and with amendments nos <e> <s> and a separately <e> <s> perhaps i may add an extra word on amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may apologise for the possibility that i may well have misled the house in my previous reply <e> <s> under part i of the bill although hmip and local authorities are primarily charged with enforcing the provisions of that part it does not mean that other people cannot bring prosecutions under that part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with the issue raised by my noble friend before i come to the amendment <e> <s> with respect to my noble friend i accept his proposition that the manufacturing industry should be protected from releases of information which may be commercially confidential <e> <s> however i assure him that the retention of the words trade secret will operate to protect such information <e> <s> if i do not say that he may be slightly disquieted by the rather pleasant news to the noble lord lord tordoff that i am about to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> in the light of our previous conversation i shall be prepared to take this amendment back and reconsider it before third reading without commitment of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord ross will accept that i must take that point away and consider it again but without commitment <e> <s> we shall also look at it in the light of what has been said on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that amendment no <e> <s> has to be put first and i therefore beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to ensure that local authorities are provided with additional resources to carry out the new duties imposed on them by part iv of the bill and that the level of resources available to them is reviewed annually <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments assessment made on the basis of the coopers and lybrand review was million and i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the figures to which he referred were based on an out-of-date version of the code of practice <e> <s> the advice on the size and siting of litter bins which he specifically mentioned was not government authorised but came from the tidy britain group <e> <s> it no longer appears in the code <e>", "<cs> my lords the only response that i can give is to say that all local government expenditure is reviewed each year in the pes rounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by thanking my noble friend for his general comments about my appointment <e> <s> it would be tempting fate too much to <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me if i point out that amendment no <e> <s> has been decoupled from amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord mean people wearing black hats with yellow bands <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> deals with a problem which i am sure we have all experienced at some stage <e> <s> i hope that i can persuade my noble friend lord stanley that the bill will be able to deal quite adequately with the problem of litter while still allowing those in another place to distribute election leaflets safe in the knowledge that they are not committing an offence <e> <s> the amendment might make it an offence to hand out such leaflets <e> <s> some may say that that should be an offence <e> <s> i am sure that if the truth be told some people would prefer not to receive election leaflets <e> <s> however i am not convinced that another place would welcome an amendment to this effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that fly posting during an election is an offence <e> <s> i believe that it breaches the rules governing elections <e> <s> that is another subject <e> <s> fly posting constitutes posting up leaflets on either council property or private property without permission <e> <s> therefore that could be reported as an offence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer that question <e> <s> the material is litter while it is under the windscreen wiper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may respond <e> <s> the placing of a leaflet on a windscreen is an offence it is litter <e> <s> however if you go back to your car and drive away knowing that the leaflet is on your windscreen you are deemed to have received it <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of sounding stupid to my noble friend i have to say first that the amendment would make it an offence for a retailer to sell a drink contained in a can with a detachable ring-pull <e> <s> it gives the can makers a period of grace of two years <e> <s> the can makers are making positive efforts to switch to the new style cans but my noble friend believes that his amendment is required to speed up that solution <e> <s> i do not believe that the available evidence supports that view <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may start by clearing the detail out of the way for my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> he used the example of the comparison between somebody standing on the highway and throwing away a can and somebody standing on the roadside verge and doing the same and not being subject to the same penalties <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that if someone throws litter onto the verge of a highway while standing on the verge that is still an offence under the bill since the legal definition of a highway includes the verges of the roadside <e> <s> therefore regardless of where the litter lands an offence will have been committed <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the code of practice which will only be formulated with consultation with all the appropriate authorities is that the code of practice will include all forms of litter clearance on any kind of highway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will join me in paying a tribute to my noble friend for the work that he does with british rail in keeping the railways tidy <e> <s> in recent years there has been discernible evidence of the improvements to our railway stations <e> <s> my local station is not cambridge but huntingdon and i look forward to it receiving a prize one day <e> <s> i also include in that tribute the noble lord lord parry and his work with the keep britain tidy organisation which is complementary <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained the intention behind these amendments is to restrict the regulation-making power which government amendment no <e> <s> za proposes should be given to the secretary of state to make transitional arrangements in relation to the interaction between the competitive tendering requirements of the local government act and the litter duty imposed by this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord will understand that i can give no guarantees at this stage <e> <s> however i can give an assurance that all the various scenarios will be taken into account when determining the formula that we hope will be effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord parry has moved his amendment with great enthusiasm <e> <s> the amendment sets out the relationship between parts ii and iv of the bill the former dealing with waste disposal and the latter with litter <e> <s> it provides that regulations can be laid to make litter collected by a waste collection authority or certain other persons a controlled waste under part ii and therefore to dispose of it illegally would be an offence <e> <s> it also allows regulations to be made to place waste disposal authorities under a duty to dispose of this waste in the same way as they are responsible for disposing of other waste collected by a waste collection authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i am right in saying i look to the clerk for assurance that my noble friend will have an opportunity to speak again because we are still technically on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should hate to deny him the opportunity to respond to my response to his amendment <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and in my name and amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord lucas relate to clause and schedule both of which concern new powers for local authorities to deal with abandoned shopping and luggage trolleys <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is a scot and a canny one at that <e> <s> i do not know the market price of a second-hand trolley <e> <s> whatever the price and whatever the income to the authority income under that activity will have to be recycled to benefit the public and the community charge payer in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly because of the way in which my noble friend has presented his amendment i think i should say more about the reason why i believe sufficient is a better word than reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords the concern underlying the amendment is understandable <e> <s> it is of course right that the secretary of state should take account of expert and lay opinion on the important matters which part vi enables him to regulate <e> <s> my noble friend lord hesketh gave an assurance during committee that there will be full consultations on part vi regulations <e> <s> i am happy to make clear that that commitment applies to appropriate local authority organisations as well as to other relevant bodies and individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a would require the establishment of a genetic <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said earlier that he was not having a very good evening <e> <s> i am afraid i shall not be able to make it any more bearable <e> <s> i cannot comment specifically on the timing <e> <s> however i am able to assure him of two things first that there is absolutely nothing sinister behind the lack of information at this time we are seized of the importance of the issue <e> <s> secondly progress is being made but regarding the specific time i must remain within the phrase that the secretary of state will report in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we touched on at least one of the questions when we first discussed this amendment <e> <s> that was the concern of the noble lord lord clinton-davis about other issues the broader issues than those mentioned in my first response to the amendment <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to give an assurance that these committees will be involved in the wider issues <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should say that we are happy to share the noble lords objectives that the committees should work and do their job and that major matters particularly those mentioned by the noble lord should not be left outside the scope of the work of the two committees <e> <s> i am advised that the appointment of the minister of agriculture fisheries and food is dealt with under clause <e> <s> if that answer is not sufficient for the noble lord i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the considerable amount of work taking place to find a biological solution rather than a chemical one <e> <s> i am not able specifically to answer about the european damage <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the mind boggles at the thought of japanese knotweed marching anywhere <e> <s> the serious point is that anybody who suffers from having this weed in their garden has a nasty beast to contend with <e> <s> it grows to about nine feet tall and its roots go down many feet there may be those who do not like chemical solutions to these problems but i have to say that a chemical called glyphosate has been used on japanese knotweed with some success at ruislip and at another site in cheshire <e> <s> reasonable success has been achieved there and at a place called bay pond total success has been achieved <e> <s> i suspect that the degree of the establishment of the knotweed has a lot to do with the level of success of the chemical <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to control of the weed <e> <s> cutting annually and grazing will only control the weed all the evidence shows that cutting grazing and even cutting annually will not eliminate it <e>", "<cs> my lords my limited information tells me that it has a stalk rather like rhubarb that it is pale in colour and hollow in the centre <e> <s> it grows <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right that is of concern because knotweed is found on much of the derelict land in this country which is being developed <e> <s> therefore finding a solution for its elimination rather than its control is important <e>", "<cs> my lords in the southern half of britain reservoirs are between per cent and per cent full in aggregate that represents about per cent below normal for the time of year aquifers are generally only marginally below normal in the south west but they are well below normal in the south east the prime responsibility for ensuring adequate supplies lies with the water companies however i understand that they expect to continue to maintain supplies this winter with only selective restrictions on less essential use in some eastern areas in these areas above-average rainfall is required to recharge aquifers and avoid the risk of shortages next year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to say what the position will be <e> <s> however the water resources are at about the same level now as they were this time last year <e> <s> the national rivers authority estimates as my noble friend has said that above-average rainfall is required to restore the levels i understand that the range is from per cent in the thames area and parts of the south west to between per cent and per cent in parts of the south east however i have good news for my noble friend on his suggestion concerning a survey <e> <s> a few weeks ago the nra began a survey similar to the one suggested by my noble friend under its powers and governed by section of the new water act <e> <s> it will assess actual and prospective resources against demand for all regions of england giving priority to those areas which are critically short of water i am <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i gave in answer to my noble friend lord nugent a moment ago were in connection with the requirements to restore the levels fully to the aquifers <e> <s> in order to provide normal levels of water resources next year full restoration would not be required <e> <s> therefore the need would be for something less than per cent <e> <s> in the thames area and parts of the south west and something less than per cent in other parts of the south east we need above-average levels of rainfall in order to remove the difficulties of providing water next year otherwise we shall have to resort again to management techniques which are all aimed at restricting demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that almost the opposite is the case it is my view that when the results of the survey appear the nra will do two things first it will direct investment where it is properly needed and secondly the ability of the water companies to raise money to meet those requirements will be much greater than they were when they were public authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we have looked at the records to see how long ago it was that we had a sustained period of difficulty <e> <s> i understand that the longest sustained period was in the s which is a very long time ago <e> <s> that was for a period of upwards of six years <e> <s> there were six successive difficult years in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to answer that question because i simply do not know the answer <e> <s> my suspicion is that they are under the control of the nra but i shall have to confirm that to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords any help that they can give will be appreciated <e>", "<cs> my lords considerable thought is being given to distribution methods but i have to come back to the difficulties of whether one provides extensively for the extremes an extension of the distribution network may be necessary to some degree but whether it is done to the extent that the noble lord is suggesting i am not sure <e> <s> those are the kinds of arguments that need to be balanced when all the information from the survey is made available <e>", "<cs> my lords in the sense that there is a problem it is not too early we know there is a problem and that is being well pre-empted <e> <s> however we have no idea how wet a winter we shall have we can but hope and pray <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that piping from the kielder reservoir down to the parts of the south east which require water poses the very question of the cost of redistribution <e> <s> all these ideas will be fed in determinations will be made and plans drawn up <e> <s> where there is excess water and where there is a need for water distribution methods will have to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend again makes a very important point he knows to his cost the difficulties of scaling the heights of the planning system in regard to this kind of investment perhaps i may end on a positive note with the way in which the water act is working and the way in which the nra is approaching its work the hope that these problems will be tackled in the long term is very real <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i also need to deal with personnel matters which are very much part of the interim arrangements <e> <s> if the house will be patient i shall deal with personnel matters but i am in the hands of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first with the reports that were published and put in the library <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton pressed me hard requesting that as soon as those reports became available i should give an assurance that they would be placed in the library <e> <s> i honoured that assurance <e> <s> as soon as they became available they were placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i believe that i have just made it clear that it was during the course of that parliamentary question that the noble lord lord shackleton pressed me hard <e> <s> the reports were not available at the time but they became available a day or two after the question was asked <e> <s> the moment they became available they were placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house shall i continue with the statement <e> <s> i shall very quickly deal with the point made by the noble lord lord shackleton <e> <s> i apologise unreservedly if it was not brought to his notice that we responded to his request <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i am not able to answer that question <e> <s> my information was that the reports were in the library <e> <s> i am having that investigated now <e>", "<cs> my lords i also have some difficulty with the linking of these amendments because it seems to me that the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord swinton is quite distinct from the other amendment <e> <s> therefore the amendments are quite separate and i intend to deal with them separately <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend because he is right to address the issue of flexibility <e> <s> i hope that in the course of my rather brief response to his amendment i shall be able to satisfy all opinion about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords again i believe that there is a difference of understanding about the nature of the jncc <e> <s> there is no conflict or problem for the joint body in wales to concern itself with welsh countryside and conservation matters but there will be times when the conservation and wildlife matters go well beyond the boundaries of wales scotland or england <e> <s> it will be for wales to take the advice of the jncc <e> <s> however on the question of local welsh countryside matters i do not believe that it is beyond the wit of that body to resolve its own local conflicts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i was about to ask whether the other amendments in this group were going to be addressed during the course of the debate <e> <s> i was not intervening for any other reason <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may confirm that we are speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> d and a <e> <s> i say two things at the outset <e> <s> the first is that i hope the house will bear with me as i respond in detail to the many anxieties raised because this is a crucial part of todays deliberations <e> <s> secondly i have already this afternoon apologised unreservedly to the noble lord lord shackleton for telling him that the studies were in the library <e> <s> the fact that they were not in the library when noble lords went there is a matter between me as a minister and my department <e> <s> i leave the statement at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i used the wrong words <e> <s> however my remarks apply even if we are talking about the bill <e> <s> we have listened to comments and responded almost in full to the report of the committee chaired by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> only one point of division between us remains <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to my noble friend lord swinton who i believe was <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships are very persuasive <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend lord renton that i hear what he says <e> <s> perhaps the house will accept that without prejudice to the outcome of this matter i shall take away the amendment and consider all that has been said during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall take away this amendment and give it further consideration before third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall also try to follow the example set and we shall not go over much of the ground covered by the earlier amendment moved by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> the subject of the first amendment amendment no <e> <s> a will be familiar to the house as the noble lord lord walpole introduced an amendment to a similar effect at committee stage <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness lady nicol spoke in support of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i have misunderstood my noble friend <e> <s> at the outset when he was moving the amendment my noble friend said that the distinction between his amendment and that of the noble and gallant lord lord carver was that the advice relating to my noble friends amendment is not binding advice <e> <s> i believe that those were the words used by my noble friend lord norrie <e> <s> what i am saying is that when the bill becomes law the jncc will be backed by statute with a requirement and an obligation to proffer advice primarily concerned with nature conservation and wildlife issues <e> <s> even that advice when it is proffered will be considered but it will not necessarily be binding advice <e> <s> however the remit for the jncc is clear <e> <s> its priority is to be concerned with nature conservation and not countryside matters <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must say that i am obviously having difficulty in explaining what i believe to be a very fundamental difference between us on this amendment <e> <s> whatever the words are the remit is quite clearly in the terms of the amendment tabled by the noble and gallant lord lord carver and by my noble friend lord norrie <e> <s> however i believe that my noble friends amendment makes even more explicit that consideration of countryside matters should be an obligation on the jncc <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e> <s> the amendments were grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord hesketh explained at committee stage consultation is a perfectly reasonable working assumption about the way things would normally be handled if the reserve power were invoked <e> <s> as the amendment appreciates there will be occasions when such consultation would be impracticable <e> <s> i would however remind the house that a direction is very much a reserve power <e> <s> it should only ever be needed as a last resort but in these circumstances the secretary of state needs to do what is right according to the circumstances <e> <s> any unreasonable use of such powers would be open to judicial review and i submit that this is quite sufficient <e> <s> clearly parliament has accepted this in the past since the existing clause uses standard provisions for ministerial directions <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will not press for an exception <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful for the opportunity to present to the house that in response to pressures from noble lords i agreed to take these amendments back <e> <s> it is entirely my error that i moved them <e> <s> it can only be with the agreement of the house that i ask for this correction to be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the primary function of this bill is to reorganise the nature conservation and countryside bodies and to build upon the good work undertaken by those bodies <e> <s> it is particularly important to recognise that all the existing functions of the ncc will be taken over by the new agencies <e> <s> these include the provision of advice to local authorities and others on all matters relating to nature conservation <e> <s> this can of course include advice about coasts <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that the government are committed to a review of the existing legislation and other matters relating to the marine environment <e> <s> it would be premature to introduce any particular planning blueprint in advance of that review <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have some sympathy with the noble lords intentions in introducing the amendments <e> <s> however in the governments view this bill is not the appropriate means of achieving the objective sought by the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke the duke of somerset reminds me that i was hoping that the amendments would be linked for the purposes of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that the ncc would have involvement in the working up of the schemes under national countryside initiatives <e> <s> i am not sure that i understood the noble earls first question <e> <s> if i misinterpreted it no doubt he will come back to me <e> <s> he wanted me to give some estimate of the time over which the grants could be made <e> <s> i am assuming that he was still including in that an element of profits forgone <e> <s> i think i made it clear in my response that the notion of profits forgone outside of the sssi areas the immediate environs are the subject of another amendment tonight is not concluded <e> <s> but in terms of the time in which grants could be applied to longer-term schemes i think i <e>", "<cs> my lords much of what i said in response to amendment no <e> <s> d covered this general subject of applying grants <e> <s> again i am slightly uneasy about this particular amendment because my understanding is that there are already considerable powers available to the ncc to enter into management agreements which require positive as opposed to negative action <e> <s> what i am not absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords we are back to a central point of difference between the noble and gallant lord lord carver and noble lords opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i meant but it may not be what i said <e> <s> there is a fundamental difference between the government and noble lords opposite and the noble and gallant lord about the nature of the jncc <e> <s> we see it as an advisory body and the amendments seek to turn it into an executive body <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> a would give the jncc a further duty to establish nature conservation criteria for use in an environmental audit of great britain <e> <s> we are back to the point that has been repeated throughout the course of the day <e> <s> it is conferring upon the jncc executive functions <e> <s> that is not consistent with the plans that the government have that it should be exclusively an advisory body <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a function of the jncc to advise on standards across the country <e> <s> in practice the implementation of those standards would be a matter for the country councils and the agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i have said on a number of occasions that we envisage the jncc being involved in producing the standards <e> <s> it is the implementation of those standards which is a matter for the individual agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is first important to say that much of what i said in response to the amendment of my noble friend lord peel certainly applies to some of the points made by the noble duke the duke of somerset <e> <s> however i must also make one point clear because i believe there has been a misinterpretation of my references to the earlier amendment about negative and positive conservation <e> <s> perhaps i did not make myself clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords amendment is one of a number which seek to place a duty on the secretary of state to ensure that local authorities are given sufficient resources for specific functions created by this bill <e> <s> as always in such cases i can only reply that the government are committed to the measures in the bill and that they are as concerned as everyone else to ensure that adequate resources are available to implement them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the original cost did not include scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i hope i may follow up that point <e> <s> i am sure that the desk study is the basis of the survey <e> <s> in calculating the costs involved here we have taken into account the fact that there will be a requirement for some follow-up work as my noble friend has just pointed out <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that there is a general awareness of the problem of contamination and that this should lead purchasers and their solicitors to ask vendors about possible contamination as a matter of routine <e> <s> the misrepresentation act provides sanctions against any vendor who fails to disclose information about contamination in response to a specific request <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty on the groupings of these amendments <e> <s> my undersianding i hope my noble friend lord stanley will agree although he did not mention it is that he spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> b to g a a za zb and b <e> <s> he also tagged on from another grouping amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e>", "<cs> my lords on all but the last two amendments i mentioned i welcome my noble friends perception in bringing forward amendments to correct technical deficiencies in clause <e> <s> if my noble friends amendments are put on to the statute book the scheme must be <e> <s> workable and i am more than happy to accept them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord exaggerates the amount of money which has been collected indeed per cent <e> <s> of people across the country have paid something <e> <s> however he raised an important point <e> <s> i hope that he will join with me in condemning those who can pay but who choose not to do so <e> <s> in defence of the government i must point out that a raft of measures have been put into place amounting to billion in order to abate the difficulties for people at the lower income end of the scale <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an important point about the community charge namely that accountability is increased <e> <s> as regards the uniform business rate he will know that business and commerce across the country were treated very unfairly some more unfairly than others and that the people concerned called for stability <e> <s> i should point out that revaluation which accounts for much of the distortion during the interregnum has been dealt with by promising regular updating of revaluation <e> <s> there is no increase of yield in real terms from the business community <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord misinterpreted my answer <e> <s> i said that the charging system was fair but that not paying was decidedly unfair and impacted on the most vulnerable and those who pay <e> <s> i hope that all noble lords will join me in condemning those who do not pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that lambeth is now sending out its bills for the reduced level of community charge <e> <s> of course there is an obligation upon all people to meet their community charge even during the interregnum when that case was before the court <e> <s> the government have not yet taken a final decision on what to do about lambeth <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend appears to have it wrong <e> <s> the tax liability falls on people and not on houses <e>", "<cs> my lords charge payers who owe local authorities money continue to have a liability to pay <e> <s> local authorities continue to have the responsibility for collection <e> <s> i understand that there have been numerous scare stories about the levels of collection <e> <s> while they are not ideal they are not much worse than the level of rate collection this time last year <e> <s> the more efficient local authorities and the more <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that the government said that collection would cost twice as much and that was recognised when provision was made for local authority spending <e> <s> some local authorities are making a more efficient attempt at introducing the community charge <e> <s> of course in the early stages the costs of introducing such major changes will inevitably be greater than they will when the system settles down <e> <s> the greater the efficiency the lower the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords we have talked about the estimated figure which was twice as much <e> <s> we do not have the actual figures <e> <s> for those figures we shall have to await the outturn from local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the valuation system is applied in all parts of the country in the same way <e> <s> there is of course a system of appeal against revaluation and many business people have taken that up <e> <s> the area of anxiety about the business rate that we share is that of the small businesses where the owner may live over a shop <e> <s> that issue is under consideration at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not detract from my first answer that the estimate at the beginning of the year was that it would cost twice as much to introduce the charge <e> <s> we do not indulge in speculation beyond that point <e> <s> we are now interested in the actual expenditure of local authorities <e> <s> we know that some local authorities have laboured the introduction of the charge while others have made an effective and efficient start towards introducing the changes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have determined that the new rates system for the business community is much fairer than the old one <e> <s> however there is an interregnum which is difficult for business and commerce <e> <s> to allow for easier implementation of the new system a gradual move towards it over a period of five years has been determined <e> <s> that will help businesses to absorb the changes <e> <s> when that system is in place it will be fairer than any system that has preceded it <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an important debate on a very important group of amendments <e> <s> at committee stage in july the then minister my noble friend lord hesketh gave an undertaking to publish our proposals for implementing the bill once it is enacted <e> <s> that we shall do <e> <s> since then however our timetable for implementation has also become clearer and i hope that the following details will be helpful to your lordships <e>", "<cs> my lords the report is not the property of the government it is the property of the ncc <e> <s> that is my understanding <e> <s> if i am misleading the noble lord in any way i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords that must remain a matter for the ncc <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords agreement on the importance of this post <e> <s> the postholder will be more senior than the chief scientists in the agencies but less senior than the three chief executives <e> <s> we believe that that is the right balance <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness agrees <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertook at report stage to take amendment no <e> <s> a back and to reconsider it <e> <s> if i have correctly understood the position this amendment would make the mere creation of a statutory nuisance an offence where the magistrates court so directs <e> <s> i understand that this is how the courts in practice currently interpret the existing legislation in the public health act <e> <s> i also understand that this interpretation of the existing law carries with it implications for the courts powers to award compensation under the powers of criminal courts act <e>", "<cs> my lords i was minded to accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with my noble friend that the priority for litter clearance should be set on the face of the bill <e> <s> that is the only difference between us on this matter <e> <s> this is a matter for the code of practice <e> <s> but i am pleased to inform him that the code will make clear that the areas most heavily used and most prone to litter such as shopping centres central parks and high density residential areas will need to be cleared more quickly than other areas <e> <s> i hope that this will reassure my noble friend that we have the problem under control <e> <s> i am grateful that he has accepted that there will be occasions when it will just not be practicable for motorways and other highways to be cleaned which was the subject of his earlier amendments in committee but i believe that the concept of practicability must be applied to all aspects of the duty <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have given repeated assurances that we will consult and take account of the views of a wide range of bodies and individuals before making regulations under part vi <e> <s> the secretary of state is the sole control authority for part vi and specific provision is not necessary for him to ensure that those concerned are consulted on regulation proposals <e> <s> let me make clear once again that we will consult and take account of the views of bodies and individuals who can help to ensure that any regulations made under part vi achieve the fundamental objective of protecting the environment against damage from gmos <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord renton raises an important point <e> <s> i want to emphasise to the noble lord lord clinton-davis that the government are not being obstructive in these matters which was the accusation made <e> <s> it is because this issue is so important that we believe it makes sense to develop any policy on liability in the wider context <e> <s> primary legislation will not be necessary because the power is contained in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask for the indulgence of the house because i am not a lawyer <e> <s> my understanding is that the general power given in clause would allow the united kingdom government to honour an obligation and to give effect to that obligation in terms of a policy on liability <e> <s> therefore my understanding is that my noble friend is right in his interpretation that that could be done <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take the last point first <e> <s> my understanding of the legal point is that the functions of the welsh and english councils must be identical because they are intertwined in legislation reaching back to <e> <s> it was that hint that i gave <e> <s> should there be a review of functions all that has taken place in this debate will form part of the information to be made available to any review <e> <s> the policy point is that the government believe that in wales there will be advantage simply through having a single organisation exercising these two sets of functions <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of these amendments would be to enable the secretary of state to create a statutory definition of contamination they would require local authorities to carry out investigations of contamination on sites entered on registers of potentially contaminated land and they would enable costs to be recovered from purchasers <e> <s> no timescale is suggested for these investigations or cost recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends amend vent relates to making provision for exemptions from the registration or registration fee requirement as may be determined by local authorities or as the secretary of state may prescribe in regulations <e> <s> i am pleased to accept the amendment on behalf of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> this was a good bill when it came to your lordships house and after hours of debate in this chamber it is now an even better bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to make a distinction between the million to million referred to by my noble friend and the allegations that have been made about million <e> <s> those two sets of figures are quite separate and distinct <e> <s> however the matter could have been thought through and the point at which the subsidy cut-off was made could have gone on to infinity in other words the subsidy could have been phased out altogether <e> <s> had that been done when the legislation was implemented it would have saved million to million <e> <s> however speedy action was taken <e> <s> the situation was spotted very quickly <e> <s> i am pleased to say that it is proposed that the change will come into effect on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords i refute very strongly the suggestion that there was a mistake <e> <s> we are not talking about a mistake nor did i concede to my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to note that at the time the act was implemented it was felt that some subsidy should be left in the system at whatever level a local authority spent <e> <s> it has been determined subsequently in the light of the levels of spending of some local authorities that the subsidy should be phased out altogether <e> <s> it is that adjustment of policy and not the correction of a mistake with which we are concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have consistently urged the european commission to bring forward proposals for amending the directive which without compromising its conservation objectives would permit member states to control effectively the problems and damage caused by pests such as crows and magpies <e> <s> we raised the matter in the agriculture council only last month <e> <s> very recently the government have learnt that the commission may intend to come forward with a proposal to address the problem <e> <s> any such changes would need the unanimous approval of all member states <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as a great relief to us all and to the government in particular if we can bring about a change to the directive to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have absolutely no choice in the matter of conforming with the directive <e> <s> we have recently received formal notification that we are in breach of the directive <e> <s> we have to respond to that formal notification and we are doing so <e> <s> i repeat that we shall do all that we can to make sure that the changes to the directive are brought about <e> <s> i am assured by much legal advice that we should stand no chance whatever in the european court <e> <s> knowing that our chances are somewhat slim it would not be a good idea to continue in breach <e> <s> we should use all our energies to bring about a change in the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords the wildlife and countryside act has served very well in terms of making sure that if we are to kill birds it will be pests that we kill <e> <s> speaking on behalf of the government i am the first to say that if we are able to bring about a change in the directive we shall do so after severe scrutiny of any birds prescribed for the list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am tempted to say caw <e> <s> i learn something every day at the dispatch box <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for improving my education on these matters <e> <s> we are talking about a <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now learnt something else <e> <s> i note what the noble lord said and in any representations that we make we shall bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords given that we have spent so much time recently discussing matters in the chamber i do not believe that anybody could argue against a european approach to protection of wildlife <e> <s> that is what we are talking about in this directive <e> <s> we are full members of the community and if we believe that there is a nonsense as we do in this case we should do what we can and use all our energies to remedy the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the turner report revealed to the nation and in particular to parents the fact that we do not have that important data <e> <s> the introduction of the national curriculum and a system of testing and assessment will remove the reasons for such speculative reports since we shall know what is going on in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not be drawn into making personal comments either about mr turner or about professor cox <e> <s> i can say that concern has been highlighted about the standards of reading in our schools <e> <s> the more objective the survey and the sooner we all know the standards of reading that are being achieved in our schools the better <e> <s> as i said <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not in a position to say that there is anxiety about standards until we know what those standards are <e> <s> there is considerable anxiety that we do not know what those standards are <e> <s> some people have an intuitive feeling that something is wrong and therefore we need the survey to tell us whether that is the case <e> <s> the work of the assessment of performance unit has been overtaken by and subsumed in the work of the school examinations and assessment council <e> <s> the expertise of the unit will not be lost in the work of the new council <e>", "<cs> my lords there is undoubtedly a very strong feeling that some teaching methods leave a great deal to be desired as regards the teaching of reading to our children <e> <s> we shall only know the true position regarding the achievements in reading in our schools when we have the results of the survey <e> <s> it is essential that the objective testing should evaluate methods of teaching <e> <s> the government have always taken the view that it should be professionals who determine methods <e> <s> when we know whether or not those methods are effective that will be the time to modify teaching methods <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept that we have presided over a major reduction in spending on school libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg

which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered a <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say from the outset that i have no disagreement whatever with my noble friend on the rights of this house to exercise its legitimate duty to ask another place to think again <e> <s> however i shall discuss the reasons why i believe we should not follow that course a little later <e>", "<cs> my lords there is not one noble lord in this house who would argue over the enormous amount of work that the noble lord lord houghton has done in promoting the cause of animals and with his concern for animals <e> <s> on this occasion the government appear to be legislating for animals in a way in which he disapproves <e> <s> i hope that i am able to disabuse the house of that view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered a <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> a to lords amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is a technical amendment which makes it clear that the reference in the relevant schedule is to section of the act

thereof <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome that statement <e> <s> i was referring to the noble lords official position <e> <s> i am sure that we shall hear more from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i specifically addressed that point <e> <s> i would only add that it is not rhetoric <e> <s> this government made a firm target and will deliver that target <e> <s> we are comparing a real target that is achievable with aspirational targets which have no backing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness referred to the government having levied the rate of inflation of per cent <e> <s> on the business community <e> <s> i believe she said that would yield an extra billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures given by the noble baroness are wrong <e> <s> there has been no further revaluation of business and therefore the poundage will yield the same amount <e> <s> the only element of difference will be the number of new businesses which will be netted off by any businesses that go out of the system <e> <s> the record books are positively littered with local authorities including the local authority of the noble baroness that have taken very much more from businesses than the level of inflation <e> <s> the best example that i can bring to mind immediately is that of my own local authority <e> <s> in one year it levied a per cent <e> <s> rate increase on local business which took the business yield from million to million overnight <e> <s> under the present arrangements that the government have put on the statute book that can never happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the matter has to come before the secretary of state <e> <s> he will consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a fundamental difference between the noble lord and the government on this issue <e> <s> the noble lord believes that those in local authorities should be the only <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the reason <e> <s> some local authorities manage their housing stock better than others <e> <s> where houses are boarded up we appeal to the local authority to do what it can to bring them back into use as soon possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish is right in saying that these are difficult times for the construction industry <e> <s> however i must link my reply to one given by my noble friend lord hesketh earlier today <e> <s> the enemy is inflation and there are signs of it falling indeed interest rates have begun to fall <e> <s> that will do more to help the construction industry to get back on track than almost anything else <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness posed many questions in that statement <e> <s> the housing associations alone are not the answer nor are the local authorities alone <e> <s> there must be an amalgam of all the agencies that i mentioned in my answer <e> <s> as regards the homeless the government have recognised that there is a difficulty <e> <s> during the next two years an additional million will be made available <e> <s> of that million will be made available to relieve local authorities provision of poor temporary accommodation and million will be paid to housing associations to relieve those sleeping rough on our streets and in our cities <e> <s> there is a total of million intended specifically to aid the homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> often the best receipts are in areas which are not the poorest and where the need is greatest <e> <s> therefore one must consider a distribution mechanism <e> <s> secondly as i have said in two previous answers putting the issue in the hands of the local authorities does not increase pluralism <e> <s> we are increasing the amount of money given to local authorities but we believe that other agencies are equally and sometimes better able to provide accommodation for the homeless and those who wish to buy homes in the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not condemn the private sector by saying that it is not building <e> <s> it is providing housing across the range from low-cost to high-cost housing <e> <s> as regards low-cost housing specifically registered housing associations already provide homes for more than million people and are now the main providers of subsidised homes for rent and low-cost home ownership for those on low incomes and with the greatest housing need <e> <s> in recognition of its new role the housing corporations capital investment programme is planned to double between and <e> <s> in addition housing estate action has been given a boost of funds to deal with the refurbishment of our large estates <e> <s> more money has also been made available for low-cost housing in rural areas where there are exciting and innovative schemes by local authorities and housing associations <e>", "<cs> my lords given the fact that there is always further to go i believe that the governments record on tackling all housing problem on all fronts is greater than that of any previous government particularly that of the noble lords party <e> <s> today more people own their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that question <e> <s> considerable acreages are being made available on land in rural areas that would not normally be available for housing <e> <s> much is happening on the housing front <e>", "<cs> my lords it must first be said that there has been considerable reform <e> <s> indeed when the national curriculum changes work through the system the hope is there is some evidence already that the staying on rate will improve <e> <s> we are committed to maintaining a-levels <e> <s> that is not to say that we do not have concern about breadth and about introducing some changes <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness knows that seac is at present looking at that area of examinations <e> <s> i can say with absolute assurance that we are not prepared to compromise standards at that level <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that with these reforms the government have addressed that problem <e> <s> all children will now study a range of subjects up to the age of whereas hitherto many young children dropped sciences languages and other subjects which are extremely important <e> <s> that is one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that head teachers themselves are arguing for breadth <e> <s> they would not be arguing for breadth if they could not deliver it <e> <s> i am not sure about the schools with which the noble baroness is familiar but i know that as-levels are offered and many schools where they believe it to be appropriate are encouraging young people to take them up <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an important point <e> <s> certainly vocational courses and the extension of btec courses are actively being considered <e> <s> for example we know that kingshurst ctc is applying vocational courses at -plus level with some success <e> <s> we hope that seac will take that into account when it reports <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a very important point <e> <s> the inevitable consequence of any dilution of standards would be an extension of courses at university level <e> <s> i believe that a-levels have served our brightest children very well <e> <s> we should now be aiming to have more children in that percentage bracket actually taking and passing a-levels <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has also made a very important point <e> <s> i believe that we should not he so hung up on where the children are <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree <e> <s> i know that there is some evidence and that there is a strong body of opinion which believes that a-levels have served us well and should be retained but that we should be giving some consideration to breadth at a-level <e> <s> i have given an assurance that that will be taken into account <e> <s> there is also a minority opinion that for many years has been doing its level best to have a-levels taken out of the system <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no difficulty in giving that assurance <e> <s> a-level standards will not he compromised <e> <s> when seac comes forward with its proposals it will have to prove and demonstrate that standards will not be compromised <e> <s> any changes that are proposed must be changes that do not compromise standards <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with that statement <e> <s> the rationale for the reforms that have been put on the statute book by the government was that young people were coming out of the top end of school without an understanding of geography history a language and so forth <e> <s> the national curriculum changes and those reforms as they work through the system will result in young people leaving <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends remarks strengthen the reasons why we should keep some subjects to be studied in considerable depth as a preparation for university courses <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law relating to town and country planning to extend the powers to acquire by agreement land which may be affected by carrying out public works to amend the law relating to compulsory acquisition of land and to compensation where persons are displaced from land or the value of land or its enjoyment may be affected by public works to provide in the case of compensation payable in respect of things done in the exercise of statutory powers for advance payments and payments in interest and to repeal part x of the highways act <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether or not the noble lord is suggesting that local authority and maintained schools should operate under the same system in other words that they should be allowed to raise substantial sums of money from the private sector <e> <s> that is what happens with ctcs <e> <s> regarding the maintained sector it is estimated that billion was spent between and against deficiencies identified at billion <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is i believe referring to the premises regulations that were required to be in place by <e> <s> they are under review for a number of reasons <e> <s> one reason is that priorities have changed substantially over that time for example the building of changing rooms may not be a priority compared with the updating of science laboratories to conform with the national curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware that there are problems regarding the repair of public buildings <e> <s> however the rise in expenditure from billion in to billion represented a per cent <e> <s> increase the rise from to the coming year is a further per cent <e> <s> and the increase per pupil over a period of years has been per cent <e> <s> in real terms <e> <s> that is an indication that the government recognise that more resources are required <e>", "<cs> my lords i have visited a large number of schools over the past or years <e> <s> i am aware of a number of matters <e> <s> one is that the management of maintenance in some authorities is better than in others <e> <s> there is therefore an issue of management of funds <e> <s> there is also an issue regarding how those funds that are received are applied <e> <s> the noble lord criticises me for quoting statistics <e> <s> the statistics i used are actual statistics they represent real moneys going to schools to address this very problem <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may correct something i said earlier <e> <s> i believe i used the word billions when i should have said millions <e> <s> however the million mentioned by the noble lord needs to be set against the million which is <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a number of problems not least those of poorly-designed schools built much later than the beginning of this century that is to say in the late s the s and s <e> <s> there are considerable problems particularly involving schools with flat roofs <e> <s> management resources constitute a very real issue <e> <s> some authorities have a very good record of managing resources <e> <s> clearly buildings erected at the beginning of the century and before will be in need of restructuring <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know where the figure of million comes from <e> <s> the figure of million incorporates restructuring of buildings and the provision of new buildings besides some refurbishment <e> <s> the figure of million i have not confirmed or otherwise <e> <s> i simply accepted it from the noble lord <e> <s> it is not a figure that i have to hand <e> <s> the amount of private money that has gone into setting up ctcs is to be commended <e> <s> the noble baroness would support a policy of taking the ctcs out of the system altogether <e> <s> where the ctcs have been established they are very popular with the local population <e> <s> they are highly over-subscribed <e> <s> my hope is that industry commerce and the des will continue to support them <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not quite correct <e> <s> the overall allocation is distributed by central government but the actual deployment of those moneys is very much a matter for local government <e> <s> the determination of priorities is also a matter for local government <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak from the dispatch box in order to defend the government on such matters not to defend individuals on the basis of hearsay or statements made outside this chamber <e> <s> there is a great deal of biased literature in this matter which does not emanate from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the details of the school <e> <s> but i know that the policy of that party is to abolish grant-maintained status <e> <s> we believe that grant-maintained status extends choice and it has certainly improved satisfaction with those schools indeed they are oversubscribed <e> <s> we believe that the number of grant-maintained schools is growing sufficiently for it to be a very adverse policy if the labour party should ever consider its abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords we know that primary schools have applied for details about becoming grant-maintained but we do not know of any particular primary school which has had a ballot on the prospect of becoming grant-maintained <e> <s> however that is no reason why they should not be granted the right under the law to be considered along with any other application should they wish to apply for grant-maintained status <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that where grant-maintained status has been granted it has proved to be very popular so popular in fact that all grant-maintained schools are oversubscribed <e> <s> i was not specifically relating my remarks to primary schools <e> <s> we do not see any reason why primary schools should they wish to apply should not be free to do so <e> <s> they will be given serious consideration should we receive an application <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly join my noble friend in condemning any action which either thwarts the application for grant-maintained status or applies a vindictive policy against a school that wishes to become grant-maintained <e> <s> we know of many such examples and that is only one <e>", "<cs> my lords i profoundly disagree with the noble lords views about grant-maintained status <e> <s> grant-maintained status improves choice for both children and parents <e> <s> it makes better use of central funds it frees local schools and it allows them to make decisions at a local level <e> <s> where schools have been awarded grant-maintained status they are highly popular with parents and students <e> <s> where they have been established they are oversubscribed in every single case <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that because this has proved to be so popular in the secondary sector we see no reason to restrict the freedom of a primary school should it wish to apply <e> <s> noble lords opposite would not only restrict primary schools from becoming grant-maintained they would also abolish the secondary schools which have already achieved grant-maintained status <e> <s> we are simply saying that we believe that the maximum amount of freedom should be allowed under the law <e> <s> we will support any primary school application which comes before the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by offering to my noble friend lord soulsby of swaffham prior my most hearty congratulations for a splendid speech <e> <s> he brought all the wealth of his experience and talents to bear on this debate <e> <s> we look forward with enormous enthusiasm to his participation in debates in the house <e> <s> for the record i should point out that swaffham prior is in cambridgeshire not norfolk <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> if she looks tomorrow at <e>", "<cs> my lords seven colleges have already been established and seven more are in the process of being established and will be opened by <e> <s> a fifteenth college is in the early stages of being considered in bristol <e> <s> therefore the government have not only secured substantial sums from the private sector but they have also gone a long way towards achieving their target of ctcs <e>", "<cs> m y lords i gave all the information which was required for that question <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right indeed only yesterday we had such a debate <e> <s> the policy of noble lords opposite would mean more spending more bureaucracy and no choice <e> <s> they would abolish ctcs <e> <s> we hope that ctcs are here to stay <e> <s> moreover where they have been established they have an excellent reputation are popular with both parents and pupils and are oversubscribed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is characteristically negative on the issue <e> <s> i should prefer as would the government to concentrate upon how positive industry and commerce have been in setting up these centres of excellence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the figures representing how much industry and commerce are committed to supply towards the capital cost of setting up these colleges <e> <s> i believe that this shows a very good record thus far <e>", "<cs> my lords negotiating to make contributions towards the setting up of ctcs is a voluntary activity both on the part of industry and commerce and on the part of government in accepting and establishing the arrangements <e> <s> i have given all the figures as regards the contribution of the private sector <e> <s> the private sector is still showing an interest <e> <s> as i said seven other ctcs are in the process of being established and a fifteenth looks as though it may get off the starting block but is at present in the early stages of being established <e>", "<cs> my lords the money which has been spent on establishing ctcs is over and above and not part of the moneys which will go into the mainstream education system <e> <s> noble lords opposite disagree with the establishment of ctcs <e> <s> they have taken many opportunities to criticise them and have done all they can to establish a proposition that they should be abolished <e> <s> the noble lord can travel down that road but we believe that extending choice is a very good thing not just for education but also for the young people who will benefit from a good sound technical education <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of repeating some of yesterdays debate i believe i made it clear that the government are doing a great deal towards increasing technical and vocational education in our schools <e> <s> we believe that the excellent example being set by ctcs will do more than anything else to improve technical education in schools <e> <s> my belief is that we shall see a growth in technical education which will have a great status equal to academic achievement in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is no <e> <s> the cost of limiting the increase in the uniform business rate in to per cent <e> <s> for businesses would create a deficit in local authority funding which would require local authorities to reduce their spending or to levy it on the community charge payer or the deficit would have to be met by the national taxpayer <e> <s> as regards the second part of the question we have no plans for extending transitional relief to new lettings <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very important to make a distinction between transitional arrangements and the system as it will operate after transitional relief <e> <s> the effectiveness of the reforms means that business and commerce rates will be capped they will be capped to the level of inflation <e> <s> therefore no rate increase will ever be greater than the rate of inflation <e> <s> the only power which exists in legislation is a power to reduce the rate and not to increase it <e> <s> that compares under the old system with rate increases over the past year or so of anything between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> i believe that when the new reforms are in place they will prove to be much fairer to business and commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than pleased to give the figures in that respect <e> <s> the year was the most successful one ever <e> <s> there was a net increase of new businesses <e> <s> that figure takes into account the new businesses which came into the system and the liquidations that went out of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the increase in the figure for local authorities is indeed in line with the rate of inflation <e> <s> the noble lord has actually taken into account one aspect of provision for local authorities <e> <s> the increase in their spending is in line with inflation <e> <s> the increase in respect of local businesses namely per cent <e> <s> is a publicly published figure and that is the figure which has been applied when assessing the rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the ssas for local authorities are well beyond per cent <e> <s> i believe that the average for most classes of authority is in excess of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes an important point <e> <s> no one suggests that these times are easy for business but that only strengthens the governments objective which is to get inflation down <e> <s> if we can do anything for local businesses especially small businesses it would be to reduce the level of inflation <e> <s> if we remit the costs to businesses now that cost would only have to be levied on other people <e>", "<cs> my lords the changes which i believe will be well received are help for people who run a shop and live over the shop and for people living in tied accommodation for whom the multiplier is to be reduced to half steps to remove anomalies in cases where people have difficulty selling their homes and improved transitional relief for a number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well have been prophetic <e>", "<cs> my lords the question that i am addressing concerns whether there is any intention to review the structure of the community charge <e> <s> the noble lords question is therefore wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fulfilled that promise in the manifesto <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in the review undertaken this year the government took into account some of the difficulties of implementing the community charge <e> <s> i have listed some of them <e> <s> perhaps i may add that one community charge payer in four receives help from the government <e> <s> a sum of billion is made available for relief of the community charge bills of million people <e> <s> that addresses the principle of ability to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> it is not my duly to indulge in speculation i have no intention of doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will understand if i refuse to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of adjustments made to the community charge this year prove that the government have been receptive to information fed into the department about difficulties faced by some people in paying their charge <e> <s> therefore if radar wishes to continue to supply information to the department i am sure that the department will be receptive to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by welcoming the noble baroness lady hollis to the dispatch box <e> <s> i believe that it is the first occasion on which she has spoken from the dispatch box and i should like to say from this side of the house what an impressive performance it was <e> <s> we look forward to meeting her across the dispatch box on other occasions <e> <s> i lost count when she reached her fifteenth question <e> <s> therefore perhaps the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not pick up all of the points in replying to the debate <e> <s> i shall make sure that answers are given to most of the questions that have been posed during the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that unilateral arrangements cause concern <e> <s> i suspect that at the end of the bills progress through the house we shall find ourselves agreeing to differ about the issue <e> <s> there are many examples where local authorities continue to negotiate <e> <s> the noble baroness pressed me on the point of negotiating for planning gain where negotiations are prolonged to the extent that local authorities hang out for greater benefits under section or section as it now is <e> <s> those prolong and delay a project to the point where a developer can make the decision to act unilaterally <e> <s> at the end of the day that is also subject to judicial review <e> <s> if the developer has acted precipitately if he has acted unreasonably there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is addressing the point about global emissions <e> <s> our contribution to those emissions needs to be seen in perspective <e> <s> it is only per cent <e> <s> of the total therefore per cent <e> <s> of co <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe this country is setting an example in that we have put global warming firmly on the agenda <e> <s> my right honourable friend the immediate past prime minister called the first conference on this matter <e> <s> that was followed by a number of other conferences <e> <s> my right honourable friend pressed i am sure that her successor will continue to do so for the united nations to agree to an international convention before <e> <s> that together with all the practical measures which have been taken not least those contained within the environmental protection act which has just been put on the statute book show that a great deal is being <e>", "<cs> my lords the prediction of co <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes an interesting point <e> <s> it is argued that we have set a realistic target which is achievable but which will make demands on industry and commerce <e> <s> however the government are concerned that the economy of the united kingdom should not be disproportionately affected in achieving those targets if the rest of the world is not going to co-operate in a global response to the issue <e> <s> i am absolutely convinced that the government will continue to press for international co-operation <e> <s> the government will also in a practical way do what they can to achieve a realistic target without upsetting disproportionately industry and commerce in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is an interesting point <e> <s> we have determined a target that is tough but achievable <e> <s> we believe that an orderly reduction in emissions gives us time to continue research and the promotion of innovative thinking to resolve this matter <e> <s> some of the aspirational targets as i prefer to call them are rather glibly talked about <e>", "<cs> my lords my answer was not a straightforward yes <e> <s> i wished to assure noble lords and people outside the house that the government are taking a practical and firm approach to stabilising emissions at levels <e> <s> as i have outlined that is a tough target which will make demands on industry and commerce <e> <s> at the same time i must emphasise that one country alone whose contribution to global warming is only per cent <e> <s> of the total cannot tackle the problem by itself <e> <s> other countries together account for per cent <e> <s> of emissions <e> <s> an international co-operative effort is required to make an impact on global warming <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say specifically whether there is one monitoring body <e> <s> if i obtain any other information i shall write to the noble baroness <e> <s> however i am sure that monitoring is taking place all the time in order to define what point we have reached and whether we are making progress on reductions <e> <s> i shall write to the noble baroness with more details <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is absolutely right <e> <s> the figures for france are so impressive because the french have been courageous and have a buoyant nuclear programme <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the noble lords first point we shall have to differ on the scientific basis on which the prediction of a per cent <e> <s> increase in emissions was made <e> <s> if we do nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i seriously take issue with the noble baroness on her second point <e> <s> rates paid on buildings no longer exist <e> <s> that situation was abolished with the new system <e> <s> as the new system operates abatement is considered <e> <s> it is even more generous than rate relief and the disabilities of individuals are taken into account as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the question on the order paper refers specifically to disabled people <e> <s> one in four people are helped to pay their community charge bills <e> <s> a sum of billion is made available and million people receive some help <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that nothing i have said seems to detract from the way in which i believe that we should care about the needs of disabled people <e> <s> my first answer listed the kind of help that is considered <e> <s> community charge benefits take account of the needs of disabled people <e> <s> i said that there is complete exemption for people with severe mental impairment <e> <s> there is also exemption for those with mental or physical disabilities who are resident in hospital care homes nursing homes and other hostels <e> <s> for those disabled people in the community there is also additional help over and above that given to other people <e> <s> i hope that i was not suave or uncompassionate in my answers on this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords first remark <e> <s> my right honourable friend the new prime minister served with distinction in the department of health and social security as it then was <e> <s> he had a very good and special relationship with disabled people and their organisations <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that there has been a review undertaken during the past year <e> <s> the review will continue as has been very publicly promised <e> <s> i believe that if disabled people wish to be considered further over and above the generous arrangements that have been made for them they could make representations to both the department of the environment and their own organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of social security has some very sophisticated methods of monitoring the requirements of people with many kinds of special needs not just the disabled <e> <s> i have no reason to believe that those needs are not watched with great care <e> <s> continuous monitoring also gives rise from time to time to new policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i have detailed the number of ways in which disabled people are helped <e> <s> however the noble lord makes specific reference to areas where the poll tax is very high <e> <s> i believe that it is more a reflection on the level of the charge in those areas than it is on the level of the way in which we help disabled people <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that if people qualify to have the per cent <e> <s> paid into their social security payments whatever they are that per cent <e> <s> is per cent <e> <s> of the average community charge in the country as a whole <e> <s> where community charges are above the average that reflects more on the local authority than on the system <e>", "<cs> my lords the amount referred to by the noble baroness means that the family does not fall into the category of receiving some of the benefits available <e> <s> if the noble baroness says that an individual with disability is paying she introduces a very different factor <e> <s> if there is one disabled person he will receive all the benefits <e> <s> if there are other people in the house and if they are below the threshold for rebate <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a short but useful debate <e> <s> there has been a wide measure of support for the education support grants programme <e> <s> everyone will have their own view of the real priorities <e> <s> it would always be nice to have more money to do things <e> <s> nonetheless it is common ground that esgs and the parallel training grants are having a beneficial impact and provide a key margin of funds to help ensure that the education service can respond to changing needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall allow that comment to pass <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i am making is that overall expenditure has gone up by per cent <e> <s> this year and will go up by per cent <e> <s> next year for education spending <e> <s> the local authority expenditure prescribed nationally by the government as a proportion has gone down <e> <s> in other words the flexibility for local determination has been increased by the reduction in national prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords i said earlier that the proportion of these moneys is per cent <e> <s> of the budget overall <e> <s> i believe i have answered the criticism that the percentage is reducing <e> <s> it is because local authorities are being given greater discretion over the moneys that they are spending <e> <s> that per cent <e> <s> is specifically set aside for the government to have their national priorities met and to assist local education authorities to implement as current thinking goes the national curriculum and the measures in the education reform act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his comments and his conversion to the recovery of costs scheme <e> <s> i note his reluctance and the reasons why he takes that view <e> <s> the noble lord spoke about the parlous state of the construction industry and the difficulties that it is having at this time <e> <s> we are talking about the costs being met only when application is being submitted <e> <s> we are talking about the part of the construction industry which is still in work and managing to submit applications <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i was saying that costs are only awarded when an application is made <e> <s> we are talking about that part of the construction industry which is still submitting applications <e> <s> we all wish that the construction industry was more buoyant at the moment <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned the degrees by which we are increasing the fees and that it was done specifically in order to help the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall give a snap answer and say that it is because the scottish system is more efficient but i do not know the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall find out and write to the noble lord <e>"]
