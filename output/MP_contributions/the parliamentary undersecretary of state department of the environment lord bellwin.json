["<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the minister of transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble lords will be aware a report prepared by the british railways board setting out the results of preliminary studies undertaken in conjunction with the french railways for a single-track rail-only channel tunnel was published in february last <e> <s> at the same time the chairman of the board asked for an early indication of the governments attitude <e> <s> the government are giving careful consideration to the boards proposals but it is too early to say what view the government will take of this new project <e>", "<cs> my lords the forthcoming housing bill will include measures to allow shorthold lettings in the private rented sector and will give public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity to respond to the points raised by noble lords in this debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the select committee on producing such a clear and if i dare say it such a constructive report <e> <s> i am sure that the select committee has made a most important contribution to the debate on a most difficult subject <e> <s> we could not have had a better illustration of the value and importance of the parliamentary scrutiny process which is highly relevant to this particular directive <e> <s> i can assure the house without hesitation that both the report and the debate have been an invaluable guide to the government in dealing with the directive <e> <s> i am sure that the debate to be arranged in another place shortly will be equally instructive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of a loophole which would enable such longstanding tenants to be evicted from their homes <e> <s> we have made it clear that we do not intend to reduce the security of existing protected tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords a detailed study into all aspects of the beverage container question is at present being undertaken by the packaging and containers working group of the waste management advisory council <e> <s> the government await the groups report which they hope to receive early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to relax controls over local government to amend the law relating to the publication of information the undertaking of works and the payment of allowances by local authorities and other bodies the commissions for local administration and the commissioner for local administration in scotland to make further provision with respect to rates and to grants for local authorities and other bodies and for controlling their expenditure to amend the law relating to planning to make provision for a register of public land and the disposal of land on it to repeal the community land act to continue the land authority for wales to make further provision in relation to land compensation development land derelict land and public bodies acquisitions and disposals of land to amend the law relating to town development and new towns to provide for the establishment of corporations to regenerate urban areas to make further provision in relation to gypsies and their caravan sites to repeal enactments about new streets to make further <e>", "<cs> my lords eec regulation no <e> <s> / on freedom of movement for workers within the community provides that eec nationals working in another member state shall enjoy the same rights and benefits in relation to housing as the nationals of that state <e> <s> it is for local housing authorities to judge the housing needs of those in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords as the recent judgment in the court of appeal shows there are important safeguards associated with the housing homeless persons act <e> <s> the judgment indicates that immigrants who have come to this country without making prior long-term arrangements for accommodation may be declared intentionally homeless <e> <s> authorities have only limited duties to such peoples <e> <s> even where authorities accept responsibility for a homeless family this would not necessarily involve making available a council house such as they would offer to people on the waiting list <e>", "<cs> my lords figures for local authority employment in england and wales taken from the joint manpower watch show that between th march the last survey date before the general election and th september the latest survey date for which information has been published the number of manual employees increased by and of non-manual employees decreased by a net decrease of <e> <s> all these numbers are in terms of full-time equivalents <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to repeat a statement now being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment on housing public expenditure <e>", "<cs> the members of the governing bodies of all secondary schools including voluntary schools are already called governors <e> <s> as has already been said the bill already provides for all primary schools including voluntary schools to have governors and governing bodies <e> <s> therefore the amendments are unnecessary in terms of the purpose of the clause as introduced <e> <s> the fact is that foundation governors are distinguished by the specific common purpose for which they are appointed and which is prescribed in statute <e> <s> they have responsibilities which are not shared by the other governors <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said on th january in an answer to my noble friend lord orr-ewing the government are currently reviewing the operation of the act and any decisions to amend its provisions will have to await the outcome <e>", "<cs> my lords the olympic games for the disabled which includes the paraplegics will be held at arnhem in holland <e>", "<cs> clause <e>", "<cs> my lords when this matter was discussed in committee it was explained that the amendment as drafted would not achieve the desired effect because the use of the words any child would mean that a parent with more than one child in the school would have to cease to be a governor not more than months after the eldest child left school notwithstanding that he had one or more other children at school <e> <s> it was also explained that there was nothing between the two sides of the committee in principle and my noble friend lady young undertook to write to the noble baroness lady david and indeed did write to her explaining how the government saw the provisions of the bill working in practice in relation to <e>", "<cs> my lords the position as i understand it is that the libyan embassy has bought the old kingsley school in glebe place chelsea and intends to use it for educational purposes <e> <s> the school was sold by the inner london education authority last year to a third party who in turn sold it to the libyans <e> <s> this is a matter of essentially local interest and as such is for the local authority <e> <s> her majestys government see no reason to regard the transaction as such as being inconsistent with the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are as enthusiastic as is the noble lord lord somers that large numbers of trees should be planted to enrich the environment of this country <e> <s> the loss of many trees over the last decade particularly due to the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have responded to similar questions from the noble lord in the past the answer again has to be no <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it is with some temerity that i rise to address your lordships being conscious of the weight of experience and knowledge around me <e> <s> this is my first bill and one which i am proud to present this afternoon <e> <s> it is perhaps not as generally familiar a subject as some others which have come and will shortly come before your lordships but its provisions are of great importance for the transport industry and for the considerable number of people who use the services it provides <e> <s> i look forward to a stimulating debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have information in the precise form requested by the noble lord but i hope the following will prove helpful <e> <s> excluding first registrations of formerly rent controlled property there were rent registrations for furnished and unfurnished regulated tenancies in england and wales in <e> <s> the mean percentage change in rent following a registration in these <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government influence the level of local government expenditure including manpower through the annual public expenditure white paper through the annual rate support grant settlement and by the operation of the capital borrowing consent powers <e> <s> ministers also regularly discuss these and related matters with the local authority associations and the leaders of individual local authorities <e> <s> in addition legislative proposals for the control of total capital expenditure and for a new method of grant distribution which will not reward overspending are before parliament at present and will be brought to your lordships house shortly <e> <s> local authorities are employers in their own right and make there their own decisions on staffing <e> <s> however my right honourable friend has frequently stressed the need to reduce local government manpower and has encouraged the regular publication of detailed figures <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say immediately to my noble friend lord amory and indeed this is the stance i took when this was raised in committee that of course one is very sympathetic because this is a matter which concerns the life and the future livelihood of many people <e> <s> therefore one has to take this as seriously as i assure your lordships both i and my ministerial colleagues in the department of transport and even beyond that do <e> <s> my lords when my noble friend lord selsdon moved this amendment at committee stage i said that in the light of that importance we would take it away and think about it again not least because we are talking of a very complex and difficult technical subject and if i may say so i think that the noble lord lord mishcon fully merits a pat on the back <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the proposal that council tenants should have the right to buy is contained in the housing bill which was read a second time in your lordships house on th june <e>", "<cs> my lords fair rents are fixed independently by individual rent officers on the statutory basis laid down by the rent act <e> <s> the department of the environment provides rent officers with statistical information about previous rent registrations but issues no guidance to them on the fixing of rent levels <e>", "<cs> my lords there are indeed indications that local government as a whole had budgeted for a higher volume of current expenditure in than is called for by the governments expenditure plans <e> <s> this is quite unacceptable <e> <s> my right honourable friend proposes to ask all local authorities to revise their expenditure plans downwards and to submit new returns by st august <e> <s> in the light of those returns we shall consider whether further action is necessary <e> <s> since wages and salaries account for nearly three-quarters of gross current expenditure it is clear that manpower reductions are essential if the proposed reductions in local government expenditure are to be achieved in and following years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say first of all and very briefly that i am not in a position to argue or join in the debate on the constitutional aspects <e> <s> there are those far better qualified not least my noble friend lord drumalbyn and others than i to do that <e> <s> i would only say on that point that listening very carefully as even more of a newcomer than the noble lord lord sefton if the thesis is that the conclusions of a select committee thereby irrevocably bind your lordships house if that is the case then i make no other comment than that i am rather surprised <e> <s> but clearly that is not for me to comment upon further at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear there is nothing i can usefully add to the statement made by my noble friend lord trefgarne last month <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i would have to begin by saying first of all that my concern and that of the government is no less than the concern of anyone who has spoken in so far as both the rights of individual elderly persons and the needs of the community as a whole to be able to provide accommodation for the elderly are concerned <e> <s> the amendment proposed by the noble baroness lady birk would greatly increase the scope of the exemption of elderly persons dwellings from the right to buy provided in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> i pay tribute without any reservation to the forthright and indeed humane way in which she and others have spoken on this subject but what <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into a committee on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and following my noble friends undertaking earlier today that the government would make a further statement on the point raised by the noble baroness lady llewelyn-davies of hastoe i should now like to make a statement on housing investment by local authorities in the present financial year <e> <s> before doing so i should like to tell the house that the government certainly intended no discourtesy to the house <e> <s> we formed the view that the announcement by my right honourable friend the secretary of state was not one which should be made in the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so the alternative is really impossible <e> <s> one could not send a letter to every member of the house on every point <e> <s> it is totally impracticable <e> <s> when a minister undertakes to write he does so as a courtesy and to give information and there is no reason why others should not see what is in the letter but it is a practical impossibility to write to everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed most of the arguments involved in this matter when we were considering amendment no <e> <s> which the noble lord lord bruce of donington moved to clause <e> <s> the governments case is that we must prevent the risk of cross-subsidisation <e> <s> we must therefore require authorities to calculate separately the rate of return that their dlos are earning on the separate parts of their business <e> <s> we must have information available in as clear a form as possible so that councillors and ratepayers can see just where their operations are succeeding and where they are failing <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are pursuing discussions with the local authorities concerned on the detailed arrangements for the seven enterprise zones announced by my right honourable friend the prime minister on th july <e> <s> we still hope to conclude draft agreements for most of these zones shortly after the local government planning and land no <e> <s> bill receives royal assent so that the procedures for setting them up can begin without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends for their comments as regards the appointment of chief constables <e> <s> in fact we have covered this ground before and i thought that your lordships were content <e> <s> let us be quite clear that we are not here talking about the removal of some central controls over local authorities <e> <s> the noble baroness lady stedman seeks some relaxation of the controls over police authorities exercised by the home secretary <e> <s> but police authorities are not local authorities they are independent statutory bodies composed of two-thirds county councillors and one-third magistrates <e> <s> police authorities are dependent on the county council or in the case of combined police authorities the constituent councils for funding police expenditure <e> <s> however per cent <e> <s> of expenditure on the police is paid by central government through a specific grant <e>", "<cs> my lords some vacant or tenanted council dwellings were sold in england and wales between april and june the latest date for which we have such information on a countrywide basis <e> <s> separate figures for sales
