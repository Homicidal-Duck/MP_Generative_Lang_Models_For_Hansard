["<cs> my lords in the course of his speech the noble lord lord soames told us of the great problems which the government have inherited from their predecessors <e> <s> this is the kind of thing one always expects to hear when power changes hands <e> <s> i wish he had used a little more imagination in the kind of language he deployed <e> <s> my noble friend lord shinwell will remember as i do the meeting i think of the parliament after the election when we were told by the late captain cruikshank of the horrors that they had inherited <e> <s> i thought he did it delightfully and i have had a soft spot in my heart for him ever since <e> <s> he told us that when they reached their departments they found the cobwebs hanging from the candelabra <e> <s> that really expresses it all and i was rather disappointed that the noble lord lord soames could not vie with that kind of language <e>", "<cs> my lords is there no way in which we can assist by using the legislation on pest control <e>", "<cs> my lords i was pleased that the noble earl paid a tribute to my noble friend lord scanlon who has done a first-class job of work in this respect <e> <s> we have come a long way from the days not so long ago when the whole training in engineering was done by a few big firms and the rest pinched the products <e> <s> the scheme we are now dis <e>", "<cs> my lords before we part with the bill may i wish godspeed to the gilbert islanders <e> <s> i believe that i was the only secretary of state for the colonies ever to visit them <e> <s> i had the good fortune to go to see them on their coral atoll and i must confess that i never thought that economically they would be able to proceed to full independence <e> <s> i also had the good fortune to visit fiji the solomons and the new hebrides and in most of those areas there was considerable fear of what would happen when britain left <e>", "<cs> my lords i owe an apology to the house for the fact that i have not been able to be present for quite a long period during the debate <e> <s> i had to attend a rather important committee in another part of the palace <e> <s> i shall try to make up for my lapse by cutting out three-quarters of what i intended to say <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord spens not only on the motion that he has put on the order paper but on the enjoyable speech that he made in support of it <e> <s> both his speech and that of my noble friend lord ritchie-calder reminded me that for at least years i have been trying to persuade my colleagues in the trade union movement that there is no better way to spend their money than on research into the use of leisure time <e> <s> i believe that that is now becoming quite obvious <e> <s> but also i believe we are clear we are now going into a period of intense technological change and under such conditions naturally employers are concerned to shed labour <e> <s> they do it as rapidly as possible and apart from redundancy payments they believe that is the end of the story <e> <s> of course governments cannot or indeed should not leave it at that for they have a responsibility for the wellbeing of unemployed people <e> <s> that responsibility includes efforts to ensure alternative job opportunities <e> <s> my criticism of the present government and especially the budget is although it seems to accomplish the task of getting people out of work it does not show much sign of knowing how to get them back into alternative employment <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say so they minimised what would have been a much worse problem <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that there are a great many restrictions which the franco administration put upon the people of gibraltar <e> <s> are the government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with others in offering congratulations to the noble lord lord armstrong <e> <s> i thoroughly enjoyed his maiden speech <e> <s> when he reminded us of the heavy unemployment in northumberland it certainly struck a chord with me <e> <s> i once had the job of trying to cure the unemployment <e> <s> when there was a sneeze in london we had pneumonia up in the north-east <e> <s> however i thoroughly enjoyed his speech and i hope to hear him again on very many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords brown coal of course it is <e> <s> i hope i am not arguing a selfish attitude in energy matters but we are not playing for small stakes in all this and i hope that in our discussions with our colleagues in the eec we shall impress upon them that there is a dire need for each of them to go after the resources wherever they may be in the ground and to begin at once <e>", "<cs> my lords either i said it very badly or the noble viscounts hearing is defective <e> <s> i did not say that i did not mean that and i would not support such a policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that the government are doing far too well already in increasing the price of other things without doing it with gas <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount told us that the review is now completed <e> <s> is he aware that he spoke far more about the financial saving that the review will produce than he did about the jobs that will be lost <e> <s> would he say whether in the course of that review the government made any estimate of the total job losses which will result from it <e> <s> further is he aware when he speaks about the intermediate areas that one of the lessons we learned was that when you have an intermediate area on the fringe of a development area and the intermediate area then disappears they are in a far worse position than any area which is within miles of a development area <e> <s> that is because nobody will go into an area on the fringe of a development area where no assistance is given while a development area is only a few miles further on <e> <s> will the noble viscount therefore tell us in view of the million less and the fact that inflation will erode that which is left for development purposes what are the levels of unemployment that he can see forthcoming in the next two or three years <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble viscount agree that several large and vital firms in the private sector would have gone bankrupt but for the saving grace of the board <e> <s> does not the noble viscount also agree that it appears from the statement that if the private sector cannot keep these firms in being the government would prefer them to go bankrupt rather than that the neb should save them <e> <s> there is also specific mention in the statement of million which must be raised <e> <s> will the sales bear any relationship to the real value of those firms rather than to the mere raising of million <e> <s> finally would the noble viscount take it from me that far from this being welcomed in any industrial part of the country it sounds far and away more like a piece of vandalism <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the answer he got was a shocking one <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that we all join the noble lord lord campbell of croy in hoping that this long delay is now coming to an end <e> <s> i do not disagree with most of what the noble lord has said to us <e> <s> he has concentrated on scottish steel but it is true to say that throughout the world steel industries are in dire trouble <e> <s> indeed if that which the economists tell us comes about and we are going into an even deeper recession those steel industries will be among the first to feel the effects of such a recession <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl keep in mind that when gas was not produced by a monopoly it was in grave danger of going out of existence altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a point of marxist influence in the labour party <e> <s> can he tell us about the same influence in the civil service <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always the custom in this house to <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earl has almost confirmed my analysis of what he was <e>", "<cs> my lords while the ministers reply to my noble friend lord wynne-jones on the question of coal is satisfactory as far as it goes may i ask him to accept that if we are now to see the closure of quite a number of pits in south wales consequent on the run-down of the steel industry there will be great resistance to the idea of more nuclear development because the miners will not believe that there will be the same demand for coal <e> <s> in the statement the noble lord said the pwr was more economic than the agr <e> <s> my recollection is that when we agreed on the agr we knew that it would be more expensive to install but that the economic performance would be cheaper <e> <s> was the noble lord referring then to the installation when he said the pwr would be cheaper than the agr or was he saying that the economic performance would be cheaper <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for taking us through the detailed provisions of the bill <e> <s> on wednesday of last week we had a very comprehensive debate on economic and industrial matters and the house did not i think very much like that which it saw <e> <s> the fact that we had that debate then is probably the reason why noble lords do not consider that this bill which in part covers some of those details is quite so damaging to the economy as i consider it is <e> <s> since our debate last wednesday we have learnt that inflation has continued its rise and has now reached per cent <e> <s> there has been a further deterioration in the balance of payments and we have reports of still heavier unemployment <e> <s> today i see in the press that the engineering employers federation report that they expect months of severe depression in their industry while the charterhouse group predicts a per cent <e> <s> fall in industrial production this year and a rise of over half a million in the number of unemployed <e> <s> that is the economic and industrial situation which we have seen develop since our debate last wednesday <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> there is more joy in heaven over one act of repentance and so on <e> <s> we on this side of the house condemn this bill because at a time of acute economic and industrial problems it restricts the ability of the neb and of the agencies to continue the good work they have been doing in assisting in the strengthening of this vital section of british industry <e> <s> perhaps the noble viscount will tell me whether i am wrong in believing that the neb made a profit last year of something like per cent <e> <s> or more <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount agree that in i think july last or in the budget his right honourable friend was insisting on the neb finding million in the course of this financial year <e> <s> that cannot possibly apply to rolls-royce or leyland <e> <s> of whom was he thinking when he said that <e>", "<cs> my lords if indeed the government are to go ahead at some stage with this suggestion will the noble viscount confirm that they will not simply try to denationalise those sectors which are making profits but will in fact look at the whole industry and not leave the public to look after the sectors which are not making profits <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether in the negotiations with the spanish government there will be a place for sir joshua hassan to look in <e>", "<cs> my lords many of the criticisms we have of this government are contained in the motion which my noble friend has moved but one of the criticisms which is not set out in that motion is that while many of us have been trying for a long time to modernise industrial relationships trying to get both the trade unions and the employers to set up a system of negotiation appropriate to the last few years of the th century all this has been made impossible by the policies which the present government have brought to bear <e> <s> indeed our anxieties on a very wide variety of these vital issues are contained in the motion and in so far as they have been answered at all the reply has of course been the usual one about the need to control inflation <e> <s> i join the noble baroness lady seear in saying that of course this is one of the major problems that has to be faced but i submit that you cannot defeat inflation merely by a policy of savage deflation allied to the resurrection of a type of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount give way <e> <s> he tells us that things were going all right with the incomes policy until it was <e>", "<cs> i have heard nothing which prompts me to withdraw the amendment but may i mention one or two matters before we divide <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester is i know a very fair-minded man <e> <s> he said that he and his party would not accept any further nationalisation but the fact is that no one is asking them to do so <e> <s> we are asking that the industry act be retained whereas the government are asking us to make changes <e> <s> it is not the case that anyone is asking anyone else under this proposal to accept any further nationalisation <e>", "<cs> this is the old story if only everybody was as good as the best we should have no cause for complaint <e> <s> i agree with what has been said from the liberal benches <e> <s> it is now essential that we should try to get the people working in any industry utterly involved and to encourage them to seek information on decisions which are of great importance to them <e> <s> i agree with what the noble baroness lady seear was saying <e> <s> i can remember being on production com <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount agree that in another place the question was raised whether this clause <e>", "<cs> as i understand clause we are dealing with writing off capital which is represented by the firms which have been sold by the neb or by the agencies and my understanding is that the agencies are to be answerable to the scottish and welsh ministers who for all we know may take a view different from that of the secretary of state for industry <e> <s> for my part have no objection in principle anyway to dead capital being written off <e> <s> indeed i remember on one occasion writing off about million of the ncbs capital because it was imposing a heavy penalty on the ncb <e> <s> over the years there had been many pit closures the coal industry having been asked by the government to invest for more coal than in fact was ever needed <e> <s> therefore i have nothing in principle against writing off dead capital but i submit that this case is a very different proposition <e> <s> there is no question of writing off dead capital indeed the assets are so much alive that others are buying them in forced sales made necessary only because of the policy the government are now pursuing <e> <s> they are creating a situation quite deliberately to shrink the activities of the board itself in order to sell back to private firms the assets which have been made viable by the work of the neb and the two agencies <e>", "<cs> if the noble viscount agrees to second it i will move it <e>", "<cs> is it not the case that clause reduces the million rising to million of the act as far as the neb is concerned and that the scottish development agency i am quoting from the under-secretary at the committee stage in another place <e>", "<cs> the switch from clause to clause having taken place after having put down an amendment to clause may i say a word about clause before we part with it <e> <s> as i understand it the act laid down limits for the neb of some million and provided that it could be increased by order to million <e> <s> clause now removes the power to make that increase <e> <s> so far as the scottish development agency is concerned and my scottish friends know the state of the economy up there at the moment the limit of million could be increased to million under clause that increase will not now be implemented <e> <s> when we come to the welsh development agency the effect of clause is that whereas the act gave an amount of million which could be increased to million the limit will remain at million <e> <s> therefore on the argument that by the governments policies there would be increases of some type or another for the private sector the reductions in amount from the neb the welsh development agency the scottish development agency will be as i have described <e>", "<cs> we have heard nothing which dissuades us from the <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble viscount lord long gave us a very strange interpretation of what this bill is about in saying how much he wanted the neb to concentrate on work in this country at the same time as emasculating the neb robbing it of the main part of its functions <e> <s> to me the two things do not add up <e>", "<cs> we have no objections in the least to this kind of development <e> <s> we wish it well <e> <s> i do not think that at this stage we would wish to commit ourselves on all the details <e> <s> the noble viscount said that it <e>", "<cs> can the noble viscount say which was the industry no <e> <s> act <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever a minister appears either at the penitent form or the dispatch box to tell us in either technical or untechnical language that they have found a need because of their own shortcomings to move amendments to their own bill my heart goes out to them <e> <s> i have no more to say <e>", "<cs> my lords in my time i have appointed and reappointed several chairmen of nationalised industries <e> <s> however if we take notice of what both the noble lord lord ferrier and the noble lord lord nugent of guildford have said we are going to have one dickens of a job to get anybody to accept chairmanships of nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to get too nostalgic but from the days of the attlee government the tory party has gone out of its way to denigrate every kind of nationalised industry that we have produced <e> <s> they have felt that this was their way not only of denigrating public ownership but of bolstering up private ownership <e> <s> so far as we are concerned or a great many of us we have no objections my family lives on their own private industry so i have no objections <e> <s> but i detest this business of denigrating great public corporations which will determine in coal in steel in gas in electricity in a whole host of things whether or not britain succeeds <e> <s> many noble lords opposite are extremely interested in agriculture <e> <s> the only reason why we have now been able to mechanise agriculture is that we nationalised the electricity industry <e> <s> would the manchester corporation or any other municipal corporation have bothered pushing electricity into the rural areas if we had not had a nationalised industry <e>", "<cs> my lords why denigrate nationalised industry <e> <s> i have said that throughout the world bulk steel producing industries are in recession <e> <s> the united states of america is no exception to this statement <e> <s> indeed the last time i looked at some of the returns over there for instance the great bethesda organisation they were hun <e>", "<cs> my lords was not his apology merely directed to the conservative members <e>", "<cs> my lords can we assume that because of his connection with british leyland most of the problems there will shortly be solved <e>", "<cs> i thought my noble friend lord mccarthy was right in many of the points he was making about the reasons for ballots <e> <s> one of the things he did not mention was the enthusiasm of the convert <e> <s> the tory party never had ballots until a few years ago and they now want to feel that they are going to pioneer the idea of ballots to the degradation of those backward proletarian institutions such as the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> it was very necessary that my noble friend lord wedderburn should have explained the background to the bridlington arrangements <e> <s> in this country we pioneered so much in the way of the formation of trade unions that much of the structure is now pretty well obsolete <e> <s> it follows that instead of the structure of industrial unionism with one union per industry we have a large multiplicity of unions even within one industry many of them indeed organising the same type of labour <e> <s> this leads to differences and difficulties which would not be with us if we had a structure of industrial unionism <e> <s> therefore the points made by my noble friend in explaining bridlington are vital in understanding the reasons for this amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not know why the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter imagines that going to the ultimate to the tribunal could be any quicker than the usual procedures within the trade union movement <e> <s> i have taken cases of this type where an individual has <e>", "<cs> why then cannot we put into the bill the six-month rule starting from the moment the complaint is made <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord seems to think that to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a select committee of this house has received evidence that government departments are delaying payment of their debts to small firms <e> <s> is this because of the high interest rates that they can gain out of them <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has tried to negotiate with the french both in europe and in the new hebrides is the noble lord aware that he has my sympathy <e> <s> will he ensure that they are not permitted to use the arrangement which brought the condominium into existence to allow their colonists in the new hebrides to get away with activities which are utterly unlawful and which could not stand the test of the democratic approach because quite obviously they are now trying to undermine the authority of a democratically elected government <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble viscount for repeating the statement which was made in another place <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that as one looks through this long statement one cannot find any new jobs in the areas affected by the steel closures <e> <s> the statement purports to be a remedial one to produce palliatives for the problems which the government themselves have created <e> <s> it does not pretend to get down to the root of the matter which is the rapid decline of the manufacturing and steel industries of this country a decline which has now reached crisis level <e> <s> of course special development areas and development areas are a very good proposition <e> <s> we used them for many years <e> <s> but they are quite useless unless there are ample industrial investments with orders to accompany them which will enable firms to expand into the new areas which have been named in this statement <e> <s> we all know that industrial investment is falling and one cannot understand how the government think that they can induce non-expanding industries to move into such areas <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i asked regarding the manpower services commission whether they were going to be given any extra financial help in order to assist them to do that which the statement says and whether with the run-down which is taking place the amount of money that the engineering apprentices board for instance is getting will be increased <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great change of attitude of the peking government does the noble lord agree that they may be looking at the position of hong kong in the longer term and that they will agree to a greater amount of election rather than appointment of the council <e>", "<cs> my lords in a long parliamentary career i do not think that i have ever heard a more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt but i should like to get this clear <e> <s> is the noble viscount saying that credit will now be given to the bsc for that write-off and that interest rates and so on which have been paid on that money will not now need to be paid any more in this years assets <e>", "<cs> a mortuary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is a case of a firm which was rescued from bankruptcy by public control and that now whether we agree with the method by which it is to be disposed of or not the taxpayer has certainly made a terrifically good deal by it having been in the custody of the neb <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that as recently as the period when the industry bill was before the house it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that if it is possible to make an estimate of the type asked for in the question it is possible also to estimate the cost of the massive unemployment from which we are now suffering <e> <s> you cannot have one without the other <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to make it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support my noble friends in their amendment <e> <s> i can never understand and i have said this before why people should imagine that some of us spend half our life running around trying to get members into trade unionism in order to kick them out <e> <s> clause is i think based upon that premise <e> <s> a short time ago we were discussing in an amendment the issue of a person who has been excluded and who feels that it has been done erroneously <e> <s> i take the point of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> it is possible at local level for something of that kind to happen <e> <s> but i would remind the house that it is also the case indeed the case he quoted was rectified by going to headquarters on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to give the noble lord an instance of where that can happen <e> <s> at one time i happened to be the convenor of auew shop stewards in a huge factory of some people <e> <s> i was also the chairman of the works committee which embraced or trade unions <e> <s> when the negotiations in a dispute reached the highest level with top management i took all those disputes irrespective of the union from which they came <e> <s> therefore if it was a disagreement the end product was the result of my negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i make a short intervention into this fratricidal strife <e> <s> the noble earl lord gowrie was saying that this may well be a preliminary to what the green paper will show <e> <s> are we then to suppose that this is a paving bill to a far more stringent and maybe vicious bill later on <e> <s> apparently from his arguments and those we heard just now there is the belief that they must curb trade union power because of what happened during the winter of discontent <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says hear hear <e> <s> in that event he does not understand what happened in the winter of discontent <e> <s> the leading union in that period was nupe <e> <s> does anybody really believe that they possess any industrial power <e> <s> as a matter of fact what happened was that feeling that they had certain rights and certain desires for increases in incomes they struck and then found that it did not matter much whether they were on strike or not <e> <s> it was this weakness which led to the excesses which according to noble lords opposite are now construed as great overwhelming trade union power <e> <s> it was nothing of the kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord gowrie was puzzled some time ago as to why more members did not speak from this side of the house <e> <s> may i tell him that the main reason is that we think that this is a bill which in no way adds anything at all to the problems with which this nation is confronted on the industrial front <e> <s> if there was ever a time in the long complicated industrial history of britain when a united front in all parts was essential it is now <e> <s> this miserable bill will divide it further <e> <s> that is the basic reason why many of my noble friends have not felt that it was worth a contribution anyway <e> <s> we heard expressions about the winter of discontent and changing the balance of power of industry and that this bill is going to do something about that <e> <s> my lords it will do precisely nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that i am concerned not only about the appearance of the palace important though that is but as i understand it the stonework which is very soft stone is now deteriorating rapidly <e> <s> moreover while in the cost of repair was estimated to be some million the latest report to which the noble lord referred estimates a cost of million <e> <s> is it not the case that we cannot possibly wait for further deterioration to this magnificent building <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that while for example the abbey has been made to look very lovely and many of the buildings around whitehall which have been cleaned are also looking very fine this building is of particular importance not only in britain but throughout the world <e> <s> he knows that much of the surface of the stone is now crumbling <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl gave a little of the background to the problems the industry had some years ago <e> <s> he recalled my past <e> <s> i was in the middle of all that and the great change in the fortunes of the coal industry since that period have been quite dramatic <e> <s> we lived through a period in which we saw the industrial domestic and export markets for british coal contracting rapidly with the result that a great many pits had to be closed <e> <s> in those days as the noble earl said there grew up a strong belief that the day of coal as a major supplier of the nations fuel was almost over <e>", "<cs> my lords this bill is a declaration that for a long time ahead coal is to be our principal source of energy supply and indeed from the reception that the bill has received in both houses that proposition is i think agreed on both sides of the house <e> <s> however there are a number of grounds where there are doubts in the minds of some of us as to whether parts of it are adequate to that purpose <e> <s> at second reading my principal objection was to the cutting off of operating grants by the end of <e> <s> of course if the necessary progress to profitability has been made a very different situation arises <e> <s> with all the doubts which must obtain i believe it is very wrong to tie ourselves to the date of the end of <e> <s> indeed even if we have none of the geological problems which can happen if we take selby one of the new sources of coal supply it will hardly have managed to achieve its maximum production by the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say that it is because of the governments policy of non-intervention in nationalised industries that they have lost two highly capable chairmen of nationalised industries in the last few months <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that at a time such as this this item must be at the top of any list of priorities <e> <s> are we not now in a situation in which there is a huge unemployment problem involving unskilled people and an unsatisfied demand for very many skilled operatives <e> <s> until we get that balance right we can never return to a period of a decent level of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords in the days which we have been discussing i happened to be chairman of the conference which negotiated associated status for most of the caribbean including st kitts nevis and anguilla <e> <s> there had been a great deal of discussion by officials at the colonial office long before the conference took place and to the best of my recollection there was never one word of dissent from the representative of anguilla to going into the three nation set-up <e> <s> we were utterly amazed when mr bradshaw and mr southwell came back afterwards and said that trouble had begun in anguilla <e> <s> there was no suggestion of it <e> <s> indeed if i recollect correctly the only thing that they were asking for at the time was an airstrip in order to facilitate more tourism and so on <e> <s> therefore i think it necessary to point out that it was no fault whatever of the government or of the departments in britain that this affair arose <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble lord on the presentation of his bill and indeed on the manner in which he has introduced it to the house <e> <s> he left open the question of whether we are the watchdog of the constitution or mr balfours poodle <e> <s> over the years that is a question that has never been answered and indeed the gentleman who suggested the poodle did so before he became a member of the house <e>", "<cs> it is the case is it not <e> <s> that one or two influential voices in the cabinet have already given their opinion as to where we should be going in regard to this matter namely in favour of an elected second chamber <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that there are no ideas in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join those who congratulated the noble lord lord boardman on his maiden speech <e> <s> he is of course an old campaigner <e> <s> he and i have discussed industrial matters in another place on many occasions <e> <s> in those days i had a chip on my shoulder which he probably got sick of hearing about when i used to forecast that one fine day we would have a huge unemployment problem of unskilled people and an equally large shortage of skilled ones <e> <s> the problem is that we have practically got there now <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ritchie-calder said we have over the years so neglected the obvious needs of reorganising and modernising our industries that we now face a kind of chasm which frankly none of us has any idea how to bridge <e>", "<cs> my lords when we are looking at an agreement such as this i think we should try to put ourselves in the position of the people of gibraltar <e> <s> the only point on which i would disagree with the noble lord lord bethell is that he said the restrictions started at a date in <e> <s> they have gone on far longer than that <e> <s> therefore we must now look at how the people of gibraltar look at an agreement which the spanish government are now refusing to implement <e> <s> it is the case and gibraltarians know this as well as i do that the spanish governments ultimate objective is to change the sovereignty of gibraltar and the longer this procrastination goes on the more the anxieties of the gibraltarians will in fact increase <e> <s> it is that determination by the spanish government to effect the change of sovereignty which has been at the heart of their activities ever since <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl find it passing strange that there should have been such huge publicity around these two issues while all the hundreds of people who have been dismissed for joining trade unions have passed without comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that reply which i am sure is as disappointing to him as it is to me <e> <s> would he agree that according to the fourth report of the select committee in the house of commons we are now confining our activities to making sure that loose stones do not fall on peoples heads <e> <s> will he agree that this noble building which millions of people from all over the world come to <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that whereas the first report of the house of commons committee showed an expenditure of some million we have now trebled that and if we wait much longer the cost will be quite prohibitive and the building beyond repair <e>", "<cs> my lords the case has been well made that this impost is going to push large sections of our industry backwards in comparison with their competitors yet every day the government complain about most of british industry being uncompetitive <e> <s> and then they proceed to ensure that it becomes more so by stupid actions of this sort <e> <s> i will not go over it all again <e> <s> my noble friend spoke about the effect on the chemical industry <e> <s> he is right <e> <s> i can give examples of half a dozen other major industries cement glass brickmaking <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> will he agree that in part it contains the answer given to a question for written answer which i was supposed to ask last monday week but which in fact was asked last tuesday week by the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton <e> <s> in that reply it was stated that the state of the victoria tower was pretty dangerous <e> <s> in the course of the reparations that are now to be made and which will take a considerable period of time will the noble earl ensure that attention is paid first to the state of the victoria tower <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have the greatest respect for <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that by far the most sensible propositions yet put on this issue were those contained in the report of the labour party peers which i tried to outline some months ago <e> <s> if a bill such as that proposed was put forward would the government support it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness answer a very vital question <e> <s> would the government care to have a look at what is undoubtedly the finest collection of resolutions and advice contained in a report produced by a committee of labour members <e> <s> if she would like a copy i will be very happy to provide it and perhaps the government could then circulate it as a green paper for national discussion <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord underhill has stressed that the government agree that the gas corporation is a highly successful publicly-owned industry <e> <s> those of your lordships with long memories will recall the days prior to nationalisation when the gas industry was rapidly moving downhill and would probably have ceased to exist at all in a year or two <e> <s> in those days it depended entirely upon the carbonisation of coal a most uneconomic process <e> <s> it had literally hundreds of very small gasworks throughout the country which could not possibly be made a viable proposition <e> <s> when the industry became nationalised it immediately began to modernise and make a whole of what had been its disparate parts <e> <s> i will pay as great a tribute as i can to sir henry jones who was then chairman of the gas corporation and to his colleagues for the fact that they accomplished at least two revolutions within the course of a few years <e>", "<cs> my lords at the request of my noble friend lord jacques may i apologise for his <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that the comments of the committee form a complete indictment of the manner in which the government are disturbing publicly-owned industries and converting them to privatisation <e> <s> could he comment at least on one of their recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the report quoted in the question is now public property and it is quite wrong to segregate as it were the proceedings of this house from those of the other place <e> <s> is he further aware that although i do not wish to quote at length other quotes could be made showing the point i made namely that in fact the privatisation scheme is taking place at enormous cost to the public <e> <s> is he aware that quite a number of eminent conservative members of parliament also signed that report <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord say what trade union ever asked after the war for the restitution of those practices <e>", "<cs> that any single trade union ever asked ernie bevin for the restitution of the pre-war practices <e>", "<cs> my lords they certainly had the right to ask at the end of hostilities <e> <s> did any of them ask for them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that there is a great deal of snobbery-attached to the teaching profession and that many teachers are giving the impression that to go and work with your hands is proof that you are a failure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that for many years a number of large engineering firms trained far and away more apprentices than they themselves needed in the knowledge that they would be necessary <e> <s> has any progress been made in cutting out the time-serving method and making qualification dependent on ability after serving a certain period <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us will be happy about the reply he has been able to give to the noble baroness <e> <s> is he also aware that we are very happy about the huge amount of work that is now being done in the palace <e> <s> would it be possible for us to have photographs and replicas of some sort especially of the clock tower while the scaffolding is still in place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl a pertinent point about the constitution of the second largest union in britain <e> <s> i have never been a full-time official of it so i have no interest to declare but i was a member of its national committee which is the supreme body for making its policies <e> <s> it is composed of rank-and-file members <e> <s> that body and no full-time official makes the policies <e> <s> there is also what we call a final appeal court <e> <s> if the most humble member of the union wishes to take the president or general secretary to the final appeal court he will find that it is composed of rank-and-file members who will listen and give a decision as to whether the president or general secretary is right or wrong <e> <s> therefore is the noble earl aware that democracy in that union and i know of others which are in the same category is quite impeccable <e> <s> all that the government are trying to do is to recreate when they sought revenge for the general strike <e>"]
