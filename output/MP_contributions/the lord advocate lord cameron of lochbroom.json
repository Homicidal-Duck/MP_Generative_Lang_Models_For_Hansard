["<cs> my lords i should first of all like to express my thanks for the most generous words which have been said already by noble lords <e> <s> i particularly take to heart what was said by the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey about speaking in the dinner hour <e> <s> i know that he frequently speaks in the dinner hour and gives a very sparkling performance <e> <s> it is nice to think that it

consistently over the years been regarded as a cornerstone of scots mercantile law <e> <s> but it can surely not have been contemplated in when the scottish law commission first set up a working party under the chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord kilbrandon to examine the subject that years of involved discussion and argument would be required before the position we are in today would be reached <e> <s> for much of that time the scottish law commisssion consulted the legal and accountancy professions in scotland and looked at the bankruptcy laws of a number of countries across the world and were rewarded with the views of eminent persons too numerous for me to mention individually in the short time available to me today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now

chancellor i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i must express my thanks and those of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the welcome which has been extended to this bill by all of those who have spoken <e> <s> its intention which will allow two international conventions to be ratified is obviously most important particularly when the subject is that of children and where the intention is to avoid by international agreement prejudice to the welfare of children who are involved and who have been involved in various ways in what has been described in the house today as kidnapping abduction tug-of-love and the like <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen and his royal highness the prince of wales that they

"<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons reasons for disagreeing to certain of the lords amendments be now considerd <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to add my congratulations to the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside for bringing this bill before your lordships house and thereby affording us an opportunity to debate what is undoubtedly an important and sensitive subject <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord has explained this bill extends to scotland only and it seeks to implement recommendations of the scottish law commission in their report on this subject <e> <s> the law commissions proposals which were carefully considered suggested modernisation of the present scots law on incest contained in the incest act although that act has in fact been restricted in part by the criminal procedure scotland act <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by thanking my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for tabling this motion with the encouragement of the noble lord lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> it has been a great pleasure to hear him also speaking on the motion before the house today <e> <s> it has given us an opportunity to debate a subject which noble lords have clearly indicated is of considerable importance in modern legislation <e> <s> the debate has i suggest been a useful constructive and wide-ranging one <e> <s> indeed our thanks are due to my noble friend lord campbell of alloway for the clarity with which he analysed the issues in his opening speech and allowed the debate to concentrate on the important issues <e>", "<cs> as i explained on second reading this among other matters is not one on which the government would wish to express a view <e> <s> as i stated then the governments position is one of neutrality but there are perhaps one or two matters that have already been mentioned in the speeches of noble lords and of the noble baroness that i should like to emphasise and draw to your lordships attention <e>", "<cs> i understood it was intended that the noble lord lord moran would move only the amendment which relates to clause and that he would deal with clause later <e> <s> i make it clear that in what i say in reply i deal only with the scottish provision although it may contain some general remarks which assist so far as clause is concerned <e> <s> but i make clear at the outset that while the two clauses are intended to produce a similar effect they proceed with regard to different systems of law and different statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to establish the scottish legal aid board and the scottish legal aid fund to make new provision in connection with the availability of criminal legal aid in scotland to repeal and re-enact with modifications certain enactments relating to legal aid and to advice and assistance in scotland and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> i am glad to acknowledge that in this debate we have obviously much in common <e> <s> we are all clear that there is an abuse of local authority power and we are all clear that it ought to be stopped <e> <s> the abuse is quite clearly the use of public money to further or to disparage the purposes and prospects of any political party <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the relevant offence under section of the act consists of the communication by a person who posseses information or a document by virtue of his official position to a person to whom he is not authorised to communicate it <e> <s> if he is so authorised no question of protecting him from prosecution arises he has committed no offence <e> <s> what constitutes authorisation in any particular case depends on the circumstances of that case <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very pleased to have this opportunity to declare the governments support for this bill <e> <s> indeed as my noble friend lord selkirk has already indicated the main purpose of the bill is to remove those legal differences between individuals which depend on whether or not their parents are or have been married to each other without however conferring parental rights automatically on all fathers <e> <s> the basis for this reform is the view which i think is now accepted that it is fundamentally unjust for the law to discriminate against persons on the basis of the absence of the marital status of their parents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords when the amendment similar to this was discussed during our committee proceedings my noble friend lord elton and i agreed without commitment as the noble lord lord underhill reminded us to consider the issues that were raised by publication of material whose purpose was said to be to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination or to promote equality of opportunities and good relations between persons of different racial groups <e> <s> reference was made then to the manner in which the national front and similar groups pursue their political objectives <e> <s> i am sure that in this house we are all at one in total disagreement with those objectives <e> <s> this has been stated in every debate that has taken place on this bill and of course on others <e> <s> equally we must all be at one in abhorrence at many of the ways in which those objectives may be pursued <e> <s> but it is right as noble lords have reminded the house this afternoon that the national front is a lawful body and it can within the law continue to carry out its activities <e> <s> i shall come back to this point in a moment but it is important to bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all those who have spoken from your lordships benches on this bill <e> <s> i should like to add my compliments to both law commissions upon the reports from which the bill has sprung <e> <s> anyone whether he be solicitor advocate or barrister who has had to deal in this realm of law realises the problems that can arise first with regard to the custody of children which is dealt with in part i and secondly with regard to the recognition of divorce and the like in part ii and the necessity as the commissions recognised of trying to clarify and simplify the law in those realms <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> we have received a number of representations suggesting that paragraph which is the object of the amendment in my noble friends name was too narrow <e> <s> on reflection we agree that in order properly to discharge his functions a trustee or a personal representative will have to engage in certain activities within paragraphs and <e> <s> it is to that end that amendment no <e> <s> is directed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments be now considered <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble lord and i have read the submission made by the law society of scotland <e> <s> it seems to me that there may be material which will require further consideration arising out of it in that a courts discretion in the event that a party applies to the court is limited simply to recovery of money or other property paid or transferred under the agreement which is in terms of clause to be held to be unenforceable against the other party <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously imbued with the same spirit of helpfulness which the noble lord lord hacking and other noble lords have shown throughout our deliberations on this bill <e> <s> however in this case i still feel unable to accept the amendment <e> <s> i recognise that some people are concerned that a person who was simply unaware that the bill applied to him would not be able to take advantage of that defence <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor i beg to introduce a bill to amend the law with respect to the reverter of sites that have ceased to be used for particular purposes and for <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both the noble and learned lords who have spoken and in particular for the welcome they have given this modest measure <e> <s> it can however be considered an important one i think when looked at from the international point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> the purpose of this important bill is to improve consumer protection <e> <s> the best protection for consumers lies in a free and fair market <e> <s> such a market offers choice and sufficient information for consumers to decide what for them offers the best value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the three noble lords who have spoken on this matter and for the obvious warmth of the welcome they have given to the bill in general <e> <s> from the matters that they have raised i look forward to an interesting committee stage on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make it clear at the outset that this directive is undoubtedly the source for part i of the bill <e> <s> i remind noble lords that not all parts of the directive are applicable <e> <s> articles and state that <e>", "<cs> i am always with the noble lord in seeking to achieve clarity but as i think he will understand i have explained the reasons why i cannot suggest to the committee that the amendment be accepted <e> <s> it will indeed introduce an ambiguity that the words included in the bill presently are intended to remove <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment <e> <s> while we are both agreed on the abuse that we are attempting to deal with in the subsection the words to which he directs attention in the amendments may prevent the protection extending to the rare circumstances where a misleading price indication is given only to a consumer who does not intend to use the accommodation as his main or only residence <e> <s> that being so i am ready to consider the point <e> <s> i hope in view of that assurance the noble lord will agree to withdraw these amendments <e>",

by mr duncan campbell in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have it in command from her majesty the queen to acquaint the house that her majesty having been informed of the purport of the debtors scotland bill has consented to place her prerogative and interest so far as they are affected by the bill at the

scottish law commission certain enactments relating to housing in scotland <e> <s> i beg to move that the bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can confidently say that all those who spoke have very properly and i would join them in doing so thanked the noble lord lord hacking for providing us with this opportunity to discuss what the debate has shown as being a number of wide-ranging issues of absorbing interest and of genuine concern to all the professions and to the wider community which they serve <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the committee has said and i should like to start by explaining how we envisage the operation of these provisions which of course were the subject of considerable debate in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that

amendments have been tabled would have saved the necessity of the committee stage altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has just said we discussed this at some length in committee <e> <s>

amendments he has opened up what i can describe as a promising avenue <e> <s> it first of all takes away the width of the reference to section of the act <e> <s> also speaking as a scots lawyer it
