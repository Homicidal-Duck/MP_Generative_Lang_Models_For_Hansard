["<cs> my lords i am not capable of competing with the previous speaker although i propose to say a few words later about rhodesia <e> <s> the first half of the noble lords last sentence was the only cheerful and a somewhat balanced picture of the situation that he gave us <e> <s> i know that the thesis he announces is in fact a historic one and one which is treated by scholars with respectabilty but he might have given us a little more encouragement in a little less time <e>", "<cs> my lords in accordance with the precedent set by certain other noble colleagues i should perhaps declare that i have been for five years the unpaid chairman of the governing body of the school of oriental and african studies and that therefore to that extent i have some interest in this subject <e> <s> none the less i have tried to keep my thoughts very short and as impartial as i can when considering the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just interrupt for a moment <e> <s> possibly i did not make it quite clear in my laudable effort to make my speech as short as possible that a lot of the profit in having the japanese here as our students and guests is that we learn a great deal about them and that was very useful during a certain emergency in our history <e>", "<cs> my lords would the foreign secretary agree that one of the most important items on our agenda in the immediate future must be the furnishing of accurate information from our own sources to all who are interested in immediately forthcoming events <e> <s> will he or his department generally who did such a good job on this front in rhodesia be considering urgently whether we need to reinforce the number of people engaged in this matter so that we keep our voice heard right away and consistently on our side <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask your lordships to accept from me one particular apology as you have done already from my noble friend lord <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as an ex-resident of chelsea and as one who knows it rather well would the minister feel able to give us an assurance not simply that the government would look after this question after something had happened but that they would arrange in some way to keep an eye on these people who have a baddish reputation for the kind of things which we fear so that we are not suddenly told that it is too late <e>", "<cs> my lords may i before asking my question suggest that there is an unhappy atmosphere between the french and ourselves however serious it may be standing in the way of negotiations <e> <s> has the noble lord thought in terms of doing the kind of operation which ultimately led in to an <e>", "<cs> my lords may i rather exceptionally invite myself to ask the foreign secretary whether he will accept warmest congratulations on this occasion from one who seems to have spent years in negotiating with the spaniards with less success than the foreign secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the foreign secretary may get very bored hearing me pronounce about public relations but i do it from former experience <e> <s> will the noble lord assure us that he will remain sensitively aware of the reactions to quite small things in public opinion and that what we must do is to avoid any impression at this time that we are in any way thinking of drawing back or hesitating <e> <s> that would have a bad effect on a wide circle of people <e>", "<cs> my lords in the hope that it might be a helpful point may i ask whether we are using in our diplomacy and elsewhere the point that there has been in recent years a welcome revival of the mohammedan religion and that what the ayatollah is doing now is well served to destroy the improvement which has been made which could be most unprofitable and extremely regrettable for iran itself <e>", "<cs> your lordships may be a little surprised that i should intervene in this debate and so i had <e>", "<cs> my lords having spoken at considerable length on this and kindred subjects in the earlier big debate that we had in your lordships house on this question i do not need to do all that again <e> <s> none the less there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts very much for the kind things he said about me but in justice to myself may i just say that i do not want that to be construed by anybody as meaning that i approve of our attending because i hope i made it clear that i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am somewhat shy about asking a question at all on this subject which is not one in which i am expert and in any case i believe that all of us feel very strongly that this is the most important yet also the most dislikeable matter that we have to talk about given the basic issues that are presented to us <e> <s> so i attach an importance to intervening albeit unskilfully though none the less expressing agreement with what the government have decided <e> <s> i do so because i feel that these matters have now reached a stage where if one does not take up what is at least by implication an offensive challenge or an offensive threat then by implication one is beginning to give up the main struggle altogether and none of us would wish to do that <e> <s> my other point <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he also agrees that when mention is made of too many threats of war surely there is a very easy answer to the point namely for the russians to move out of afghanistan <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have been engaged in this matter directly for some time may i express my congratulations to the noble baroness for raising this question and our thanks to her <e> <s> now that this matter has become a humanitarian question and has nothing to do with the older matters of war guilt and other crimes may i ask the minister whether this is now a case of simple persecution <e> <s> if this is so i would ask the minister whether he would agree with my suggestion that he continues to write to the soviet government since this is now a piece of pure human persecution and mans inhumanity to man which has nothing to do with those old things <e> <s> those of us engaged in this matter would like to know from the minister whether he will be good enough to continue to write to and talk to the russians who now have no case left and who can be informed if your lordships will accept my word for it that those of us dealing with this case will go right on doing it and will not be put off by negatives of whatever kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak in this debate because i do not feel any longer qualified on the intricate matters that learned and less learned noble lords talk about <e> <s> i should like to make possibly my shortest speech and express one wish <e> <s> i have attended certainly three of the debates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as at one time a perpetual traveller express my warmest thanks and those of other people to the noble baroness and also to the government for finally acceding to what she has been urging for so long <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it is extremely important that the british public be kept fully informed of the progress of these proceedings as there are occasionally times when the british public is a little unwilling to draw the right conclusions from what happens <e>", "<cs> my lords could the foreign secretary indicate to us whether he is able through these visits also to help our allies to get a certain amount of information or is this question too indiscreet to be answered <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise today with a rather special humility in that i have neither been active in foreign affairs for some little time now nor active in your lordships house <e> <s> therefore i am very conscious of what a little rustiness can easily do to one and i apologise in advance in case i get myself in any way puzzled or even slightly incoherent but i hope that that will not be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from previous questions will the noble lord confirm that it is good policy to point out that it is the reluctance of the soviet union to agree to any kind of verification that holds up this whole matter <e> <s> it is important that the public realise this and realise that it is not due to western countries <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have very little technical knowledge of this great enterprise which we are in a sense developing from debating into celebrating and quite rightly i will be very short indeed <e> <s> but i should like it to be felt that there is some particular exhilaration in being here at this time as a retired member of the diplomatic service <e> <s> all the people engaged in this tremendous profession perhaps owe quite a lot to our service for the collection of fares even if they are payments from one government to another <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is not precisely relevant do the government bear in mind all the time that day after day our friends from poland are a very special case in shall we say <e> <s> world history and that should at least inform us even if it cannot in any special form affect our policies <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that i do not have a present accurate knowledge of the legal requirements of this situation but is this not a position in which countries like ourselves could at least find a way of making it clear both publicly and to the syrians that we are worried about this situation and we look to them to restore at least a peaceful look to the situation so that we are not alarmed by one more crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords in the matter of making our representations to the soviet union which i hope we do in an extremely definite manner may i ask whether we are using the language to the soviet union which would make it extremely clear to them and also i hope to our own public that in behaving in this way they are completely destroying the credibility of anything which they may eventually say in the cause of peace <e> <s> in other words they are destroying their own position of being people who are credible in bringing about peace <e>", "<cs> i speak i hope at minimum length from the position of somebody who has been converted from no seat belts to seat belt and not through running into anybody or being run into <e> <s> if you use an automobile for driving in business or otherwise around the world a certain amount you will find that you run into differences of practice at this time in the worlds history <e> <s> if you do not have an ability to put on a seat belt that is if you do not have one and it is not available then you go suddenly from a country where you do not need to wear one to a country where you do need to wear one and you are in a jam which you did not expect <e> <s> i do not suppose many people are as foolish as that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join my protest to that of my noble colleague lord gladwyn <e>", "<cs> that has made my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask two brief questions on two points that were mentioned by the noble lord the foreign secretary <e> <s> one is on afghanistan <e> <s> i suggest that much pressure may be placed on the noble lord to move along a track which would possibly if not intentionally weaken the strength of the united nations in dealing with this whole question which it will have to do at some time <e> <s> without being patronising will the noble lord be extremely careful about the possibility of giving away united nations points without their being mentioned as such <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former director of the operations to which we are referring in the united states i can assure those noble lords who have spoken kindly of the information organisation that they are absolutely right within the money one can get and given the size of the united states i can confirm that that organisation is very expert and does the best job possible with the money available given the size of the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords since speaking slightly out of order is <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to say on the legal side of this matter at all but i will give your lordships with apologies a piece of history <e> <s> when i first joined <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may be a little surprised to find me standing at this moment because i do not have any known connection with this case but actually i was born in doncaster and i feel that i have a very strong direct local interest in a right judgment finally being made on this particular argument <e> <s> perhaps before saying more on that i may say that i understand how the different interests get extremely worked up about this and i understand why people want to commit what i myself believe to be an outrage on this town <e> <s> having been born very near to that part of the world and having travelled through it and having been in it many times i have a strong personal feeling about it <e>", "<cs> my lords some time ago in your lordships house it used to be a pleasant coincidence that i seemed constantly to be talking immediately after the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> this pleasure i have missed for some time <e> <s> i am so delighted to resume this relationship of succession <e> <s> note the deferential touch my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i might make the shortest speech of the debate which has been full of very important and very encouraging speeches on this extremely critical situation which might become worse before it gets better and that means a very great deal <e> <s> i wish to allude very briefly to two items which seem to me to be working against us and which we need to be aware of even if they are not susceptible of improving by legislation <e> <s> one of them quite frankly is a feeling which hangs like a shroud over many people <e> <s> it is that for some reason or another which they do not quite know they do not like americans <e>", "<cs> my lords in a debate such as this as great an honour as one can consider oneself to receive is that of speaking immediately after the noble baroness lady ryder of warsaw <e> <s> it seems rather dry to say that she is an expert she is far more than that <e> <s> she is an expert of both heart and head and <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that we should not be too much bound by expectations of success or failure in our approaches to the soviet government <e> <s> surely the important thing is to keep on at them which is what they would do with us if matters were the other way around <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one unpopular point which i hope will help the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> it has been crossing my mind that the argentines obviously will have to suffer for the stupid <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords <e> <s> am i out of order <e>", "<cs> i should like to return to the already over-travelled suggestion that if there could be a formulation which included a clearly understood interpretation of the term agreeable to both parties if a wording could be found for that surely it would be the solution <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have served a good deal in the far east in my time in the foreign service i hope that it may be in order for me to say that it will be extremely welcome to the people who still look very much to britain for advice and indeed <e> <s> for money that their part of the world remains very much an areas about which we in this country still wish to care <e> <s> they are glad that either through lack of money or through lack of care we do not neglect those countries which perhaps are of less day-to-day interest than they used to be but which still remain very important to us <e> <s> it is also important for our reputation and our wish to keep in touch with the countries which we have governed and no longer govern that we still care for them and that we still put reasonably generous amounts of money and great skill at their disposal <e> <s> i think that that is all that needs to be said by someone who is less active in this respect but who like so many people who have lived in these countries still cares for them and will do so in the future i am very glad to hear this announcement today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will forgive me if i make a very short speech in fact perhaps the shortest of the debate this evening <e> <s> it is simply this having worked with the school of oriental and african studies and with other similar and allied institutions i regard this occasion for speaking as being a very happy one to take part in very briefly <e>"]
