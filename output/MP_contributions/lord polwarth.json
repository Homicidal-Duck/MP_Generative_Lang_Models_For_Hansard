["<cs> my lords this debate has been opened and will be wound up by the welsh <e> <s> there will be a strong english contribution need i say london contribution towards the conclusion i suspect from the noble lord lord ponsonby so perhaps i may be forgiven one word on behalf of scotland before i move on to the main theme of my speech which is of more general application <e> <s> i am very glad that the noble lord lord parry has put this emphasis on tourism and i should like to emphasise its vital importance to scotland <e> <s> this is not just its importance as a currency earner <e> <s> it is a vital part of our economy <e> <s> i am told that in one way or another it employs some people in scotland <e> <s> it is particularly vital to the highlands and islands where it is the largest single employer <e> <s> that is an area where the other principal occupations are by and large declining in employment agriculture fishing and forestry however healthy they may be in themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we are all delighted to see the noble lord lord davies of leek back in his seat and fully restored <e> <s> i must say that after listening to him i am sure that none of us would have realised that he has been away for three months he is now back here in his usual fighting form and has given us an entertaining speech one which i thought a remarkable example of brevity to some of us on both sides of the house <e> <s> i had prepared a speech and i have now thrown it away because everything that i was going to say has been said so much more effectively in what i think were some outstanding speeches this afternoon <e> <s> i am sure that that would be agreed on both sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister assure us that his comments about the regional imbalance in the matching of jobs and vacancies mean that the government will look at regional employment policies very selectively in a constructive way rather than slashing them too violently <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to noble lords opposite i hope i can assure the noble earl who made the statement that this show of <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a number of oil companies american and other are picking up the tab to a substantial extent in support of other scottish musical organisations notably the scottish national orchestra of which i was until recently the chairman and that it would be unfortunate if there was any suggestion that those funds might be diverted away to another source because these existing organisations are seriously threatened financially as to their existence at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard speakers from places as far apart as caithness and devon and of course the noble marquess to whom we are so grateful for asking this question spoke from the heartland of england <e> <s> the problem is therefore widely spread throughout the country <e> <s> i think his question is most timely following in the wake of your lordships decision last week on the question of school transport <e> <s> his question speaks of village schools <e>", "<cs> my lords are those figures solely for england or england and wales or do they include scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords in pursuing his efforts would the noble lord bear in mind that among the worst offenders in failing to produce cheap air fares are the two state-owned airlines of this country and of canada on the british-canadian run who sharing the run between them have failed to produce virtually any cheap fares in contrast to the united states routes from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord mackie for allowing me to intervene at this point without previous warning <e> <s> i felt that as the minister responsible for piloting the local government act through this house and a pretty traumatic experience it was i can assure you i wanted to say just two or three things <e> <s> i believe with hindsight and in the light of experience that our decision to go for a two-tier system was a fundamental mistake <e> <s> other noble lords have highlighted the reasons <e> <s> i should like to cite one or two the proliferation in numbers of staffs and the unfortunate enmity and bad blood which has resulted in a number of cases between districts of cities and their surrounding regions where different politics are involved <e> <s> this i would suggest to your lordships is perhaps a little warning to us in regard to what might happen were we to have a local legislative assembly in scotland which might well be of a different political party from the government of the united kingdom <e> <s> that is something i think we should ponder <e>", "<cs> my lords in terms of numbers we are now exactly half way through the speakers list <e> <s> i hope for the sake of your lordships that we are slightly further than that in terms of total time <e> <s> i shall certainly do my best to obey the injunction of the noble lord lord peart on the subject of brevity <e> <s> may i apologise in advance to my noble friend who is to wind up and to the noble lord lord ross of marnock that i must leave before the end of the debate because of a long-standing function that i would find it difficult to miss this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords would the government bear in mind in applying their policy that however desirable it may be to maintain a strong british-based company in this industry there are a number of overseas-owned companies with substantial manufacturing operations in this country which give considerable employment notably in a number of the regions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the main causes of this problem as it is also of the length of many of our major debates the fact that the membership and the active membership of your lordships house is continually growing <e>", "<cs> i am no expert on the technicalities of this measure but i am one of the scottish nobility <e> <s> in addition however i have had the privilege of knowing canada and the canadians for years <e> <s> i go there regularly <e> <s> i have been there at least three times during the course of the debates on this measure in canada <e> <s> i should simply like to say that the more i listen to what we are saying this afternoon the more actuely embarrassed i am becoming about what will be the reaction of our canadian friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord donnet of balgay would necessarily expect me to support his views on the bill but i think that we all appreciate his experience in one of the industries affected by it and the service that he has given to it in scotland <e> <s> i think that we should all be grateful to my noble friend lord lauderdale who i am sorry is not here at the moment for his extremely knowledgeable contribution to the debate and for giving us a refreshing dash of realism in a debate which for a good deal of its course has tended to wander in the arid wastes of ideology <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of this debate there has been a wide measure of agreement with the report of the committee which is hardly surprising seeing that out of the previous speakers no fewer than were members of the committee <e> <s> perhaps that is my only possible excuse for detaining your lordships at this time by coming in myself as an outsider perhaps with the excuse and the interest which i declare of being involved in various activities such as pipe laying platform building and the supply of equipment and services to the oil and energy industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i may be considered to have one minute left for my reply <e> <s> all i will do is to thank the noble earl lord avon for the great trouble he has taken with his reply and express the hope that as he said he will convey the views of this house to the government in their consideration of this report while bearing in mind that we are not crying wolf <e> <s> about the straits of the arts and that they cannot expect for ever that organisations will be able to go on turning out their high standards under the pressures to which they are subjected <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend consider advising the members of clubs in st jamess street to exercise a degree of commendable restraint in approaching pedestrian crossings outside their clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that when this motion first appeared on the order paper many of your lordships imagined that such an apparently dry subject could have been opened up in such a down-to-earth and entertaining manner as it has been by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not it is fair to say that we have with us a gamekeeper turned poacher <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord himself said that more or less if not quite <e> <s> but whatever that position may be he gave us the benefit of his very great experience of the practical problems in this thorny subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will not the noble lord agree that rather than carp at the details of the proposed transaction we should warmly welcome the only possible solution to keeping open this famous shipyard and maintaining some employment in shipbuilding on the lower clyde as well as the hope that possibly it will restore the yard to the high state of efficiency which it enjoyed prior to nationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble earls comments about urgency will the government confirm that they have had an approach from the university of aberdeen of which i have the honour to be the chancellor regarding the possibility of merging with other higher educational establishments in that area in the interests of greater efficiency that they asked the government to set up an inquiry into the advantages and the feasibility of such a merger and that the government received this approach over a year ago <e> <s> however they have had no response other than a formal acknowledgment <e> <s> can the noble earl say when the university may expect a proper response <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl confirm that their deliberations will be concluded in time for us to achieve something towards our objective by the time of our five hundredth anniversary in <e>", "<cs> may i simply ask my noble and learned friend the lord advocate to look very seriously at something which in this day and age is a complete anomaly <e>", "<cs> may i briefly declare an interest and say that i own a few hundred acres of marginal and hill land which nature has populated with a few wild pheasants and other species of game none of which enjoys any protection from predators whether animal or human <e> <s> i reckon that each bird that falls to the guns of my friends family and me for the pot contributes about to the local rates <e> <s> while i appreciate the problem of narrowing the base of the rating system perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate whether he can justify the continuance of this basic difference between the practice in scotland and south of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is such a thing in your lordships house as a backwoodsman does the noble lord agree that this is a very suitable subject for their discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords in the preface to <e>", "<cs> my lords flying down from scotland this morning i reflected on the enormous benefit that has accrued from competition to us who are obliged by our residence to commute regularly weekly from the north by this means of travel <e> <s> i thought back to the early days of the first service of british airways and full credit to them for pioneering it with a dc and a -hour flight <e> <s> i then thought of the difference that emerged when british caledonian came on the route albeit out of gatwick and not heathrow with more amenities and with a great service <e> <s> this stirred british airways ultimately into the concept of the shuttle with its hourly flights and two-hourly flights and with no need to book though admittedly with a bare minimum of leg-room and other creature comforts <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i apologise to the noble lord if the information given to me was incorrect <e> <s> however the fact remains that they then made public that they were to restart a lapsed service from manchester which effectively scuppered british midland which depended upon manchester traffic in order to make a prestwick service viable <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear in due course that british airways is to revive a call in scotland in addition to the one at manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords it is rather intimidating to attempt to follow the three previous speakers a former minister with responsibility in this field not to mention an erstwhile aviator himself a former chairman of the civil aviation authority and of course that doughtiest of champions of the travelling public the noble baroness lady burton to whom we are deeply indebted for raising this subject once again <e> <s> i hope that your lordships will not take it amiss if by and large i support practically all that they have said <e> <s> i have no doubt that before the debate is over there will be an opportunity for some contrary views <e>", "<cs> a mere layman hesitates to intervene after the contributions of three such skilled and powerful advocates from scotland <e> <s> my only claim is that many years ago i was obliged in the course of preparing for my examinations as a chartered accountant to try to learn something about the law of bankruptcy <e> <s> singularly little did i learn and even less do i remember <e>", "<cs> my lords since we have exhausted more than three-quarters of the customary dinner hour reserved for this kind of business i have no intention of following the noble lord lord bruce of donington in such a wide-ranging review of the economy which with the greatest respect to him i think he rather wasted on the small handful of us here in the house today <e> <s> i suggest that he might have done better to reserve it for the bright lights of next wednesday although for all i know he may be going to give us an equal performance on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords while i can never claim in my accountancy career to have had to delve into the mysteries of insolvency law it seems to me in all equity that the amendment proposed by my noble friend lord selkirk should be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords since a particular company and an individual have been mentioned may i as a former director of the same company ask her majestys government whether they would not agree that it would be quite unreasonable to expect an individual to lead a great international company based in this country which has performed so outstandingly for considerably less than he would obtain for doing the same in other countries and in particular in the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all deeply grateful to the noble earl lord shannon for introducing this vitally important subject to us and to the right reverend prelate for his splendidly realistic maiden speech in support <e> <s> i suppose he must be the first electronic bishop ever to have graced our benches <e> <s> may he long and frequently continue to electrify us <e>", "<cs> my lords as the director of a clearing bank may i say that it would be improper for me to comment on the detail of this statement at this stage <e> <s> however may i ask the government to accept that i believe the vast majority in the banking industry who conduct their affairs with prudence will welcome any measures designed to maintain and enhance their reputation for sound banking and will wish to cooperate in supporting the measures proposed when we have time to see them in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than carp at the figures given by my noble friend when he repeated the statement may i just assure him that there will be considerable relief among those responsible for running the major scottish national companies the orchestras the opera and the ballet of whom i was once one at the decision to continue the special grant given to recognise the problem following reorganisation of local government and its contributions in scotland <e> <s> i suspect that that owes not a little to the great interest taken by the former minister my noble friend lord gowrie in the arts in scotland and his regular visits there particularly to the last edinburgh festival <e> <s> we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am confirmed in my view that it must be enormous fun to be an economist and particularly one of such outstanding eminence as the noble lord lord harris who has just enlivened the dying stages of a long debate with something which has wakened us all up if nothing else <e> <s> i always admire the immense certainty with which these gentlemen can lay about and demolish their opponents in the total certainty that there is only one view of economics and it is always the right one <e> <s> my economics were abandoned after one year at cambridge and certainly i do not intend to follow the noble lord any further <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that at the inquiry into this matter it appeared that much of the noise to which exception was taken by objectors could not be directly attributed to this service but was due to general aircraft and helicopter movements in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are all extremely grateful to the noble lord lord bruce for having introduced this subject even if i do not follow him into the second part of his motion partly because he did not tell us much about it <e> <s> but i shall let that be <e> <s> i considered the first part of the motion to be unexceptionable <e> <s> co-operation is something that we all want <e> <s> i think we are striving to get it but it can always be made better <e> <s> the merit of this debate is that it has continued that which was started by a somewhat controversial report of the select committee on overseas trade under my noble friend lord aldington of which i had the privilege to be a humble member <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all deeply grateful to the noble lord lord bottomley for giving us a chance to talk about this extremely important subject <e> <s> i think we all equally appreciate the sincerity of the way in which he introduced this subject even if some of us may not go all the way with him in what he has said <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i do not follow the somewhat narrow line to which he <e>", "<cs> i shall go even further than the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and say that from my professional experience admittedly a little rusty now it would be impossible for the national tax system to handle the collection of a tax which related fairly to the inhabitants and companies resident in a particular region of scotland and to local authority expenditure <e> <s> for one thing not all individuals are assessed in scotland although they are resident there <e> <s> some are assessed south of the border and in other parts of the country <e> <s> let us take a company such as the great dawson group <e> <s> it has operations in a number of regions in scotland and some in england <e> <s> how on earth will its tax liability to local authorities be assessed and divided fairly <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i was very much involved in the creation of the bute house trust and the raising of funds to put that property in order <e> <s> my understanding is that the property was made over to the national trust as part of a deal with the treasury involving family estate duties <e> <s> my memory may be faulty but i think that is the position <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies perhaps i may draw the attention of the last two speakers to the <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear what the minister said <e> <s> this amendment may not be the right answer <e> <s> i urge him to take the matter seriously <e> <s> unless the brakes are applied soon by whatever means industry and commerce could find themselves on a runaway train in the rates that they have to pay <e> <s> i am aware of the disincentives that exist for industry and commerce to set up in scotland when faced with the disparity in the rate levels and the rate of rates increase <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take the matter seriously <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether we are not getting rather far away from the subject of this amendment which is to do with terminology <e> <s> i find it difficult to see why so much heat is being generated <e> <s> i began suddenly to see light when the noble lord lord ross talked about a poll tax having been known i think to cause revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my voice and say that i think there is a real problem here <e> <s> i appreciate that by tradition we are inhibited from going into the detailed tax implications of this but the fact remains that where an employer as all good employers will do i am sure offers to reimburse his employee for the community charges and that probably means for his employee and the employees wife he will if he wishes the employee to be no worse off than before have to pay something <e> <s> i think i worked it out as being about to per cent <e> <s> in addition above the charges because of the tax which will fall to be deducted as a taxable benefit from the employee <e> <s> i do not think we can deal with this here but it is a genuine injustice <e> <s> as others have said it is not just the agricultural workers but the ministers of the churches and others who occupy tied accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider asking the stock exchange council to investigate to what extent the collapse of the market has been accentuated by the widespread dependence on electronic communications systems with the consequent reduction in reliance on human judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the remarks and timely reminder of the noble lord lord beaverbrook i suppose that my correct duty would be simply to desist from contributing to the debate so that your lordships would catch up the missing minutes at a stroke <e> <s> i shall not be quite so self-denying but i shall do my best <e> <s> anyway the voice of scotland has been heard from both sides of the house already <e> <s> the noble lord lord goold blew the scottish trumpet loud clear and if i may say so very well <e> <s> i sincerely hope that he will continue to play the same instrument in your lordships orchestra regularly <e> <s> i also support everything that he said <e> <s> i particularly support what he said about the work of the scottish development agency in turning round the scottish economy to its present state <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be wrong but i was under the impression that independent of this report the government are engaged in a review of regional policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly support this bill and i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for his kind words about the role of the scottish council <e> <s> i fully recognise the role of his party in providing so to speak the paternity for the scottish development agency in the person of the noble lord lord ross of marnock who was then secretary of state <e> <s> we should acknowledge how sorry we are that he is not fit enough to be with us on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose i should really declare an interest in that my forebear the first lord polwarth was lord chancellor of scotland during the later days of the scottish parliament which then existed <e> <s> i do not think that i see any proposals from the other side to resuscitate that ancient office <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak for no particular interest and without the vast experience of some noble lords who have spoken this evening <e> <s> i speak with experience as at various stages an auditor a non-executive director of various public companies a non-executive chairman of two companies and a member of the audit committee of a major american corporation <e> <s> indeed i have been the chairman of that committee for two years <e>"]
