["<cs> my lords when i attend a funeral it is with real sadness in my heart at parting either from <e>", "<cs> my lords i hestiate to intervene but is not the fast breeder reactor the reactor that we have been working at dounreay and caithness for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i intrude with diffidence into this debate but i do so because my noble friend who opened it asked those of us who have practical experience to say what they have found <e> <s> i travel from glasgow to heathrow practically every week during the time that this house is in session and i arrive between pm on most days and later on two hours later <e> <s> let me explain that i carry my luggage myself otherwise the situation would be hopeless <e> <s> i get down off the plane and i go to the point where the bus arrives <e> <s> there i find a pavement about half the width of a pavement of an ordinary street in the city of london <e> <s> it is piled with trolleys and baggage of the people who are already waiting to get a bus <e> <s> i have to wade through that mob and generally have to get off the pavement and walk in the roadway in imminent danger of being mown down by a bus arrival <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene surely the handling of the passengers is even more important than the handling of the baggage <e> <s> i am complaining as other noble lords have done about the complete mishandling of passengers which makes them all very angry <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend has just said i entirely agree with him <e> <s> as one who was a member of the armed forces for a great number of years i sympathise with the position that the wives of people serving in the forces are in under certain circumstances which this will help them to avoid <e>", "<cs> i rise merely because i think that the noble lord who has just spoken forgets things that he does not wish to remember <e> <s> he forgets the rent restriction act <e> <s> he forgets owners rates <e> <s> what was one of the principal causes why we needed to build more houses <e> <s> i also ask who was it who went ahead and built the houses <e> <s> who was it who set a target for housing <e> <s> it was not the government of which the noble lord has been a member it was the conservative party which set the target <e> <s> the target of houses was fixed by two members of your lordships house today myself and my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls <e> <s> we were told that the target was impossible <e> <s> the labour partys target was houses <e>", "<cs> have noble lords opposite taken into account what was the original cost of the house to the local authority who will probably make a considerable profit even allowing for a reduction of per cent <e> <s> again what has it cost them to maintain that house <e> <s> many of these original houses have been kept up-to-date by the local authority at considerable expense not to the local authority but to the poor unfortunate ratepayer of whom i am one and the noble lord opposite is another <e> <s> one must take account of those two figures before saying <e>", "<cs> perhaps in addition to the care and trouble that was taken in another place to get this matter right the noble earl will before the report stage consider the question as put before us today by noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me from the amendments which the noble lord has moved that he is making it more difficult for those who occupy public sector houses to obtain possession of those houses <e> <s> that seems to me to be quite contrary to the generous nature of the noble lord as i have known it over many years <e> <s> has he himself ever had to wait for a period of five years before he could get the ownership of a house <e> <s> i have done so and i can tell him that five years is an awful long time to wait <e> <s> i wonder whether he would reconsider the amendments which he has moved recently in your lordships house before he goes further as regards this matter <e> <s> this seems to me to be quite contrary to his nature <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand that the noble viscounts remarks apply to companies that have been literally robbed of their assets such as yarrow <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question <e> <s> the noble lords first amendment reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has misunderstood me <e> <s> let me read what it says <e>", "<cs> having had something to do with housing in scotland in other years i should like to speak briefly on this amendment <e> <s> the bill as it stands amends the tenants rights scotland act and as we read what it intends to do it gives the secretary of <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has mentioned me perhaps i may say to him that i am distressed to listen to his argument which seems to me to prove conclusively that you cannot trust the local authorities in scotland to do the right thing by the citizens they look after <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all noble lords who are interested in forestry to any degree at all will be most grateful to the noble earl for the statement that he has made <e> <s> may i ask one small simple question which may be of interest to forestry owners <e> <s> will the noble earl define more clearly what he meant when he talked of small round timber <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend care to give the house his opinion of the mental stability of those who make declarations such as are contained in this question <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to make a speech at the moment but as a chartered accountant to express my entire approval with what has been said by most noble lords who have spoken on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords were the figures stated in reply to the question a measure of the impact of inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord also tell us how many houses are in the programmes of local authorities <e> <s> i can remember that at one time a conservative government had houses of them in scotland <e> <s> could the noble lord find out whether they are building anything like that number today <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord tell us whether what he has been saying is in line with the advice given by the various institutes of chartered accountants throughout great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise very much with the noble lord in what he has said in particular his reference to the enormous increase in rates all over scotland <e> <s> i have looked up what i have been required to pay year by year and i find that in i paid using rough figures <e> <s> for it was <e> <s> for it was <e> <s> for it is <e> <s> things are getting into a ridiculous state and i strongly support what the noble lord has said about a -year period being quite enough <e> <s> i shall listen with great interest to what the noble earl the minister has to say in reply <e>", "<cs> i have a fairly large family of both boys and girls who have attended various schools in scotland and in england and i have never at all had any difficulty in obtaining from the schools all the information of the kind that the noble lord opposite proposes should be made a requirement in the bill <e> <s> i hope that such a requirement is not included in the bill and that we are allowed to collect the information which is readily given to us when we ask for it <e>", "<cs> that is quite incorrect and the noble lords knows it <e> <s> he and i served together for many years in another place and he knows very well that i got all the information that was required and that i asked for in connection with the ordinary schools in the country of which i am very proud so far as scotland is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the minister for the trouble he has taken in going over the bill with us <e> <s> we are equally keen to congratulate my honourable friend <e> <s> he does not like me to call him that but we worked amicably together for a number of years <e> <s> he was my friend during that time and remains so although he is certainly on the opposite side of the fence to me <e> <s> i shall not worry your <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the first occasion upon which i have had the privilege of addressing your lordships house i crave your indulgence and would like to thank noble lords who have wished me success earlier in this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords at this stage of the evening i shall keep my remarks as brief as possible <e> <s> in the same way that i have been waiting to speak most people in scotland have been waiting a long time for this bill <e> <s> at least they will see the light at the end of the tunnel which will free them from the built-in iniquities of the existing domestic rating system <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord lord williams for what he has said <e> <s> the point is that even though a subsidiary or related company may find itself in the position of being owned per cent <e> <s> by an authorised institution it should have nothing to fear so long as there have been no transactions worth investigating by the authorised person <e> <s> therefore these amendments will not prove to be as onerous as he may suggest <e>", "<cs> although i can sympathise with the basic thrust of the amendment i feel that such a matter would be better dealt with under the inspection of the register provisions in clause <e> <s> to that effect i have tabled amendment no <e> <s> which i think deals with that point in a slightly wider way than specifically womens aid refuges <e>", "<cs> my lords before i begin i apologise to the noble lord lord brabazon of tara for not being here when he was speaking <e> <s> unfortunately all the efforts of london transport could not quite get me here on time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion that a humble address be presented to her majesty for her most gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords her majesty and her family are also a source of constant admiration and since i am closer in age to the younger members of the royal family i should like in particular to refer to their qualities of leadership and good nature which have impressed young people throughout the country <e> <s> the princess royal the duke and duchess of york and prince edward all recently took part in a successful its a knock-out television programme <e> <s> at a stroke this showed their continued commitment to the future of our nation and by example they have encouraged others to take up the selfless pursuit to make the united kingdom a better place for us all <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot see that there is any case for devolved government in scotland <e> <s> nothing that i have heard today from proponents of devolution has caused me to change my mind <e> <s> indeed i am convinced even more than years ago that devolution is based on frantic sentimentalism and electoral expediency which will do nothing whatever to help scottish people their economy or welfare <e> <s> a decade ago there was a feeling in some quarters that devolution had become respectable because of the rise of the snp <e> <s> it was thought that the snp had become mature and responsible <e> <s> but where are they now <e> <s> i do not hear this great call for devolution from scottish people <e>", "<cs> one of the points about federalism is that it must require equal partners within its different constituent parts <e> <s> i do not think you would get that by splitting up england scotland wales and northern ireland because england would always be the major partner unless england were split up <e> <s> i do not think there is any call for splitting england up <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two confessions to make today <e> <s> first i have never spoken in a social security debate before and secondly i am not sure that i know a great deal about social security itself <e> <s> however i have chosen to talk today because this is a very important sector of government policies and it is a major cost to the taxpayer <e> <s> it is relevant to all of us and not least to those people who receive benefit today <e> <s> my contribution will be small because i am here to listen to what is said and i have very much enjoyed doing so <e>", "<cs> i too was not present at the second reading and i am very sorry for that <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord understood that what i really meant was that new private tenants were created by people buying their council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a little intimidating to speak at the end of such a long debate and after so many eloquent and experienced speakers <e> <s> noble lords will be pleased to hear that i shall not take a long time because there is little new to say and i shall limit myself to talking about the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the third member of your lordships house who has to rise today and humbly apologise to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for not being in my place when he rose to speak <e> <s> being the third member i cannot really offer any excuses but i shall make a particular point of reading what i know were his very fine words in <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point very clearly that the noble lord lord williams of elvel has made <e> <s> i did not intend to castigate the noble lord lord bruce of donington for not being present i simply wanted to talk about some of the things that he mentioned <e> <s> however i can do that at another time with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the term i used was household <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure and an honour that on the first occasion that i speak from the dispatch box it should be to respond to a debate on a report from one of your lordships select committees <e> <s> i know that select committees are often overworked and rarely praised <e> <s> it is therefore a particular joy to be able to say what an interesting and detailed report this is and to thank all noble lords who played a part in its formulation especially its chairman the noble lord lord kearton <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the secretary of state will take his decision on the question of the reference of the proposed acquisition by minorco of consolidated gold fields plc in the light of advice submitted by the director general of fair trading <e> <s> if he decides that this proposed acquisition raises issues of public interest sufficient to warrant a reference to the monopolies and mergers commission it will fall to the commission under the fair trading act to report on whether the proposed acquisition may be expected to operate against the public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his kind and encouraging words <e> <s> as for his supplementary question of course a large number of representations have been received covering a wide range of subjects including that of strategic minerals <e>

trading and also for the takeover panel to take those decisions on how the regulatory process is carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of consgold having lost any business as a result of having a per cent <e> <s> south african interest <e> <s> however i think it is worth pointing out to the house that under the local government act all contracts by local authorities in this country must be let on purely commercial grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government are aware of the deadline tomorrow <e> <s> your lordships will note that we still have hours to go <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the monopolies and mergers commission recommended that the government of kuwait should be required to reduce their shareholding in bp over a period of some months <e> <s> however in order to promote an orderly disposal of the shareholding the report also recommended that this period should be subject to some flexibility in the light of market conditions <e> <s> my noble friend the secretary of state accordingly asked the director general of fair trading to consult the kuwait investment office on this basis with a view to obtaining undertakings to reduce the shareholding in bp to not more than per cent <e> <s> and to advise him further on the appropriate timescale for divestment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to answer all those points <e> <s> i thank my noble friend

sound recordings <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may go on giving a full explanation <e> <s> it can of course be argued that it is up to the programme-maker when he signs up the performer for the initial recording to ensure that he acquires all the consents that he needs for possible later exploitation

independent body and not by the person wanting to make the further recording <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not have made myself clear the first time round <e> <s> the jurisdiction of the tribunal is not affected by where the performer may be found <e> <s> the question is whether the performer when approached refuses reasonably or unreasonably <e> <s> what is reasonable will be the same wherever the

be its responsibility have all come up against severe problems <e> <s> this has led to the delay that i have mentioned <e> <s> the campaign was to be divided into three parts the building of a giant house involving an imaginative display of safety hazards the production of a logo and the establishment of a computer database system <e> <s> none of these has gone ahead because of various legal technicalities and disagreements with other member states <e> <s> specifically as i mentioned in a previous answer the government are not letting that delay their campaign for child safety which as the noble baroness knows is extremely important <e> <s> the government are very much aware of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords nine out of firms in this country are aware of the significance of the

the cbis initiative which provides clear evidence that british business is ready to seize the new opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords although i said that nine out of firms in the country were aware of the campaign so far only one firm in three has taken steps actively to prepare for the single market <e> <s> this shows that a great deal of work needs to be done which will be done by the government

already knows many british manufacturers will continue to wish to draw attention to the fact that their goods are made in britain and they remain free to do so <e> <s> what is now clear is that member states may not take national measures to compel traders to origin-mark their goods unless <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point but that is exactly the issue <e> <s> they are not obliged to do so if it is not particularly advantageous <e> <s> is is totally a commercial decision for manufacturers as to whether they want to label their goods made in england made in great britain or whatever it may be <e> <s> it would be discriminatory to insist that all goods sold in britain were labelled and i think it would be unfair if we insisted that all british manufacturers should label their goods made in britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for welcoming the draft orders <e> <s> they are complicated but they are necessary for our industries

should ask for yellow wine <e> <s> i am advised that they are special wines bottled in the jura region of france which no doubt he would now like to visit <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord monson asked some pertinent questions <e> <s> as for his references to the imperial quantities on some products it is probable that most imperial sizes will he discontinued in the future <e> <s> however as he has probably read in the press we are seeking permanently to retain the pint for both draught beer and milk in returnable containers <e> <s> however it is not illegal for manufacturers voluntarily to add the equivalent declaration <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no need to make it illegal <e> <s> it is perfectly all right for manufacturers to do so as they always have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the consumer should know exactly what he is buying <e> <s> under these measures he will know precisely <e> <s> as i have already mentioned the situation will be exactly the same across europe <e> <s> metrication of carafes of fluid ounces and fluid ounces is retained so that imperial measures can continue to be used <e> <s> however we expect that they will be phased out when metrication is completed in favour of standard metric sizes <e> <s> by that time the consumer will be totally aware of the situation <e> <s> therefore i believe that consumers rights will be protected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that the noble lord now asks for a particular measure of fluid ounces <e> <s> he asks for a glass or half a bottle of white wine <e> <s> he will still be able to do so and will receive a standard measure for the standard price <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord caithness i beg to move that this debate be now adjourned until

obviously we do not expect a downturn to occur immediately <e> <s> it will take time <e> <s> however there is evidence to show that house prices have been slowing down considerably which is a sign that other forms of spending will change dramatically in the future as well <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord graham of edmonton may well be correct when he refers to further education on the subject <e> <s> i am not sure how he suggests that that should be done <e> <s> however his suggestions on how this kind of communication can be improved would be gratefully received by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords citizens advice centres are only one weapon to use <e> <s> i shall be coming on to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i was making a general point that the retail prices index includes the mortgage rate <e> <s> but i also take the point of my noble friend <e> <s> interest rates are an effective weapon against inflation and in an advanced and mature market economy such as that of the united kingdom we believe that they are the only weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether my noble friend lord brocket was listening a few moments ago <e> <s> i said that controls on lending do not work because they are wrong in principle and ineffective in practice <e> <s> we need to deregulate and to remove these artificial barriers <e> <s> consumers who are increasingly sophisticated will quite easily find their way around any artificial controls and barriers that we put up <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know why my noble friend lord rippon states that these rates are necessarily criminal <e> <s> i regard a high inflation rate as being genuinely criminal <e> <s> we are trying to reduce the steadily but slowly rising rate of inflation by using the interest rate <e> <s> we feel that in the long term high interest rates will be far less damaging than the resurgence of high inflation that we saw in preceding decades <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have many principles <e> <s> as regards the deregulation of financial controls since the government came into power they have always felt that the best way forward was to bring down as many of those artificial barriers as possible that had existed for many years before <e> <s> that is what they have done and that is why they are committed to a policy of using interest rates as the main weapon against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster on british shipbuilders <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the words of the two noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i have to say at the start that the government take no pleasure in making this announcement about north-east shipbuilders limited <e> <s> it is a great sadness after years that the yards have to close but i shall seek to justify that in the next few moments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rightfully sounds annoyed at what has been going on in sunderland <e> <s> the government officials in the department of trade and industry and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am genuinely grateful for the intervention of my noble friend <e> <s> he is absolutely correct in saying that everybody who has been concerned with the issue of the north-east has worked extremely hard to get a satisfactory result from the closure of this yard <e> <s> the member of parliament for sunderland north mr bob clay has tried particularly hard to see what could be done <e> <s> ultimately we feel that there comes a point when it is no longer credible to go on trying <e> <s> we owe it to the people of sunderland to end the uncertainty that has plagued their lives for far too long and now to offer the town a new future <e> <s> the town is not short of committed business people willing to do their utmost and to make it work <e> <s> i have been assured of the role that they are prepared to play <e> <s> the opportunities will be there if people wish to take them and we shall be doing our utmost to make sure that the money and infrastructure are available to help to create those new jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that he is shocked and disgusted by the way in which the government have behaved <e> <s> i have to remind him that billion of taxpayers money has gone in support of british shipbuilders since <e>", "<cs> my lords british farming is an entirely different issue <e> <s> the noble lord is quite entitled to have a separate debate on that subject <e> <s> today we are discussing north-east shipbuilding and british shipbuilders as a whole <e> <s> enormous funds have been poured into them over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords we have explored every single avenue available to us <e> <s> we have considered approaches and extended the deadline twice but none can offer a secure future for nesl <e> <s> that is the reality of the situation <e> <s> furthermore as to the figures mentioned by the noble lord concerning unemployment they exaggerate the dependence of outside jobs on the yard <e> <s> they take a wholly unjustified view of the prospects for new employment in the town <e> <s> they greatly exaggerate what is needed to revitalise the economy of sunderland <e> <s> i need not go on <e>", "<cs> we should see for example the recently announced major investments by gold star the south korean electronics company <e> <s> it is hoped to create up to jobs for an million capital investment in the region <e> <s> that is the direction to go in and i sincerely hope that it will be successful <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to that point i have to say that i have never heard of ships being built in a hurry in any case <e> <s> it always takes a long time <e> <s> i cannot believe that the situation would arise in the future whereby we had to do exactly that and build them in a hurry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not appear to have that information at hand at the moment <e> <s> i am not sure which figures the noble lord wants <e> <s> if he wants to know how the government calculated that it would be cheaper to close the yards than to keep them open the answer is that the disposal to any of the new parties would have cost british shipbuilders more than closing the yards <e> <s> the advice that the chancellor has received is that none of the bids offers a commercially viable basis on which to negotiate a future for nesl <e> <s> the question of quantities should be taken into account but does not necessarily arise <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord wants hard figures <e>", "<cs> my lords cost comparisons are irrelevant in themselves until one has a bid that might offer a viable future for the yards <e> <s> we know the criteria we have used to define viability <e>", "<cs> my lords if i misunderstood the noble lord lord peston am sorry <e> <s> i do not have the figures at hand <e> <s> however the package announced today is designed for the longest term <e> <s> we have felt for a while now that the shipbuilding yards will not be viable forever <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on the noble lords suggestion to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster <e> <s> however i must point out to him that as regards the link between shipping and shipbuilding nesl has built very few if any ships for uk owners in recent years <e> <s> therefore it appears that there is currently no great link between the two in the north-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i do not wish to detain the house for much longer <e> <s> however i should like to point out to the noble lord lord peston that we are talking only about a levy <e> <s> only per cent <e> <s> of the income of the bcira comes from the levy and it will continue to be financed by the department of trade and industry in the shape of a grant <e> <s> there is no reason why that should not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i do not appear to have satisfied the noble baroness but the form of words which i have is that they have continued to thrive <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> i understand that there is not a long-term futures market for oil but i may be wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been an interesting debate <e> <s> i especially enjoyed the speech of my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> in his

implications of changing from dollars to ecus <e> <s> i shall of course convey the thanks of noble lords to my noble friend lord brabazon of tara for the information he has provided over the past few days <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure why we are the last european country to enact this piece of legislation <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that somebody has to be last and that in this particular case it was ourselves <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting and useful debate as well as being very far ranging <e> <s> we have covered a good deal of ground on a whole spectrum of subjects <e> <s> as my noble friend outlined at the beginning of the debate the bill represents a set of carefully prepared and detailed proposals and it is not a radical overhaul of the companies act or of other legislation <e> <s> it is nonetheless a sizeable bill and introduces some significant reforms <e>", "<cs> it is easy to criticise but he must make up his mind whether he wants more subjects or fewer subjects in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston repeated the comment about the lancashire hotpot <e> <s> in this case i feel that he wants to make more of an irish stew where no one quite knows what goes in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> he will not have had an opportunity to see them <e> <s> we intend to publish professor diamonds full report in time for it to be available before discussion of part iv of the bill in committee <e> <s> i hope that that will put his mind at rest at least for the time being <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says and i hope to be able to deal with the matter later on <e>", "<cs> my lords many matters are taken into account in the definition of public interest <e> <s> however perhaps i may continue with my speech <e> <s> obviously takeovers and mergers are important subjects and i may be able to answer the noble lord later on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord preempts me <e> <s> i was about to come to that point <e> <s> the united kingdom governments position on the draft community merger control regulation is well known <e> <s> we have reserved our position while continuing to participate constructively in discussions <e> <s> it is draft community legislation and so is separate from the bill which deals solely with national controls <e> <s> your lordships will have the opportunity to consider its implications on the united kingdom in the usual way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that there is now no deadline on the directives as a number <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about mergers and takeovers and not a long-term decline in certain industries due to technological changes <e> <s> the government never like to see people made redundant or lose their jobs <e> <s> but when in the past years unemployment has risen from million to about million and is now coming back down to under million i feel that the point i made about the loss of jobs in the short term is relevant <e> <s> it is a sad but necessary fact of commercial life <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am making a point of principle to the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> perhaps i may just finish what i <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> perhaps i may get to that point in the next few minutes when i shall make my position clear <e> <s> the noble lords reference to section of the act is something of a red herring in this matter since principles so expressed would be guidance not rules under the act and section does not relate to guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords we try to get all directives to all noble lords who are interested as soon as possible <e> <s> i think that article in particular is being sought but i understand that this has not been published and is therefore not available <e> <s> as soon as it and other directives are available they will be passed on to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for speaking for a few moments on this subject <e> <s> he is quite right in extolling the virtues of the mmc which has been with us for a number of years <e> <s> the noble lord said that it was not an easy job and i totally agree with him <e> <s> the commission has done well for a number of years and with a number of governments <e>", "<cs> my lords under the provisions of the films act the government support the film industry through payments to british screen finance limited <e> <s> annual sums of million for feature film production and for script development and short film production are available for the five-year period beginning st january <e> <s> the government maintain the view that current economic conditions offer a sound framework for the british film industry to operate successfully on a commercial basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend and other noble lords will be pleased to know that there has been a substantial upturn during recent years in the fortunes of the cinema business <e> <s> after a consistent decline for a number of years to a low of million cinema admissions in the figure rose steadily to million in and looks set to register a further rise <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a re-think in <e> <s> the film industry is doing extremely well <e> <s> there have been a number of recent critical successes the mission wish you were here who framed roger rabbit <e> <s> and many others made either with british money or with british expertise which is renowned throughout the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that that is a question for local authorities <e> <s> i shall however take note of it and ask my noble friend the secretary of state to look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord any figures on ownership of the film industry in britain by foreigners or british nationals <e> <s> on the question of tax incentives i do not believe that it is for the government to make this country particularly attractive to films <e> <s> that must be based on commercial necessities decided by film makers themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the film industrys exports remain at a high level and reached million in per cent <e> <s> up on the previous year <e> <s> likewise exports of television programmes have shown a welcome overall increase in recent years they amounted to million in <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it must be up to the consumer to decide what he wants to watch on his television screen <e> <s> therefore if people want to watch second-rate films that is up to them <e> <s> the british film industry makes some extremely good films <e>", "<cs> which are supported in a minor way <e> <s> other countries have problems because they wish to support their own languages <e> <s> we do not need to do that because english is world-renowned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not able to do so at the present time <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of today i believe that any film which is made in britain for export is in the english language and that any imported from america is american <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different question <e> <s> there are organisations which oversee what is shown on television as regards obscenity and so forth for example the british board of film classification local authorities and ultimately the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord has brought that to our attention <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord young of graffham i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams in his opening words said that we were starting a long committee stage and he is correct <e> <s> however i hope that at the end of our deliberations we will have a better bill from the governments point of view <e> <s> unfortunately we do not seem to have started particularly well with amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the government do not believe that it is appropriate for companies legislation to prescribe such obligations for the internal management of companies <e> <s> perhaps i may explain why company law sets out to ensure that companies deal properly with their shareholders assets and that they are accountable to shareholders <e> <s> it does not set out to make them efficient <e> <s> that is the function of markets <e> <s> in the interests of accountability the law requires companies to keep adequate accounting records and auditors to check that proper accounting records are kept before making their report <e> <s> that is quite right and proper <e> <s> in practice auditors frequently report to companies about their systems of internal control before making their report <e> <s> that too is all to the good <e> <s> but to make the maintenance of a satisfactory system of internal control a statutory requirement in the governments view crosses over the line dividing propriety from efficiency <e>", "<cs> i am still not sure that it is appropriate to apply the regime of banks and building societies to companies overall <e> <s> i can understand why the noble lord believes that it makes sense that all companies should have a satisfactory system of internal control <e> <s> i think it is pointless to impose such a requirement without having an accepted view of what is and what is not a satisfactory system of control or at least an accepted means of testing a system <e> <s> in practice the testing would become the responsibility of the auditors themselves <e>", "<cs> i still have to say what i said in my opening remarks that company law sets out to ensure that companies deal properly with their assets <e> <s> but it does not set out to make them efficient <e> <s> therefore the internal running of the management systems must be up to companies themselves <e> <s> there <e>", "<cs> i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> the noble lord will be <e>", "<cs> new section the subject of the amendment reproduces the existing offences in the act <e> <s> it makes it an offence to fail to keep proper accounting records <e> <s> the offence is committed by any officer in default meaning an officer who knowingly and wilfully authorises or permits the default <e> <s> it is however a defence under section of the act for the officer to prove that the default was committed honestly and was excusable in the circumstances in which the companys business was carried on <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord williams for saying that <e> <s> perhaps this is an occasion where we could consider the points that have been made in committee and look at them at greater leisure than is possible today <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for thanking me for the letters i wrote to him last week <e> <s> it is nice to know that they arrived and that they did some good <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will feel that we do not need to raise the matter again at report stage <e> <s> the government do not feel that it is worth raising the subject again until we know what is happening at the european level <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot offer the noble lord any information at the moment as to the date of the debate <e> <s> i sincerely hope that it will take place before too long <e>", "<cs> the explanation given by the noble lord lord bruce of donington is very interesting <e> <s> we do not consider that whether or not the bill at this point refers to the state of affairs or the state of the affairs is of consequence <e> <s> moreover although the amendment brings the provision in new section in line with that in new section a it puts it out of alignment with the reference in new section <e> <s> i hope that this explanation is sufficient <e>", "<cs> it has been an interesting and far-ranging debate on the subject <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend and others who have raised it <e>", "<cs> making it statutory simply adds another regulation which we are keen not to do <e> <s> we feel that the revised standard of accountancy will improve the situation and that therefore there is no need to make that statutory <e> <s> however as i take it that noble lords feel very strongly about this matter perhaps i could take it away and come back at report stage then we could discuss it further <e>", "<cs> no i cannot give that assurance <e>", "<cs> to pre-empt the noble lord the amendments are not as i am sure he will realise technically correct <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord does not feel the need to press them at this stage <e> <s> we will look at what he has said and discuss it when we get to report stage <e> <s> accounting standards have a role to play <e> <s> if one brought all disclosure requirements into statute one would have a very unwieldly statute book <e> <s> the noble lord lord peston said that there were many special cases that one would wish to bring in and that this was a special special case <e> <s> however i believe that the accounting standards that we have provided for deal with this matter very effectively <e> <s> but that does not pre-empt what i have already said <e> <s> we shall take this away and look at it extremely closely in the next few weeks <e>", "<cs> before i reply to that point the proposed amendment would apply to all companies <e> <s> i believe that this goes too far <e> <s> the case for disclosure by small companies is not made out the case for disclosure by public companies is considerably stronger <e> <s> this needs to be considered further <e>", "<cs> we shall consider what the noble viscount has said including the idea of bringing in a power for the secretary of state <e> <s> however i cannot confirm that the government will put forward an amendment at the next stage <e>", "<cs> there already is a power to amend disclosure requirements assuming that clause is passed <e> <s> i hope that that makes a difference <e> <s> i can certainly give an undertaking that we shall consider using that power if the standard proves ineffective <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord suggests is moderate and yes we are happy to do that <e> <s> what i felt was being proposed earlier was that we should take this amendment away and simply bring it back at report stage <e> <s> i cannot confirm that <e> <s> we shall look at it very closely and discuss it with the relevant officials and all parties who are involved <e> <s> we shall make a point of looking at it very thoroughly indeed <e> <s> i hope that that goes far enough <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> as i said earlier there is a power to amend the disclosure requirements by a statutory instrument assuming that clause to which we shall come in the next few days is passed <e> <s> i can give an undertaking that we shall consider using that power if the standard that we are going to introduce proves ineffective <e> <s> perhaps that is what he wished to understand some time ago <e>", "<cs> i entirely appreciate the desire of the noble lord lord peston to give accounting standards greater force by making compliance with them a statutory requirement <e> <s> there has been growing concern in recent years about the effectiveness of accounting standards in dealing with new and not always welcome developments in accounting practices <e> <s> the concern has focused on <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord has just said is all very well but the form of words that i used earlier was that the government welcome the dearing report <e> <s> i do not believe that i need to add <e>", "<cs> yes we shall consult <e> <s> the dearing committee recommends that although accounting standards should not be incorporated into the law there should be a statutory requirement on companies to disclose whether or not their accounts comply with accounting standards and to explain any departures <e> <s> the government are sympathetic to this recommendation although they do not wish to take a final view of it until the consultation procedures that i have already mentioned have been completed <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to listen to the noble lord lord willliams <e> <s> we do not consider that the amendments make a change of substance to the bill <e> <s> they are not strictly necessary <e> <s> this is another case where people feel more comfortable with something close to the wording of the existing act and look for a change of substance wherever words have been used slightly differently <e> <s> that said these particular amendments are not objectionable and the government can accept them <e>", "<cs> on capitalisation is one of the permitted ways in which a company can reduce a <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for raising the issue <e> <s> of course it is important to give proper effect to the directive in our domestic law <e> <s> that is our community obligation <e> <s> however our obligation under the treaty of rome is not to repeat the directive word for word <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for raising the point <e> <s> i have not had an opportunity to welcome him to the committee and i do so now <e> <s> i hope that he will be with us for a while <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could refer the noble lord to the answer which i have just given to my noble friend lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i hope that my noble friend lord morris is not confusing the word effect with the word effect as in the bill <e>", "<cs> this deals with the effect of the departure in these cases whether or not it is the financial effect <e> <s> we find it difficult to see any need for the clarification <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that there is any more to say <e>", "<cs> there is no great point of principle here <e> <s> this is a matter of judgment as to the precise circumstances in which minority shareholders should be able to require consolidated accounts to be prepared notwithstanding the exemptions from that requirement provided for in new section for certain intermediate holding companies that is for parent companies which are themselves a subsidiary of someone else <e> <s> the seventh directive from which this protection for minority shareholders derives would allow either what the bill provides at present or the scheme envisaged by this amendment <e> <s> in our judgment there is no real reason to make a distinction between private and public companies in this context although i acknowledge that the directive refers to the possibility of such a distinction <e>", "<cs> i am advised that other countries do not make a distinction <e>", "<cs> since there is no point of principle involved for the government and the noble lord feels strongly about this perhaps i can take back this amendment and consider it further <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> this is a probing amendment and i shall write to the noble lord in the next few days <e>", "<cs> by all means <e>", "<cs> the formulation in the bill simply follows the directive <e> <s> this refers to securities admitted to official listing on a stock exchange in a member state <e> <s> i understand that that term does not include companies whose shares are traded on the unlisted securities market <e> <s> in any event i cannot see that the amendment proposed by the noble lord would have a significant effect <e> <s> there cannot be many companies listed on the unlisted securities market which are themselves subsidiaries of someone else <e> <s> therefore i cannot really see the point of the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> everything which the noble lord says is very interesting <e> <s> however in this instance we believe that we may be bound by the directive <e> <s> it may be possible to introduce a more stringent regime <e> <s> therefore i suggest that we discuss this with companies first before going any further <e>", "<cs> there are two points here <e> <s> first we believe that we may be bound by the directive and its terms <e> <s> secondly we should like to discuss the matter with the companies involved before going further <e> <s> to that extent yes we should like to have an opportunity to discuss the matter further on report <e>", "<cs> for the benefit of the noble lord lord bruce of donington i shall endeavour to bring a little original thought to this amendment <e> <s> these words are redundant because new section b to which subsection refers makes no reference to voting rights <e> <s> i hope that explains the situation <e>", "<cs> i am not sure where the noble lord finds that reference <e>", "<cs> article b of the directive is not relevant in this context as we have decided to implement article <e> <s> the question therefore does not arise <e>", "<cs> that is what i am advised <e> <s> on question amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> i am sympathetic to the thinking behind this amendment and i recognise that it may be sensible to make a change here <e> <s> we are certainly willing to consider the point carefully and report back <e>", "<cs> i find myself again grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> we recognise that there is an important point here and we see considerable attractions in the noble lords amendments taken as a package <e> <s> i cannot accept them today but i agree to consider them most carefully and to report back <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> but in these provisions the phrase companys accounts is used <e> <s> this is not a defined term in the bill <e> <s> therefore it is not entirely clear what is being referred to <e> <s> by contrast companys annual accounts is defined in the new section and <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that that necessarily makes any difference <e> <s> from time to time a company may well change its annual year <e> <s> whether its annual reports are for nine or months they are still called annual accounts <e>", "<cs> i gather that is the situation under existing legislation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a valid point <e> <s> it has been pointed out to us that strictly speaking one does not value assets by historical cost accounting rules <e> <s> they are recognised at cost <e> <s> paragraph of schedule to the bill implements article of the seventh directive which refers to valuation and valuation method <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> we are dealing here with a very specialised interpretation of words <e> <s> perhaps it will help if i write to the noble lord to let him know exactly what it is that we mean <e>", "<cs> i object to that <e> <s> it is nothing to do with whether the government do or do not know what is written in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce is trying to put another interpretation on the meaning <e> <s> i have explained what the government think the provision means but the noble lord simply does not agree <e> <s> on that basis i am willing to write to him to explain it <e> <s> it has nothing to do with my briefing my knowledge how much my officials know or whether the government know what this bill means <e> <s> of course they do <e>", "<cs> i made the point that we shall write to the noble lord lord bruce and copy letters will be sent to all members of the committee who participated in this debate <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may offer some background information on the amendment <e> <s> the rules set out in the schedule reflect detailed consultation with outside bodies in particular on the issues raised by the two methods of accounting for business combinations <e> <s> acquisition accounting and merger accounting are the source of much debate within the accounting profession <e> <s> in the light of this the department consulted particularly carefully on the legislative changes which might be made in the context of implementing the directive rules in article acquisition accounting and article merger accounting <e> <s> the department put forward deliberately wide-ranging options for discussion at the end of december <e> <s> at about the same time the accounting standards committee announced that it would embark on a review of the relevant accounting standards <e>", "<cs> we are always delighted to offer explanations on our own amendments to the bill <e> <s> the noble lord asked a question earlier about fair values <e>", "<cs> in the light of what the noble lord has said i think that the best action to take at this stage would be to withdraw the amendment so that we may look at it again <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier we are always delighted to discuss the governments amendments <e> <s> i shall attempt once more to explain exactly what the government mean <e> <s> i take first amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is designed to remove an ambiguity about the term without any adjustment which appears at line <e> <s> the amendment makes it clear that income and expenditure should be included for that part of the financial year before the acquisition <e>", "<cs> on a different year entry the financial year of the parent is the important financial year not that of the subsidiary <e> <s> that is the point of the amendment <e> <s> as regards amendment no <e> <s> that is also to remove an ambiguity about the term at all material times <e> <s> the amendment makes it clear that group accounts must show corresponding amounts on the assumption that the undertakings had been merged throughout the previous year <e>", "<cs> i know that it sounds confusing and looks awkward and as though it is more complicated than it needs to be but the amendment covers adjustments on lines generally accepted in accounting practice <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord williams said is fair enough but this practice is carried on at present <e> <s> the need for proper disclosure does not seem to be an intolerable burden <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord does not know the answer to those two questions <e> <s> i shall endeavour to get them for him as quickly as possible <e> <s> the effect of the amendment is to clarify the fact that companies in this context need only disclose that information about each class of assets and liabilities <e> <s> when he asks what each class is i am not sure what he is trying to say <e> <s> presumably he seeks to know what each class is <e> <s> i can now tell him that class is to be defined by professional guidance <e> <s> guidance will also cover netting-off <e> <s> i hope that that will please him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord again asks two pertinent points <e> <s> as i said before class is to be defined by professional guidance <e> <s> there is a draft standard by the profession already in existence <e> <s> we shall be seeing it at any moment now <e>", "<cs> very soon <e>", "<cs> yes the statute can be carried out in the light of what i have just said <e> <s> as for the noble lords other problem on netting-or the bill as amended could not net-off between classes <e> <s> the other things left have to be defined specifically and therefore do not play a part <e>", "<cs> i understand that the problem is that the noble lord lord williams did not understand what we meant before we amended the provisions and that now he does <e> <s> the government are in the same situation <e> <s> that is precisely why we amended the provision <e>", "<cs> i must say again that bills are often published and that we have to make minor technical amendments here and there to clarify what we meant and occasionally to change one or two things <e> <s> it is the opposition who are trying considerably to change the bill <e> <s> the government are trying to make it easy for everybody to understand <e> <s> that is what they have just done in these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am always delighted to discuss such issues with the noble lord <e> <s> at the beginning of the debate i was going to say that the amendment was a minor technical one but that never seems to be the case <e> <s> what we have done here is to make it clear that disclosure is only required where a subsidiary is disposed of in respect of those subsidiaries which significantly affect the figures in the group accounts <e> <s> it also requires the name of the subsidiary to be stated <e> <s> the noble lord is well aware of that <e>", "<cs> i am delighted that the noble lord is quite happy with amendment no <e> <s> and i presume with amendment no <e> <s> as well <e> <s> i am sorry that he is not quite so happy with amendment no <e> <s> but i understand that his suggestion would create difficulties which appear to be unforeseen <e> <s> therefore we cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take advantage of what the noble lord has said and withdraw these amendments in order to look at them at a later stage <e>", "<cs> absolutely this is genuinely a drafting error <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i shall make sure that he is informed as regards what the guidance is <e> <s> on question amendment agreed to <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said the amendments appear to restrict joint ventures to non-corporate bodies such as partnerships <e> <s> we have some sympathy with this <e> <s> we wish however to look again at the whole definition of a joint venture in this context in the light of comments we have received <e>", "<cs> we would be delighted to receive my noble friends amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendments are intended to align the definition of associated undertaking in the bill more closely with the definition in accounting standards <e> <s> i understand that wish <e> <s> however the wording in the bill reflects article of the seventh directive <e> <s> we are constrained by the wording of the directive the main principle of which is to achieve a greater harmonisation of accounting treatment within the european community <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will see that there is not a great deal we can do <e> <s> in the light of that i ask him to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my legal advisers do feel strongly about that <e>", "<cs> the amendment would change the burden of proof in determining whether one undertaking is an associate of another where per cent <e> <s> of voting rights are not held by that other undertaking <e> <s> i understand that as the noble lord outlined there is a similar presumption in the relevant statement of standard accounting practice <e> <s> the presumption may have been included in the standard because the definition of an associate in that context is wider than that used in the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer is that we have followed the scheme in the directive and stuck to it <e> <s> the presumption contained in the noble lords amendment is not included in the directive and therefore the same is true of the ssap <e>", "<cs> we do not say that ssap is either stronger or weaker than what is proposed in the bill <e> <s> it is slightly wider <e> <s> we have sought to follow the directive and that is exactly what we have done <e> <s> we have not gone beyond the directive <e> <s> we are happy with the position <e>", "<cs> i shall write to the noble lord on that point in any case <e> <s> i think that i ought to say that the directive is primarily a harmonisation directive and we cannot depart from the substantive intention of the directive <e> <s> therefore the argument about whether we can go further than the directive seems irrelevant <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble lord to make clear exactly what we mean <e>", "<cs> to paraphrase what the noble lord said he asks whether we are willing to accept amendments which go beyond what the directive states <e>", "<cs> the answer to that question is that where the directive makes a requirement we cannot go beyond it <e> <s> however the noble lord is of course entitled to put down as many amendments as he wants <e>", "<cs> i hope that that is a point which i can clarify for the noble lord very soon <e> <s> i shall let him know the answer in the very near future <e>", "<cs> that is precisely what i meant by the very near future <e> <s> i shall let the committee know the answer this evening <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord would like a further explanation for the purposes of paragraph of schedule associated undertakings and of new section subsidiary undertakings we are trying to explain exactly what is meant by leaving voting rights out of account <e> <s> that is precisely what the amendments seek to do <e>", "<cs> in the light of what members of the committee have said perhaps i should indeed take this away and get further explanations or possibly even rewrite it for a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain a little further <e> <s> the present provisions which the amendments replace are ambiguous where it has to be determined whether one undertaking is an associate or subsidiary of another during a period <e> <s> it is not clear whether the rights have to be exercisable at some point only during that period or must be exercisable throughout it before the relationship is recognised for that period <e> <s> the amendments adopt a slightly different approach in that under them the relationship will only be recognised for that part of the period during which the voting rights are exercisable <e> <s> an example of a case covered is voting rights on preference shares where a dividend has passed <e>", "<cs> where it has been passed <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that that question really arises <e>", "<cs> all we are trying to do is clarify beyond doubt <e> <s> perhaps we have taken it too far <e> <s> it is only a drafting amendment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept it <e>", "<cs> i too should like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> with this amendment <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord for these most helpful suggestions <e> <s> without repeating everything that he has said i accept amendment no <e> <s> and would like to think further about the wording of amendment no <e> <s> and bring forward our own amendment to the same effect at a later stage as well as to the equivalent provision in new section clause if that is acceptable to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lords doubts are indeed well founded <e> <s> the amendment would require companies using the equity method of accounting to follow the relevant accounting standard <e> <s> while this is a laudable aim in itself for the reasons that i gave in speaking to an earlier amendment we agree with sir ronald dearings conclusions that it is not appropriate to give statutory effect to statements of standard accounting practice <e> <s> we are therefore unable to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said briefly earlier what the noble lord suggests is a laudable aim but we do not agree in principle to giving statutory effect to ssaps notwithstanding what it says in the dearing report <e> <s> without specific reference to accounting standards equity accounting it would be interpreted in line with generally accepted accounting practice but not standards binding in themselves <e> <s> we are happy to consider a specific reference to generally accepted accounting practice but not to making it statutory <e> <s> i hope that that helps to clarify matters <e>", "<cs> we shall take account of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> that is an important area <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel that he can withdraw his amendment now <e>", "<cs> no i gather that they were incorrectly drafted when the bill was first published <e> <s> there is nothing unforeseen or untoward in them <e>", "<cs> it is true that the noble lord lord bruce has done rather well today <e> <s> i am not sure whether his winning run will continue in this series of amendments <e> <s> they would require companies to give the address or in some cases the registered number of the various classes of related companies on which disclosure is required by schedule to the bill <e> <s> i recognise that the intention is to give additional information to the users of accounts <e> <s> but let us pause for a moment and consider whether the value of such additional information warrants the extra burden and costs which may in some instances be considerable <e> <s> the present requirement is to give the country of incorporation which this bill re-enacts <e> <s> in the vast majority of cases this enables the reader if he so wishes to obtain the information about the company which is on the public register in the country of incorporation <e> <s> in cases where access to the <e>", "<cs> all afternoon i have been berated for giving answers to some of the noble lords amendments which are too complicated <e> <s> in this case when i come out with a fair simple and honest answer he suggests that i should make it more complex <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington has been extremely frank so i shall be earnest with him <e> <s> he said many things in the past few minutes about this matter as has the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran but neither has brought a single piece of evidence or proof to show that this has been a problem in the past <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to see that the amendment does much more than the similar but more general provision in new section in clause <e> <s> that provision allows a reporting company not to disclose the names of certain related undertakings which are established or carry on business outside the united kingdom where the directors conclude that to do so will be seriously prejudicial to the companys interests <e> <s> there is therefore a considerable overlap between this amendment and a quite separate provision already in the bill <e>", "<cs> there seems to be a lot of agreement as regards these amendments <e> <s> this group of amendments has a common theme namely blocking two loopholes for unscrupulous boards who seek to evade disclosing to shareholders certain payments made to directors upon joining the board <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my purpose was to move amendment no <e> <s> and then seek to amend it later on <e> <s> however having given my word to the noble lord that i shall look at his amendment no <e> <s> i withdraw amendment no <e> <s> and undertake to look at the position again at report stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i too should first comment on amendments nos <e> <s> to which concern the signature of company accounts <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting the case for retaining the requirements of the existing act as indeed did other noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> there is no great point of principle here on the part of the government <e> <s> but nevertheless i am not at all persuaded by the arguments that they have brought to bear that the existing requirement for signature by two directors or one where there is only one director has a vital role in making the directors of a company take more seriously their responsibilities in connection with the preparation of accounts <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the views of the noble lords lord williams and lord benson <e> <s> it is sad that this point of minor deregulation which is what it is on the signing of accounts should raise such deep concern with them <e> <s> i have listened to their remarks <e> <s> i do not believe that it is worth pressing this point <e> <s> i shall read what has been said and consult the various people who need to be consulted and we can perhaps look at this matter again on report <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord williams we were slightly puzzled by the amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of the thinking behind it <e> <s> we had not previously seen its purpose <e> <s> if my noble friend wishes i am willing to undertake to consider the point more carefully <e>", "<cs> this amendment picks up one of the recommendations of the dearing committee though it goes further than dearing in suggesting that the financial effect of departures from accounting standards should be quantified <e> <s> dearing proposes that in the case of all large companies the director should be required to state in the notes at the <e>", "<cs> no the noble lord cannot take that <e> <s> we shall bring amendments at a later stage but that later stage will be as soon as possible after we have consulted <e> <s> there is no point in bringing amendments before we have done that <e>", "<cs> either way the amendments will have to come to this house at some stage <e> <s> i really cannot say whether or not we shall have amendments brought to the house before or after they have been dealt with in another place <e>", "<cs> the accountancy profession will not come back until april <e> <s> we might just get the amendments in time for third reading but if not we shall have to deal with them even if the noble lord lord williams disapproves of them as lords amendments to commons amendments when we receive them towards the end of the year <e>", "<cs> we shall bring amendments when we have gone through the consultation process <e> <s> we shall bring them as quickly as possible <e> <s> i do not know why the noble lord is making such a fuss about this because generally speaking the amendments we are likely to bring forward will be of the kind that he wants to see for instance the amendment with which we have just been dealing <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord williams has explained the amendment seeks to reinstate the wording used in the act <e> <s> in drafting the bill the opportunity has been taken to restructure certain provisions <e> <s> as a consequence the wording of new section refers more simply to the annual accounts and a true and fair view both terms being defined at the end of part i of the bill <e> <s> while the wording is different we see the change as having no effect on the present coverage of the auditors report <e> <s> we do not believe that the amendment is necessary and i hope that the noble lord will not press the point <e>", "<cs> again this has been a wide debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord benson has come in with some powerful arguments <e> <s> the government have consistently tried with various pieces of legislation to renew to progress to look forward and therefore to restructure certain provisions <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> i listened to the noble lord with interest <e> <s> we are not aware that the new section which repeats section of the existing act has given rise to any problems <e> <s> nor are we persuaded that the detailed changes would alter in any significant way auditors existing rights to information and explanations <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to reverse the present position whereby it is no defence for directors charged with a failure to lay accounts before the general meeting to claim that they are not liable as the accounts did not exist or were defective <e> <s> this would he quite unmeritorious because it would give them a defence in such circumstances <e> <s> for that reason i must resist this particular amendment and would ask the noble lords to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for explaining the intention behind these amendments <e> <s> the government accept that the statutory audit requirement imposes costs on small companies and during the last few years we have looked carefully at possible ways of reducing these costs <e> <s> we have concluded however that the involvement of an independent qualified accountant is necessary to safeguard the integrity of accounts and as a protection against fraud <e> <s> and after careful consideration we have decided that the statutory audit requirement is overall the best way of securing that involvement <e>", "<cs> this clause re-enacts with very minor amendments sections and of the companies act dealing with dormant companies <e> <s> companies are defined as dormant if during the accounting period no significant accounting transactions take place <e> <s> the dormant company may exempt itself from the obligations to appoint auditors by passing a special resolution and filing it with the registrar of companies <e>", "<cs> it is not necessary for companies to be de-authorised they can simply be dormant <e> <s> i do not understand the noble lords objection to that <e>", "<cs> i hope that i have not misled the noble lord lord williams in what i said <e> <s> the point is that if a company is already authorised then it cannot declare itself dormant <e> <s> therefore i do not believe the question arises <e> <s> that is what the bill states <e>", "<cs> the question as to whether a financial company which declared itself dormant would lose its authorisation simply does not arise because if a company is already authorised it cannot declare itself dormant <e> <s> i hope that that explains the slight confusion <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes an interesting point <e> <s> however i stick to banks and insurance companies <e> <s> they are already covered by statute on dormant companies <e> <s> we are merely treating financial services companies in exactly the same way <e> <s> de-authorisation as we all know is for the relevant bodies under the financial services act <e>", "<cs> i shall get to that if the noble lord will wait for a moment <e> <s> one of the opposition amendments which i shall name soon would rule out the option <e>", "<cs> i have already said which <e> <s> i will not let the noble lord interrupt me again until i have finished because i have to get through this <e> <s> the opposition amendment would rule out the option <e>", "<cs> yes that is what i thought i said <e> <s> i am sorry amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in a nutshell the government amendments reflect our preference to leave open options for detailed implementation of this new proposal until we have had the opportunity for full consultation with those concerned <e> <s> i commend them to the committee <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> excellent <e>", "<cs> i must protest <e> <s> i was interrupted by the noble lord on numerous occasions <e> <s> i am listening carefully to what he is saying and i shall be delighted to continue doing so until he has finished <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord lord williams provides a serious argument against what we are trying to do <e> <s> the government say that if shareholders do not wish to receive their report and accounts they should not have to <e> <s> the noble lord seeks what he calls a positive election not to receive them <e> <s> but if we are already leaving so much to be decided by regulation after consultation with the people who will ultimately he carrying this out i think that we are creating a strait-jacket for companies <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what i can add to the debate <e> <s> i am at a little bit of a loss as to what else the noble lord wants <e> <s> i have offered him the possibility of what he said <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the noble lord has fully justified the reasons for accepting the amendment <e> <s> i do not see why he does not withdraw it and look at what has been said <e> <s> indeed he mentioned earlier that i made a substantial opening speech which i did <e> <s> if he reads carefully what i said and speaks to some of his advisers he may see that there is a lot in it which is commendable and which points to the approach which we are taking on this most important question <e> <s> i hope that he will now see that it is worth withdrawing the amendment and he can bring it back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington is confusing two different principles <e> <s> the basic principle about which i am talking is whether we should legislate for shareholders to receive summarised reports and accounts <e> <s> the principle about which the noble lord lord bruce is talking is whether shareholders either do not wish to receive or clearly elect not to receive summarised reports and accounts <e> <s> the principle should be decided after a considerable amount of discussion and consultation with the relevant people <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not seek to press the amendment any further <e> <s> i have already spoken to a certain amount of it <e>", "<cs> there was no rudeness implied at all <e>", "<cs> it was not meant to be rude at all <e> <s> as i have just said the noble lord simply looked slightly tired after the exertions of today and i was offering him some comfort that is all <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for saying that he was putting down a marker on this to bring it back on report <e> <s> i shall reply to him as briefly as possible <e> <s> these reserves are now maintained in the uk by a relatively small number of merchant banks and discount houses <e> <s> in effect they allow disclosed profit in any year to be increased or reduced at the option of the directors <e> <s> as a result hidden reserves limit the usefulness of the profit figure in the accounts as an indicator of performance <e> <s> the government have been giving thought to this in the context of the european communitys bank accounts directive <e> <s> we are required to enact this directive in our law by the end of next year <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply very briefly to those remarks <e> <s> i think that the noble lord will find when he reads hansard tomorrow that the amount of time taken up by government amendments has been very small by comparison with the amount of time that we have spent listening to the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the governments view is that as under the existing act any regulations which impose more onerous duties on companies should be subject to positive resolution procedure <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce believes that any government who give themselves powers to change primary legislation by statutory instrument must be treated with the maximum of suspicion <e> <s> i wonder whether any government could escape his disapproval on that basis <e>", "<cs> the noble lord shakes his head in agreement <e>", "<cs> many members of the committee have asked detailed questions on this clause <e> <s> perhaps i may first turn to the remarks of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> he asked whether this more onerous provision would work within this meaning <e> <s> more onerous governs parliamentary procedure not ability to use the regulations <e> <s> therefore the words more onerous add to the requirements <e> <s> for instance documents can be changed in accounts and reports <e>", "<cs> i must return to what i said in my opening words the principal point of the clause is to deal with a highly technical piece of company legislation <e> <s> it can be used for some of the points which the noble lord lord williams raised <e> <s> indeed i do not think that i need add to that <e>", "<cs> that is what we are doing now <e> <s> we are discussing what is going into the primary legislation <e> <s> as i said that is to enable us to adjust technical points <e> <s> we set out our present intentions in the bill but we reserve the right to change technical points after a great deal of consultation with the industry and after taking into account the comments which were made in committee yesterday and which will be made today and what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i cannot see why the noble lord continues to object to the point <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the concern of the noble lord lord williams of elvel and my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter who spoke clearly on the subject <e> <s> i am therefore more than happy to give the undertaking that such draft orders will be circulated so that we can have noble lords informed comment before we put them to this place subject of course to parliamentary proprieties <e> <s> in principle i must confirm my undertaking that noble lords will be included in all consultations <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bruce of donington prefaced his remarks by saying that he sought harmony between us <e> <s> i always hope that that is the case between himself and myself <e> <s> with the permission of the committee i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he was probing here so perhaps i may explain further what is meant by a control contract in this context <e> <s> it is a contract giving a right to direct the operating and financial policies of another undertaking in the special sense of new section a which is both authorised by that undertakings constitution and is permitted by the law under which that undertaking is established <e>", "<cs> new section contains a test for a parent/subsidiary relationship that is new to our law <e> <s> what we are getting at here is the practical control of one company over another <e> <s> an undertaking is to be regarded as the parent undertaking of another if it has what is termed a participating interest in the other and if it actually exercises a dominant influence over it or if it and the other are managed on a unified basis <e> <s> what is meant by a participating interest is set out in new section inserted by clause <e> <s> a participating interest essentially arises where one undertaking exercises a significant influence over another as a result of an interest in the share capital of that other it is presumed to exist where per cent <e> <s> of the shares in that other are held <e>", "<cs> we are returning to amendments which have already been dealt with <e> <s> the definition of the phrase the dominant influence to which my noble friend referred was introduced by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i hope that gave an adequate reply a few minutes ago <e> <s> my noble friend gave an example of woolworth which has no participating interest <e> <s> therefore it does not need to be consolidated under this clause <e>", "<cs> we do not dissent from the general drift of the formulation used by the noble lord <e> <s> however as i explained in the context of the phrase the dominant influence in respect of the earlier amendment we do not consider it necessary or appropriate to define the phrases managed on a unified basis or dominant influence in this context <e>", "<cs> we shall certainly look into that point <e>", "<cs> my lords ford has predicted that over the next five years jobs at dagenham will be lost by natural wastage as a result of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> however i must point out that the dagenham plant will now be making the new fiesta range of cars which ford believes will be extremely successful and will become a best seller <e> <s> generally speaking i must point out that ford has to decide how to run the company and it must not be for the government to tell it how to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no information on that point but i am sure that my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in reply to an earlier question it must be for ford to decide where to build its cars <e> <s> it has been building cars in the european community for many years and it has often switched model production from one area to another <e> <s> perhaps i may also point out that ford is about to invest million in a new engine plant at bridgend in south wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i meant that i was sure that my noble friend thought that he was quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely correct <e> <s> moreover we seek to continue to manage the british economy in a way so as to encourage more investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have details regarding only the dagenham plant <e> <s> there as i said jobs will be lost by natural wastage over the next five years <e> <s> at bridgend a total of jobs will be created and preserved when that factory is working at full steam <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if the dagenham plant is successful in producing fiestas at the best possible price then we should be able to look forward to an increased production at that plant rather than at valencia <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the noble baroness is right <e> <s> we are attracting an enormous amount of investment from overseas purely because of and the opening up of the single european market <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the amendment appears to be unnecessary <e> <s> by virtue of the interpretation act unless the contrary intention appears the word oath when used in legislation includes affirmation and declaration <e> <s> therefore i hope it was not an oversight on the part of the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps he will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that i can put at rest the noble lords mind on the amendment <e> <s> where investigations are carried out by any officials the main costs of the investigation are the staff costs <e> <s> it would be odd therefore for outside investigators fees to be recoverable but not the costs of official salaries <e> <s> it is desirable that the question as to whether those costs are expenses and so recoverable should not be in any doubt <e> <s> such doubt could arise were the noble lords proposals to be accepted <e> <s> i therefore ask him to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i have not explained the point <e> <s> it is that expenses tend to carry the sense of being disbursements <e> <s> lawyers are not economists and that may explain the difference <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with the purpose of the noble lords amendments <e> <s> as he has said the definition of book debts provided by the amendment was proposed by professor diamond in part ii of his <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord mishcon for being brief <e> <s> both amendments nos <e> <s> z and z make clear that a chargee is the person who is entitled to exercise the security rights conferred by a charge <e> <s> the terms of a charge generally confer rights on all parties to the charge including the chargor and any guarantor and it is necessary to ensure that they are excluded from the definition <e>", "<cs> i understand the intention behind the amendment and that the law society is keen on it <e> <s> but the term further proceedings is taken from existing legislation and has served perfectly well to date <e> <s> there is of course no reason why the committee should not take the opportunity to amend any wording that has survived from the act but i think it best not to change familiar terms unless they have actually been shown to be inadequate <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot give examples in relation to foreign law <e> <s> as for examples from the domestic context which may offer some sort of analogy there are legal proceedings for the cancellation of a prior land charge on the land charges register for the rectification of the land charges registrys register or specific performance of an agreement to grant a charge <e> <s> apart from that i have to confirm that the wording has not been tested <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can say without wishing to confuse the committee that to the government it is clear that the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> there is no reason to interpret proceedings as necessarily only legal proceedings especially in this context where it is obvious that an administrative formality such as registration in another register is envisaged <e> <s> moreover the term procedure is possibly ambiguous <e> <s> it can be taken to mean only a necessary formality <e> <s> the existing term is probably wider in its scope than is procedure which implies a wholly routine administrative process <e> <s> the term <e>", "<cs> generally speaking we are satisfied that we have covered that argument and perhaps i may suggest that the noble lord reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams has put over his case very clearly and i would not wish to claim that there is no argument in favour of requiring the registration of charges created by companies over shares in their subsidiaries <e> <s> but i do <e>", "<cs> the government are in sympathy with the intention behind the noble lords amendment <e> <s> we agree with professor diamonds recommendation that negative pledge clauses should be registered and we intend to implement that recommendation <e> <s> it is not however necessary to do this by way of an amendment to part iv <e> <s> neither does the amendment quite achieve its aim as i shall explain later if the noble lord wishes which he does <e> <s> in scotland under section of the act negative pledge clauses contained in the instruments of floating charges are already registrable <e> <s> they will continue to be so under section as amended by clause of the bill and they will be ineffective if the charge containing them is not registered within days of its creation <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what we are proposing <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lords advisers have misunderstood the effect of paragraph d <e> <s> a negotiable instrument is a piece of paper that either recites an undertaking to pay a sum of money or contains an order to a third party to pay a sum of money and which may be transferred by delivery and endorsement to a <e>", "<cs> we have had a nice debate on the amendmentsi apologise because i shall speak for rather longer than i have done on other amendments as this is an important area and there is a principle to get across <e> <s> before i discuss the amendments i should say that the proposal to discontinue conclusive certificates has been widely supported by the commercial world in response to our consultations in <e> <s> representatives of for example banks and finance houses are in favour of the changes that we are making <e> <s> they are the people who will ultimately benefit from the changes <e>", "<cs> it may help if i first explain what new section does and does not do <e> <s> the common law doctrine of constructive notice attributes notice to such persons as could reasonably be expected to make all inquiries that a reasonable and honest man would make <e> <s> what the new subsection abolishes is any supposed doctrine that the mere registration of a charge in itself automatically has the effect of attributing notice to everyone whether or not as a question of fact the particular individual could reasonably be expected to have searched the register <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord does not read too much into the word entirely which is obviously ambiguous <e>", "<cs> it will be under part v to be commenced on tuesday st february <e>", "<cs> the amendments will be tabled before next week <e>", "<cs> we have followed professor diamonds advice and have not allowed for provisional registration in the absence of a system of priorities <e> <s> the reason for this is quite simply that provisional registration would not solve the major problem of the present system <e> <s> a charge that had been created but did not yet appear on the register would still take priority over a provisionally registered charge just as it takes priority over a subsequently created charge <e> <s> provisional registration would not help the second chargee any more than the creation of his charge does at present <e> <s> he comes second either way <e> <s> provisional registration would protect a prospective chargee during the period between his search and the date on which the charge is created <e> <s> he would not run the risk that someone else might get in before him and take a charge over the same property during that period <e> <s> but this problem is best dealt with by chargees ensuring that they leave as little time as possible between their search and the creation of the charge <e> <s> to attempt to deal with this by a system of provisional registration would only add to the existing doubt about the register itself <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could clarify to the noble lord lord williams what we are going to do <e> <s> we are extending the rules to include the kinds of unregistered companies which the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could write to the noble lord on that point in the next couple of days and let him know whether we are doing it under the current bill or whether there will be another order <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran wishes to say something <e>", "<cs> it is certainly desirable to avoid any doubt as to whether new section and part iv in general apply to charges to secure a non-monetary obligation <e> <s> therefore i am happy to accept the noble lords amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can clarify this further <e> <s> addition of further property to that already subject to a fixed charge always gives rise to the creation of a new charge <e> <s> the inclusion of additions in new section implies that it may not <e> <s> it implies that the addition of property may be achieved simply by variation <e> <s> we wish to avoid that implication <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that this amendment is necessary or desirable <e> <s> it is unnecessary because if the company or chargee fails to sign after a reasonable number of reminders any court would take the view that it was being recalcitrant and was refusing to sign <e> <s> the amendment is undesirable because it is much better left to the court to decide what is or is not a refusal <e> <s> the amendment would allow an application to be made to the court at the shortest delay on the part of the person whose signature was being sought <e>", "<cs> perhaps i have not explained fully to the noble lord what is suggested by our wording <e> <s> we believe that our wording already allows an application to the court if a person fails to sign <e> <s> however i am prepared to look at what the noble lord said and if we feel that he has a point we shall consider whether an amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify what we are trying to do <e> <s> the requirement for the signatures of both the company and the chargee provides a safeguard for both of them <e> <s> without the requirement the company might deliver particulars that understated the extent of the charge or a memorandum that claimed incorrectly that a charge had been discharged <e> <s> in those circumstances the charge would be void in respect of the inaccuracy <e> <s> it is necessary therefore for the chargee to approve any further particulars or memorandum <e> <s> similarly if the chargee delivers further particulars that result in an overstatement of the extent of the charge the company will suffer because the register may exaggerate its indebtedness putting off other potential creditors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can answer the questions put by both noble lords by saying this <e> <s> the exception would also preclude avoidance where particulars become inaccurate because of a change in the identity of the chargee <e> <s> it would be a considerable burden if all those in whom the security rights of the charge were newly vested had to deliver further particulars <e> <s> particulars would have to be delivered for example every time there was an assignment of a charge <e> <s> since the identity of the chargee is not a crucial piece of information which third parties would rely on for their own assurance or to secure their own position it is unnecessary to impose such a burden <e>", "<cs> there is obviously no desire on the part of the government to be cavalier in their attitude and i take note of the strong feelings of both noble lords <e> <s> the amendment addresses a concern expressed by many outside bodies which is why it has been brought forward in this form <e> <s> the whole charge might become void because of a relatively minor mistake <e> <s> the main purpose of the register is to know whether the property itself is encumbered <e>", "<cs> there is obviously considerable strength of feeling from members opposite <e> <s> therefore i shall be happy to look at what has been said without giving any undertaking that we will come back with amendments <e>", "<cs> very briefly the point is that if the identity of the chargee is a matter of significance to a searcher then he can inspect the register and the instrument of the charge itself which is kept at the companys registered office under the new section <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> z <e>", "<cs> i think i should explain first the reason for giving the secretary of state a power to require notice of events in new section a that cause a floating charge to crystallise <e> <s> the knowledge that a floating charge has crystallised is important to other prospective chargees <e> <s> for example a crystallised floating charge will take priority over a subsequently created equitable fixed charge <e> <s> it is desirable therefore to have a means of providing for disclosure of the crystallisation of floating charges <e> <s> without the power to require notice of events prescribed under new section a the secretary of state would not be able to ensure that the register of charges disclosed full information about floating charges <e>", "<cs> i do not see that that question arises <e>", "<cs> no but that is what could trigger off an automatic crystallisation of a floating charge <e> <s> a charge could be over a variety of assets which would therefore justify it as being a floating charge <e>", "<cs> i must point out that the example i am using is only an example <e> <s> i do not see that the difficulties the noble lord has with it are necessarily valid <e> <s> all we are trying to point out in this instance is that if the terms of the floating charge specified that it would automatically crystallise if the company exceeded a specified borrowing limit the company might not know immediately that the limit had been reached and the chargee would not be able to know unless the company had already told him <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran replies perhaps i may say that the noble lord spoke of loose drafting <e> <s> consideration was given to framing the power in such a way that notice would be required only of events within the knowledge of prescribed persons <e> <s> however there are a number of difficulties with that requirement <e> <s> to avoid unnecessary complexities the power is framed in general terms <e> <s> as i said however the intention is that it should be exercised in relation to prescribed events which are known to the company which is charging <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the intention behind these amendments <e> <s> i do not think anyone would wish to argue against the proposition that a company should keep its register properly and up to date <e> <s> unfortunately these amendments would not assist that objective <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> z was based on the belief that the new section does not require companies to keep an up-to-date register but the section as drafted does impose that requirement <e> <s> it imposes a duty on a company to keep a register of all charges containing certain entries <e> <s> those entries must be accurate and up to date if the duty is to be fulfilled <e>", "<cs> i find myself surprised that the noble lord lord williams is being so forceful about this point <e> <s> i thought i had explained the matter rather carefully in my original reply to his amendment no <e> <s> z <e> <s> i must point out that there are so many duties of companies which are not subject to audit <e> <s> as the noble lord knows there are pages in the companies act and the vast majority of them concern duties which are not related to accounting and audit matters <e>", "<cs> auditors audit registers as part of their duties in relation to the companys accounts <e> <s> it is not part of their job to inspect those registers <e> <s> the alleged difficulty has not been apparent in our consultations <e> <s> there have been no complaints at companies house <e>", "<cs> this may not be the appropriate time to debate what should or should not be included in the work carried out under an audit <e> <s> part iv is specifically about the registration of company charges <e> <s> any proposal for an inspection of the register must be justified on its merits not because it would be relevant to an entirely different function <e> <s> i know that the noble lord feels strongly about the point <e> <s> perhaps he would look at what has been said in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both the noble lords for having spoken relatively briefly <e> <s> we have obviously received representations from the law society <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord is worried about the definition of vehicle <e> <s> i presume that that comes from new subsection <e> <s> vehicles are those things which are not ships aircraft or hovercraft <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not in any way wish to confuse the noble lord or the other members <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say at the outset how much i and the department of trade and industry appreciate the way in which the noble earl has approached his task today by giving me an advance copy of his address <e> <s> i am grateful too that he <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may finish my remarks <e> <s> it is a complex issue and i am sure that there are details which i or my officials have missed <e> <s> it appears that mr russell has been unable to cooperate with the official receiver <e> <s> the official receiver understands that mr russell is the principal creditor and shareholder of the company and any civil proceedings would be largely for his benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e> <s> moved that the house do now again resolve itself into committee <e> <s> lord <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained his amendment would delete two subsections from new section which deal with separate issues <e> <s> i take them in turn <e>", "<cs> i shall respond first to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> we are very sorry that these amendments were put down late <e> <s> i expressed regret in my earlier remarks that the committee had not had time to consider them before todays discussion <e> <s> they were tabled last wednesday so i suppose that we have had more time to discuss them than we have had for one or two other amendments <e>", "<cs> i do not want to make an issue of this <e> <s> we are sorry that the amendments were late <e> <s> i understand that those tabled on friday were simply a re-ordering of the amendments <e> <s> they were not different amendments <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that <e>", "<cs> that is an entirely different question with which i am not proposing to deal at the moment <e> <s> i turn to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran asks why paragraph b is needed <e> <s> it is accepted that new section ab might be strictly unnecessary <e> <s> however in our view it provides a useful pointer to the operation of the section <e> <s> when first replying to the noble lord i asked him to consider reflecting further on the matter <e> <s> in the light of what has been said in committee the government should reflect and come back again at the report stage <e>", "<cs> in the space of a few minutes the noble lord lord williams asked a number of detailed questions <e> <s> these new sections have been carefully drafted and have benefited from advice from all kinds of interested parties <e> <s> we believe that the new sections work but the area is difficult and technical <e> <s> as the noble lord has suggested improvements we shall be glad to consider them <e>", "<cs> yes that is precisely what it means <e> <s> however perhaps i may continue <e> <s> the companys constitution as set out in section a is an omnibus word conveying all constitutional limitations <e> <s> as i said it is well understood by the courts and practitioners <e> <s> i think that i have covered most of the points raised by the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> however if he feels that there are any outstanding matters i am sure that he will be happy to discuss them again at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i was well aware of the reasons behind the decision of the noble lord not to move the amendment tabled in his name which dealt with subsection <e> <s> as i said earlier we are keen to reflect on all suggestions made by noble lords <e> <s> indeed on some suggestions no doubt we shall come back at a later stage <e> <s> as regards this particular subsection it explains the use of terms in subsection and does not create new rights <e>", "<cs> again the noble lord lord williams has made numerous points in connection with the new clause <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat what i said in reply to an earlier point <e> <s> i am very happy to listen to his words and to look further at areas which he has suggested need to be changed <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come to the question of what is void or voidable in a moment <e> <s> turning briefly to the question of ratification if the company ratifies a transaction the third party cannot back out <e> <s> that is that <e>", "<cs> we do not regard this as slang <e> <s> however it is an issue that we are quite happy to look at <e> <s> this is the modern style of drafting and for the time being we shall continue to use it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could reply to the various comments made on this clause <e> <s> first subsection states <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord lord peston if i have misunderstood what he was trying to say <e> <s> we feel that charities in this context should be treated differently from all other sorts of companies <e> <s> the noble lord said that we are being inconsistent in this approach <e> <s> we are not being inconsistent we are being very consistent in treating charities in very much the same way as they have been treated in the past but simply allowing non-charitable companies to be able to change their rules for the reasons that i have already outlined <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly answer that point <e> <s> we are dealing with company law where we are changing the rule of <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is confusing himself with the bill with which we are dealing at the moment and the charities act <e> <s> we are bringing forward these amendments to the companies bill because we have already changed the <e>", "<cs> initially i was rather surprised and little puzzled to see this amendment down on the marshalled list <e> <s> as i understand it it is seeking to change the trustee investments act to allow trustees who are covered by the act to invest in a slightly wider range of companies those which have paid dividends to some shareholders in shares rather than cash at some time in the past five years <e> <s> setting aside for a moment the complex rights and wrongs of this issue on which i shall touch in a moment i do not regard this as an appropriate subject necessarily to be dealt with in the context of this bill <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate the noble lords desire to find means of encouraging the wider spread of employee share ownership schemes <e> <s> that is an objective which is shared by the government and much has already been achieved in that direction through various aspects of government policy <e> <s> i believe that there are presently very few significant obstacles to the introduction of effective and worthwhile schemes <e> <s> i understand the points which the noble lord has made about the limitation which the specific reference to money in section b can be said to produce <e> <s> however i believe that the amendment would go much too far in opening the matter up <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pre-empt any discussions which the committee may have on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd has yet to move it and it would be wrong for me to go into detail <e> <s> however i expect to be able to offer to discuss the matter further with the advocates of the <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pre-empt any discussion on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> there are aspects of it which we find interesting and to which we would seek to find a solution <e> <s> however the government will not accept amendment no <e> <s> in exactly its present form <e>", "<cs> i reiterate that we agree with amendment no <e> <s> in principle <e> <s> however we must reserve our position and take account of any pitfalls which may emerge on further consideration <e>", "<cs> as i indicated in my response to amendment no <e> <s> a the government firmly believe in the wider spread of employee share ownership <e> <s> they are not unsympathetic to the objective of the amendment <e> <s> nevertheless the subject needs to be handled with considerable care in order not to provide the opportunity for abuse which the basic provisions of this part of the bill are intended to avoid <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord lord williams that there is no lack of enthusiasm for finding a satisfactory way forward on this concept <e> <s> it is far more a matter of the complexity of the issue and limited resources <e> <s> we have already had an example of that complexity in that the noble lord lord williams brought forward an amendment which had substantial technical defects <e> <s> we do not wish to do that <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank my noble friend lord morris for his remarks <e> <s> i am glad that he felt encouraged by what i said <e> <s> my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth talked about resource limitations <e> <s> he knows perfectly well that time is generally short that there are priorities and that time will be taken up in discussing this matter <e> <s> that is because it is complicated and not because we do not have enough officials to look at the matter or that there are not enough parliamentary counsel to deal with it <e> <s> it is just that it is complicated and needs to be given a great deal of thought <e>", "<cs> i believe that we have talked sufficiently on this subject and it will be given the highest priority <e> <s> i must add that that is no guarantee that we shall come back with something on report <e>", "<cs> this amendment could not i believe actually be made to operate in practice <e> <s> nor do i believe even if it were practicable that it would help significantly the identification of those with interests in shares <e>", "<cs> there is no question of throwing out the general principle behind what was said by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil <e> <s> the governments position is that there are alternative ways to create the transparency or lift the veil as my noble friend lord peyton put it to see who are the owners behind shares <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee does not feel that there is any contradiction of principle in anything i have said <e> <s> my noble friend lord rippon of hexham spoke about the principle <e> <s> my noble friend said that he did not understand why i was arguing in this direction <e> <s> the principle i am dealing with is that of transparency of the owners of shares <e> <s> we feel that this amendment does not go any further than the suggestions we have already put forward <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra has mentioned the per cent <e> <s> benchmark <e> <s> the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is no better than that <e>", "<cs> we are seeking transparency <e> <s> it is perhaps more the degree of it that we disagree upon and also the practicalities of the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the committee that in my initial answer i said that we had had a major consultation in august <e> <s> considerable difficulties were pointed out by a variety of people <e> <s> the proposals that now come forward in the shape of this bill were generally accepted <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why we have been unable so far to accept the amendments tabled by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e>", "<cs> that is partly what i said but the noble lord will remember the other aspect about which i was worried <e> <s> i refer to beneficial ownership <e> <s> on the low threshold there was the thought that it was an impracticable mechanism that would not work <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may quickly ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> is he saying that our proposal to increase transparency by lowering the threshold to per cent <e> <s> is unacceptable <e> <s> is that too high <e> <s> the noble lord is shaking his head <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for saying that <e> <s> he is absolutely correct <e> <s> in the past few minutes and throughout our proceedings in committee i have tried to please the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and have tried to explain why we are taking certain stands <e> <s> i thought i had explained clearly in my opening remarks that his proposal simply would not work and would not be any better than what we are proposing <e> <s> i hope he will not feel that i am being rude if i say that there is no point in the government considering further something which we believe will not work <e>", "<cs> the first thing to say about new section a is that it does not confer unrestricted new regulation-making powers on the secretary of state to amend part vi of the act <e> <s> it allows him to change three specific provisions in part vi which at present he cannot change <e> <s> it extends an existing power and it re-enacts another <e>", "<cs> the figure can already be changed by regulation <e> <s> i do not believe that my noble friend has felt worried that the existing power to make regulations has been used in an unwholesome way <e>", "<cs> that is a different question that we have already dealt with at considerable length in our earlier debate about transparency <e> <s> perhaps i may continue to deal with the points raised in this debate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is correct <e> <s> i am afraid that i was carried away <e> <s> i was going to deal with his amendment <e> <s> i recognise the concern of the committee that even the specific provisions referred in new section a should not be subject to amendment without careful parliamentary scrutiny <e> <s> in the light of that if my noble friend lord peyton were to withdraw his amendment and my noble friend lord mottistone and other noble lords chose not to move theirs i would agree to return on report with an amendment making the exercise of all the powers contained in new section a subject to affirmative resolution <e>", "<cs> i am slightly confused <e> <s> i thought that amendment no <e> <s> zb had been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> za on which we have just voted <e> <s> i may be wrong and the noble lord may have spoken to another amendment <e> <s> if that is so i am not sure which amendment that is <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the amendment to which the noble lord spoke is amendment no <e> <s> zb <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to this debate <e> <s> i should like to say at the outset that the government are not prepared to accept these proposals <e> <s> there are a number of reasons for this which i shall deal with in turn <e> <s> many noble lords have said that this is a difficult complex and highly-charged issue and therefore i shall have to speak at <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply to my noble friends point <e> <s> my noble friend lord hanson answered that when he said that in his experience <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly comment on what has been said especially by my noble friend lord carr <e> <s> i do not feel that i gave any steer whatsoever to the takeover panel or the deliberations of its working party <e> <s> i mentioned that we were not prejudging the issue by saying that the <e>", "<cs> in an earlier debate my noble friend lord peyton offered to me his sympathy for being on the front bench <e> <s> he suggested that the secretary of state should be present to take the heat <e> <s> i should like to point out to him that whenever i see the secretary of state i pass on any heat that i have received <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to make a great song and dance about the issue and i accept what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> this amendment is designed to reduce potential delays when the recipient of a <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend feels that am speaking too long in reply to his comments <e> <s> i shall gladly cut down my meagre words <e> <s> as to his point about the notice principle we have already looked at that <e> <s> at the start of my remarks i said that i should not wish to argue against the objectives <e> <s> in the light of that i am happy to reinspect the issue but i cannot give any guarantee that the government will come back on report with an amendment to cover the matter <e> <s> however we shall consider it <e>", "<cs> again this is an interesting proposal which my noble friend brings forward <e> <s> i should like to remind the committee of the reason why the provisions on concert parties were introduced in the companies act <e> <s> it had become apparent that it was possible to evade the obligation to disclose by distributing interests in shares among a number of people acting in concert none of whom individually held an interest as large as per cent <e> <s> consequently groups of people acting in concert to acquire shares are now required to aggregate their separate interests for the purpose of disclosure <e> <s> groups of shareholders should be able to adopt a common strategy towards the conduct of a company without being obliged to show their hand in advance to the management <e> <s> this is a perfectly proper activity for the owners of a company to pursue <e>", "<cs> the previous amendments tabled by my noble friend lord peyton have contained technical proposals which could be said to fall broadly within the scope of part vi of the act even if in the governments view they would not actually further the objectives of part vi <e> <s> this amendment however raises a major issue of principle which goes beyond part vi and runs counter to the governments policy on takeovers <e>", "<cs> the government are opposed to this set of proposals both for reasons of general principle and also because they consider that the implications of the individual changes are in some cases highly undesirable in themselves <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief but the noble lord lord williams commented that i had said that directors of companies were bound by law and that they would not necessarily comply with the law <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting that secretaries are somehow brought under the law <e> <s> i could say exactly the same to him that they would not necessarily comply with the law <e> <s> i therefore do not see how he is improving the position or even proving his point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord onslow for moving the amendment <e> <s> i was aware that my noble friend lord mottistone would not be here <e> <s> the committee may find it helpful if i first explain the structure of the new section which is inserted into the act by this clause and the reasons the government want to adopt the system for determining and changing the return date for a companys annual return <e> <s> i shall then explain why i do not believe that the amendment moved by my noble friend would achieve these purposes <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply briefly to the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> i believe that there is a certain amount of misunderstanding of the government proposals <e> <s> if members of the committee who disagree with the governments view look more closely at our proposals they will see that we have allowed a certain amount of flexibility <e> <s> we have no desire to create a totally fixed or rigid system <e> <s> i think that there is sufficient flexibility to get round the problem which my noble friend lord hanson mentioned <e>", "<cs> i have no quarrel with the intention behind the amendment but i do not believe that it is necessary <e> <s> as i explained in relation to the <e>", "<cs> i was initially slightly confused as to the exact purpose of this amendment <e> <s> the requirement in the new subsection of section is to deliver successive returns each of which is made up to a date not later than the companys current return date <e> <s> cannot really see the need for the power of the secretary of state proposed by the noble lord <e> <s> i have already explained flexibility in replying to an earlier amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would read what i have said and i think he will find that what i said earlier on is very relevant to this particular point and therefore the amendment is probably unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the government are not convinced that present legal arrangements regarding notice for meetings and their conduct are inadequate or should be subject to more detailed regulation <e> <s> in particular it should be borne in mind that on occasion there may well be pressing and valid reasons for holding a meeting at a time or on a date which could be proscribed by this amendment <e> <s> i have in mind for example the very tight deadlines which sometimes have to be imposed in connection with takeover proposals <e> <s> in such situations we believe that the minimum period of notice required for such meetings and the right to appoint a proxy provide adequate safeguards for the shareholder <e> <s> this amendment would make it necessary for all public companies to take specific powers in their articles of association to provide for the emergency situation <e>", "<cs> at present the law already provides that every notice calling a meeting of a company must contain a statement with reasonable prominence that the member entitled to attend and vote is entitled to appoint a proxy <e> <s> active shareholder participation however is unlikely to depend on whether the company rather than the shareholder himself or herself meets the cost of the postage stamp <e> <s> this seems to be entirely a matter and a fairly minor one at that for the internal organisation in running the companys affairs and its relationship with its own shareholders <e> <s> i do not consider that this is a matter for legislation <e>", "<cs> this is a long-standing restriction and one which affects a considerable number of interests <e> <s> i am referring here not only to those shareholders in public limited companies who may wish from time to time to appoint proxies but also to the many other shareholders whose interest lies in the smooth running of the meetings of such companies <e> <s> such meetings can on occasion attract a considerable number of shareholders who wish to speak <e> <s> the present provision was introduced in on the grounds that to allow all proxies also to speak would open the way for what might be described as professional proxies whose purpose was simply to delay business by lengthy interventions <e> <s> although this restriction may seem a little hard on the proxy and the person he represents it is important to bear in mind that the proxy does have the right to vote and that is the crucial factor <e> <s> the private company is treated differently for the simple reason that it is in the private company that shareholders are more likely to be oppressed by majority shareholders <e>", "<cs> in setting the threshold in the original section at per cent <e> <s> of share by value the intention of the present bill is to provide a balance between the interests of efficient changes of management control and the interests of shareholders <e> <s> i am not aware of any criticism that these provisions are not working satisfactorily notwithstanding what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene <e> <s> i understand the point that the noble lord seeks to make <e> <s> but he is discussing taxation particularly capital gains tax and this bill is not the appropriate place for such a debate <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord who probably has an extremely good case to make on capital gains tax and how it relates to small shareholders that it would be better to make his case on the second reading of a finance bill <e> <s> i hope therefore that the noble lord will not feel the need to continue <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the debate with interest <e> <s> over recent years the government have done a great deal especially through their privatisation and taxation policies to foster the greater involvement of employees in their companies <e> <s> we have noted the development of other concepts such as the type of partnership company my noble friends amendment is designed to promote <e> <s> i should say at this point that the government are sympathetic in principle to the development of the kinds of organisation to which my noble friend has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in the departments of trade and industry employment and transport and the civil aviation authority and office of fair trading recorded in total written complaints about package holidays <e> <s> this compares with recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to comment definitively on the recommendation at this stage because it is too early to predict how negotiations in brussels may develop <e> <s> the governments starting point is that tour operators should be contractually liable to provide their customers with precisely the holiday that they book and that beyond that a formula must be found for limiting liability in a sensible way <e> <s> many european community partners share our general concern but wish to tackle the offending article in different ways <e> <s> it remains to be seen what kind of formula may be mutually acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not satisfy the noble baroness <e> <s> at the beginning of my answer i said that i did not wish to comment definitively on the recommendation because we are still negotiating in brussels <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments position was reached after careful consideration of the various submissions put to them on consultation <e> <s> they take account of the views expressed by consumer bodies <e> <s> however the consumer movement the travel industry and others with expertise in the field should also consider whether they wish to make appropriate representations on the issue to the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question must be taken in the context of the past years <e> <s> package holidays have increased from million to million today <e> <s> therefore it appears that the vast majority of people who take such holidays obviously enjoy themselves and continue to go <e>", "<cs> my lords the main increased area of complaint has been in respect of consumer surcharges <e> <s> abta has introduced a new code which should greatly improve the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the question of strict liability in the context of holidays is different from that in the context of food <e> <s> for instance we are not <e>", "<cs> no my lords we are still considering both <e>", "<cs> my lords the consideration will be complete in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> a maximum term of imprisonment of two years seems to us to be about right for an offence of this kind involving giving false or misleading information to the competition authorities <e> <s> the penalties were taken directly from the more limited offences which clause replaces that is those in sections and b of the fair trading act <e>", "<cs> i still think that what i said basically explains the situation in that whereas some penalties were specifically created to deal with a major perceived problem what we are dealing with here is not a problem which is perceived to be particularly great or something which gives us great cause for concern but rather a penalty which has been taken from the old section of the fairtrading act <e> <s> in fact all we are really doing is broadening the scope of the provisions <e> <s> therefore we believe that any similarity with that which has occurred in other acts especially the financial services act is irrelevant <e> <s> indeed there is in this case no significant problem which we need to deal with by means of such a serious penalty as seven years imprisonment as suggested by the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that that further explanation clarifies the position <e>", "<cs> i do not believe so but we may have genuinely missed something here <e> <s> it may help if i were to check up on that point and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> i was amazed when i saw the amendment because the noble lord lord williams has been so hard on us whenever we have tried to introduce any sort of regulation <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord has gone through some biblical conversion <e> <s> i shall briefly explain the position <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am not going to sound very encouraging to the noble lord lord peston <e> <s> i remember the noble lord lord williams giving notice of his intention to seek to reverse this provision of the monopolies and mergers commission performance of functions order when it was before this place for approval in january <e> <s> the noble lord is if i may say so making a major issue out of a minor procedural change unless i have missed something in what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> the monopolies and mergers commission has a very reasonable and respectable chairman who makes these kinds of decisions quite happily <e> <s> it is for him to decide how many members and in what way to use the committees and commissioners <e> <s> the noble lord himself has experience in the procedures of public bodies having been chairman of one himself <e> <s> he reminded us that the price commission worked as a commission not as the mmc does through groups <e> <s> yet i believe i am correct in saying that although the final reports were agreed by the full commission they were in practice drawn up by panels of members <e> <s> so perhaps there is a similarity between what the price commission was doing when the noble lord was in charge of it and what we are suggesting that the mmc should be doing now that is trying to make its activities as efficient and expedient as possible through the good decision of the chairman <e>", "<cs> it seems to us to be entirely fair enough <e> <s> there is no danger of the mmcs inquiries becoming arbitrary or capricious as a result of the order and as a result of there being on occasions smaller committees of three members <e> <s> the statute not to mention the possibility of judicial review contains sufficient safeguards against that <e>", "<cs> i too shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a and amendments nos <e> <s> and which we shall come to shortly are all concerned with applying the public interest test set out in section of the fair trading act in various new ways <e> <s> it may therefore help if i start by reminding the committee how this test operates at present <e>", "<cs> i realise that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is extremely experienced in this particular field and that he has spent much time on these matters <e> <s> however i do not really understand why he is worried about the conclusions drawn by a legal adviser from section of the fair trading act concerning the duties of the director general of fair trading when there is also section of the competition act under which the director general can investigate anti-competitive practices on the part of businesses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put his case extremely well <e> <s> as i said earlier he is more than expert in the subject <e> <s> i shall read with care what he has said <e> <s> however i cannot give any commitment that we shall be able to improve on the present situation <e> <s> we feel that the two acts complement each other and that it is therefore not necessary to update the fair trading act <e> <s> i hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord explained the position very well <e> <s> however i am glad to be able to tell him that the figure already stands at million <e> <s> it was increased to that level in by the merger references increase in value of assets order a copy of which can be found in the library <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to the same amendments as the noble lord <e> <s> he seems to think that the existing provisions for referring anti competitive practices to the monopolies and mergers commission are insufficient <e> <s> we have discussed his proposed additions to the functions of the mmc in this respect in considering amendment no <e> <s> a and i hope that i have explained why we consider the present provisions for referring anti-competitive behaviour cover the ground quite well <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would make a number of changes to the public interest test applied by the monopolies and mergers commission when looking at matters referred to it <e> <s> i should remind noble lords that section of the fair trading act requires the mmc in determining whether a matter operates or may be expected to operate against the public interest to take account of all matters which appear to it to be relevant <e> <s> the list of particular desiderata which follows although fairly wide-ranging is not exclusive <e> <s> the weight to be attached to particular factors will vary from case to case <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is concerned that information obtained by the uk competition authorities under the competition act should where necessary be able to be passed on for the purposes of the eec treaty and the single european act <e> <s> we believe that this is already adequately provided for by section d which permits disclosure in pursuance of a community obligation <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble lords question does not arise <e>", "<cs> it is not that i do not wish to be encouraging or generous to the noble lord i am always delighted to be so <e> <s> however in this case the expression community obligation is defined in the european communities act <e> <s> there is no doubt to which community and obligation the reference is made <e> <s> the noble lord said that i was referring to the <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams for being relatively brief <e> <s> i am also glad that he gave notice that he would oppose the question that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i apologise that i am not able to be quite as brief <e>", "<cs> clause is an important element in the protection which the part is designed to give to exchanges and clearing houses <e> <s> it establishes the principle that where conflict might arise between insolvency law and the systems of the exchanges and clearing houses the latter are to take precedence <e> <s> to achieve this result subsections and are both necessary <e> <s> it is not enough to ensure as subsection does that contracts and rules are valid <e> <s> it is also necessary that the clearing and settlement systems and the default rules should be able to deal with those contracts <e> <s> that is the purpose of subsection <e>", "<cs> it was pleasing to hear the noble lord discuss the possibility of future amendments in his name <e> <s> we look forward to those <e>", "<cs> the noble lord suggests that the exchange or clearing house should meet the cost of providing assistance <e> <s> the government do not believe this is appropriate save in circumstances in which there is no prospect of the cost being recovered out of the insolvents estate for which the clause already provides <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i shall be brief <e> <s> it is not intended that the copies should be certified copies <e>", "<cs> photocopies would be fine <e> <s> what is important is speed <e> <s> that is the main requirement <e> <s> copies would be perfectly all right <e>", "<cs> it is a fact that the copy can be a photocopy <e> <s> it is quite acceptable for it to be a photocopy <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams asked whether there would have to be proof that the copy whether a photocopy or any other type of copy was a copy of the original document <e>", "<cs> we mean what we say <e> <s> a copy is a copy <e> <s> i understand the noble lords example <e> <s> it would be easy for him to make a copy and it would not necessarily be an exact copy <e> <s> it will always be possible for the originals to be handed over so they can be left in the hands of the insolvency practitioner <e> <s> i am not sure whether that entirely answers the question posed by the noble lord but perhaps this is a matter at which we can look further <e> <s> however there is obviously no guarantee that we shall necessarily come back with any changes <e>", "<cs> i am very glad to have that reassurance from the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> the purpose of subsection is to ensure that an exchange or clearing house can take action without delay in relation to the defaulter or his property in connection with default proceedings <e> <s> the amendment would reintroduce scope for delay by requiring leave of the court or alternatively in the case of section of the insolvency act of the administrator to be obtained in such circumstances <e> <s> this would be undesirable for two main reasons <e>", "<cs> the effect of the amendment would be that the normal insolvency act provisions on currency conversion would apply if the exchange or clearing house reported a debt expressed in foreign currency <e> <s> i do not see any objection to the noble lords approach and we shall bring forward a government amendment <e>", "<cs> as i have already explained the underlying purpose for part vii of the bill is to remove the uncertainty that would exist between the interaction of insolvency law and the clearing and settlement systems of those financial markets included in part vii if a member of a market were to default by making specific provisions for the application of insolvency law to those markets <e> <s> this clause is a piece of that jigsaw and it may assist the committee if i spend a few moments outlining the aim of the clause <e>", "<cs> that is a matter which obviously involves many of the principles surrounding the whole aspect of insolvency law <e> <s> when we are talking about this there are many principles of insolvency law <e> <s> when it comes to a court deciding between as the noble lord said whether or not a settlement or bagain is valid under the terms of the law <e>", "<cs> i can now see exactly what the noble lord is getting at <e> <s> if it is not <e>", "<cs> i have already outlined the principles underlying part vii of the bill <e> <s> the aim of this particular clause is to protect persons who have entered into a market contract with the insolvent without being aware that the contract was at undervalue which gave them a preference over or prejudiced other creditors <e> <s> the same protection extends to the exchange or clearing house where it deals with part of the defaulters estate under the provision of their rules <e>", "<cs> is that it <e> <s> the noble lord said that the provision was extraordinary <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to prove that it is not <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this amendment also concerns the part of clause which relates to dispositions of property <e> <s> it seeks to amend clause which <e>", "<cs> the purpose of the new subparagraph a which this clause inserts into schedule of the financial services act is to clarify the meaning of the expression <e>", "<cs> the aim of this clause is to clarify the position regarding set-off which it has been suggested is unclear as a result in part of an attempt to update the language of the bankruptcy act in the insolvency act <e>", "<cs> there is a very short answer to the question raised <e> <s> this is a straightforward measure of deregulation <e> <s> however i am sure that members of the committee will not be satisfied with that <e> <s> without going into too much detail perhaps i can explain what it is that the government are doing <e>", "<cs> we are as keen as the accounting profession to discuss together the commencement arrangements for part i which concerns company accounts <e> <s> this is simply a continuation of the close consultation with the profession which has gone on throughout the preparation of this part <e> <s> i am happy therefore to give the noble lord an assurance that we shall consult on the arrangement for bringing it into force <e> <s> on part i we shall consult both the accountancy profession as the noble lords amendment suggests and the representatives of other interested parties with whom we have been in discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost to industrial and commercial companies to date of the changes in bank base rates since march compared with the cost if bank base rates had remained the same since march is estimated to be about billion <e>", "<cs> my lords we have continued to see sustained growth in the past months <e> <s> the noble lord says that interest rates have increased from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> that is of course true from june <e> <s> but if the base date is taken from march the figure was at that time per cent <e> <s> i do not agree with the noble lords conclusions <e> <s> the recent cbi and dti surveys are consistent with strong manufacturing investment growth which we hope will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords exports are performing well <e> <s> we always knew that strong growth in domestic demand would lead to a rise in imports <e> <s> i must point out that imports of non-consumer goods have also risen reflecting a rise in output and investment <e> <s> so long as the government maintain a firm fiscal and monetary policy we do not believe that there is a great problem <e>", "<cs> my lords the aim of interest rate policy has always been to keep down inflation <e> <s> perhaps i may point out that a one percentage point increase in interest rates even if sustained for a full year costs companies far less than a one percentage point increase in pay settlements <e>", "<cs> my lords i broadly agree with the noble and learned lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously matters are entirely different in the united states <e> <s> this governments policy has been to seek to keep inflation as low as possible by the mechanism of interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it is something to worry about but as i said exports are performing well and we believe that so long as the government maintain a firm fiscal and monetary policy the problem is not as great as the noble lord suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble earls comments are absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords as i believe the noble lord well knows we never speculate on future interest rate movements <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment on the latter part of the noble lords question <e> <s> as to the first part unemployment is of course continuing to fall <e>", "<cs> my lords the interest rate is used to keep down inflation <e> <s> the february retail figures are only one months figures <e> <s> in the three months to february retail sales were unchanged from the previous three months <e>", "<cs> my lords based on being the index of production for the aerospace industry was in and in the following years and in a growth of around per cent <e> <s> per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in agreement with my noble friend and i thank him for bringing that information to the houses attention <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid that i am unable to do that <e> <s> if the noble lord wants those figures i should be delighted to write to him and put a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for taking part in the debate <e> <s> notwithstanding the legalistic views of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i think he described them as such i must point out that the provision is useful only for consolidated accounts and that therefore it is not sensible or meaningful to leave <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have some sympathy with the purpose of the amendment <e> <s> it is not always apparent from a companys individual accounts how much of its reserves are potentially distributable to shareholders <e> <s> until the companies act companies were required to disclose separately the amounts of their capital and revenue reserves <e> <s> generally the amount of the revenue reserves disclosed would have been the amount of the distributable reserves <e> <s> although this was a matter of some debate at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government accept that a small change to the bill is needed here to ensure that a company cannot avoid the effect of a notice served under new section by shortening its financial year <e> <s> we do not think that the actual amendment proposed by the noble lord offers a satisfactory way of achieving that end but if he is willing to withdraw his amendment i undertake to bring forward a government amendment on third reading which has the same objective <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained he moved an identical amendment at the committee stage <e> <s> i said then that we were willing to consider the point carefully and report back <e> <s> i am grateful therefore to the noble lord for tabling this amendment and giving me the opportunity to explain why on reflection we have concluded that we cannot accept a change on this point <e> <s> there are two questions here first whether to follow this particular amendment and secondly whether some other change should be made instead <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can give some further background <e> <s> i think it is fair to say that the corresponding provision in the act is flawed <e> <s> section states that a company need not comply with schedule and need not show a true and fair view but it does not say that the account need not be audited and delivered to the <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave the noble lord suggests that the amendment is otiose <e> <s> however our advisers say that we need it and therefore we put it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords after the fairly substantial debate in committee and what i have just said i am sorry that i have not been able entirely to satisfy the noble lord lord williams on this matter <e> <s> perhaps i should point out that the word included means included in the consolidation <e>", "<cs> my lords we have considered these amendments in the light of what the noble lord said at the committee stage and i have listened to him now <e> <s> we have also taken preliminary soundings with one or two auditing practitioners <e> <s> our conclusion is that the words contained in the bill as it stands are adequate and that the changes in the wording proposed by the noble lord would be unnecessary and very possibly confusing <e> <s> we are not aware of any pressure from the auditing <e>", "<cs> my lords there may well be <e> <s> such words have often been pointed out by the noble lord to whom we are grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point perhaps i may clarify exactly the position of scottish partnerships <e> <s> these have a legal personality separate from that of their members and therefore the problem does not arise <e> <s> section of the companies act specifically provides that a scottish firm is eligible for appointment if all its partners are qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case it would obviously be a separate entity <e> <s> but the old partnership and the new partnership would both be regarded as new partnerships <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords an identical amendment was discussed in committee <e> <s> we recognise that the professional bodies are not very happy with the idea that the responsibility to maintain the register should be a joint one <e> <s> my noble friend lord brabazon of tara said in committee that the government would consider whether a way could be found of meeting the bodies concerns while still implementing the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i would agree with the noble lord that this is a matter of reverting to the usual burden of proof <e> <s> first this is a standard provision that can be found in several statutes which provide for the prosecution of offences that have been committed by partnerships and unincorporated associations <e> <s> secondly there is authority for the proposition that particularly in the case of offences which do not involve an element of <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said this is a technical amendment bringing in those who are officers or servants <e> <s> in this definition officers or servants are those instructed by the investigators to carry out whatever duties there may be <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i would never wish matters to be pushed through the house on the nod <e> <s> he has asked a pertinent question <e> <s> the concept of an officer or servant is well understood in law <e> <s> it is a phrase used elsewhere <e> <s> it does not have a meaning here different from that in any other statute <e> <s> i therefore hope that the noble lord will be put at ease <e>", "<cs> my lords without intending to be in the least facetious it has exactly the same meaning in other statutes as it has here <e>", "<cs> my lords subsection specifies functions in detail <e> <s> this is to ensure that the question of whether or not an overseas authority qualifies for the purposes of these provisions can be determined with reasonable certainty <e> <s> however it would be undesirable for the secretary of state to be limited in his ability to provide assistance solely for the purpose of a function in subsection <e> <s> it would reduce the scope for providing assistance and focus consideration of whether the powers can and should be exercised on the relatively sterile question of whether the information was being sought for a function which corresponded to a particular function exercised in the united kingdom <e> <s> it is important that the authority should not be seeking the information in question for some purpose other than for the purpose of its regulatory functions in the companies and financial services sphere <e> <s> otherwise the object of exercising these powers could be wholly at large <e> <s> but the main consideration as to whether to exercise the powers should focus on matters of the kind instanced in subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking i agree with what the noble lord lord williams has said <e> <s> however as the noble lord knows there are different forms of banking <e> <s> therefore some aspects of banking will come under the new subsection and other aspects of banking will quite clearly fall under the secrecy applications in other parts of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord williams is generally right but he confuses the matter in this respect that it is not that the secretary of state would or should but that he may <e> <s> the intention here is that the costs or expense of exercising the new powers will generally be borne out of the departments budget <e> <s> however if the secretary of state sees fit he might request a contribution towards the costs from the requesting authority <e> <s> it is envisaged that the basis for any such contribution would be set before the united kingdom investigation began <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be extremely unlikely but in the event that would be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords yes it almost certainly is <e> <s> there are a variety of options for members and this would fall under those <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing on the order paper in the name of my noble friend lord young of graffham <e>", "<cs> my lords major changes in the focus of the dtis policies were made early last year <e> <s> regional policy now operates within a framework of measures designed to promote enterprise and business development throughout the country and to encourage firms to take full advantage of the opportunities of <e> <s> our enterprise initiative is particularly relevant to the regions and our europe open for business campaign is aimed at encouraging all firms to take action now to ensure they benefit from the opportunities the single market will bring <e>", "<cs> my lords just before easter the commission announced the definitive list of areas which will benefit from the erdf as declining industrial areas objective <e> <s> nearly all our assisted areas will be eligible <e> <s> in addition a number of additional areas will qualify for the first time <e> <s> there were however some disappointing omissions <e> <s> we hope that in the future we shall be able to do something about that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the question on the order paper had anything to do with the business rate i should have been delighted to reply to the question of the noble lord <e> <s> however i am afraid the question on the order paper is directly concerned with regional policy <e> <s> therefore i shall decline <e>", "<cs> my lords the changes announced last year were not designed specifically to reduce expenditure but rather to make it more effective through being targeted on those areas where it would be most effectively used <e> <s> i speak particularly of smaller firms <e> <s> it is by such targeting that we shall see substantially greater growth in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that i had answered the questions by saying that nearly all our assisted areas will be eligible although from our discussions with the commission some were not included in the erdf areas <e> <s> i thought that that covered the point which the noble lord raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that will not be the case <e> <s> i am not sure why but it does not appear that that is something that needs to be changed at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may take this opportunity to answer that question <e> <s> subsection is necessary for three reasons <e> <s> first it makes clear that the term charge includes in england a mortgage <e> <s> secondly it makes clear that the term in scotland includes not only a heritable security which is the equivalent of a mortgage on land but also any form of security <e> <s> thirdly it excludes charges that arise by operation of law for reasons explained in committee <e> <s> the subsection derives from sections and of the act <e> <s> as drafted in the bill at present it leaves some slight doubt as to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord mottistone and the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran for explaining the intention behind their amendment although i am sorry that neither accepted what i said in my opening remarks concerning my amendment <e> <s> without going into the matter at the same length as i did in committee i will explain to the house the reasons the government do not believe that a certificate that is conclusive of all matters is desirable <e> <s> i think this will answer the questions put by the noble lord lord carter <e>", "<cs> no my lords of course not <e> <s> i should point out however that those most recent words were dealing with only one point <e> <s> i have dealt at considerable length with a whole range of other points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> although i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i indicated not so much that part iv would have to be rewritten but that if conclusivity was required of the certificate it would not be possible under the new system in part iv <e> <s> therefore the basic premise that the noble lord makes is right in that it would have to be entirely rewritten <e> <s> secondly on the aspect of clerical oversight the point is that if there is a clerical oversight innocent third parties would be in trouble because the chargee would be protected under the terms of existing law <e> <s> the certificate does not allow the register to be updated and therefore it is not just a matter of clerical oversight <e>", "<cs> my lords both the noble lords lord hacking and lord carter mentioned the definition of charge <e> <s> charge is defined in new section as a registrable charge <e> <s> furthermore the negative pledges about which the noble lord lord carter was worried will be registered by way of the prescribed particulars <e> <s> the effect of this combined with the rule on notice is that subsequent charges would rank behind in priority to the floating charges <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come to that point in a moment <e> <s> in the majority of cases it would be reasonable to expect those taking security over a companys property to inspect the register <e> <s> they would therefore even without the amendment be fixed with notice except where they can reasonably be expected to have searched the register for some other purpose <e> <s> the government agree that those who acquire security that arises by operation of law should not be taken to have notice <e> <s> it is possible that the amendment does not deal with that point adequately and it is something which we continue to discuss with the law society as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that we have no definitive plans to put forward any further amendment on third reading <e> <s> the timetable for discussions with the law society would not enable us to prepare an amendment in time <e> <s> however this is indeed a complex area of the law and we are prepared to be persuaded that we have not as yet got the matter right <e> <s> it is therefore important that we take the time to prepare proper amendments should they be needed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is up to any noble lord to move whatever amendment he may receive from the law society <e> <s> i think that i have made the governments position quite plain <e> <s> we continue to hold discussions with the law society on the point and we are more than happy to continue such discussions <e> <s> when the discussions have been concluded we shall do whatever needs to be done <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not willing to give any undertaking other than the one which i have already given <e> <s> i have said that we are continuing to discuss the situation <e> <s> my wish is that the amendment put forward by the government should be accepted on the basis that we are still considering what the law society is proposing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is a great deal of difference between what noble lords opposite want and what the government want <e> <s> however i believe that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what the government are doing here <e> <s> the government have looked carefully at the arguments made by noble lords opposite in committee with regard to the application of the avoidance sanction where the name of the chargee is omitted or mis-stated <e> <s> first it was suggested that a charge might be invalid if it was not executed by the chargee <e> <s> there are all sorts of reasons why a <e>", "<cs> my lords as both noble lords have said we discussed this amendment in committee when i said that i would consider the points made <e> <s> the concern is that new section a would permit the secretary of state to require the notification of an event that entitled the chargee to crystallise a floating charge even though he did not exercise that entitlement <e> <s> the government believe that this concern is misplaced <e> <s> such an event could not be said to affect the nature of the security under a floating charge <e> <s> chargees will at any time have a number of rights contingent or otherwise to crystallise a floating charge <e> <s> the transformation of a contingent right to an actual right would not amount to a change in the nature of the security <e> <s> such a change will only have taken place when the right is actually exercised and the charge crystallises changing its nature by attaching to specific property as a fixed charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran was confessing and that the noble lord lord williams was saying that he had made a mistake also a confession <e> <s> i am afraid that so far i have nothing to confess but if your lordships will bear with me i am sure that as we continue with this bill there will be many things i shall have to confess <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if anything remains that i have not dealt with <e> <s> perhaps i could say a little more <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move pursuant to the resolution of the house of tuesday last that the house do now resolve itself into a committee upon the bill in respect of part v <e>", "<cs> i thank both noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i hope that in dealing with the recommitment of part v we shall be able as far as possible to treat our remarks on clauses which we have already discussed in committee as though this were a report stage <e> <s> i hope we shall be able to look more closely at the new clauses which we have brought forward <e> <s> as for the criticism that the noble lord lord williams of elvel levelled against the government on the new amendments to part vii i should like to point out to the chamber that although these amendments are very lengthy they are substantially grouped and only include a total of about a dozen full discussions <e> <s> therefore i do not think there is the substantial problem that the noble lord lord williams made out <e>", "<cs> this is a convenient moment to break until pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i am no happier replying to this amendment than i would have been if i had to reply to the amendments of the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> however in that case i have my noble and learned friend the lord advocate to help me out <e> <s> in this instance i have to do it myself <e>", "<cs> i only reached my second sentence <e> <s> i have hardly started and i have quite a lot to say <e> <s> i take the point that the amendment as <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness if i have misunderstood what she said <e> <s> i totally agree with her <e> <s> there is no intention to particularly draw out women as having special qualities that perhaps men do not or could not have <e>", "<cs> my lords the inner london boroughs have proposed to my right honourable friend that the transfer to individual boroughs of major ilea sports facilities should be subject to certain conditions <e> <s> they have requested transfer to specific boroughs subject to the condition that if a borough no longer wishes to maintain the site it must be offered free of charge to any other inner london borough which is prepared to maintain it as a sports centre <e> <s> each proposal for transfer will have to be considered on its merits but my right honourable friend will be prepared wherever appropriate to impose such conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i am not sure that a covenant will be attached to the grounds i think it is more a case of a condition <e> <s> my right honourable friend must be satisfied that an inner london borough requires property for its lea functions before he can make a transfer order <e> <s> he would expect to make those conditions on the order only for major items of property serving more than one borough such as ileas large sports centres <e>", "<cs> my lords there is only one playing field in kingston which is about to be disposed of and there are about six in the pipeline <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry to hear what the noble lord had to say <e> <s> i shall certainly pass on his comments in the greatest sincerity to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because there could be a potential temptation to local authorities that my right honourable friend has sought to place these conditions on the transfers <e> <s> i am sure however that boroughs will wish to continue to use the playing fields currently used by ilea and that they will be influenced by pupil pressure and no doubt parent pressure <e> <s> i would not expect any sports fields to go out of sports use as a result of ileas abolition <e>", "<cs> my lords we regard that possibility as being extremely unlikely mainly because parents will certainly not vote for a local authority that has the intention of selling playing fields <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is correct <e> <s> i shall draw her remarks to the attention of both secretaries of state concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords in the three months to february trade in manufactures was in deficit by billion compared with a deficit of billion in the previous three months <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that the period of the last labour government was a very long time ago <e> <s> i had hardly left school at the time that government left office <e> <s> this governments policies have laid down the basis of sustained growth eight years of growth <e> <s> the economy has grown faster

below the community average <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will be aware that he has a debate on th april when naturally we shall be able to discuss these questions far more fully than at question time <e> <s> however as regards his specific question concerning what the government intend to do it is not so much for governments but for industries to galvanise themselves to improve their export situation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are continually offered the advice of forecasters and select committees <e> <s> very often those forecasts are wrong <e> <s> sometimes of course they are right <e> <s> the government take all those factors into account <e> <s> as to interest rates companies are now in a far stronger financial position than they have been for a long time <e> <s> i must point out that a per cent <e> <s> increase in interest rates even if sustained for a full year increases industrys costs

not the case <e> <s> there is a review dealing with the statistical office which will involve a transfer to the cso of statistics work in the dti and the department of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords

noble lord does not affect any contract that the creditor may have with those to whom he lends money or with the company <e> <s> secondly the noble lord asked for more justification for not accepting the amendment <e> <s> ultimately the prior notice will negate the whole purpose of the reform in that it will delay the procedure <e> <s> one of the aims is to make procedures quicker and more efficient for companies <e>", "<cs> surely it is for the person who has lent the money to decide on what conditions he will do so <e> <s> if he says that he must have a copy of all written resolutions which arise that is fair enough <e> <s> however that is his decision and not one which needs to be set down in law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord spoke of a member of the company lending money <e> <s> if he were a company member he would have received the resolution in the first place <e> <s> if he did not wish to agree to it he would not need to do so <e> <s> again that would be a decision entirely for him <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that there is any problem with the existing wording of the government amendment and i think that the noble lords amendment could only cause confusion <e>", "<cs> again we feel that these words are a wholly unnecessary addition to the bill <e> <s> the first part of new section a sets out the effect of what a resolution in this form is to have <e> <s> the second part defines the form of the resolution which is to have that effect <e> <s> the resolution is one <e>", "<cs> with leave perhaps i can briefly say that directors are not entitled to act on the basis of the resolution unless they know that all relevant signatures have been obtained and neither is anyone else allowed to act on that resolution <e> <s> people do not take commercial decisions on the basis of pure rumour <e>", "<cs> with great respect how does that differ from the present situation where a resolution has to be circulated well in advance <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord understands exactly what we are trying to do here which as i said earlier is to make it easier and more efficient for companies to run their internal affairs <e> <s> the provision is perfectly clear and we do not believe that the amendment is necessary <e>", "<cs> i should just like to make a very brief point <e> <s> it is most kind of the noble lord to bring these points to the attention of the government and we try to discuss them in a fair manner <e> <s> later on we shall reach amendments with which the government will agree <e> <s> however this amendment does not seem to add very much to the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams of elvel has obviously put an enormous amount of thought and work into bringing forward these amendments <e> <s> again it is no disrespect to the noble lord that the government do not see them as being entirely necessary <e> <s> i am afraid that the same has to be said for this amendment <e>", "<cs> it is not a great burden but the very fact that it is an unnecessary burden surely must be enough to accept that we do not need it <e> <s> it is important that the member is made fully aware of what the resolution says <e> <s> that is already achieved by the requirement in this subsection that the document accurately states the terms of the resolution <e> <s> that is what counts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilgerran is beating the government over the head about being out of touch with reality but i am not sure what practical realities the noble lord has in mind that the government have not already addressed <e>", "<cs> if both documents accurately state the terms of the resolution once a shareholder has agreed to it presumably there would be no reason for him to want to withdraw that agreement <e> <s> likewise in the existing situation of a meeting once a vote is taken the matter is decided <e> <s> there is no question of a shareholder saying sorry i did not mean to do that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord williams gives an example that he says is indicative of the real world <e> <s> i am not sure that that is entirely true <e> <s> the example suggested by the noble lord would not in any way affect the original government amendment <e>", "<cs> it is apparent from new section a that a proposed resolution does not become a resolution until it is signed by or on behalf of all the relevant members <e> <s> it seems to us unsatisfactory to enact that such a resolution be dated prior to its fulfilling the conditions of being such a resolution <e> <s> that is what the amendment states <e> <s> i know that the noble lord says that it is simply a probing amendment <e> <s> given the examples mentioned by the noble lord lord williams of elvel perhaps i may briefly explain <e> <s> if a shareholder has moved or cannot be reached in order to sign the document then the resolution cannot take effect <e> <s> it can only do so when all the relevant members have signed the document <e>", "<cs> so long as the resolution was not signed by the attorney before the power of attorney was revoked then he will retain his right as being the original shareholder and without the power of attorney <e> <s> if it were signed first of all then the original power of attorney would remain <e>", "<cs> whatever happens if one member does not sign the resolution then it cannot be carried <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the situation is that once a shareholder has signed the resolution whether through the power of attorney or not then he has committed himself to the resolution <e> <s> it needs just one shareholder not to agree to it <e> <s> in those circumstances the resolution simply does not occur <e> <s> as the noble lord said it is <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose this amendment <e> <s> first it would leave the law unclear as to whether a company is to be able to act by unanimous written resolution even if its memorandum or articles forbid it <e> <s> secondly i believe we should allow the unanimous agreement of the members to override any contrary provision in the memorandum or articles <e> <s> if we make no provision then the courts would have no clear indication as to whether section a is to have effect notwithstanding any provisions of the companys memorandum or articles <e> <s> the courts would have to balance the statutory freedom granted by the new section to act in this way against any contrary private law restrictions of the companys <e> <s> this is a question which we ought to decide and then give a clear indication to the courts as to our intentions <e> <s> i think this subsection decides the question in the right direction <e>", "<cs> i have two objections to leaving it to the members to delete the provisions in the articles or the memorandum and relying on them to do so <e> <s> this new procedure is about doing away with bureaucracy <e> <s> given the evident views of the members of the company altering the memorandum and the articles would be an unnecessary formality <e> <s> we have to bear in mind the kind of companies that this reform is particularly designed to help <e> <s> the owners of small private companies may not appreciate that there are provisions in the articles or memorandum which will need altering if their unanimous and written resolutions under this new procedure are to be effective <e> <s> they may not have ready access to good legal advice <e> <s> we should remove this trap for them and the requirement for unanimity is a more than adequate safeguard <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first make a general point concerning the remarks of the noble lord lord williams before he withdrew the previous amendment <e> <s> of course we listen and continue to look at all the words which noble lords have spoken in the course of the debate <e> <s> the process of examining legislation we put forward does not change because we happen to approve an amendment now <e>", "<cs> in answer to the question as to who decides what auditors are or what auditors are not it is for auditors themselves to decide whether they are affected as auditors <e> <s> after all they are in the best position to do so <e>", "<cs> the words auditors as auditors are taken from section <e> <s> there is nothing new in them <e> <s> auditors have experience of their duties <e> <s> the auditors decision is subject to test in the court <e>", "<cs> i think that we are widening the discussion <e> <s> i am keen to bring it back to the amendment <e> <s> if the auditors object to the written resolution the company can put the resolution to a meeting under the existing procedure <e> <s> the point about written resolutions is that they go to the auditors in the first place for the auditors to decide whether anything needs to be done <e>", "<cs> i do not see how that follows <e>", "<cs> no they do not have previous notice <e> <s> they receive the resolution at the start of the procedure for all the members of the company to receive the resolution <e> <s> it is not prior notice <e>", "<cs> the auditors can state their objections in a number of ways almost in any way they want <e> <s> the noble lord used the examples of by telephone or by letter or by inclusion in a resolution <e> <s> i think i am correct in saying that it can be in any form which the auditors find appropriate <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment is that even if the auditors do not consider that the resolution concerns them as auditors or that it does not need to be considered in the relevant meeting nevertheless the resolution will not have effect until the period of seven days from the day the auditors receive the resolution expires <e> <s> that is because the new section c provides that a written resolution shall not have effect unless the period for giving a notice under subsection expires without any notice having been given in accordance with <e>", "<cs> the reason for the requirement that a record of the signatures be kept is that it should provide some check against fraud <e> <s> under the <e>", "<cs> the point is that there is a requirement to maintain the signatures in the book <e>", "<cs> yes it is a record of the members who signed the resolution <e>", "<cs> no it does not <e> <s> the way the provision is worded is as follows <e>", "<cs> i hope that we have not frightened off the noble baroness lady phillips so that she leaves <e> <s> i enjoyed her intervention <e> <s> i do not believe that she is breaking the law in any way so far but she should perhaps not take my word for it <e> <s> the matter is complicated <e> <s> perhaps i may now bring in my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> as i have already said with these amendments we are rying to make life easier for companies and auditors <e> <s> the amendments tabled by the opposition raise complexities which the government do not feel exist <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> i thank my noble friends who have spoken <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend lord peyton was here at the start of the recommittal proceedings minutes ago but i said that the proposals had come from the institute of directors which had spent an enormous amount of time consulting various companies so as to make the procedures relating to small private companies far easier and less complicated than they have been <e> <s> i believe that we have done that <e> <s> if we have spent some time discussing the proposals it is purely to ensure that all noble lords taking part in the committee understand what we are trying to do <e> <s> i hope that i have been able to do that <e> <s> i have explained my reservations about the amendment <e> <s> we shall obviously read what the noble lord has said but at the moment i do not mean to change what i have said <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is trying to make this more complicated than it is <e> <s> the purpose of the provision is to remove possible doubts about the status of the record of resolutions and signatures <e> <s> a record purporting to be signed by a director or by the company secretary is to be evidence of the proceedings in agreeing to the resolution <e> <s> but it is only evidence <e> <s> it can of course be shown that the record is false <e>", "<cs> our purpose in excluding these resolutions from the general permissive power for the company to decide matters by unanimous written resolution was to ensure certain safeguards for shareholders <e>", "<cs> it is accepted that there is some overlap between these provisions <e> <s> however we regard a decision by a company to remove its auditors before the expiry of the term of office to be such an important step that it is not appropriate for it to be done by a written resolution <e> <s> that is the message of this provision <e> <s> it should not lie with the auditor himself to decide whether a meeting should be held though in most cases he could have required one under section c <e>", "<cs> the drafting of part ii of the new schedule does not work unless a written resolution is to include a resolution proposed to be agreed to in accordance with the new section a <e>", "<cs> i shall go a little further by explaining why this particular wording has been adopted <e> <s> it was not necessary that this approach was adopted but the draftsman found it convenient to do so <e> <s> this definition applies only to part ii of the schedule <e> <s> as i said it simplifies the drafting of the schedule <e>", "<cs> that question was one that had previously escaped me <e> <s> in looking at my notes perhaps i should say that when a draft is proposed it is not a draft which in itself may be proposed as the ultimate wording <e> <s> a draft is a draft and a firm proposal is a firm proposal <e> <s> so i am not sure that the question of the noble lord arises because i think there is confusion here between what a final resolution is and whether or not there can be a draft resolution <e> <s> a draft resolution is of course not a final resolution <e> <s> the final resolution would go out to each of the members <e>", "<cs> provided the draft is ultimately proposed that is fair enough <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord just said this is a mere question of drafting <e> <s> but we prefer to include in the bill the words that the noble lord would have omitted <e> <s> they paint the full picture and establish beyond doubt that it is the requirements in new section a which govern who is to sign the resolution and thus who is a relevant member <e>", "<cs> no not at all <e> <s> their inclusion is simply to make things clearer <e> <s> the schedule states that certain persons are not to be regarded as being entitled to attend to vote at meetings therefore they are not to sign <e> <s> if the suggestion is that the reference should be to that section and this schedule the provisions of the schedule the noble lord mentioned such as those of paragraph would operate by way of adaptation of new section a <e> <s> therefore it is only necessary for paragraph g to refer to that section <e> <s> i hope that has made the matter clearer <e>", "<cs> at last i am happy to accept this correction to the short title for section <e> <s> i am grateful to the committee for spotting the error <e>", "<cs> there is no need to require that the appropriate statement or documents are sent to a relevant member before the time at which the resolution is supplied to him for signature <e> <s> in the case of a resolution dealt with at a meeting there is a fixed occasion at which a member has to cast his vote so it has been thought necessary to provide for a period of notice to give him time to consider all the relevant information <e> <s> however in the case of the unanimous written resolution procedure under section a there is no set time by which the member must decide one way or the other <e> <s> perhaps at this point i should say that with the permission of the committee i am speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> c c c and c <e> <s> i hope that that will be in order <e>", "<cs> i believe i am right in thinking that we shall discuss service contracts and directors on amendment no <e> <s> c but that does not matter at the moment <e>", "<cs> the essential point to make here is that there is no need to provide for notice of a resolution under that provision <e> <s> if the shareholder is not happy he need not sign <e> <s> he can take as long as he likes to make up his mind and can ultimately consult his legal advisers <e> <s> the main point is that nobody has to sign a resolution whether it affects directors contracts or anything of greater importance <e> <s> it does not need to be agreed <e>", "<cs> i presume that this change is intended to have no substantive effect <e> <s> although i understand the noble lords concern that the offence and penalty are set out on the face of the provision rather than by reference i would not favour this amendment <e> <s> it is important to recognise that the substantive provision is section <e> <s> this paragraph is just concerned with adapting that section to the circumstances of the unanimous written resolution <e> <s> in the circumstances it is quite right that the penalties and offence are applied by reference to the relevant subsection <e> <s> that is the normal way of applying provisions like this and it is adopted throughout this schedule <e>", "<cs> i understand from what the noble lord lord williams has said that his intention is that each relevant member must receive an individual copy of the appropriate documents <e> <s> i can see no reason why we should insist on that <e> <s> the important thing is that the appropriate documents are supplied to the relevant member and that is provided by the text of the government amendment <e> <s> i imagine that in most instances the company will supply individual copies of the documents but i can also see that in a small closely-knit company it might on occasion be convenient for the company to pass round the documents attached to the resolution which the members sign <e> <s> i do not think we ought to lay down too precise and bureaucratic a procedure for the circulation of the documents <e>", "<cs> with permission i too should like to speak to this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> c <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord says but for example in a case where unanimity not a majority is required it is not a question of an interested partys vote swaying the decision <e> <s> therefore it does not matter if an interested party has a vote <e> <s> however i think that one needs to consider two points <e> <s> first since inevitably the <e>", "<cs> on the point of a general meeting i believe it is right that any shareholder can vote whether or not he has an interest <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> yes i believe that in principle that is correct <e>", "<cs> in the provisions in this schedule we have simply been adapting provisions in the companies bill which deal with resolutions in a meeting to the particular circumstances of the unanimous written resolution procedure <e> <s> in the case of sections and of the companies act there are provisions which render ineffective resolutions passed in reliance on the exercise of voting rights <e>", "<cs> i apologise if i skipped past the relevant sections a little too quickly <e> <s> i mentioned sections and of the companies act <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the noble lord that they are provisions that render ineffective resolutions passed in reliance on the exercise of voting rights by a member holding shares to which the resolution relates <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel has modelled his amendment on the adaptations that we have made to the procedures in those sections <e> <s> however in the case of the subject of his amendment a resolution approving a contract of employment of more than five years for a director there is no analogous provision in the underlying law <e> <s> section does not render ineffective resolutions passed by the exercise of voting rights held by interested directors <e> <s> i suggest that it would be unhappy to enact that <e>", "<cs> it is very kind of the noble lord lord lloyd to speak in that way <e> <s> certainly he normally gives me notice of a difficult question but occasionally he asks difficult questions to which i do not have the answers immediately to hand <e> <s> perhaps i may explain what i meant in the case of sections and <e>", "<cs> the relevance is that we adopted section in paragraph <e> <s> to say that more fully in sections and there are provisions which render ineffective resolutions placed in reliance on voting rights by a member holding shares to which the resolution relates <e> <s> we have adapted these in earlier parts of the schedule concerning the written resolution procedure <e> <s> there is an equivalent power to adopt in section <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may for a moment or two pre-empt both members of the committee who wish to speak <e> <s> i am sorry about this confusion <e> <s> if one turns to paragraphs and of the amendment i believe that one will see that the situation is self-explanatory <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord williams for clarifying what i had originally been trying to say earlier <e> <s> he put it very well <e> <s> with regard to his second point if there is widespread concern in the committee about the position of interested directors and i feel that probably there is such concern i should be prepared to examine without commitment the case for amending section itself <e>", "<cs> i hope that i shall be able to alleviate the concern of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> i have already explained that new section a permits private companies to elect to alter the statutory maximum duration of an authority to allot shares from five years to a longer fixed period or an indefinite period <e> <s> this section has been included in the package because it is a measure which affects only the internal procedures of a company <e>", "<cs> i wished to remind the noble lord that to get into the elective regime is still a unanimous procedure <e> <s> therefore all shareholders must agree to the proposal that there need not be annual general meetings <e>", "<cs> i do not want to speak at too great length <e> <s> this is clearly an important point concerning annual general meetings <e> <s> new section a introduced by the clause permits an election by private companies to dispense with the holding of an agm <e> <s> the government believe that this new provision will relieve many small companies of an unnecessary burden and the proposal has been widely welcomed <e> <s> careful consideration has been given so as to ensure that there are other means to deal with the business previously conducted at agms and also safeguards to permit any individual member to call for an agm to be held in any particular year <e> <s> that covers the point that the noble lord raised i point him to new section a <e> <s> similarly if auditors are concerned that there is reason to call an agm they will have power to do so <e>", "<cs> there is no need for notice to be given for an annual general meeting which is not to take place <e> <s> where the matters that would normally be dealt with by an annual general meeting are already being dealt with by a written resolution as we already discussed earlier i believe that the noble lord perhaps was not in the chamber when we discussed it there is no need for prior notice <e>", "<cs> being a great deregulator there is a temptation to agree with what the noble lord proposes in his amendment <e> <s> however it might be helpful if i were to explain some of the background to this proposal <e> <s> the original suggestion from the institute of directors was that the proportion of members required to consent to the calling of a shareholders meeting at short notice should be reduced from per cent <e> <s> to a lower figure <e> <s> the institute did not specify the figure <e> <s> in the public consultation exercise the government proposed that the proportion required should still be a substantial majority and suggested per cent <e> <s> however several of the bodies consulted felt that per cent <e> <s> was too low per cent <e> <s> is therefore the proposed compromise figure <e> <s> i believe that it was proposed by the law society <e> <s> we are therefore talking of companies moving by unanimous vote let us remember from a situation where one shareholder in nineteen can unaided block a proposal to hold a meeting at short notice to one where one shareholder in nine can do so unaided <e> <s> given the safeguards surrounding the whole regime i do not consider that to be unreasonable <e> <s> that is why the government chose per cent <e>", "<cs> i could perhaps answer that in the shape of a question to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> does he feel that it is important that whatever figure is chosen it should reflect a majority of the shares <e>", "<cs> if it is the wish of the committee we shall be happy to look again at this figure <e> <s> but the government feel that it is important that there should be a majority of members of companies in favour <e> <s> a reduction would open up the possibility of ordinary resolutions being passed at meetings called at short notice in circumstances where proper notice had not been given permitting further attendance and where a simple majority in favour would not have been obtainable <e> <s> given that i hope that noble lords will be able to withdraw their amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot say exactly why the bodies consulted considered it to be too low <e> <s> i am not sure of their reasoning <e> <s> however i shall look into the matter to see whether the government believe their suggestions to be fully justified <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak to the same amendments as the noble lord <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be that two additional conditions are required before an elective resolution becomes effective <e> <s> the first is that the resolution be recommended by the board of directors <e> <s> in the type of small owner-managed company for whom the new clauses are intended to benefit in many instances the board of directors may also be all or virtually all of the members <e> <s> we therefore consider that in many cases the condition will be an unnecessary complication <e>", "<cs> let us suppose that there was an instance where the shareholders of a company wanted to act in a particular way but it would be feasible for the board of directors not to agree <e> <s> i believe that it would be wrong if under the amendment the board of directors was able to stop the resolution coming forward <e> <s> i am sure that basically the noble lord lord lloyd agrees with me <e>", "<cs> it does not create a great problem for the government but for the reasons which the noble lord pointed out it is unnecessary <e> <s> i can add no more to what i have already said <e> <s> we are creating a situation in which shareholders ultimately have the power <e> <s> there is no requirement for the board of directors to agree a resolution <e> <s> directors are entrusted with the conduct of companies because shareholders cannot do everything themselves <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams spoke of normality but i do not think that the amendment necessarily deals with that <e> <s> in an extraordinary situation where shareholders may be unanimous why should the board of directors have a veto on that unanimity <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord peyton for that intervention and for giving me the opportunity to clarify the point he raised <e> <s> what he said was correct <e> <s> the regulations in subsection are governed by subsection <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if the noble lord lord tordoff feels that that is the case <e> <s> that is not my reading of it <e> <s> subsection is governed by subsection <e> <s> the power is not to amend the whole regime or act only to add to those parts of the act to which the regime itself applies <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at the clause again to see whether it needs any clarification but my noble friend lord peyton seemed to understand it as did i i shall certainly look at ways of clarifying exactly what it is we are trying to do but at present my feeling is that the clause is clear and no amendment is needed <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord williams is interesting <e> <s> he has obviously put a great deal of hard work into its drafting <e> <s> however i do not think that it will come as any surprise to the noble lord if i tell him that we shall not accept it <e> <s> perhaps i may also say to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran who in his opening remarks referred to the governments view of this type of amendment as discussed in committee that fortunately the noble lord lord williams withdrew his amendment before the government had an opportunity to respond <e> <s> nevertheless he is quite correct as to the general gist of how we would have responded <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i was surprised at the tone of the noble lord lord williams who i felt was being rather self-righteous <e> <s> as my noble friend lord onslow pointed out the bringing forward of the amendment is a result or the considerable hard work that he put into it rather than that of the noble lord lord williams <e> <s> he accused the government of dragging their heels with a certain amount of pride <e> <s> he made it sound as though we were being dragged forward kicking and squealing to the dispatch box on a whole range of proposals which he believes we should enact <e>", "<cs> that all happened before i became involved <e> <s> the noble lord asked whether we would consult him in advance about any further amendmends to table g yes our proposals for the form of the amendment have already been discussed <e> <s> when we have a text available for further consultation a copy will be sent to the noble lord <e> <s> we shall be more than happy to discuss it further if he so wishes and likewise with the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran who i know is equally interested <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e> <s> i completely misunderstood what my noble friend said <e> <s> he has clarified the point <e> <s> perhaps i should say no more on that matter except to refer the noble lord lord tordoff to what my noble friend just said <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure what point the noble lord was trying to make <e> <s> he asked why we should allow some companies to retain the seal <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> the amendment is quite plain <e> <s> it is an abolition there is no need to have a common seal <e> <s> maybe i am being very stupid i do not understand what the noble lord is trying to say <e> <s> there is no requirement to have a company seal therefore companies can cease to use one unless they particularly want to <e>", "<cs> it is just that we allow people to make a choice <e> <s> some people are very fond of their seals and may feel it is part of their tradition <e> <s> there is no good reason for taking seals right out of the legislation <e> <s> all we are doing is to allow companies that do not wish to use them any more not to do so <e>", "<cs> generally speaking that is absolutely correct except that i should point out that the situation is slightly different in scotland where the seal is not being abolished yet <e>", "<cs> the government do not see that the problem arises at all <e> <s> it does not seem to be a significant part of any difficulties arising out of the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said in my opening remarks and perhaps this is the cause of the confusion where the seal would have been used the document must be signed now by a director and the secretary <e>", "<cs> the director and the secretary are authorised to do so by virtue of this bill <e> <s> the new section a is a complete protection for third parties <e> <s> third parties have no need to inspect the articles <e> <s> provided the new formulations are satisfied the document will be properly executed <e>", "<cs> there are several reasons why the government intend that documents executed as if they were under seal should be signed by a director and the secretary <e> <s> the first is that in section of the companies act a private company need only have one director whereas every company is required by section to have a company secretary who is distinct from the directors <e> <s> in many companies the secretary is also the companys legal adviser and is often entrusted with the company seal <e> <s> but the essential point is that the requirement to have a signature by a director and the company secretary is the only way of ensuring two signatures and for this reason i hope that the noble lord will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have listened with considerable interest to the points made by the noble lord lord hacking and those other members of the committee with an interest in this subject <e>", "<cs> no i am not giving a commitment <e> <s> i am simply saying that we shall consider the matter further having regard to the discussion that has taken place today in this recommitment <e>", "<cs> since the noble lord lord williams has asked me so directly and so nicely perhaps i can say no we do not guarantee to bring forward an amendment at the next stage in this house but we will look at the situation very sympathetically <e> <s> it is likely that we will be able to bring forward an amendment in another place when the bill goes there <e> <s> but we cannot at this moment make an unconditional commitment to take it any further <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to all who have taken part in this brief debate particularly my noble friends lord marshall of leeds and lord mottistone <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the thanks of my noble friend lord mottistone for our amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> however the government sometimes ease the path of industry to make sure that it can do what it says it can do <e>", "<cs> as i indicated when the noble lord moved a very similar amendment in the earlier stage of the committee the government are not convinced that the present legal arrangements regarding notice for meetings and their conduct are inadequate or should be subject to more detailed regulation <e> <s> in particular it should be borne in mind that on occasion there may well be pressing and valid reasons for holding a meeting on a date which would be proscribed by this amendment <e>", "<cs> i can add not a great deal to what i said to the noble lord in the course of the committee stage debate on this bill when he moved a similar amendment which would have imposed this obligation on all public companies as opposed to the more limited number exceeding the threshold which he has specified in the present amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that interjection <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel asked whether the government are fully committed to shareholder democracy <e> <s> of course they are <e> <s> we can see that by the massive increase in the number of shareholders of all types over the past years <e>", "<cs> the government genuinely support all companies which wish to send shareholders reply-paid proxy forms <e> <s> but we shall not legislate for that because it must be a matter for the internal management of the company <e> <s> if the company wishes to encourage more shareholders by providing reply-paid forms as the noble lord lord lloyd believes theycan that is a decision for the company <e> <s> the government have made a commitment to a shareholder democracy by privatising certain companies and running the economy in a certain way during the past years <e> <s> that is their commitment to shareholder democracy <e> <s> i am not convinced that reply-paid proxy forms is a further commitment to shareholder democracy <e>", "<cs> i undertook at an earlier stage of the committee to consider and consult further on the amendment then moved by the noble baroness and the noble lord lord peston that proxies should be permitted to speak at meetings of public companies as well as those of private ones <e> <s> i believe that at the time i indicated a certain amount of sympathy with what the noble baroness was saying <e> <s> perhaps i have become less sympathetic since then <e> <s> i shall try to explain why by answering at some length <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene very briefly <e> <s> we did not have a great deal of time for full consultation and therefore the department did not contact the full consultation list <e> <s> however we contacted of the more important of the representative bodies and organisations as well as womens groups with an interest in promoting the involvement of women in business <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not that answers the noble baronesss question fully but we did our best in the time allowed <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that it would be entirely apt to add customers to the persons whose interests an auditor must bear in mind when considering whether the circumstances of his ceasing to hold office as auditor should be brought to their attention <e> <s> auditors are not normally regarded as having a duty to customers of a company <e> <s> of course many customers of a company will be creditors of it as a result of their dealings with it and the existing provisions will ensure that the auditor will consider them when deciding whether to make a statement <e>", "<cs> no doubt <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i have much to add to what i have already said <e> <s> the government do not agree with the noble lords point of view <e> <s> we have stated from where we started and what we are doing with the clause <e>", "<cs> auditors may have interests in many things but they do not need to be added to the statutory duty <e> <s> matters of general interest will often be of interest to creditors <e> <s> i believe that i have said enough now <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am always eager to please the noble lord <e> <s> i shall do as he suggests <e>", "<cs> i am faintly astonished by the comments of the noble lords who have just spoken <e> <s> i thought that they would probably welcome the proposal as protecting those who might have been injured or have contracted a disease which has taken a long time to become apparent <e>", "<cs> that is true but the administrative changes or problems will be sorted out in <e>", "<cs> the example i used was that of an employee contracting a disease which perhaps had not made itself apparent <e> <s> i must say that i am not entirely sure why a period of years has been chosen but that seems to be a reasonable length of time and i find it totally acceptable <e>", "<cs> sometimes we have to allow for greater administrative difficulties in order to make something slightly more humanitarian <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord mottistone for his words <e> <s> i sincerely hope that he will not press his amendment <e> <s> i will take a great deal of note of what he has said in support of it <e> <s> he might be reassured to know and i sincerely hope he is that we are continuing to discuss the topic of notice with the law society both in relation to new section in part iv of the bill and to clause <e> <s> i shall ensure that his concerns are considered in the context of those discussions <e> <s> this is a very complex area of law and we are fully aware of the need to get it right <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will seek to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> we are all indebted to the noble lord lord hacking for dealing both clearly and much more briefly than he might have done with the complexities of a case that not only continues to provoke articles in the learned journals but to exercise the minds of lawyers advising companies <e> <s> i shall try to be similarly clear and brief <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has suggested that the amendments are needed because the existing definition of a subsidiary does not provide for the case where one company has the right to appoint half the board of directors of another company including the chairman who has a casting vote in the event of a tied vote <e> <s> we agree that one company should be a subsidiary of another in such circumstances since this gives effective control <e> <s> however we believe that the bill as drafted already achieves this end and i shall go on to describe how <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the words spoken <e> <s> in fact it was not until this amendment was tabled for the committee stage debate that the government were even aware that there was any concern about this issue <e> <s> since then we have looked at the different categories of payments which are made to shareholders by companies and if one leaves aside the question of dividends most occasions which lead to funds accruing to the account of shareholders seem likely to be the subject of resolutions at general meeting when shareholders would have a chance to consider this aspect of any proposals and vote on them accordingly <e> <s> therere also general safeguards in section of the companies act which enable a member of a company to apply to the court for an order on the grounds that the companys action is unfairly prejudicial to some of the members <e> <s> the government are accordingly doubtful as to whether it is appropriate to initiate legislation in this area particularly as it has not been established that there is any real problem concerning abuse of sums retained by companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further

inflation over the last few years and that the government have to compete for prime television time <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with what the noble lord said <e> <s> although i do not have the

carried out by <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree entirely <e> <s> the comparison between local authorities and central government is totally unjustified <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> it is important for people to know what is done by their water boards <e> <s> secondly because the boards will belong to their shareholders it will be for them to decide the future policy of advertising <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that is entirely correct <e> <s> we are talking about public information <e>", "<cs> my lords many millions of pounds are being spent on health and education <e> <s> i believe that it is important for people o know what is happening in individual government departments <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> we shall not return to this bill before eight oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that both noble lords generally welcome the amendments <e> <s> i know that they understand the reason why it has been necessary to bring back so many at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can briefly say that it is necessary for the order-making powers to be widely drawn precisely because of the complexity to which i have referred and the wide variety of markets and procedures for which it may be necessary to cater <e> <s> however i draw attention to the importance of clause in this connection <e> <s> that makes clear the purpose of the part <e> <s> we consider that the regulation-making powers are constrained by that purpose <e> <s> if they were used for any other purpose their exercise might be successfully challenged <e> <s> that is an important safeguard which i believe should meet any concerns about the apparently broad scope of some of the powers and i hope that noble lords will agree <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> m introduces a new clause in effect similar to clauses and which are deleted by amendments nos <e> <s> m and m <e> <s> the new clause imposes a duty on any person who has control of any assets or documents relating to a defaulter to give such assistance as it may reasonably require to a recognised investment exchange or recognised clearing house <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an interesting point <e> <s> the clause is intended to deal with systems dealing wholly or predominantly with transactions in markets which it is appropriate for the bank of england to supervise <e> <s> it may be desirable to make this plainer in the clause itself <e> <s> the government will consider bringing forward an amendment to this effect <e> <s> in principle it is right that any system operated by the bank should be subject to the same regime as an equivalent system operated by an institution on its list <e> <s> i believe that i have said enough on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that at present there is no actual system but there may be one in the future <e> <s> the criteria will be set by the bank and approved by the treasury <e> <s> as regards the specific question the government are considering bringing forward an amendment to make matters clearer <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i thought that i had made myself quite plain <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord because i thought we had been going so well so far <e> <s> i maintain that the government are considering further amendments and will look at this matter again in the light of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we shall see what can be done <e> <s> however i must make it plain that there will be no amendment to define the criteria themselves <e> <s> it may be made plainer in the clause itself where the clause is intended to deal with systems relating wholly to transactions in markets which it is appropriate for the bank of england to supervise <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i was unaware that i had not answered a question yesterday <e> <s> perhaps i may give the noble lord a more specific answer now <e> <s> he asked whether the government intended to bring forward a new amendment in respect of the criteria for admitting settlement arrangements to the list <e> <s> the clause provides for the bank of england to draw up those criteria subject to approval by the treasury <e> <s> that approach is similar to that in section of the financial services act which concerns the wholesale money markets <e> <s> those are the markets with which the clause is primarily concerned <e> <s> they are supervised by the bank <e> <s> we do not propose to amend that approach to set any criteria <e> <s> however the clause will apply only if the secretary of state exercises his discretion to make regulations <e> <s> we are contemplating an amendment on how he might exercise his discretion so that he would have regard to whether it was appropriate that the bank would supervise settlement arrrangements in the market concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may say why the criteria cannot in fact be specified in the bill <e> <s> it is because the clause is concerned with systems which do not yet exist <e> <s> i think it is important to get this point across <e> <s> we do not know what systems may be devised in the future and it is therefore not possible to specify at this stage what criteria will be appropriate <e> <s> however the grey book the regulation of the wholesale markets in sterling foreign exchange and bullion sets out the criteria for admitting institutions to the list kept under section of the financial services act <e> <s> to the extent that a system is concerned with the wholesale money markets the grey book gives some indication of the ground the system would cover <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> m is grouped with amendment no <e> <s> m so yes i am speaking to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am sorry that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran is not here <e> <s> however the noble lord lord tordoff explained his intentions admirably <e> <s> i hope that he did not misunderstand what i said <e> <s> i think i made it clear that the point is that it is preferable that we should have a discretionary power <e> <s> in much of this part of the bill flexibility is required <e> <s> that is why we have created the amendment in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very nice to see the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in his place <e> <s> i hope that he will not regret missing a day off but i am sure there will be plenty of other opportunities <e>", "<cs> my lords consultation is still taking place <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see whether or not we are able to bring forward any amendments at third reading but it appears unlikely that we shall be able to do so <e> <s> however we shall make every effort as we have done with so many other amendments to bring them forward to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords professor robert jacks report to which reference has been made contains recommendations covering a broad range of issues concerning banking law and practice

after consultation <e> <s> if it becomes clear that legislation is desirable we would seek the earliest opportunity to introduce such measures <e> <s> in a more general sense i believe that it would be quite wrong to reach conclusions on an issue on which consultation has taken place before the consultation period has finished <e> <s> i know that noble lords are aware that the issue goes far wider than professor jacks review <e>", "<cs> very briefly my lords i am sure the noble lord lord hacking will understand that it is not possible to give any particular commitment that action would be taken in the context of the companies bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for the general welcome that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has given to the order <e> <s> however i

sure noble lords will join me in wishing the industry every success in its promotional activities in cannes <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion which i shall pass on to my noble friend the secretary of state <e> <s> the government always welcome further representations from the industry <e> <s> perhaps we may see whether there are specific areas which they could examine further <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that my answer was rather encouraging that the government are always keen to listen to further representations from the industry <e> <s> as i said i shall pass on the comments to my noble friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords of course my noble friend was extremely keen to go to cannes this year <e> <s> unfortunately as secretary of state he has a busy schedule and at the last moment the visit had to be cancelled <e> <s> he left for japan this morning <e> <s> he much regretted not being able to go to cannes and of course i regret that he did not ask me to go in his place <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a balance of trade surplus in the sale of films and television programmes <e> <s> i am not sure of the exact figure for film studios in operation in the country at the moment <e> <s> however one of the problems that worried the film industry in the past concerning the elstree studio is now solved <e> <s> it has been saved for future film production <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is of course quite correct about the competition at cannes <e> <s> the films chosen for competition are chosen by one man who is french <e> <s> however before that is taken the wrong way i should point out that the french also have no films in the competition <e> <s> the government have done a lot in the past to help the british film industry <e> <s> as i said in reply to an earlier supplementary question the government continue to review the policy towards films so that we may have a successful film industry <e> <s> i should also add that in the recent oscar awards british people won five oscars <e> <s> that is a notable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course philosophically quite sound when it comes to this governments ideas <e> <s> the governments main thrust over the past few years has been to ease deregulation in the industry in order to aid its expansion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords that is film tax policy which is decided by the treasury and my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> however that is certainly something that the government will continue to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that list <e> <s> there are many other titles which i am sure noble lords will have heard of such as scandal and a fish called wanda <e> <s> i am sure that the document can be found in the library and that any noble lord can look it up <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that is also a very notable achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the opportunity that the noble lord lord mason has provided for us to discuss the sale of wine by the glass <e> <s> it is always a pleasure to discuss such an agreeable beverage with your lordships <e> <s> i am only sorry that i am unable to illustrate what i have to say this evening with some practical examples <e>", "<cs> my lords the next time the noble lord orders a glass of wine he should ask about the quality and the price <e> <s> although wine sales have grown six times in the past years it is estimated that only per cent <e> <s> of wine sales are in public houses or wine bars <e> <s> a proportion of that will of course be by the bottle <e> <s> we are talking about the small proportion of total wine sales which are sold by the glass <e>", "<cs> my lords application was made under the town and country planning act to the royal borough of kensington and chelsea in december and consent was granted in october <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords first question is yes i do think that it is appropriate <e> <s> as for his second question concerning <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments record on arts funding in general is very good <e> <s> there has been an increase in real terms of per cent <e> <s> and for museums and galleries in particular an increase in real terms of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be a matter of great debate as to whether or not the advertising hoardings are more or less ugly than the scaffolding canvasing and tarpaulin that will cover the building while it is being cleaned <e> <s> the cleaning operation will take between and months and at the end of that period the advertising hoardings will come down <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that he has spoken most appropriately in pointing out that when the cleaning is over the building will look considerably better <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the cleaning work will start in the near future <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that noble lords can complain about a so-called lack of funding which i have proved is not the case and at the same time criticise a museum for using such an imaginative scheme to raise extra resources <e> <s> i believe that the trustees should be congratulated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i misled the noble lord <e> <s> i meant to say that the day-to-day running of the museum was not up to the government but up to the trustees <e>", "<cs> my lords again that is a matter for the local authority but the hoardings were erected only following extensive consultations with local residents and the police <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i simply think that the cleaning of st pauls was an entirely different matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the honour to speak for the government in support of this private members bill <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing the bill to this house so clearly and concisely and all other noble lords who took part in the debate for bringing so much expertise to it <e> <s> in particular the noble lord lord ennals brings a great deal of expertise to this debate having been a minister of state for health in the last labour government <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to listen to him <e> <s> however i think that he will admit that he raised some issues that were not directly related to this bill <e> <s> he will therefore not be surprised if i do not answer all his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of only one nationwide retailer of domestic refrigerators offering a collection and recycling service <e> <s> others are being encouraged to do the same <e> <s> however recycling services are provided by both the uk cfc manufacturers and by some refrigerator companies and these are widely used for commercial and industrial refrigerators <e> <s> the warren spring laboratory is also undertaking a study of the topic <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some technical problems in recovering cfcs from refrigeration coolant material but the government are in close contact with the electrical industry to see what further progress can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should put the problem into perspective <e> <s> it is only per cent <e> <s> of the total <e> <s> of that only per cent <e> <s> of the uk total could be easily recoverable <e> <s> the governments record on initiatives to help industiy to recover cfcs is very good <e>", "<cs> my lords the industry itself is certainly looking into the idea of better design for recovery <e> <s> at the moment there are no plans to make the matter a statutory offence <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment the industry seems to be doing very well in bringing down the level of consumption of cfcs <e> <s> at present there is therefore no general requirement for there to be a statutory offence <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e>

reduction <e> <s> we shall see what they will do in the next few months <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment there does not seem to be a great problem with commercial refrigerators <e> <s> there is a great deal of publicity within the industry about stopping the leakage of cfcs <e> <s> as i have already said we are looking closely at the situation on domestic refrigerators and discussing it with

friend has evidence to the contrary i am sure that we shall be able to look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join other noble lords in thanking the noble and learned lord lord oliver of aylmerton for his excellent introduction to the debate and in particular for the way in which he explained the deliberations of the committee <e> <s> i should also like to associate myself with the words of my noble friend lord morris when he said in his opening remarks at least i think that this was what he said that the more complicated the subject the better the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the government never speculate on future movements in interest rates but everyone has far more to fear from a resurgence of inflation than from a period of high interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords inflation is a far greater problem than high interest rates <e> <s> my information is that only one-fifth of per cent <e> <s> of all loans result in repossession <e> <s> indeed the number of repossessions between the first half of and the second half showed a reduction of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> the government regret any hardship caused to mortgage borrowers <e> <s> however as we have said inflation is a far greater problem <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a short-term phenomenon

considerably in certain areas <e> <s> retail sales have dropped since last summer <e> <s> mo has slowed down considerably and is coming within the target area <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting argument and i am sure that noble lords opposite have taken it on board <e>", "<cs> my lords all mortgage borrowers are aware that interest rates can go up as well as down <e> <s> also building societies offer certain budget plans where increases or falls only take place once a year <e>", "<cs> my lords out of a total of million loans in the period from july to december there were repossessions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well that i cannot give him that assurance <e> <s> however as regards repossession according to the building societies assocation the main causes of mortgage problems are matrimonial unemployment and financial mismanagement difficulties <e> <s> the government have been able to help with unemployment and will no doubt turn their efforts to the other two problems in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords from what i gathered of the debate yesterday in most parts of the country there are more houses than there are people to live in them <e> <s> there are certain areas where there is a substantial problem <e> <s> my noble friend lord caithness said that he was very sympathetic to that and that he was looking further into the problem as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have no plans to privatise the bank of england <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting proposal which i shall put to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e> <s> the differences between the bundesbank and the bank of england are perhaps not as great as they appear <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord would welcome the removal of ministerial accountability for the bank of england were his proposals to be put into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords that is as the noble lord suspects a completely hypothetical situation and one that is unlikely to arise in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree with the noble lord <e> <s> the bank of england works well with its existing system <e> <s> we believe that the government have a clear resoponsibility to maintain the currency and avoid inflation through their monetary policies <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in reply to an earlier question we have no plans to change the existing situation but as before i shall put those suggestions to my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that my noble friend welcomes my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is going far off the question <e> <s> i said that the existing situation of control of the bank of england works well and that the government have a clear responsibility to maintain the currency and to avoid inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords before i reach that point perhaps i could mention something else about the order which i think is relevant to the debate <e> <s> perhaps first i could say what the position would be of the exempted agreements under existing mergers legislation <e> <s> the orders we have before us will only have the effect of exempting the agreements concerned from the scrutiny under the restrictive trade practices act <e> <s> they will not prevent the application of the fair trading act provisions to mergers underlying such agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly that is quite a significant subject area which is being continually discussed by the department <e> <s> at the moment however we are dealing with this specific aspect which does not cover some of the problems that have been raised by the noble lord <e> <s> however i take his point and i shall discuss it further with the department to see whether anything needs to be done in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords to the final part of the question of the noble lord lord williams i can say yes <e> <s> the whole of the act will come into force on st august of this year <e> <s> i hope that after all the hours the noble lord spent discussing the act when it was a bill in this house he will regard that as being

office became a public corporation some years ago the governments role has been confined to broad issues of general policy and matters of overall financial control <e> <s> operational matters are rightly the responsibility of the post office board <e> <s> many of the issues raised by the noble lord will fall into this category <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my answer the post offices external financing limits already provide for a very substantial increase in investment <e> <s> it is basically investment that we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil services approach to training already largely conforms with the framework for training set out in the white paper <e> <s> this emphasises the need for sound planning investment and professionalism in the training and development of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil services record on training is extremely good and is highly regarded in training and development circles of all types <e> <s> the white paper is a framework for the national training effort and does not differentiate between government departments and other industries <e> <s> on the other point raised by the noble lord there is a great deal of cross-fertilisation in training between government departments and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords again the civil services record on employing women is very good <e> <s> there are increasing numbers of women at senior <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question the white paper relates specifically to training <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil service is active as a major employer on several of the industry lead bodies which are helping to define workplace standards of performance and has incorporated them into its training programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the question appertains purely to training in government departments <e> <s> there the governments record is extremely good with over million being spent approximately per cent <e> <s> of the pay bill <e> <s> that is in line with the best practice among employers generally <e>", "<cs> my lords of course that is why the white paper was published last year <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these two new clauses is plain the opposition are seeking to reduce the length of the existing qualifying period for a woman to exercise her rights under the main maternity provisions of the employment protection legislation <e> <s> under amendment no <e> <s> the qualifying period for claiming unfair dismissal because of pregnancy would be reduced to one month <e> <s> under amendment no <e> <s> there would be no qualifying period at all before a woman acquired the right to return to her old job after a period of maternity absence <e> <s> the present position is that for most women the qualifying period for these two rights is two years continuous service <e>", "<cs> i am sure that noble lords opposite will have listened carefully to the noble lord lord somers and will take account of his words when making a decision on this amendment <e>", "<cs> i have a great deal of sympathy with the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> i wish also to echo some of the sentiments that we have heard today from all around the chamber <e> <s> aids is undoutably a horrific tragic and sad disease <e> <s> we have had a most sensible debate <e> <s> i should like to thank all those who have contributed to it <e>", "<cs> those are two important and relevant points <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady seear i am not sure whether anyone who had been dismissed because they were suffering from aids and who went to an industrial tribunal before which it was proved that that was unlawful would necessarily want to return to that job <e>", "<cs> the aim of this amendment as i understand it is to ensure that exemptions from the sex discrimination act are kept under review and that unnecessary exemptions are removed <e> <s> this is a reasonable aim but i hope to persuade the committee that the amendment is neither necessary to achieve the aim nor effective in doing so <e>", "<cs> the government see absolutely no need for this clause <e> <s> we have already consulted fully on all the legislation repealed or amended by clauses and in our consultative document entitled <e>", "<cs> i am keen to answer that point and i shall do so in a general way <e> <s> earlier the committee spoke of the demographic changes that will occur during the next years <e> <s> that if anything will strengthen the hands of young people more than has happened over the past few decades <e> <s> young people will be in short supply <e> <s> they will not be exploited <e> <s> it will be up to them to demand what they can obtain from their employers <e> <s> the firms which will fail will be those that do not invest in training do not offer a proper career structure for their young people and do not give incentives or instil loyalty <e> <s> the noble lord lord callaghan mentioned tourism and the leisure industry as being poorly represented by trade unionists <e> <s> perhaps he believes that as a result there is a substantial amount of exploitation <e> <s> that simply is not true <e>", "<cs> it simply is not true <e> <s> in the field of tourism and leisure we have seen the largest number of new employees during the past five years <e> <s> they are not second-rate jobs <e>", "<cs> let me finish the point <e> <s> they are not second-rate jobs <e> <s> they are good-quality jobs not part-time but full-time <e> <s> they offer employment to the kind of people who require it <e> <s> the noble lord wished to intervene <e>", "<cs> perhaps between the hours of and pm the noble lord lord mccarthy will join me in the banqueting house to launch the awards for the best chef and the best waiter <e> <s> he can then ask them whether they are being exploited <e>", "<cs> throughout the field standards are continually improving <e> <s> i do not believe that that has anything to do with whether there is a trade union <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to hear that admission by the noble baroness <e> <s> i disagree with her <e> <s> i think that the health and safety commission does a very good job and will continue to maintain high standards <e>", "<cs> that is why this government introduced yts to provide first class training for those young people <e> <s> that is why we later introduced employment training and why we are introducing the training and enterprise councils <e> <s> i know that the noble baroness said that we should talk about training in the near future but there are a whole range of areas in which the government are bending over backwards to help young people to obtain good jobs and good training and to keep those jobs when they have them <e>", "<cs> there is no desire on the part of this government or myself to create more areas of exploitation among young people women immigrants or the disabled <e> <s> there is no desire by this government to see that <e> <s> however i do not see how this amendment changes what we have today <e> <s> i passionately believe that deregulation will stop exploitation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may i hope briefly before allowing the noble lord to continue respond to that criticism of the consultative document <e> <s> there were over responses to the document <e> <s> the majority of the responses recognised the need to reform the legislation restricting the hours that young people work <e> <s> the cbi said it was confident that the exercise would expand the job prospects of young people relieve employers of a tiresome administrative burden and promote greater flexibility in the arrangement of work better utilisation of staff in many manufacturing and service sectors and a reduction of unit labour costs in the britain of the future <e>", "<cs> there are obviously two clear different principles at stake here <e> <s> the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon made a case about the role of women in the mines <e> <s> he made a clear and concise case i admire him for so doing <e> <s> however that is not the issue we are discussing we are discussing the case put forward by the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> he has worked hard in an effort to prove that the government are showing themselves <e>", "<cs> women do have a choice as regards working underground there is not a shadow of doubt about that <e> <s> however we are not only talking about that kind of choice there is also the choice under the provisions of the social security act <e> <s> that is what i am dealing with at present <e>", "<cs> i cannot give that information at present <e> <s> we are discussing a general point of principle rather than a specific example <e>", "<cs> no it is not hypothetical <e> <s> as i said <e> <s> i am not certain at the moment how many women graduated with degrees in mining engineering last year <e> <s> however one of the reasons why there have been fewer graduates is because women have so far been unable to work underground <e> <s> indeed the noble baroness lady seear made the point that as from now that will be a matter of choice rather than discrimination <e>", "<cs> let us consider the hypothetical situation of a woman who is perfectly fit and capable of working underground <e> <s> there is no other conceivable job that she can fulfil above ground in other words there is no other choice open to her <e> <s> it is an extremely hypothetical example but potentially the provisions of the social security act could be put into effect in such a case <e> <s> in my view we are looking into a tiny aspect of the principles of the bill i am sure that the noble lord lord mccarthy will agree with me <e>", "<cs> the point of the legislation is to get people into jobs as quickly as possible so that they may play a full part in the growth of the economy and in the community <e> <s> we can perhaps think of a hundred different examples where there could be exceptions <e> <s> however i have listed many such exceptions <e> <s> i have said how the new legislation is expected to work <e> <s> it is not discriminatory <e> <s> it does not try to impose itself unnecessarily <e> <s> it attempts to offer jobs to people <e> <s> and they are very worthwhile jobs <e>", "<cs> there seems to be some confusion between refusing work and not actively seeking work <e> <s> i shall try to clarify that confusion <e> <s> the social security act introduced as a condition for the receipt of unemployment benefit and income support as an unemployed person a requirement to be actively seeking employment <e> <s> failure actively to seek work would lead to both benefits being disallowed although income support at a reduced rate may still be payable to those who would otherwise suffer hardship <e>", "<cs> this amendment is slightly confusing because it refers to the purposes of this act without making clear which act it means the bill itself or the factories act <e> <s> the amendment as drafted would amend clause of the bill rather than section of the factories act as i assume was intended <e> <s> the amendment is also far too draconian because it applies to the cleaning of any machinery not just dangerous machinery <e> <s> most cleaning can be undertaken in a manner which does not give rise to risk of injury at all <e>", "<cs> the purpose of amendments is to give the secretary of state power by order to remove the different treatment of males and females in certain subordinate legislation by assimilation rather than revocation <e> <s> where an order was made under that power the effect would be to retain legislation which is obsolete or in the case of the lifting provisions inconsistent with medical advice that lifting capacity varies with the individual <e> <s> it is suggested that the government should make regulations in those areas setting appropriate levels of protection for all workers after consulting the hsc <e> <s> but we have already consulted the hsc <e> <s> it tells us that it is already working on draft regulations designed to ensure safety when loads are handled manually and that it is content for the other subordinate legislation to which section a applies to be revoked <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put the answer to that point <e> <s> there was a response which i omitted to give <e> <s> the responses to the consultation about uk regulations are under consideration by the hsc <e> <s> the regulations are under consideration alongside the european directive <e> <s> therefore it is not the case that the regulations are no longer being worked upon <e> <s> they will continue to be considered <e>", "<cs> it was a pleasure to hear the remarks made by my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton concerning royal commissions <e> <s> i found them educative <e> <s> i also thank the noble lord lord rochester for his support because obviously the government are not happy to accept the amendments <e>", "<cs> the effect of this amendment would be to limit the order-making powers in clause so that they could only be used to make consequential repeals and amendments following on from subsections and in other words the power currently provided by subsection a <e> <s> however it would also build in the proviso that the health and safety commission and the equal opportunities commission must agree <e>", "<cs> we are parliament <e>", "<cs> the noble lord thinks he is on to a good thing here <e> <s> i have to disappoint him by saying that he is not <e>", "<cs> there is no requirement to have a ballot at the moment <e>", "<cs> i must object <e> <s> that kind of accident happens occasionally and it is greatly to be regretted <e> <s> however it is ridiculous to argue that the accident occurred because the young person was on yts <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause is to remove unnecessary and unjustifiable restrictions on young persons employed <e> <s> young persons are those who are over the minimum school-leaving age and under <e> <s> we are talking broadly about and year-olds plus a few who are permitted to leave school who have not reached as a result of a quirk in their birth date <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> these are the figures for <e> <s> the all-injury figures have been quoted in answer to parliamentary questions in the house of commons but the other figures of fatalities have not <e> <s> i shall certainly put them in the library as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my first reaction is one of surprise at the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> he says that i have not gone into the case sufficiently <e> <s> when i mentioned the wider issues of religious freedom and relations with the sikh community he said that that was not necessarily enough <e> <s> then the noble lord agreed with me in principle and said that this amendment was all right <e> <s> i think he agrees with what we are doing <e>", "<cs> a great deal of thought has gone into seeing whether or not the exemption should take place <e> <s> it has been decided in this specific and special case of sikhs on construction sites and construction sites only <e> <s> i made the point that there are no plans to extend the exemption further at present <e> <s> that situation remains <e>", "<cs> i can reply briefly to that request <e> <s> it is difficult to predict how many accidents the proposed regulations would prevent <e> <s> however a special analysis of head injuries undertaken by the health and safety executive over a two-year period revealed the following first there were some reported acidents causing absence from work of over three days secondly approximately per cent <e> <s> of such accidents were caused by persons being struck by an object or by materials thirdly about per cent <e> <s> of accidents were classified as serious and involving fractures concussions and internal injuries fourthly in each year one death could have been prevented by the wearing of a suitable helmet <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord wedderburn welcomes what i said at this evening if that is the right time about the new leaflet <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat what i said <e> <s> that joint advisory leaflet will outline the legal position in the light of the changes introduced by the bill <e> <s> it will contain advice on matters of good practice that employers should consider if they want to change their employees hours <e> <s> the new leaflet will be broadly similar to the leaflet <e>", "<cs> i understand fully what the noble baroness is saying <e> <s> she is correct i have neither a <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier i understand quite clearly what the noble baroness is trying to say <e> <s> however i am not sure that she has convinced me or provided sufficient evidence for me to withdraw my objections <e> <s> i am sure that we can return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> i should like to be associated with the tributes to the staff who look after us so late at night <e> <s> surely that is the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> this is a voluntary agreement with the staff <e>", "<cs> i want to come back to the case that the noble lord lord dormand made about this place <e> <s> this is a perfect instance of where voluntary arrangements are working extremely well <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn prefaced his remarks by saying that we were coming to the stage of the fairness amendments <e> <s> he may well call them that <e> <s> i think that they are the unnecessary amendments because so much of what they contain is already well provided for in existing legislation <e>", "<cs> i was glad that the noble baroness lady seear did not introduce this amendment as a fairness amendment <e> <s> i was not quite sure why i felt that but i did <e> <s> when the noble lord lord mccarthy tried to compare old age with sex and race i realised that fairness had nothing to do <e>", "<cs> no that is not the case because the important matter is that i cannot hope to be female i cannot hope to be black but i most certainly can hope at some stage to reach old age <e> <s> i have much sympathy with the intention of the noble baroness lady seear in tabling this new clause which seeks to outlaw discrimination by potential employers on the grounds of a persons age <e> <s> the government firmly believe that employers should recognise the valuable resource represented by applicants of any age <e> <s> it can clearly be wasteful for employers to refuse to consider applicants solely because they have or have not reached a certain age <e> <s> this is a message we have frequently sought to get across to employers for example in my departments recent white paper <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity to discuss with the committee the very important subject of employment opportunities for people with disabilities <e> <s> i sympathise with the motives underlying the proposed new clause <e> <s> however i do not believe that this clause would prove helpful in securing the changes which we all wish to see <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes a good point <e> <s> i do not have any figures as to whether the initiatives set up by the government have made any difference <e> <s> with the knowledge i have of the initiatives i feel that they have been greatly welcomed by people with disabilities and are working very successfully <e> <s> while i am dealing with that point perhaps i may draw attention to something said by the noble baroness lady turner about the quota scheme <e> <s> it is one of the key issues at which the review will look when we get to that <e> <s> i do not have at hand the figures wanted by the noble baroness but when i have some i shall make sure that she receives a copy <e>", "<cs> let me first clarify the reasons why we have included this clause in the bill <e> <s> it is to make a further contribution to our general policy of reducing burdens on business in particular by simplifying legislative requirements for small firms <e> <s> the legislation currently provides for most employees to be given a written statement of their main terms and conditions within weeks of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may begin by reminding the committee that our purpose in introducing the clause is to reduce the burdens on small firms by exempting them from the requirement to provide an additional note on any disciplinary rules <e> <s> employees in these firms will still need to be given the name of a person to whom they should apply with any grievance <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy said that this was a very minor amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester said that what the government were proposing in clause was a fundamental change <e> <s> the noble lord lord callaghan said that it was an attack on small unions <e> <s> all noble lords opposite have essentially missed the point of clause <e> <s> i agree entirely with my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> this is not an attack on the fundamental principle of paid time off for officials <e> <s> the effect of all these amendments is in one way or another to negate the effect of clause <e>", "<cs> the first of these two amendments proposes to leave out the phrase <e>", "<cs> the original concept could have been lost with the original wording of clause <e> <s> it was because of that that the orginal clause was amended by the amendments which were brought in at the report stage in the house of commons <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> proposes to leave out line of page and to insert the proposed passage <e> <s> this would require an employer to provide time off for trade union officials to receive training in relation to matters for which the union would like to be recognised or in respect of functions which they would like the employer to agree they should perform on behalf of his employees even though in fact there is no such agreement <e> <s> it would be quite inappropriate for an employer to be required to give time off for such training <e> <s> clause most appropriately gives a right to reasonable paid time off for training in aspects of industrial relations relevant to duties which are either concerned with negotiations with the employer about industrial relations matters or are concerned with the performance of functions relating to industrial relations matters which the employer has agreed the union may perform on behalf of his employees <e>", "<cs> the point is that that is an agreement between the employer and the employee <e> <s> likewise in the case of a director it is up to the director to decide in conjunction with his managing director whether he should have paid time off time off without pay or whatever he wants <e> <s> we are not taking that away from current legislation <e> <s> there is still a right to paid time off <e> <s> if the noble baroness suggests that we should do away with that right altogether and simply allow individuals to negotiate whether they should have paid time off fair enough <e> <s> but that is not what we suggest here <e> <s> therefore there is no natural analogy between a director and another employee <e>", "<cs> it seems almost extraordinary that having discussed four separate amendments over the past hour and a half members opposite still want to continue this discussion and oppose the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy has dealt with the unions for a great deal of time and naturally i understand that he feels very strongly about this matter <e> <s> however i believe that he is stretching the point and perhaps i may go through the clause yet again to explain exactly what we are doing <e>", "<cs> in moving this new clause the noble lord lord wedderburn has returned to a matter which was considered by this house during the passage of what became the employment act when a rather similar amendment was moved at that bills report stage <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lady gardner of parkes is right <e> <s> i am pleased that the noble baroness and the noble lords opposite are prepared to go some way towards meeting our objectives by proposing a qualifying period of nine months instead of the current six months <e> <s> however the government cannot support their amendment because it fails to address the primary purpose of the clause <e> <s> it is to <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord would like to tell me what else it is for <e>", "<cs> i knew it was a mistake to give way to the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> i shall come to those points in the course of the next few amendments <e> <s> i am sure he is well aware of that <e>", "<cs> it has been suggested by the law society that without a statement of the reasons for dismissal some employees will find it harder to obtain another job <e> <s> that was echoed by the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> let me underline that we are changing the statutory requirements in relation to written statements <e> <s> there is nothing to stop an employer giving such a statement to someone he dismisses despite the fact that there is no statutory entitlement <e>", "<cs> i disagree with that statement entirely <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord wedderburn we shall continue to examine exactly what is meant by the written statement and what it is used for <e> <s> noble lords opposite will contend that it is used for a whole range of things and i maintain that it is not <e>", "<cs> i do not follow that thinking <e> <s> i do not see why that should be <e> <s> currently the written notice has no legal enforcement whatever <e> <s> so why does it make any difference <e>", "<cs> we are perhaps getting away from the essence of this discussion <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear chastised me for not knowing enough about how industry works and how people are sacked <e> <s> what we are talking about is a right that was introduced by the labour government in <e> <s> it is a right that had a fundamental link between the right to go to an industrial tribunal and the provision of written reasons for dismissal so that the employee could decide whether or not there was a case <e> <s> that was all <e> <s> there was no suggestion that perhaps the manager would have some thinking time if he had to write a letter <e> <s> it was purely so that the employee could make the decision <e> <s> that is all that we are talking about now <e>", "<cs> this amendment would retain the current position whereby any change to the length of the qualifying period for the right to a written statement of reasons for dismissal has to be made by primary legislation <e> <s> there are of course arguments of speed and convenience which can be made in support of the proposal to provide for any future changes made by statutory instrument <e> <s> there is also logic in our proposal <e> <s> the secretary of state already has power to vary the qualifying period for the right to make a complaint of unfair dismissal by means of a statutory instrument subject to affirmative resolution <e> <s> he has had that power since the unfair dismissal provisions were first introduced in in the industrial relations act <e> <s> clause simply means that the long-standing arrangements for making changes to the qualifying period for claims of unfair dismissal will also apply to any necessary changes in the qualifying period for the right to a written statement <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i recognise the type of case referred to by the noble lord lord wedderburn and the law as it stands today and the way he described it <e> <s> it sounded like such an outrageous abuse that i would be more than happy to look into it further <e>", "<cs> the new clause seeks to extend the scope for lawful organisation of secondary action <e> <s> the government believe that there can be no case for such a step and the new clause is therefore unacceptable <e>", "<cs> i am sure that i shall be able to do so but perhaps the noble lord will permit me to continue <e> <s> the uk government are sure that nothing in this legislation is incompatible with the guarantees afforded by ilo convention <e> <s> the government are in the process of responding to the ilo committees report and as part of this response explain why its views may have been based on misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the relevant law and the context in which it operates <e>", "<cs> that is an entirely hypothetical situation <e> <s> we shall have to wait to see what the response of the government is <e>", "<cs> the aim of this amendment is to make a redundancy payment payable to an employee up to the age of whether or not he or she has passed the normal retiring age in his firm <e> <s> however a redundancy payment is paid to compensate an individual for the loss of a job which he or she had a reasonable expectation might continue <e> <s> when an employee reaches retiring age that expectation no longer exists so there is really no loss which falls to be compensated <e> <s> of course it would be unusual anyway for a person to be made redundant after passing retiring age <e> <s> normally such a person would have retired and left <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the aim of noble lords who oppose the question that this clause stand part <e> <s> i can see why they regard what we are doing away with and creating as a financial burden on small firms <e> <s> however i believe that that is based on a misconception <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester asked for a justification <e> <s> i sincerely hope that i shall be able to give him one <e>", "<cs> let me remind the committee of the purpose of this clause <e> <s> it enables the secretary of state to give industrial tribunal chairmen or if appropriate a full tribunal the power to conduct a prehearing review of a case and to require a party to pay a deposit of up to as a condition of proceeding further with or defending the application <e> <s> we intend that this new power should be used only where the case is thought to have little prospect of success or to be frivolous vexatious or otherwise unreasonable <e> <s> when the unfair dismissal provisions were orginally introduced the expectation was that industrial tribunals would provide a cheap speedy and informal means of resolving certain disputes in the employment field <e> <s> the tribunals have lived up to those expectations and provide a highly effective and speedy means of resolving a whole range of employment issues <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn asked about the jurisdiction aspect of the tribunal <e> <s> it will be up to the chairman of the tribunal to decide where he has jurisdiction and when a full tribunal should be asked to look at a case <e> <s> on the point about appeal yes in all cases there will be methods of appealing against any decision <e>", "<cs> i shall have to look into the methods of appeal and let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> in his opening remarks the noble lord lord rochester talked about justice <e> <s> in this clause there is no sense of perverting justice in any shape or form <e> <s> it is no good the noble lords lord mccarthy and lord wedderburn trying to pretend that there is because that is not so <e>", "<cs> i understand there are no proposals at the moment to pay interest on the deposit <e> <s> furthermore i understand that only a relatively short space of time of about three months is involved <e> <s> i have not been able to work out the interest that would be due on but perhaps i can put the argument this way <e> <s> if someone is willing to put down that sort of deposit in the first place i am sure he would not mind forfeiting what must be a relatively small amount of money over three months <e>", "<cs> i was glad to hear the noble lord lord wedderburn say that he did not expect nor even want the government to accept the amendment <e> <s> that makes my job slightly easier <e> <s> furthermore the noble lord spent a certain amount of time talking about the ilo <e> <s> we have already touched on it so i shall not repeat what i said earlier <e> <s> he also said that this country was now at the bottom of the international standard regarding employee rights <e> <s> does he not agree that if that is so one of the reasons for it might well be that in the past we have had the most powerful the most dangerous the most ugly unions of any european country over the past years <e> <s> that has led us into the severest economic decline <e>", "<cs> it is only since that has been overcome that this country has begun to perform efficiently economically <e> <s> the proposed new clause if accepted would create a gross imbalance in the law by significantly restricting employers ability to dismiss or refuse <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble lord spends any time outside his office or whether he travels up and down the country <e> <s> i have to admit that when the reign of the noble lords unions came <e>", "<cs> what about victimisation of the employer <e> <s> i think the noble baroness misunderstands that the purpose of the ballot for unions was to prove that a sufficient majority within the unions approved of the executives decision on whether or not there should be strike action <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble baroness misunderstands the situation as it exists and always has existed <e> <s> the law in this country has always enabled an employer to take various measures up to and including dismissal against any of his employees who choose to take industrial action <e> <s> we are not introducing anything new here <e>", "<cs> i have to say i was a little surprised when i saw that the noble lord would speak against this clause <e> <s> the plain answer to his question why get rid of it after all these years <e> <s> is that it is simply to remove an outdated requirement from the statute book <e> <s> raw celluloid which contains cellulose nitrate is not now commonly used in industrial processes <e> <s> it was used in the manufacture of cinematograph film but this of course is no longer the case <e> <s> the film which is manufactured today is of the non-hazardous cellulose acetate type and action is being taken to copy archive material onto this type of film <e> <s> therefore the present requirement to register is regarded as redundant <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am amazed by the interest that has been taken in this subject <e> <s> i know that it is important <e> <s> i had no idea that the noble lord had such a great interest in films <e> <s> nor did i realise that the noble lord lord mccarthy had played a part in films in the past as i understood someone to mention <e>", "<cs> i do not know what i said that may have given the noble lord that impression <e>", "<cs> in my opening remarks i said that i was speaking to all the amendments in the group <e> <s> they are amendments nos <e> <s> to and <e> <s> as i said essentially these amendments derive from a single primary purpose that is to transfer land currently held by the training commission to the secretary of state for employment on the dissolution of the commission <e> <s> there is nothing untoward or underhand about that <e>", "<cs> we believe and i think the noble baroness will agree that training in the past has not been as effective as it might have been <e> <s> we are trying something new <e> <s> we believe that industry should be more responsible for training because industry knows more about what kind of training is required and therefore will be in a better position to control the sort of training provided <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness has missed the fact that we are setting up the tecs organisations which are proving so successful <e> <s> the whole focus on employment training and yts are very genuine commitments to training for the future <e> <s> the noble baroness asks why industry has failed apparently to train people in the past <e> <s> when we reach the next group of amendments on the industrial training boards we shall no doubt be told by the noble lord lord mccarthy why they have been so successful <e> <s> perhaps at that stage i shall be able to demonstrate rather more as to what is at the back of the governments mind <e>", "<cs> i shall first speak about employment training <e> <s> et is the largest and fastest growing adult training programme ever launched in this country <e> <s> it aims to provide a flexible package of high-quality training for longer-term unemployed people which is locally planned and delivered to help them obtain and keeps jobs <e>", "<cs> this clause is an important one which provides for the dissolution of the training commission <e> <s> as the committee knows the commission was established by statute under the employment and training act and therefore can only be dissolved by primary legislation <e> <s> let me remind the committee of the reasons why we are having to go through the process of dissolution and the very sorry and unhappy role that the tuc played in bringing it about <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond briefly to the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not have at hand the information as to whether or not the figure of five per cent <e> <s> on day release has changed <e> <s> i am not at all convinced that the pure example of whether or not there is day release shows that there is effective or ineffective training in the private sector for young people <e> <s> i am not sure that the noble baroness has proved that it is not effective <e>", "<cs> it also seems to goagainst the tuc retraining document <e>", "<cs> first i shall respond to the noble baroness <e> <s> the framework that the government are working under was introduced by the white paper of last year <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness has read that <e> <s> the essential framework has three levels at which to work the local level which involves the training and enterprise programmes the industrial level which involves standards and quality monitoring and the national level which involves developing policies for priority <e> <s> that is a multi-faceted approach to training as a whole <e> <s> there is no desire for this government to allow training <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> i should have said that i was speaking also to amendments nos <e> <s> to and <e>", "<cs> i apologise for the mix-up over which amendment we had reached <e> <s> it was entirely my fault <e> <s> our approach to sector-based training organisations is to encourage where possible the creation of voluntary employer-led bodies to attract the commitment of senior management within the relevant sectors <e> <s> the government amendment is designed to assist in this process by providing for employer-led statutory boards either as a step towards employer-led voluntary arrangements or if we decide that it is appropriate any continuing statutory boards <e>", "<cs> i do not hate trade unions <e> <s> i think that there is a time and a place for everything and that trade unions provide a valuable service at the right time and in the right place <e> <s> however this is not it <e> <s> i understand exactly why the noble baroness speaks about trade unions in such glowing terms and i know that she really believes it <e> <s> however we have already tried with trade unions and it has not worked <e> <s> they have not always proved themselves to be entirely responsible <e>", "<cs> we are generally looking at that sort of proposal in a positive way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that in the areas of north dorset and east dorset district councils and poole borough council last year there were reported cases of people being bitten <e> <s> those cases were reported by their doctors <e> <s> that is obviously a tremendous number of people <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not appear to be the case <e> <s> i understand that in the early s there was a similar infestation <e> <s> the actual fly which is something like a black fly is professionally called <e>", "<cs> my lords the fly exists in scotland but does not seem to have provided the same sort of concern that it has in north dorset <e> <s> i do not know why that should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a suggestion that it should be killed by spraying with <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house will agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness opposite has tabled an amendment which closely resembles one tabled at committee stage <e> <s> as i made clear in that debate i share the general concern that employers heed the message that the workplace risks from the aids virus are negligible and there should be no discrimination <e> <s> as i said before no risk means no discrimination <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first point out that there are some technical difficulties with the amendments of the noble baroness as drafted <e> <s> as it stands the clause deals only with discrimination on the grounds of marital status <e> <s> to give favourable treatment to women returning to work after pregnancy would involve sex discrimination against men <e> <s> it would therefore be necessary to amend subsection of the clause to include a reference to section of the sex discrimination act <e> <s> moreover it is not clear whether the amendments would cover women undertaking training with a view to returning to work <e> <s> neither is it clear for how long after a pregnancy a woman would continue to be able to receive special treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a very fair point <e> <s> it is a matter that i shall consider <e> <s> perhaps i may write to the noble baroness at a later stage and let her know whether the numbers have indeed increased <e>", "<cs> my lords as with most of the oppositions amendments to date on the subject of women and mining these amendment are simply a delaying tactic which will have the effect of perpetuating unequal treatment between men and women <e> <s> there have been lengthy debates both here and in another place on the conditions below ground and whether or not they are suitable for women but they have really been quite irrelevant to the central question are there any grounds to justify treating women differently from men as regards a ban on working underground <e> <s> the answer is no <e> <s> there are no health and safety risks underground specifically affecting women and not men to justify such a ban <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is confusing two different and distinct issues <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that he is not but i believe that he is <e> <s> we are removing discrimination between the two sexes <e> <s> there does not seem to be any reason why women should not be able to work underground as successfully and as capably as men <e> <s> the home office report to which the noble lord referred deals with an entirely different issue <e> <s> it is about intimidating women <e> <s> i do not think that any woman who wished to go underground would then end up being intimidated by her working colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the debate which we have had on this subject <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady seear who said she felt that i did not have a tiny or small mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that if there is a doubt about a claimants entitlement to unemployment benefit the decision is not made by <e>", "<cs> my lords it still discriminates against men <e>", "<cs> my lords it was most encouraging to hear that the noble lord lord mccarthy listened so carefully to what i said in committee <e> <s> indeed he repeated much of what i said <e> <s> i should say to him that i also listened carefully to his remarks <e> <s> the trouble is however that i suspect i may have bored the noble lord and that he then <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to explain to your lordships why it is that we want to repeal these provisions and why we feel that there would be no benefit in the minimum one-year delay that would be required by the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand that the noble baroness is concerned and feels that there are not enough inspectors <e> <s> i do not have the information before me but i am well aware that there is an increase in the number of inspectors <e> <s> the targets over the next few years are an increase in the number <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i said that i did not have the information before me but it is up to the hse to decide how many inspectors it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to look further to find out how many factories are inspected by those inspectors <e> <s> however i believe that that argument misses the point we are trying to get at <e> <s> it does not prove anything to suggest that inspectors should visit every single factory <e> <s> obviously some factories are better than others <e> <s> some factories in certain industries need to be inspected more often than those that are not considered dangerous or which have excellent records <e> <s> the government have allocated sufficient resources to the hse to allow it to meet its targets <e> <s> the hses request for resources has been met in full <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear is quite right to say that the government sympathise with a great deal of what she said <e> <s> however i am not sure that everything that i am about to say will be music to the ears of the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> the amendment has the worthy aim of improving the skills and competence of young employees in the workplace <e> <s> however we believe that it is misguided in its approach <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is quite right <e> <s> this is a most interesting issue and needs to be fully aired and discussed <e> <s> i totally appreciate therefore the anxieties that have been expressed by noble lords opposite and by my noble friend <e> <s> i agree that employers should consider the availability of transport and welfare facilities before they employ young people at night or even on sundays <e> <s> in particular they should ensure that the working environment is safe and healthy and that there are adequate arrangements and facilities to ensure young peoples welfare <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lords sits down perhaps i may make one or two points before he decides whether to call a division <e> <s> there is a certain misconception that the government are removing all restrictions on all employers <e> <s> that is simply not the case <e> <s> the proposals concern the restrictions on young peoples hours of work in industrial undertakings and shops <e> <s> other sectors of employment such as offices have never been regulated <e> <s> there is no evidence that this has led to young people being exploited <e> <s> the noble lord does not even try to produce evidence of exploitation <e>", "<cs> my lords again we have had an interesting debate on exactly the same amendment as we discussed in committee <e> <s> perhaps we shall see it again at third reading <e> <s> it is a very important issue <e> <s> i sympathise with the intention behind this new clause <e> <s> age discrimination is unfair to individuals <e> <s> it also hurts businesses and the economy <e> <s> we cannot afford to waste the talents of older workers particularly now that the number of young entrants to the labour force is steeply declining <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the government will read carefully what the noble lord has said and they may make some changes in the future <e> <s> the issue is about means and not ends <e> <s> in the case of race and gender discrimination parliament decided to deal with discrimination through legislation <e> <s> i do not believe that this is appropriate in the case of age <e> <s> there are important differences <e>", "<cs> my lords it was published last week and i shall make sure that the noble lord gets a copy <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations will be health and safety at work regulations which normally go through on the negative rather than the affirmative procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy started his remarks by chastising me for explaining in committee what the clauses did in only lines <e> <s> i am not sure what point he was trying to make whether i had spoken for too long or too short a time or whether i had not fully explained what was being done <e> <s> i am happy to come back at this stage and explain exactly what the government propose <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations will deal with health and safety at work considerations <e> <s> this is not a health and safety consideration it is something entirely different <e> <s> it deals with a religious issue and therefore it needs primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not see the comparison between people who are in some way unhealthy and sikhs <e> <s> however i have yet to see the regulations and no doubt we shall have to wait and see whether there will be further exemptions <e> <s> but i do not believe that there will be any <e> <s> we are talking about sikhs in a religious connection which has nothing to do with health <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no evidence to suggest that there will be any more accidents because some people are not wearing safety helmets <e> <s> at the moment it is not compulsory to wear hard hats <e> <s> some employees in the construction industry already do so but some do not <e> <s> the point i should make to the noble lord lord stoddart as to why we are making the provision compulsory is that the industry generally believes that it would be safer if everyone wore hard hats <e> <s> all we are doing is exempting sikhs on the grounds that i am trying to explain <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy complained that i had spoken for only lines <e> <s> now i am trying to speak at some length but i keep on being interrupted <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the chance of someone causing an accident and injuring a third party purely because he is not wearing a hat is very remote <e> <s> the noble lord says that i claimed there would not be an increase in accidents because of this exemption <e> <s> the two claims are very close indeed <e> <s> i think we are getting away from the central argument which is one of principle <e> <s> it concerns whether a group should be exempted on religious grounds from certain regulations <e> <s> that principle was already broken in when the party of the noble lord was in power as regards the wearing of helmets on motorbikes <e> <s> here we are in considering a similar exemption on construction sites <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> if an injury occurs involving a sikh who is not wearing a helmet and we are talking of proximate cause the third partys claim will not be dependent in any way on whether the sikhs injury would have been prevented or lessened by a safety helmet <e> <s> i hope that that clears that point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord misunderstood me or not <e> <s> the exemptions provided for in regulations would not cover sikhs because they can be given only if they are consistent with health and safety provisions <e> <s> we are not talking solely about health and safety provisions <e> <s> the sikh will be less safe to a certain extent wearing a turban than a helmet <e> <s> we have never suggested otherwise <e> <s> that is why the matter has not been brought in under regulations and that is why we are discussing it now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously a great pleasure to have the opportunity of explaining what clause does <e> <s> the purpose of the clause is to clarify the effect of the exemption contained in clause on the application of the race relations act <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply to the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i think it would be unwise at this stage to go over much of the old ground that we discussed for minutes in the debate on clause <e> <s> we recognise that each different religious group has particular practices or issues which are uniquely important to it <e> <s> for the most part there is no actual conflict between these and our own laws and practices <e> <s> whether they are christian jewish sikh moslem or any other religious and traditional practices lie largely in the private domain of their own lives or in the area of negotiation with the various authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not the faintest idea <e> <s> that will depend on who would decide <e> <s> ultimately i suppose it would be the courts which would decide whether or not there was a detriment <e> <s> the noble lord has brought up that hypothetical situation <e> <s> we should have to see what the effect of that would be <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy accused me of not having clarified the point or of saying that the use of the word clarify meant something else <e> <s> it does not <e> <s> clause makes clear the effect of clause <e> <s> in that sense it clarifies <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has explained the situation extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not agree with the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> he gave the example of an insurance company charging more money because a construction company employed sikhs if the insurance company were to increase the premiums he asks whether that would be judged as discriminatory <e> <s> that may well be but the fact is that it has not happened it is most unlikely that it ever would happen and whether it is an insurance company or a supply company or any other kind of company discrimination is discrimination <e> <s> that is quite clear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wedderburn repeated more of what i said in committee <e> <s> obviously that logic is unassailable <e> <s> that is what i said and that is what i meant <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather surprised to see this amendment <e> <s> most other opposition amendments this evening have seemed to come some way towards the governments approach or even to return to the status quo <e> <s> but this amendment seeks to give the employer even less rights in respect of his obligation to provide paid time off to trade union officials <e> <s> it rides roughshod over the single and abiding concern that the government have returned to again and again namely that there can be no justification for an employer being required to pay for time off for trade union officials to carry out duties which are concerned with matters in relation to which the employer does not recognise the union <e> <s> under this amendment that unacceptable state of affairs would continue to obtain and therefore the government cannot accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment presupposes that the omission of the notion of an associated employer from the wording of clause would if it were to be enacted restrict the right to paid time off to carry out trade union duties in respect of employers which are associated employers of the trade union officials employer <e> <s> the clause will certainly restrict the right in respect of associated employers as it restricts the right in the case of the principal employer <e> <s> the degree of the restriction depends however on ones interpretation of the rather opaque wording of section as it is at present a subject to which i shall return in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the government cannot support the amendment <e> <s> i try hard to make the noble lord lord wedderburn happy but i seem to fail more often than not <e> <s> i am pleased to note that the opposition are prepared to go some way although the noble lord lord wedderburn asked me not to say that and that there seems to be a willingness to look at both sides of the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and with the leave of the house until that last sentence of the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lady gardner of parkes for giving us all those <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords whenever the noble lord lord mccarthy prefaces his remarks by saying that this is a most modest amendment i feel the urge to look very closely at the amendment again to make sure that there is not a hidden agenda <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord lord rochester was unconvinced by my answers at committee stage <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to help him further tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords no i doubt very much that we shall do so <e> <s> this is a matter about which the government are prepared to think between now and third reading <e> <s> however i make no commitment to bring forward an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this proposal is on the face of it a minor one and it would still appear to leave considerable discretion with the secretary of state as to who apart from employers he chooses to consult before making an industrial training order <e> <s> however i do not feel that we need to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy on the development of industry based training bodies was set out clearly in last years white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that as the noble baroness knows the matter is under discussion and review <e> <s> we hope that there will be an announcement shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords we oppose the amendment not because we do not believe that the rights of industrial training board staff involved in transfers should be protected <e> <s> quite the contrary <e> <s> that is why we have created the specific stipulations that the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations should be extended to include industrial training board staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the concern of noble lords opposite that those with a professional interest in the training field should be as involved as possible in the selection and indeed membership of industrial training boards <e> <s> i share their concern as i indicated in reply to the noble lord lord rochester during discussion of the bill in committee <e> <s> however i have to say that this amendment is not the way to achieve that aim <e>", "<cs> my lords it is extraordinary that i should need to rise when the noble lord thinks that he already knows what i am going to say <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has hit on an important point <e> <s> he is quite correct <e> <s> the commission is planning special promotions in the united states canada and japan aimed at promoting travel to europe for a whole variety of reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord ponsonby for those words <e> <s> what some noble lords do not realise is that the noble lord himself is well involved in the tourist industry particularly in london <e> <s> as for government support for the european year of tourism that is implicit in the fact that the programme is sponsored by the british tourist authority and will continue to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords discussions are still continuing on the proposed ec directive <e>", "<cs> my lords i admire the noble lords ability to raise an entirely different question when dealing with the european year of tourism <e> <s> i suspect that he will have plenty of other opportunities on which to put down such a question on the order paper when one of my colleagues or i will be delighted to answer <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> there is a certain amount of controversy about the role of tourists in this country <e> <s> however i should point out that most people in this country receive a tremendous benefit from the influx of tourists <e> <s> it was worth over billion in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct <e> <s> i know he is a great supporter of the industry also <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right in pointing out that there are a number of competitions throughout the country to impress on people the importance of tourism and of exchanging cultural differences <e> <s> the competition for europes tidiest city and the best facilities for the handicapped will be uppermost in our minds during <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what has been said in this debate on an important aspect of industrial relations and trade union law <e> <s> we have heard from members of this house whose experience and expertise in industrial relations law and practice has been reflected in the tremendous quality of this debate <e> <s> i too am sorry that the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls could not be here <e> <s> however if i may say so with respect we have heard from him through the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously not a legal expert or able to comment immediately on the type of wording that the noble and learned lord has proposed <e> <s> as i have said we shall study what has been said in the debate and we shall no doubt look very closely at that phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords views will obviously be taken into account before a final decision is taken <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> perhaps i should point out that two-thirds of the workers who come under wages council schemes are paid more than the minimum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i agree entirely with the premise of the noble baroness <e> <s> regarding training as she knows well the government have made great changes in the way in which workers are trained in order to improve the situation across the board <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a certain amount of evidence to support what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> compliance in that area works out at a rate of between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that that is an extremely high rate <e> <s> there are inspectors who visit annually establishments and continue to do a very good job <e> <s> there has been a slight increase

already been a major consultation exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of inspectors is adequate given the high rate of compliance and that is what counts <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of wages

make the point that within this house there are many directors and chairmen of boards whom i am sure will testify to their own restraint <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not current government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords that is decided between companies and their shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords again that must be decided between the water companies and their new shareholders <e> <s> however perhaps i may point out <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking about the ambulancemen we are going slightly off the original question <e> <s> in any case it is illogical to make comparisons between pay increases for different groups or individuals <e>", "<cs> my lords the issue of sensitivity may well be valid but ultimately the government cannot be an arbitrator in what individual companies decide is right for individual chairmen and shareholders ultimately have the right to object <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said it is up to individual companies to decide <e> <s> the government do not have a role to play in forcing companies to pay certain salaries or even deciding what companies should pay their chairmen and directors <e> <s> as to the noble lords point about the prime minister i understand that my right honourable friend still takes less than her proper pay <e>", "<cs> my lords there is simply no requirement to compile those kinds of statistics but the noble lord is entitled to ask the question <e> <s> i am sure that there are individual reports and accounts in the library of the house where he can find that information himself <e>", "<cs> my lords the per cent <e> <s> figure conies from a single survey <e> <s> it is not necessarily all that scientific and the results should therefore be treated with a certain amount of doubt <e> <s> in any case the

precisely what could have happened this summer if the union had authorised that action which for reasons best known to itself it decided not to do <e> <s> a further ballot would not have been required

learned lord for that intervention <e> <s> i suspect that what i have said needs to be considered further <e> <s> however the basic principle of what i have said remains <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will give me a chance i am simply responding to the second reading debate at this stage and i have to make the point to the noble lord lord mccarthy about this idea of getting injunctions <e> <s> although this principle is well understood by many noble lords it is a stiffer test than i think the noble lord lord mccarthy recognised when he was speaking <e> <s> that is purely the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that it is a tougher test than the noble lord seems to think <e> <s> if i may turn to the problem that any formula which sought to impose a maximum limit on the extension which a court might award potentially poses if the formula involved a court in making a decision about the circumstances in which the extension would be appropriate in terms of the effect on industrial relations or the unions rank and file i do not believe that any court would find it easy to reach a view on the basis of such criteria <e> <s> also if i may turn to the <e>", "<cs> my lords yes my noble friend is correct <e> <s> the tourism industry is well aware of its responsibilities in this area and is working on a variety of programmes in schools and colleges in order to raise the profile of the industry as providing a good and permanent career <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is most sensible <e> <s> i recognise that often there is a problem in the development of tourism in areas of particular attractiveness <e> <s> often it is that particular environment which attracts visitors to the area <e> <s> however having recognised that concern it is the governments policy to develop new markets so that visitors can spread to areas which hitherto have not had tourist potential to develop action programmes for a variety of areas throughout the country and to help to extend the season so that fewer visitors will bunch in the summer months <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recently announced almost a doubling of the amount of taxpayers money given to regional tourist boards <e> <s> that will help to a great extent to diversify places that tourists visit <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely one of the areas where tourists have a beneficial effect on our cities <e> <s> in the near future the government will introduce a new anti-litter campaign because we need to present a better image to foreign visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords it is most important that all our schoolchildren particularly those who go to work in industries where they meet foreigners have the ability to converse to a certain extent with those foreigners <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe in a combined approach <e> <s> as regards the tourism industry there are many commercial organisations which understand the need for their employees to learn foreign languages <e> <s> they have instituted a variety of courses <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> it is the responsibility of us all to make sure that we clean up litter <e>", "<cs> my lords of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends concern over this matter which is important to the people of north dorset <e> <s> with regard to whether the pesticide would affect flora and fauna

privatised is so that we can better deal with such problems <e> <s> there is no evidence to suggest that the blandford fly has been caused by excess pollution <e>", "<cs> my lords superficially the proposal of the noble baroness is attractive but the whole idea of the tecs is that they are locally responsive and flexible to local training requirements <e> <s> i believe that the employment opportunities of people with disabilities will best be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure what the construction industry training board does to help people with disabilities <e> <s> the question deals

customary when dealing with this subject we have had an interesting and varied debate <e> <s> i have listened with great care to the speeches that have been made <e> <s> as i said during the bills second reading we are keeping this aspect of the law under close review and will continue to do so whatever the fate of this particular bill <e> <s> however i shall limit my words to the amendment on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite right to say that the tecs are at the centre of the governments policy for the future delivery of training <e> <s> it is important that the tourism industry grasps this opportunity and ensures that its training needs are a prominent feature of all such tecs <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned a couple of qualifications that can be received from universities and polytechnics <e> <s> i am very glad to say that these are increasing <e> <s> in march <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for abta to advise its members on training <e> <s> whenever the government meet representatives from that organisation we ask them to encourage their members to train their personnel as effectively as possible <e> <s> that includes language training which is a key to the service which we provide to overseas visitors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right in that preservation of the beauty of the countryside and the eradication of the litter problem are extremely important <e> <s> he will know that there is a bill before another place to help deal with those problems <e> <s> the noble lord ingeniously managed to bring that question into the question on the order paper dealing with training <e> <s> i say to him that aspects of environmental concern are brought into tourism programmes in schools and colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a variety of organisations and committees which represent britain abroad <e> <s> any closer links that they develop with their overseas counterparts are to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords the proof that abta sets great importance by the quality of its training is that it offers some of the cheapest holidays in the whole of europe <e> <s> as for its requests for help with training the department offers an enormous variety <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway certainly adopts a very different principle from that which has previously appeared in clause of the bill <e> <s> no longer is it to be left to the courts to exercise discretion about whether to extend the four-week period allowed between the date of a ballot and the unions first authorisation or endorsement of industrial action <e> <s> instead a four-week period is to be suspended until any proceedings in which a relevant act is called into question have been concluded the stop-the-clock provision as my noble friend called it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right the conditions had changed <e> <s> however the noble lord lord mccarthy has entirely missed the point <e> <s> the leaders of the union recommended that their members should vote for a strike <e> <s> it was the union members themselves who voted against such action <e> <s> it shows that sometimes there is a difference between what union leaders think their members want and what their members actually want <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the point i am trying to make and i did say that i was not seeking to draw a general lesson from any particular case is that within a fairly short space of time in this case four weeks the minds of union members can change <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally accept that point <e> <s> however the principle i am trying to put across to the house is that union leaders may think in one way while the union members think in another <e> <s> therefore extending the four-week period may not be in the interests of members and may not be what they decide <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mccarthy helpfully makes clear the intended effect of the amendment that he successfully introduced in committee <e> <s> my response to that amendment assumed that that was what he had in mind <e> <s> it follows that there is nothing i can usefully add to the reply i then gave <e>", "<cs> my lords it did not because the union leaders recommended strike action <e> <s> they recommended the union members to vote yes but they did no such thing <e> <s> they voted no <e> <s> that shows that the union executive is out of touch with what its members wanted <e> <s> it also shows that the four-week period is the correct period <e>", "<cs> my lords all i am saying is that the noble lord has not provided any evidence to show that it will be better to set the limit at weeks as opposed to four <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend does not wish to get into a lengthy discussion about the ford dispute <e> <s> i made it absolutely plain when i used that example that i was not making a great case of it it was simply an example of how the members views differed from those of the executive <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord should concentrate so much on the discrepancy he should concentrate upon the fact that the rate is falling much faster in the north than in the south <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord is well aware that we never make forecasts on unemployment trends <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes a valid point <e> <s> moreover that is a question which the unions themselves should consider when seeking to look after the interests of their members <e> <s> however the point i think he was trying to make is that regions should make themselves look more attractive to potential employers <e> <s> indeed the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very welcome and useful information <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the mineworkers and the fact that some coalmines had been closed <e> <s> however he should remember that it was actually the strike of and mr arthur scargill that led to more mine closures than anything this government have done <e>", "<cs> all those initiatives are working because unemployment is coming down <e> <s> the rate is coming down fastest in the areas of greatest need <e> <s> the noble lord asked about idop <e> <s> i shall have to look further at that scheme and perhaps i may write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and learned friend for raising that subject <e> <s> the situation in northern ireland is sometimes forgotten <e>", "<cs> my lords as an immigrant from scotland i do not see that there is anything particularly wrong in young scots men and women coming south of the border <e> <s> government policies are working as part of the total renewal of the economy which is why unemployment is coming down and the economy continues to grow <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the cbi but generally speaking we must look at employment issues in the context of rising employment <e> <s> figures for the previous quarter show an increase of over the previous months in the number of people joining the workforce <e> <s> we are doing everything we can to ensure that people who have jobs retain them and that those who are unemployed soon find jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to hear my noble friends comment <e> <s> i suspect that whenever we deal with regional issues to a certain extent we are bound to deal with parochialism <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have never created unemployment <e> <s> the government are well aware of the unhappiness caused by unemployment which is why we have schemes designed to get long-term unemployed people back to work <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fair point <e> <s> the regions hide areas of substantial prosperity as well as severe black spots <e>", "<cs> my lords relocation is obviously one way to help the statistics along <e> <s> the noble lord will no doubt be pleased by the announcement made on th january by my noble <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting question but entirely different from the one on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords we are doing our very best to get people who are unemployed back to work <e> <s> the noble lord may wish to know that in the northern region one-third of all unemployed people between the ages of and have started training on et <e> <s> it has the highest penetration rate throughout great britain and represents an per cent <e> <s> increase since april <e> <s> i hope that the downward trend will increase <e>", "<cs> my lords the employment bill published on st december deals with the outstanding problems of the pre-entry closed shop secondary action and unofficial action <e> <s> at this stage the government have no plans for further industrial relations legislation but we have always made it clear that we are prepared to introduce legislation to deal with any new problems which may arise in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather suspect that the noble lord lord mccarthy is trying to make cheap political points <e> <s> he is full of facts that do not stand up to examination <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state actually said <e>", "<cs> my lords we have so much employment legislation only because of the abuse of powers by trade unions over several decades <e> <s> as for the other point raised by the noble baroness about whether we should look at adjusting the existing legislation no doubt we shall be able to discuss it in detail when the bill arrives in the house later this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that mr kinnock and the labour party are slightly confused on the issue <e> <s> mr tony blair who speaks on the labour partys behalf in another place recently said <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say from this side of the house that that is precisely what we think we have achieved <e> <s> the legislation that we have introduced over the past few years has been extremely successful <e> <s> i hope that that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will have to wait <e> <s> no decision has been taken on either of those two issues <e> <s> he has seen the employment bill which was published on st december and which deals with the problems that i outlined <e> <s> any further action which the government feel should be taken will have to wait for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity presented by the noble lord lord peston whose most interesting speech i thought contained some rare glimmers of vision to record the governments commitment to continuing to improve the education and training system of this country to highlight some of our considerable achievements in the past decade and to point up the ways in which we are preparing to meet the challenges of the next decade and beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords we were faced this afternoon with a substantial subject and i have been impressed by the breadth of the debate <e> <s> although i think there has been a slight bias towards education i nonetheless believe that we have developed some interesting themes across the field of education and training as a whole <e> <s> i was accused at a couple of points of being panglossian in my opening speech <e> <s> pangloss dealt with dreams of optimism i have tried hard today to deal with reality <e> <s> the government are not complacent <e> <s> we are aware of the problems but we are also aware that we have had substantial successes <e> <s> i said at the outset that we have a long way to go but we should not lose sight of where we were which was considerably worse <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord young of dartington mentioned the national curriculum <e> <s> it is being formulated in such a way as to ensure that less academic children have the opportunity to study in subjects at a level appropriate to their abilities and in a way that enhances their understanding <e> <s> moreover it will guard against a tendency in the past to offer these children a curriculum which was unnecessarily constricted in its scope <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that a good deal of flexibility has been built into the planning of the national curriculum <e> <s> the needs of less academic pupils have not been overlooked <e>", "<cs> my lords fair enough <e> <s> overall some per cent <e> <s> of three to five year-olds participate in some form of education or care provision <e> <s> that puts us near the top of the european league and not at the bottom as suggested by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a delight to elaborate but unfortunately i do not have the time <e> <s> i am sorry if i have not mentioned all noble lords who have spoken or all the issues which have been raised <e> <s> it has been an interesting debate and if i have missed any specific questions i shall write to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must write to the noble baroness about that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady turner surprised me <e> <s> she started by essentially welcoming the fact that the government had consulted and that we had made considerable changes in our code of practice <e> <s> she then went on to say that it was all a waste of time that there was absolutely nothing good in the code of practice and that we should bin the whole thing and probably not even bother starting again <e> <s> the noble baroness said that we had been one-sided <e> <s> but the draft code concerns ballots by unions of their own members asking whether those members are willing to take part in or to continue with industrial action which their union may authorise or endorse <e> <s> that is the subject of the draft code <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer that in a moment <e> <s> proper ballots can give a union protection against legal proceedings that could otherwise be brought against it <e> <s> such ballots relate to industrial action it is up to a union to decide to organise it <e> <s> the law does not oblige a union to consider calling on its members to take industrial action <e> <s> the law places requirements on employers to allow the use of premises for certain ballots in certain circumstances <e> <s> the code refers to these obligations <e> <s> to do more would distort the fundamental purposes of the code <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely because the noble lord is not interested in the rights of trade union members or of democracy when it <e>", "<cs> my lords the government of course do not wish to see any lessening of morale within the training board <e> <s> our intention is to appoint the right people as soon as possible <e> <s> until then the existing board remains in place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish is not quite right on that <e> <s> we spent a great deal of time in the committee stage of the employment bill last year discussing this precise point <e> <s> the committee came to the conclusion that the new proposals were the correct way to go forward <e> <s> the citb has been kept on as a training board precisely because it was seen to be doing a good job <e>", "<cs> my lords the general secretary of the tuc has suggested names to the secretary of state and these will be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the timescale we shall be making an announcement as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords as soon as possible means very shortly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not the statement of the noble lord lord mellish that was inaccurate <e> <s> my point was that it was policy decision that we took in this house last october <e> <s> i am simply making the point that we had discussed it at some considerable length some months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i could ever do anything to the satisfaction of the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> we are looking for the right people to sit on the board <e> <s> that is what is important <e> <s> we are trying to do it as quickly as possible but i cannot give a firm date <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble baronesses for their comments <e> <s> i was not entirely surprised by the words of the noble baroness lady turner <e> <s> i was slightly more surprised by the words of the noble baroness lady seear and i very much welcome her support for this change <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that one has to look at what happens when companies remain in the public sector and they are restricted by for example the treasury <e> <s> there are also numerous public sector restrictions and overheads <e> <s> those represent some of the reasons the skillcentres have been incapable of being a success while part of the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords shame on the noble baroness for even suggesting that we have been running down the skillcentres in order to privatise them <e> <s> that must be quite wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is trying to be helpful there <e> <s> he is absolutely right in saying that there has been an element of confusion as to how training should be provided by employers and by employer-led bodies through the government network <e> <s> however i really feel that we have come to the end of that confusion by setting up the training and enterprise councils by privatising the skills training agency and by continuing the good work that has been done by employment training and youth training <e> <s> i sincerely hope that over the next years we will continue to see these programmes grow and prosper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her remarks <e> <s> they provided some useful information <e> <s> she was correct in everything she said about the skills training agency <e> <s> i also hope that it will succeed in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly interesting to learn that the noble lord is the president of an organisation as distinguished as the mobile radio users association <e> <s> he has introduced a more general concept of overall training <e> <s> i am sorry that he missed some of our recent debates on training at which his noble friend lady seear was present and on which she is an expert <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a good debate until the noble lord lord dormand of easington rose and decided to dive in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a dogmatic attack on privatisation and its issues <e> <s> i do not remember his exact words but he implied that there was something wrong with profit <e> <s> the past years have shown that profit is most important <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is wrong because skills centres like anything else must be in a position to charge the market rate for supplying the services that they provide whether it is training or whatever <e> <s> he said that tecs and skills training centres will be run by the same people <e> <s> that is not necessarily so <e> <s> there will be a contractual obligation between the skills centres and the training and enterprise councils <e> <s> the skills centres will be competing with other private sector providers of training so that the tecs can obtain the best possible value for money <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that during the past couple of minutes my noble friend lord beloff enjoyed himself <e> <s> he appears to have a great interest in training but he has not played any part in our recent debates on the subject <e> <s> i regret that because his views are extremely important and valid <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness makes a good point about the provision for disadvantaged people the disabled ethnic minorities and in some instances women who need to play a full part in our economy <e> <s> that is one reason why the government have chosen training as one of the major priorities in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend lord beloff if i implied in any way that he does not have a general interest in the subject <e> <s> i was merely making the point that since i have been employment minister in this house and dealing with the employment bill my noble friend regrettably did not take part in that debate and we all missed him then <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness did not understand my original answer <e> <s> i said that we hope that more employers will have family friendly policies towards their employees <e> <s> more specifically the government are aware of the great concern of many women on this issue <e> <s> the ministerial group on womens issues has issued a five point initiative <e> <s> all government training programmes and business initiatives are open to women and we are also supporting the nationwide back to the future series of conferences for women returners which are being held in conjunction with the bbc and the industrial society <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not yet been convinced of the need to have a european directive on that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that helpful comment <e> <s> i think he knows as well as i what the question is trying to get at <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord must know perfectly well that at this time of the year when we are approaching the budget it would be quite wrong of me to speculate on anything which the chancellor of the exchequer might have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the government as an employer have a very good record on that sort of provision <e> <s> they provide flexible working practices to allow women to be able to organise how they wish to work <e> <s> some government departments have schemes for the holidays <e> <s> indeed there is one in central london which is based at the treasury <e> <s> generally speaking the civil service is seen as a good leader and a good example to other employers <e> <s> however we shall obviously seek to do more <e>", "<cs> my lords the point the noble baroness makes about small firms is absolutely valid <e> <s> what we are doing is encouraging small employers in specific areas to club together to provide the kinds of facilities that single large firms can supply themselves <e> <s> the same basic principle applies for school holidays <e> <s> one of the initiatives we have taken is to write to school governors to remind them that they have the powers to provide school premises out of school hours precisely for that sort of care <e>", "<cs> my lords we encourage many flexible working practices and we encourage maternal leave <e> <s> i think the record in this country is not at all bad <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a great deal of good practice at the moment so there is no need to assist with cash <e> <s> however the department of health is making available million for pilot studies on how existing government resources can be more clearly focused <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the words of the noble lord <e> <s> i am not sure that his back-benchers agree with him either <e>", "<cs> my lords it must be up to the individual leas to decide exactly how they will provide for their employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness refers to the employees of the national health service <e> <s> it must be up to the national health service to decide how best to deal with the needs of its own employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wished to ask about the ambulancemens dispute why on earth did he not table a question in those terms on the order paper <e> <s> this question quite obviously refers to acas <e> <s> therefore perhaps i may answer the part of his supplementary question which i think is appropriate <e> <s> yes acas has been successful <e> <s> the noble lord said that the service has helped to settle per cent <e> <s> of disputes but i think the figure is about per cent <e> <s> however that is still a very high success rate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows perfectly well the answer to that accusation <e> <s> there is an adequate method of negotiation for the ambulancemen and that is what is taking place <e> <s> there is no such thing as compulsory conciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments attitude to arbitration and conciliation is an extremely good one <e> <s> indeed the number of inquiries received has increased from in to in <e> <s> therefore this is something which we fully support <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a useful debate on a very interesting report from the select committee on the european communities <e> <s> the committee has carried out a detailed and thorough examination and deserves praise for putting the report together in such a short space of time <e> <s> i believe that the essential aims of the government and of the committee are very close <e> <s> we are all firmly committed to the principle that the single market must serve the interests of everybody in the community <e> <s> in particular it must create the climate for job creation and development <e>", "<cs> fair enough my lords <e> <s> i must have misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> however the point remains that we took a full part in the process of negotiation <e> <s> we participated constructively in the discussions and supported a number of the changes that were made but those changes did not go far enough for us to accept the full charter <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows that that is not true <e> <s> if he listens a little longer he will hear some further proof <e>", "<cs> my lords what an extraordinary question for the noble lord to ask <e> <s> is <e>", "<cs> my lords precisely <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble lords greater knowledge because i know that his party has been proponents of the idea ever since the beginning <e> <s> but it was a conservative prime minister who brought this country into europe <e> <s> it was under a conservative government that the idea of was conceived <e> <s> it was a conservative government who brought in the single european act <e> <s> and where was the labour party in all that time <e> <s> we all know that even in it had a manifesto commitment to bring us out of the european community <e> <s> yet here the members are all exhorting us to accept a social europe <e> <s> there is one reason for this sudden contradiction <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no difficulty with that but the noble lord is missing my point <e> <s> i am talking about the labour party and how it has changed <e> <s> the reason it has changed is that after nearly years out of office and with the pathetic opposition that it has provided over the past years it sees the only effective opposition to this governments policies is with the red dawn rising over brussels <e> <s> that is the truth <e> <s> this government are keen to look ahead <e> <s> the social charter is now passed <e> <s> it was a political declaration but one which we believe also commits the signatories to a package implementing measures many of which we have not had sight of <e> <s> we must now move to the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the analysis of my noble friend sounds reasonable <e> <s> in and in there will be some quite severe bunching as regards the three main bank holidays at easter may day and at whitsun <e> <s> however the matter is not quite so simple as my noble friend suggests <e> <s> there are a number of factors to take into account <e> <s> as i said we are still looking at the situation carefully to see whether or not a consensus will arise <e>", "<cs> my lords it comes as no surprise that the noble baroness would like us all to have more holidays <e> <s> however as is so often the case comparisons between what we do in this country and what is done on the continent are not entirely fair <e> <s> a casual look at any good diary will show that there is no conformity on the continent as is the case in the four constituent parts of great britain <e> <s> therefore i do not think the suggestion of the noble baroness is necessarily a good one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the point of the noble baroness will be considered as part of the review which is considering how to deal with the bank holidays <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason for that is that easter is a movable feast <e> <s> we have discussed that matter on many occasions <e> <s> we have suggested that the interested bodies particularly the churches should reach some kind of consensus on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been a whole variety of suggestions <e> <s> people have suggested a churchill day a trafalgar day a st georges day and even a waterloo day on th june <e> <s> as we have a labour day on st may some consider that we should have a conservative day <e> <s> that demonstrates the problem as regards the whole of this issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will no doubt be aware that the levy system allows for exemptions and that is does at present qualify for european social fund money <e> <s> the clarification that we seek concerns the situation under the new regime and we shall have to await the response <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but it is up to the european social fund to decide exactly how much money should be handed out to all the people who would like money from the fund <e> <s> generally speaking the amount of money that is received from the european social fund as a proportion of the total amount of money that is spent on training in the engineering industry is very small <e> <s> a couple of years ago the figures were some million from the esf compared with over billion spent by the rest of the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is only partly right <e> <s> i understand that the rules require that the funding must be matched by public sector finance <e> <s> however there is some discussion as to what exactly public sector finance means <e> <s> we are trying to show that whether it is a privately led organisation or one which is totally subsidised by taxpayers money the industry training board should still receive social fund money <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has got it quite wrong <e> <s> we are not being at all doctrinaire we are being exactly the opposite <e> <s> we are moving away from a statutory organisation to one which is far freer and market-led by the industry <e> <s> that is not a doctrinaire approach <e> <s> we hope to receive a response from the commission fairly soon and we shall have to review the situation at that stage <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i shall not quarrel with the noble baroness over semantics <e>", "<cs> my lords the engineering industry is totally non-discriminatory <e> <s> i am sure that it will continue to support women in the engineering industry as much as it has done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because training provision has failed over several decades that we have elected to go into the new regime <e> <s> we have had in this house many debates on training and we believe that in future in the s training provision in this country will be far better than it has ever been before <e>", "<cs> my lords the post office now expects sunday collections to be available nation-wide by the autumn <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is a great doubter of the post offices ability to provide a good service <e> <s> i have no doubt that he is aware that the post office is committed to an average per cent <e> <s> peformance improvement this year <e> <s> that includes sundays and of course mondays to saturdays <e>", "<cs> my lords we all have stories to tell of how bad the post offices service sometimes is but generally speaking it is a good service and is continually improving <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lord has missed the point <e> <s> we are talking about sunday collections not sunday deliveries <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a great pleasure to come to this house to make a statement which is so generally welcomed by the noble baronesses opposite <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the noble baroness lady turner say that she supported the idea that it is a good scheme and one which should be encouraged <e> <s> i am glad that she mentioned the labour partys record because for a long time it did not show any great concern about training <e> <s> it is only in recent years that it has started to say that training should play a far greater part in our national economy than it did previously <e> <s> i hear one or two noble lords opposite muttering dissent but they will no doubt be aware that the real cost of training undertaken by the government has increased by three times in real terms over the course of the past years <e>", "<cs> my lords again it is a pleasure to hear my noble friend welcome the scheme in such glowing terms <e> <s> she makes a valid point about the psychology of the scheme that will encourage young people to realise the worth of their training and therefore make even greater efforts to use the training throughout their careers <e> <s> it will also encourage employers to recognise the motivation of their young employees <e>", "<cs> my lords of course it comes as no surprise that the noble lord lord dormand of easington does not fully welcome the scheme <e> <s> he used the word cautious and said that this is a matter of changing direction <e> <s> that reinforces the view that i have held for quite a long time that the noble lord has not listened to what i have said in the past and does not recognise the direction that the government have been taking for some time now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to hear the noble lord the leader of the opposition joining us in these debates <e> <s> the political points that i made right at the start were aimed not really at the long distant past but at the last labour government <e> <s> i referred to their present policies which the noble lord may know are still confused <e>", "<cs> my lords we have as many tecs or lecs as possible covering as many different areas as possible so there is a direct link between local provision and local needs <e> <s> as they will cover the whole of the country the noble lords problem will be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords as tecs will cover the whole of the country there will be no national need which is not by definition a local need somewhere <e> <s> so long as the individual can prove his or her need to be trained it is up to the tecs to decide with other tecs exactly how that training need is to be provided <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand how tecs work the onus is on them to decide the most valuable amount of training required <e> <s> in the example used by the noble baroness there is no reason why if the tecs were in agreement with that proposal it should not be put into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord no doubt knows that we set ourselves two years to cover the country <e> <s> we hope to have covered per cent of the country by the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords we must wait to see how the bids come in for the existing tecs which need development funding <e> <s> the noble lord misses the point <e> <s> we are already two years ahead of schedule in putting tecs into place <e> <s> the process has gone extremely well and i hope that the noble lord encourages the tec in his area <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of training provision in this country is not that it should offer a free-for-all for anyone who wants any kind of training in whatever industry he or she wishes <e> <s> it is important that it is proved to be worthwhile and there is an attainment of skill levels at a national level <e> <s> that is what is so important about training <e> <s> tecs can support training needs in other areas and will be encouraged to support centres of excellence <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that there is no evidence to suggest that the governments campaign worked <e> <s> i am not sure that he has evidence to prove that it has not <e> <s> we have always made plain and we are continuing to do so particularly in the light of demographic trends that employers must look across the full range of potential employees to ensure that they obtain the best possible workforce for their particular industries and that includes older people <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil service is regarded as a good employer <e> <s> it increased the range of ages at which people are encouraged to join the civil service in some instances by raising the age qualification in order to persuade older people to apply for jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly do not encourage that practice by employers <e> <s> we continually encourage employers rather than making people redundant to retrain and therefore retain them <e> <s> we have done that by a variety of means as the noble baroness is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have those figures to hand but i shall inquire whether they are available and write to the noble baroness <e> <s> it was particularly gratifying to hear my noble friend be so encouraging about that scheme as it was to hear the noble lord lord stallard expressing the same view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will be glad to hear that there are a number of instances where employers specifically encouraged older workers and they proved very successful <e> <s> that is particularly so with tesco stores bq british telecom and british rail which have also introduced schemes as well as macdonalds and sainsburys <e> <s> where good practice occurs it is seen as a success <e> <s> it does not stop the employment opportunities of young people and we continue to encourage it <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that the retirement age in the civil service is is largely historical <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no straightforward answer to that question <e> <s> perhaps it should be more properly directed to the questioner the noble lord lord stallard <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the retirement age is and that appears to be an ultimate barrier <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on to the minister responsible the suggestion that the retirement age should be examined <e> <s> i am sure that has happened in the past and that it has been concluded that is the right age for that particular industry <e> <s> that allows civil servants who have an enormous amount of experience to go into other employment after reaching the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble baroness takes a great deal of interest in the affairs of older people <e> <s> she successfully piloted a bill through this house in the last session <e> <s> as regards upper age limits in the cabinet that will not so much be up to me but of course to the people of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right in saying that there has been a steady decline in the number of jobs connected with agriculture <e> <s> they declined by per cent <e> <s> between september and september <e> <s> that decline is likely to continue <e> <s> more specifically the employment service has a number of schemes aimed particularly at isolated rural areas <e> <s> for example jobs instead of being advertised at jobcentres are advertised in local libraries post offices church halls and so forth <e> <s> there is an outreach scheme to send officials who specialise in finding jobs for people to isolated communities in order to help the unemployed to find work <e> <s> the provision of new technology is also important <e>", "<cs> my lords unemployment is now nearly at half the level that it was in july though it is marginally higher than in <e> <s> the noble lord must know that since then three million new jobs have been created by the policies of this government <e>", "<cs> my lords there are several initiatives through which government departments have backed private and voluntary schemes <e> <s> for example the rural development commission provides a wide range of advice financial help and training <e> <s> the rdc also has a building programme for workshops especially in areas where the return on investment is too low to attract private sector investment <e> <s> there is also a full range of department of trade and industry services to help advise small businesses which are starting up so that they may maintain their impetus and therefore provide future solid employment <e>", "<cs> my lords in dealing with employment we should not consider just the planting of trees but also their cutting down which provides an enormous amount of employment <e> <s> in the course of the next years we shall see tremendous growth in the harvesting of the product which will provide a large number of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i fully understand the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> the rural development commission is there partly to deal with the problem and to provide the buildings and workshop space so that firms can carry out some kind of useful function <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> local offices of the rural development commission which are supported by private sector-led committees are able to provide general advice supported where necessary by expert advice on management marketing and technical matters in order to assist small businesses to grow <e> <s> part of the key to that is also to provide the workshops the small industrial areas so that those businesses can continue to thrive <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on those comments to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> however my understanding is that in recent years rural transport has begun to improve <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to the two noble lords who have just spoken <e> <s> before doing so i should make the general comment that i find myself in a certain amount of difficulty <e> <s> i cannot go into the details of what passed between my department and the companies involved while customs investigations are continuing <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords on all sides of the house will agree that it would be wrong to prejudge the case until that investigation is complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i can confirm that it will not be possible to build a complete full-sized gun from the parts that have been supplied from the uk <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether other countries are capable of creating the tubes which are missing <e> <s> i suspect that britain which has an excellent record in that kind of development is possibly the only country which could do so otherwise presumably the iraqis would have gone elsewhere in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been a pleasure and of great interest to listen to the views of all who have spoken tonight particularly so because noble lords obviously have an enormous amount of experience on this issue and also a certain strength of feeling and variety as to how we should go ahead <e> <s> however i feel that the subject is essentially a complex one and i should like to deal with all the points that have been made or at least as many as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certainly happy to pass on that request to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i would just make one point about the code of practice and whether it should be made statutory <e> <s> the recommendation is that the price be put on the face of the ticket <e> <s> i think that most people already do that <e> <s> but if a person is willing to spend on a ticket i suspect that whether the ticket originally cost or is probably irrelevant <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really think an inquiry is needed <e> <s> there has not been a great deal of fuss about this matter <e> <s> certainly neither i as minister for tourism nor my department has received a single letter from an individual complaining about ticket touts or about being ripped off or exploited <e> <s> i know the anxieties of the london tourist board but i suspect that the best way to deal with the problem is to talk directly to the promoters and make sure they understand that there may be a problem in the way that they issue tickets <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords on the question of pay the most important thing to remember is the main principle of pay namely the need to recruit retain and motivate the right people for the job within what businesses themselves can afford <e> <s> that must be true whether you are at the lower level of the pay scale or at the very highest level <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is absolutely right <e> <s> i am not sure whether noble lords opposite are suggesting that we should interfere <e>", "<cs> my lords we are entering the area of semantics <e> <s> the government have always maintained that pay increases should be affordable and should be decided by businesses <e> <s> that is right and that is what the government have continually done <e> <s> that is what the cbi has done too <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not talking about levels of pay but about pay increases <e> <s> on that subject there are numerous examples of major british companies whose directors have taken pay cuts <e> <s> a noble lord opposite from a sedentary position asks me a supplementary question about naming those companies <e> <s> the figure for guinness was per cent <e> <s> lower for pilkingtons per cent <e> <s> lower and for the national freight corporation per cent <e> <s> lower <e> <s> the list goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend the paymaster general was comparing the tax and prices index with the retail prices index which are two different things <e> <s> the government including both my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable and learned friend sir geoffrey howe have said that leaders of industry should set a good example in pay determination <e> <s> i entirely endorse that approach and believe that noble lords opposite agree with that view <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a disgraceful suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am suprised that with his wealth of experience the noble lord should confuse two issues first the new unit price of labour costs and secondly the level of pay <e> <s> the two are not connected <e> <s> the government have always made the same statement on the question of pay namely that the companies should be able to afford it and that they must pay regard to international competition when setting those wage levels <e> <s> that is important and that is why we had one of the highest productivity growth economies in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that pay is for businesses themselves to decide <e> <s> however we have always maintained that leaders in industry should set a good example in their own pay determination <e>", "<cs> my lords we consult a variety of organisations involved in the search selection and recruitment industry <e> <s> we shall continue to do so when it is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that issue has anything to do with the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords this question is about employment agencies it has nothing to do with training <e> <s> that is another question which i am keen to answer but i cannot do so at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> what i shall do is to repeat what i have just said <e> <s> the most effective way of minimising redundancies is to ensure that we have a healthy economy <e> <s> we do that by reducing inflation and maintaining our tight monetary and fiscal policies which will ensure that we have a booming industry <e> <s> after eight years of growth in the construction market given the current level of interest rates it is not surprising that it should now decrease but the long-term future for the construction and house building industry is good <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the noble lord heard what i said in my original answer <e> <s> i said that i agreed that there had been some job losses but that employment in the sector at the end of last year was at its highest level for at least years <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will be pleased to hear that the housing corporation capital programme is set to rise from billion this year to - billion in and - billion in - <e> <s> that is a massive and rapid increase by anyones standards <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right <e> <s> skill levels and shortages are of great concern to us all <e> <s> in that context the construction industry training board is working hard to alleviate the skill shortages and to ensure that skills are not lost to the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the construction industry stilll uses the youth training and employment training providing its services either to young people or to people who have been unemployed <e> <s> the main point about the construction industry training board is that it should be more responsive to the needs of employers <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall seek to run the economy in such a way that the long-term future of the construction industry is assured <e> <s> i believe that that is the most sensible approach <e>", "<cs> my lords the accident figures are extremely regrettable and we obviously feel that they are too high <e> <s> however i cannot agree with the noble lord when he said that it was due to cost-cutting <e> <s> everyone involved in the construction industry knows that an efficient site is a safe site and that goes as far as possible for the channel tunnel site <e> <s> as for comparisons with the french sector they are not entirely helpful because the french set different criteria for reporting accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that and i am surprised that the noble baroness should make that accusation through the unions because they are represented on a variety of safety committees there is full and regular consultation with members of the four unions represented on the site and as i understand it those consultations work effectively <e>", "<cs> my lords it is tragic but let us also remember that that site is the largest construction site in europe <e> <s> it is one of the bravest kinds of construction sites that we have seen in recent years beneath the channel <e> <s> it is not surprising that accidents should occur even though it is very regrettable <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but i must point out that i am advised that there is a well developed system of safety committees and employee safety representatives on the project that trade unions are well represented among the workers and that the trade union safety representatives have forwarded no complaints to the health and safety executive <e> <s> however if the noble baroness has evidence to support her case i shall of course be interested in seeing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that would be useful information but i regret that i have no information on either of those two projects <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i am able to agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a useful contribution from my noble friend who has experience in such matters <e> <s> perhaps i may tell him that the contractors themselves are worried and <e>", "<cs> my lords this construction site is way above the average for the construction industry as a whole <e> <s> that is partly due to under-reporting in the rest of the construction industry <e> <s> i am not able to tell the noble lord how it compares with other industries overall <e> <s> in any case i am not sure that that is strictly relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that there is a certain amount of under-reporting <e> <s> when the contractors are caught out the full weight of the law is brought to bear <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> to that effect the secretary of state has already met with the chief executive of the contractors consortium to discuss the position of the safety of workers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that with his experience in those matters the noble lord should use statistics so selectively <e> <s> when we deal with statistics involving the construction industry we include plumbers carpenters and even decorators <e> <s> when we deal with the channel tunnel we deal with people who work deep underground under the sea and that is obviously bound to be more dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords the hse is working on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords dundee <e>", "<cs> my lords it comes as no surprise that we have had a most interesting debate <e> <s> however it comes as a surprise that i was accused of not speaking for long enough on my introductory speech <e> <s> that is because the bill is short and simple and i thought that i should keep my speech within the same vein <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to produce figures when we reach committee stage if that is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall return to that point in a moment <e> <s> i shall first deal with other european legislation and the accusation that other countries somehow have better employment laws than we have in this country <e> <s> in many respects other european countries place far greater restrictions on industrial action than we do <e> <s> for example legally enforceable collective agreements are the norm in all community countries except the united kingdom and ireland <e> <s> in germany denmark and belgium any strike in breach of the peace-keeping provisions of the collective agreement is unlawful <e> <s> industrial action is unlawful if its effects are out of proportion with the demands being made and the courts will decide whether that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords we have responded to the accusations from the ilo <e> <s> i am not sure that we have received a reply to that response <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly consider that point if it is seen to save time <e> <s> however i have to point out that the legislation on unfair dismissal enacted by the last labour government which made dismissal of strikers fair made no special provision for refusal to work on grounds of health and safety <e> <s> there was no need then and i do not believe that there is any need now <e> <s> in any case it is very far from obvious that simply stopping work is always the right response for an employee who genuinely believes that working conditions are unsafe <e> <s> except in a minority of cases where there is in fact or is believed to be real and serious risk of personal injury there are other options <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that that evidence would necessarily prove anything either way <e> <s> the noble lord lord mellish also asked for evidence about the requirement to hold a ballot before strikes <e> <s> there is a principle involved here <e> <s> the government believe that it is entirely right that a union should hold a proper ballot before calling for industrial action by its members <e> <s> again there are some members of the noble lords party who agree with that <e> <s> that is what the law provides and it has an enormous amount of support from employers and union members themselves <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> my lords there does not have to be a ballot or a strike <e> <s> there can be negotiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to look at the notes if they exist as i am sure they do <e> <s> as the noble lord said that is something we shall be able to return to in committee <e> <s> my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter made an excellent speech when he traced the history of employment legislation in this country <e> <s> he proved how successful it had been in reducing strikes <e> <s> that is the subject we shall be able to return to next wednesday in our debate <e>", "<cs> my lords when it comes to the noble lords figures and to the amount of research that has taken place on government legislation and its effect on strikes there is a great deal of uncertainty and confusion <e> <s> the noble lord has made his case <e> <s> it is not one that is universally agreed and i doubt whether it will become so <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord in commending the united government stand on this matter <e> <s> the commission has adopted an action programme for tackling fraud <e> <s> at the instigation of the united kingdom it now has procedures for considering special reports by the european court of auditors such as the recent report on export refunds <e> <s> in january this year the commission published its first annual report on fraud which was debated in another place on th february <e> <s> for its part the uk takes every opportunity to ensure that the momentum of the fight against fraud is maintained <e> <s> it is for those reasons that we do not feel that we are hiding our light under a bushel <e> <s> after all over the past few months we have had several questions in the house on precisely this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to try to stimulate our european colleagues on this matter <e> <s> i must emphaise that we have taken the lead in insisting that the community should tackle seriously the problem of fraud and of inadequate management which is at the root of the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly urge that suggestion on my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the usual channels have heard my noble friends suggestion <e> <s> concrete progress has been made in the area on export refund monitoring on proof of arrival of export for claiming refunds on a new code of conduct for reporting all significant frauds and irregularities in relation to structural fund receipts and on tougher regulations relating to the payment of our own resources <e> <s> we are not complacent <e> <s> we believe that there is still a great deal to be done and we are in the vanguard of the fight against fraud <e>", "<cs> my lords we continue to fight fraud with our community partners and with the commission <e> <s> in the united kingdom we have already increased resources devoted to the undertaking of physical checks <e> <s> we have provided extra training for customs staff we have insisted on better facilities for cap export examinations and we have concentrated special investigator-led drives in high risk areas <e> <s> as i said we are not complacent <e> <s> we believe that there is still more work to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to answer the noble lords questions <e> <s> no one knows what is the total amount of fraud against the community budget <e> <s> various estimates have been made but i should not give more credence to one than to another by mentioning a figure <e> <s> therefore it is not possible to give the noble lord the percentage of the fraud which may have been committed by british agricultural producers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i may not be able to answer the noble baronesss question fully <e> <s> however approximately officers have been given extra training in order better to direct attention to higher risk areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that a debate can be organised through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that the historical perspective has anything to do with the question <e>", "<cs> my lords since the number of people self-employed has risen by more than per cent <e> <s> to million in december <e>", "<cs> my lords during the same period the number of self-employed women more than doubled <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a range of schemes designed to help small businesses for example the enterprise allowance scheme the loan guarantee scheme the enterprise initiative and a variety of other government-backed schemes <e> <s> they are designed to help and advise small businesses on how to become more successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot point to one scheme in particular and say that it has been the most successful <e> <s> however the government have been most successful in helping small businesses by creating a stable business environment lowering taxation and having less government red tape <e>", "<cs> my lords the uniform aspect of the business rate will be extremely helpful to small businesses in enabling them to budget for future rate increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that people have had the initiative to set themselves up in businesses of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been a good regional spread of self-employment growth of approximately per cent <e> <s> in the south-west to just under per cent <e> <s> in the northern region <e>", "<cs> my lords people who are self-employed cover the full range of business activities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not quite correct in what he says because less than one in six of self-employed people work part-time <e> <s> in recent years the growth has been strongest among full-time self-employed people <e>", "<cs> my lords the question deals with self-employed people <e> <s> in any case part-time work sometimes suits people very well <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not separate self-employed business failures from other kinds of business failures <e> <s> however i can tell the noble baroness that on vat statistics generally in early indications showed that there was an increase of vat registrations per week <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well be true but the noble lord stated that my right honourable friend the secretary of state had no time for trade <e>", "<cs> i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords i say right at the outset how much i have enjoyed this afternoons debate <e> <s> i commend particularly the words of my noble friend lord caldecote and underline how much i share his views on trade unions <e> <s> there is no question of any kind of ideological attack on trade unionism only opposition to the irresponsible abuse of trade union power <e> <s> that is why i did not fully understand the speech of the noble lord lord dean of beswick but since he is not in the chamber perhaps we shall return to that issue later <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter suggests that it is indulging in a pastime somewhere in the royal county of berkshire <e> <s> he may well be correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should take that up with the leader of his own party rather than with my right honourable friend the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely why we are reforming the training system <e> <s> we are involved in a host of education initiatives such as tvei compacts high technology national training work-related further education open learning and career development loans <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord rochester will approve of many of these initiatives <e>", "<cs> not really my lords it was entirely up to the unions and their members to do so through the secret ballot <e> <s> what is perhaps surprising is that when those measures came before the house the party of the noble baroness voted against them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have taken many other steps to introduce greater democracy within unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand the noble lords stand on this matter <e> <s> i do not understand how he can pick and choose which laws from other countries he wishes to welcome <e> <s> indeed there are plenty of others which he would not choose <e>", "<cs> my lords this has nothing to do with procedural actions <e> <s> the united kingdom has not been condemned by the ilo <e> <s> as i said the tuc withdrew the complaint that it had made <e> <s> clearly the tuc had no confidence that the ilo would uphold its views <e>", "<cs> my lords i reaffirm what i have already said the united kingdom has not been condemned by the ilo <e> <s> therefore let us leave this subject at least for the time being <e> <s> i fear that we must simply beg to differ on this particular view of the ilo <e> <s> i repeat we have not been condemned by the ilo <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course write to the noble lord lord rochester on these matters if it proves to be necessary <e> <s> however perhaps i may briefly say that the government commend the ipm and the ipa for their excellent voluntary code of practice on employee involvement <e> <s> we believe that it will contribute significantly to voluntary developments in this important area <e> <s> as i said i shall write to the noble lord if there is a point that i have missed <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the opportunity that the noble lord lord dean of beswick has given to discuss worker health and safety on the channel tunnel project <e> <s> i do so particularly since he has had a certain amount of experience from visiting the site yesterday <e> <s> that experience helps us in our deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that the hse has received no allegations from the workforce about safety on the site <e> <s> those allegations can be received in confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords we very much want to see progress in the social area <e> <s> we fully support the idea of a social dimension to the single market <e> <s> we believe that that is best achieved by completion of the single market stimulating economic growth and reducing unemployment <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and now the whole house will also be aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the government feel that the social charter is inconsistent with the agreement reached by all heads of state and governments at the madrid meeting of the european council in june <e> <s> the agreement was that job creation and development should have top priority in the achievement of the single market <e> <s> the government also say that despite the difficulties we have with the social charter we shall play a full part in the negotiations on the individual proposals in the european commissions action programme of measures to implement the charter <e>", "<cs> no my lords not really <e> <s> we feel that there are some aspects of the action programme arising out of the social charter which we shall be able to accept <e> <s> there is no point in signing up to per cent <e> <s> of an agreement which involves a programme that we simply could not accept <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it was the labour partys approval of the social charter which has now caused it so much confusion about where it stands on the issue of the closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why as individual proposals come out of the commissions action programme we shall definitely be playing a full part in negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very valid point <e> <s> one of the steps we have taken is to ensure that implementation is fully recorded by the european commission and that it reports regularly to the council of ministers to advise member states on exactly how implementation is progressing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear the noble baroness state that point <e> <s> it confirms what my noble friend lord orr-ewing said namely that the labour party has now rejected the principle of the closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand that there will be some proposals on health and safety at work which we shall be quite willing to discuss in the most positive way <e> <s> however there are other proposals on part-time work which we feel would be detrimental to the employment prospects of people working in this country <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the charter itself if not legally enforceable it is simply a political declaration <e> <s> it is from the social charter that the commission has set up its action programmes <e> <s> their legal base will be decided on individual merits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house has heard the noble lords view <e>", "<cs> my lords that simply shows that we are a party which is committed to freedom of discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords this country has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the european community <e> <s> our youth unemployment is below half the average in the european community <e> <s> those statistics speak for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the construction industry training board and my department are still conducting negotiations on the volumes and funding of youth training undertaken by the board <e> <s> these negotiations are not yet complete and i am therefore not able to comment on them at this stage <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think that there is any prospect of youth training ceasing to be a programme of the citb <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already shown our commitment to the citb by leaving it in its statutory format while other industry training organisations have been privatised <e> <s> by the same token however we feel that employers themselves should play a greater part in contributing towards the training of their future employees <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely because of what the noble lord said that we feel that employers should contribute more to the training of their future employees <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it strange that noble lords opposite occasionally try to lecture us on economic management and on the inflation rate <e> <s> the most recent increase in the rate of inflation is due to large increases in the community charge which added per cent <e> <s> to the rpi inflation rate from april <e> <s> as for unemployment we have seen a record fall during the course of the past few years and we hope that that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords pay is generally decided between managers and their employees <e> <s> on the matter of government pay we always insist on moderation and that pay settlements must be earned <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we have always said that we would join the european monetary system when the time was right <e> <s> we have continued to say that one of the conditions that must be met before we can join the mechanism is for us to have a lower inflation rate <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always delighted to listen to the words of the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> however perhaps i may remind him that in august the inflation rate was nearly per cent <e> <s> that did not do very much to help the worst off in our society <e>", "<cs> my lords that was largely caused by the state of the economy that was left to us by the party of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> i meant august but that was a long time ago <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> we still feel that inflation will come down to around per cent <e> <s> within the course of next year <e> <s> we do not look just at retail sales figures but also at house prices and a whole host of other indexes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always made clear that pay in the private sector has to be decided between managers directors shareholders and employees <e> <s> it is not for the government to dictate wage increases <e>", "<cs> my lords there are certainly signs of a resurgence in exports <e>", "<cs> my lords the money raised by the community charge as compared with rates has increased by some per cent <e> <s> that has nothing to do with the government and everything to do with local authorities <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned unemployment over the past four months <e> <s> there has been a very slight increase in the number of unemployed <e> <s> that is largely due to high wage settlements <e> <s> we hope that there will be pay moderation we have always argued for that and that in the long term that will reduce unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on any particular case <e> <s> however if an employer changes an employees terms and conditions against the will of the latter it is open to the employee to sue through the courts for breach of contract <e> <s> alternatively if the employee considers that the contract of employment has been repudiated he may resign and make a complaint of constructive unfair dismissal to an industrial tribunal <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall enjoy a far fuller debate on tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole house is enriched by the experiences of my noble friend in this matter <e>", "<cs> of course my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i must remind the noble lord that under existing legislation that was enacted by the previous labour government an employer is allowed to dismiss all those who have breached their contracts of employment through taking industrial action <e> <s> such an employer does not have to face claims of unfair dismissal from those who have been dismissed through taking such action <e> <s> we are improving the situation under the terms of the new bill <e>", "<cs> my lords that is precisely the kind of issue that we shall be able to discuss next week <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to reply to questions from noble lords in this house on any subject but it is normally the case that questions constitute requests for information <e> <s> i try to supply that information as ably as i can <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> that is after all a matter to be decided between employers and employees <e>", "<cs> i did not expect for one moment that we should have such an interesting and lively debate on this amendment <e> <s> perhaps it will be helpful if i set out precisely what we mean in clause of the bill <e> <s> it seeks to ensure that an individuals union membership or non-membership will have no bearing whatsoever on the availability of job opportunities to him <e> <s> subsection of the clause accordingly makes it unlawful for an employer to refuse to employ a person on the ground that he is or is not a union member <e> <s> that is the point that i believe the noble lord lord monkswell was trying to make about fairness <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain that <e> <s> the bar council is not covered by the statutory definition of a trade union contained in section of the then labour governments trade union and labour relations act nor are practising barristers and solicitors workers within the definition laid down by section of that act <e>", "<cs> no i simply believe that the noble lord lord dean of beswick misunderstood what my noble friends were saying <e> <s> both of them said that this was an extraordinary amendment and i entirely concur with that <e>", "<cs> clause seeks to ensure that an individuals ability to obtain a job will not be affected by whether or not he is a member of a trade union <e> <s> that is an important new protection for job applicants i emphasise that and it is entirely even-handed since it will make the pre-entry closed shop unenforceable while at the same time providing protection for union members <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has that right <e>", "<cs> perhaps i misunderstood the noble baroness when she introduced the amendment <e> <s> i was not entirely clear what activities the amendment sought to protect <e> <s> therefore what i said stands we do not wish to see an obligation upon employers that they must employ an employee who has quite consistently had an appalling trade union track record of being militant and of organising the kind of activities that would be thoroughly irresponsible in the new company <e> <s> in other words that is exactly the way the law stands now <e>", "<cs> we shall be able to discuss so-called blacklisting later in the bill when noble lords opposite will introduce a new clause specifically on that subject <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness lady turner of camden i shall speak to both amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i think that i shall disappoint the noble lord because there is not a great deal that i can add to my comments on amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> it must be true to say that the government cannot possibly accept the premise of this amendment that it should be unlawful for an employer to refuse a person <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> of the noble lord lord mccarthy was not formally grouped with the government amendments to which i have spoken <e> <s> however if it meets with the approval of the committee i am more than happy to speak to that amendment <e>", "<cs> i take it that the committee is happy that i should speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i understand why the noble lord feels that it is closely connected with the government amendments which were inspired by the opposition in another place <e>", "<cs> i hope that this amendment is not too vague <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady phillips perhaps i may say that we are trying to be as conciliatory as possible to the opposition <e> <s> i am not sure what the terms of the opposition amendment were in committee or at report stage in another place but i am sure that somebody helpful will be able to point the noble baroness in the right direction to enable her to make her own comparison <e>", "<cs> if the first clause of this bill is passed it will undoubtedly represent one of the most important landmarks in the history of industrial relations and trade union law in this country by signalling the end of the pre-entry closed shop <e> <s> the post-entry closed shop is already unenforceable but it is still lawful for an employer to refuse to engage workers because they are not or indeed because they are members of a trade union <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to repeat all the points that i made when referring to the earlier opposition amendments concerning trade union activities but it can safely be assumed that much of what i said then applies to the new clause after clause with which we are now dealing <e> <s> i must say at the <e>", "<cs> i see the amendment in a far more definite light but there we are <e> <s> i am not a lawyer and i cannot look at the matter with legal precision <e> <s> i still suspect which is why i said that i believed the effect was unintentional that the amendment would have the effect that i said it would have though i accept that the noble lord lord wedderburn has said that that effect is not intentional and that that is not what is required <e>", "<cs> absolutely <e>", "<cs> the case for making changes to the provisions of the present section of the act which concerns immunity for threatening or organising secondary industrial action was set out in the green paper <e>", "<cs> i am confident that the ilo will not condemn clause <e>", "<cs> international comparisons are a red herring <e> <s> it may well be instructive to know what happens overseas but no other country has the same framework of industrial relations and trade union law or the same industrial relations institutions and traditions <e> <s> the bill is concerned with getting the right framework for this country and not for a country overseas <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to extend the scope of immunity for organising secondary action beyond that proposed by clause and beyond the scope of immunity allowed by the present law <e> <s> that is what i understand the amendment to mean <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord wedderburn <e> <s> in that case perhaps i can return to ballots and section of the act which allows aggregation of votes as the noble lord described but only where all the workers are in dispute with their own employers <e> <s> if there are employees in dispute then their action will be primary action and nothing in clause will make their action unlawful <e>", "<cs> i feel that the arrangements proposed by the amendment are neither necessary nor desirable <e>", "<cs> this amendment like the others tabled by the opposition seeks to extend the scope of immunity for organising secondary action beyond that proposed by clause and beyond the scope of immunity allowed by the present law <e>", "<cs> before i comment on these two amendments it would be helpful if i explained the purpose and the effect of the subsection in clause which they seek to modify <e> <s> subsection ensures that where workers take primary action in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute with their own employer that cannot be held to be secondary action simply because looked at from the point of view of another employer it has secondary effects <e> <s> for example if a primary dispute closed a factory one result might be albeit as a by-product to cut off supplies to another employer who was also involved in a different dispute with his own workers <e>", "<cs> clause of the bill removes immunity for organising or threatening to organise secondary industrial action <e> <s> it thereby establishes the principle that an employer should have a remedy if he is threatened with industrial action even though he is not a party to a trade dispute <e> <s> the only exception is to be for inducing secondary action in the course of peaceful picketing as the current law allows <e> <s> the clause makes no change to the legal liability of anyone taking part in industrial action as my noble friend lord renton explained <e> <s> its terms are relevant to the <e>", "<cs> if that is the case must say yet again that the opposition are not giving all the facts <e> <s> it is untrue that the ilo has condemned the present law <e> <s> it is equally untrue to suggest that the ilo has yet condemned clause as drafted <e> <s> we have every reason to believe that that body will not condemn clause <e> <s> however what is true <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will let me finish what i have to say <e> <s> the whole point is that we never reach the end of the story on the ilo <e> <s> let us get the position absolutely right <e> <s> last summer an ilo advisory committee made an observation on aspects of uk compliance with ilo convention no <e> <s> <e> <s> there was absolutely nothing extraordinary about that <e> <s> the very same committee in its report queried aspects of the law in various european countries <e> <s> there is nothing wrong with that <e> <s> a process of dialogue between that kind of committee and the governments of member countries of the ilo is quite normal <e> <s> the united kingdom government have responded to the committees observations <e> <s> however as is always the case the response was given to the ilo in confidence <e> <s> members of the committee opposite know that <e>", "<cs> as i understand the position as the tuc has withdrawn its complaints to the ilo there is simply no need to have any constructive negotiations because there are no complaints to discuss <e> <s> no doubt we shall enjoy some more debates on the ilo as the committee continues on its course through the bill <e>", "<cs> that is purely an argument of semantics <e> <s> we have now got rid of that potential <e> <s> if members of the committee opposite support that kind of action it is entirely a matter for them <e> <s> perhaps they do not go to dundee very often <e> <s> i do <e> <s> it is difficult to talk to the people of dundee on this issue following the loss of the ford plant <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester has done so again today so i am not sure why he has decided that clause should be opposed <e>", "<cs> that is an entirely reasonable position for the noble lord lord rochester to take <e> <s> however he will admit that there is no evidence to suggest that any employer ever has gone or ever will go to all the sweat of setting up separate companies so as to create what would now be illegal secondary action whereas by supporting the socialists and opposing the clause he allows such things as the blacking of ford usa dundee to occur <e> <s> we have seen the threat and potential disaster that that has caused <e>", "<cs> it is certainly true that the term industrial action appears or will appear by virtue of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can briefly say to the noble baroness that she must be aware that by this current bill we get rid of the closed shop and secondary action and we are about to get rid of unofficial action <e> <s> we are making things less and less legalistic <e> <s> we are getting rid of the type of problems in which the noble lords lord wedderburn and lord mccarthy seek to indulge <e> <s> we are less legalistic <e> <s> it is precisely this new clause that would create the kind of problems that the noble baroness does not wish to see <e>", "<cs> that would fulfil the reasonably practicable aspect of the clause <e> <s> perhaps i may more fully explain what exactly clause does <e> <s> it remedies an anomaly in the present law <e> <s> as explained in the green paper <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wedderburn will be glad to know that i think his amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> section of the trade union act requires the union to accord an entitlement to vote to all those members of the trade union who it is reasonable at the time of the ballot for the union to believe will be induced to take part or as the case may be to continue to take part in the strike or industrial action <e> <s> it is clear that the question of entitlement to vote falls to be decided by reference to union members employed by the relevant employer at the time of the ballot <e> <s> therefore to suggest that the <e>", "<cs> i thought that that was the point the noble baroness was trying to make in respect of a <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord donaldson of lymington said that the point would repay consideration <e> <s> the government have considered it <e> <s> they see no reason to change the law <e>", "<cs> the green paper <e>", "<cs> but by passing this amendment and specifically excluding it in the rules the unions would get round the effects of this clause entirely and there would not be any point in having it <e> <s> there would be no requirement to repudiate <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i understand the point that the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> presumably the rule book could be changed to take account of that <e> <s> so far as i can see it is totally unnecessary to accept this point on the basis that the unions could adjust their rule books in such a way as to avoid the repudiation of procedure and avoid the total effect of the clause <e> <s> i may well be wrong but that is what i understand <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mccarthy said that trade unions were complicated <e> <s> we are trying to make them less complicated by making sure that repudiation affects everybody lay or official who calls action in the unions name <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord lord wedderburn mentioned the procedure for effective repudiation although like him i am aware that we shall be discussing that point in greater detail in a few moments <e> <s> an understanding of the process of repudiation is vital <e> <s> we cannot have exceptions to the clause brought in by noble lords opposite <e> <s> the point of the clause would be ruined <e> <s> effective repudiation is an easy hurdle to overcome <e> <s> it is reasonable and right it is not too onerous <e> <s> therefore unions always have the ability to say that they are not responsible <e> <s> if they do that they have no liability and there is no problem <e>", "<cs> i say to the noble baroness that in this case she is quite right <e> <s> the amendment does not subvert the clause <e> <s> instead it seeks to introduce uncertainty and delay into the repudiation process <e> <s> that is why the amendment is unacceptable <e> <s> superficially it might seem to involve only a minor change to make it easier for unions to comply with the law <e> <s> it will not improve the positive intent of subsection <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to transform a clear statement of a unions repudiation into a lottery <e> <s> it will make it uncertain who has been notified and how <e> <s> it will benefit neither union nor employer nor members <e> <s> of course that is exactly what the noble lord lord mccarthy wants <e>", "<cs> the green paper <e>", "<cs> i rather feel that the noble lord lord wedderburn is making very heavy weather of all this <e> <s> the provisions of the new section a are not necessarily the most significant or important of the changes that clause would make to section of the act nonetheless they are useful and logical changes <e> <s> there is certainly no case for removing these provisions or modifying them in the way proposed by the amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment adds an arbitrary period of two weeks to the requirement to inform a customer or supplier whether the union had or had not effectively repudiated a relevant act which had affected or could well affect commercial contracts to which it was party <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord accept that we are not talking here about repudiation but about confirmation <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> it has nothing to do with any other union <e> <s> surely the union will know whether it repudiated something even it it was five months ago <e> <s> it just has to confirm it <e> <s> it is simple <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord lord mccarthy is getting excited about nothing <e> <s> he simply has not proved his case that it is not possible for the union simply to confirm that it has repudiated something <e> <s> it cannot be that difficult <e> <s> the court would not expect a union to do more than was practicable to satisfy the requirement to respond to the inquiry forthwith <e> <s> that is why i feel that the noble lord is getting excited about nothing <e> <s> he has not made his case <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that the noble lord has yet grasped that we are not talking about repudiation but confirmation <e> <s> all the union has to do is confirm yes we repudiate it <e> <s> by all means why does the union not confirm that it repudiated action which had nothing to do with it <e> <s> it does not seem to make much difference so long as the union provides the confirmation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has failed to appreciate that the amendment we are discussing does not change the position <e> <s> the trade union could easily wait two weeks before it sent off its confirmation and exactly the same situation would exist as if it were sent forthwith <e>", "<cs> it is exceptional for the costs of carrying out statutory duties to be subsidised from public funds <e> <s> the position in respect of trade unions is no different and there is no good reason why the public should bear any of the costs which properly fall upon trade unions in discharging their statutory duties <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that that is not what i said <e> <s> he argued that there was an inconsistency <e> <s> there need not be an inconsistency <e> <s> there is no inconsistency and there is no basic right that statutory duties should be subsidised from public funds <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e> <s> i made the position quite plain as regards the ballot funding scheme <e> <s> the government have no plans to abolish it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is right <e> <s> the union has a very clear choice as to what it does the point of the statutory duty is that it gives the choice <e> <s> however as i said though i do not believe the noble lord heard me the first time the ballot funding scheme was established to encourage the voluntary extension of balloting before industrial action <e> <s> the law was subsequently changed to require unions to ballot their members as a condition of securing immunity from legal proceedings <e> <s> just because we did that then does not mean that we need to do it now <e> <s> it is as simple as that <e>", "<cs> there is nothing more that i can usefully add <e> <s> if the noble lord does not accept what i have said then i am sorry <e> <s> we do not see why public funds should be used to subsidise this scheme <e> <s> the noble lord has not made a case except to say that because we provide funds in one case we should do so in another <e> <s> that is not much of an argument <e>", "<cs> the amendment would enable a union to avoid potential liability for any relevant act of its officials or committees if the union happened to have a rule which provided that in relevant circumstances an official who did a certain act was no longer to be regarded as an official the obvious implication of the amendment <e> <s> what would happen if any such option was to be open to unions <e> <s> it must be reasonable to assume that unions would proceed forthwith to make such rules as were necessary to restore the status quo <e> <s> certainly the unions rules might then deny shop stewards the authority to call for industrial action on behalf of the union <e> <s> but would members appreciate that sort of technical difference <e> <s> i venture to suggest they would not <e>", "<cs> the government certainly do not want to look absurd in putting through this legislation and it is fair that the noble lord lord wedderburn should point out the inadequacy of this point <e> <s> i do not like the amendment but there may be something in what the noble lord says so on that basis i am happy to reconsider the matter without any commitment to bringing forward something on report <e> <s> however i will examine the position carefully <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has said these amendments bring us into the territory of a matter which i know is one which members of the committee opposite regard very strongly <e> <s> it may be helpful if i first address amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these seek to remove the provisions of section and section of the act proposed by the bill <e> <s> the effect would be to prevent the provisions of section of the act from applying to contempt of court proceedings <e> <s> i should add that amendment no <e> <s> appears somewhat otiose since it proposes to remove a word that is in one of the lines that amendment no <e> <s> proposes to delete <e>", "<cs> it is right that a union should be responsible when any of its officials call or threaten to call industrial action which will interfere with contracts <e> <s> the time is right to amend the provisions of section of the act which are relevant to union liability for such acts <e> <s> it is spurious to argue that a unions liability for such acts should not be subject to statutory prohibitions <e> <s> first the basic immunity for such acts is itself a statutory creation <e> <s> secondly unions are bodies which the law has long recognised as appropriate for special treatment and there is no valid comparison with west end clubs of any kind <e> <s> thirdly there is no valid analogy with other bodies or associations as their purposes are different from those of trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble baroness <e> <s> the tvei programme is expanding at a considerable rate <e> <s> by september education authorities will be in the extension phase <e> <s> we all have to operate within the resources available to us <e> <s> no time or money that the schools will put into working out the initiative will have been wasted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very unfortunate if it is getting around that the government are not committed to training and technical and vocational <e>", "<cs> i confirm that employers are very impressed with tvei and have seen a marked improvement in the quality of the school leavers whom they are taking on <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always maintained that million would be spent and million will be spent <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in reply to an earlier question by september out of education authorities in england scotland and wales will be in the extension phase of tvei <e> <s> we remain committed to including the remaining <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some schools and teachers are naturally disappointed <e> <s> but as i said every local authority will be receiving its full share of funding over the life of the programme <e> <s> that is very commendable <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the overall budget has not been cut <e>", "<cs> my lords on the short notice point education authorities were advised in may in respect of the coming academic year <e> <s> on the question of cuts the overall budget for the overall programme has not been cut <e>", "<cs> this new clause which was inserted at report stage in the commons will prevent unauthorised officials taking advantage of a majority yes vote in a ballot to call <e>", "<cs> i very much welcome the words of my noble friend lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> when he asks me whether or not i will be able to convince members of the committee opposite of the correctness of this particular clause i admit i have my doubts <e> <s> my track record on these issues is not particularly great <e> <s> however i realise that the noble lord lord rochester has a far more open mind on such matters <e>", "<cs> faced with this amendment it is my turn to wonder whether members of the committee opposite have a proper understanding of what might be the real world effects of the industrial relations legislation which they apparently favour <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly find out the provenance of that case <e>", "<cs> this clause was added to the bill at commons report stage <e> <s> it is a logical extension to the law to take account of other provisions in the bill <e> <s> the clause will prevent shop stewards taking advantage of ballots on official strikes to organise unofficial action <e> <s> it requires a union to specify on the voting paper who will call the industrial action to which a ballot relates if there is a majority vote in favour and the union wishes there to be such a call <e>", "<cs> i wish the noble lord lord mccarthy had asked that question earlier when we were discussing the detailed provisions of the clause rather than when we are discussing clause stand part <e> <s> i shall certainly need to read a little more carefully what the noble lord lord mccarthy said and come back to him <e>", "<cs> no i am not sure that i can give an example to the noble lord lord wedderburn <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble lord lord monkswell he is asking what would happen if in a workplace a proper ballot were to take place organised by the trade union in that workplace and all the members in the proper way were asked to vote <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble baroness i do not think this amendment is about an appeal <e> <s> it is about whether there has been due warning <e>", "<cs> there is a certain amount of confusion over the amendment <e> <s> there is a certain amount of confusion about the existing law and how within the bill we have changed the rules concerning unofficial action and therefore the effect of the clause <e> <s> i say that because my noble friend lord campbell of alloway asked me to consider carefully the points of fairness and moral responsibility <e> <s> i hope within the next few minutes to show that that point has been considered effectively that the problem that my noble friend thinks exists does not that the provisions are entirely fair and considerably improve the current law and that the amendments are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i shall answer the point on victimisation in a moment <e> <s> the issue remains the same <e> <s> the principle under current legislation passed by the labour government is that if everybody is sacked there is no appeal no notice <e> <s> that is the principle which noble lords opposite seek to overturn with these amendments <e> <s> that is not consistent <e>", "<cs> under the bill official action is action called for by a union official <e> <s> that is the position with which we are dealing and that is the distinction between official and unofficial action <e> <s> the great advantage about unofficial action is that the employee has a choice <e> <s> if employees refrain from unofficial action there will be no grounds to enable an employer to victimise anyone by virtue of the provisions in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not think that the problem arises <e> <s> the choice is surely whether it is official action or unofficial action <e> <s> it is not for me to decide what is official and what is unofficial action <e> <s> it will be up to the tribunal to decide whether or not the employee has been dismissed correctly <e> <s> that is the tribunals decision not mine <e> <s> all we are saying is that where there is unofficial action and the employer chooses to <e>", "<cs> we have strayed from the amendments that we were discussing which deal with the matter of due notice and the problems of appeals to a tribunal victimisation and other such matters <e> <s> we have now returned to clause <e> <s> i am quite happy about that <e> <s> however i should make some points clear <e> <s> action which is taken only by non-union members is not unofficial action for the purposes of this clause <e> <s> however action taken by union members which is not organised by a union official is unofficial whether or not it is balloted <e> <s> that is the main point here <e>", "<cs> one working day <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has not been entirely convinced by my words and that he feels that the greatest problem with the amendment is a drafting problem <e> <s> that may be true <e> <s> of course it will ultimately be up to the noble lord lord rochester to decide what he wishes to do about the amendment <e>", "<cs> these amendments relate to an issue about the terms of the proposed new section a of the act and indeed the present law on dismissal while taking industrial action <e> <s> both were debated at length during consideration of the bill in another place <e> <s> throughout those debates the government made clear the fact that we fully share the aim of ensuring that health and safety standards at workplaces are maintained or improved <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with that point specifically <e> <s> i believe that that is the case <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> there is a basic principle of health and safety legislation which is that it is illegal to demand an employee to work on a machine which is fundamentally unsafe <e> <s> so the point made by the noble lord is already dealt with <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i have a certain amount of sympathy with the noble baroness because it is a difficult distinction to make <e> <s> it is quite clear that although there is an element of pressure in itself by not working because of a fear of working on unsafe machinery that does not necessarily mean that it amounts to industrial action <e> <s> that is the point <e>", "<cs> it is the intention behind the stoppage of work <e>", "<cs> all the cases which we are talking about here are entirely and purely theoretical <e> <s> no court or tribunal has ever found any difficulty in dealing with this subject <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> there is no prospect of an employer obliging his employees to work in unsafe conditions <e> <s> that is a red herring and has nothing to do with this point <e>", "<cs> it is illegal for an employer to require his employees to work on unsafe machinery <e> <s> that is clearly the basis of the law as it stands <e> <s> these amendments have nothing to do with health and safety and everything to do with allowing employees to take unofficial action and be protected for doing so <e>", "<cs> i have said this before clearly where employees stop work simply because they fear for their own safety that would not by itself constitute taking part in industrial action any more than it would if they refused to go back to work in the same conditions simply because they continued to believe that they were unsafe <e> <s> no court or tribunal this is a point made by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and noble lords opposite know this perfectly well have ever found that a simple refusal to do unsafe work amounts to taking part in industrial action for the purposes of the law on unfair dismissal <e> <s> that must be the point <e> <s> that must allay the fears of the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that situation has not changed from the current law <e> <s> we are talking about a new distinction of unofficial action <e> <s> we have gone through what makes unofficial action and what does not make unofficial action <e> <s> it is for the union to repudiate action which could be official <e> <s> if it is official there is no problem <e> <s> if the union repudiates it and it becomes unofficial then the employee knows full well the consequences of that decision <e>", "<cs> i must answer this point <e> <s> this aspect of the bill is not about health and safety at work <e> <s> it concerns unofficial action <e> <s> the directive is one thing <e> <s> we have no problem with the british law on the health and safety directives <e> <s> this aspect of the bill concerns unofficial industrial action and nothing else <e>", "<cs> the directive is clearly about self-preservation where there is danger and only that <e> <s> that is not what we are discussing <e> <s> where there is clearly a genuine perceived danger over self-preservation no court or tribunal in this country has found that to be industrial action and none will <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally withdraws the amendment i make two brief points <e> <s> he twice referred to injuries and the fact that they have increased over the past few years <e> <s> that is not the case so far as i can see <e> <s> there has been a steady decline in fatal injuries since <e> <s> the incidence of fatal accidents has been considerably reduced over the past years <e> <s> that is important <e>", "<cs> as i said earlier though i do not suppose i made it clear enough the government fully share the aim of ensuring that health and safety standards at workplaces are maintained or improved <e> <s> we also deprecate any breach by an employer of any statutory duty arising under the terms of any of the various acts mentioned in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to point out to the noble baroness that it is not the employer who decides what is official or unofficial action it is the tribunal <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> in addressing the amendment i think that it is once again useful to remind ourselves that the bill proposes a package of measures to deter and discourage unofficial action <e> <s> in addition the present law requires unions properly to ballot their members before calling or organising industrial action <e>", "<cs> it does not surprise me that the noble lord asks me for the source and evidence because he probably knows that i do not have them to hand <e> <s> however i know that the tucs position is in principle that it does not wish to see unofficial action encouraged <e>", "<cs> i ask the committee to remember that action is only unofficial when the union has repudiated it <e> <s> if the union does not repudiate it and it has lawfully organised the action it is perfectly official action <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> the amendment proposes does the noble lord wish to labour the point further <e>", "<cs> it is an overriding principle of industrial relations law that no action need be taken until it has been balloted on <e> <s> the whole point of modern industrial relations law is to avoid strikes <e> <s> inspiration has reached me about the reference to the tuc <e> <s> i understand that in a letter to the secretary of state for employment about health and safety in clause the tuc took this position on unofficial action <e>", "<cs> it is not for a union to decide what is official or unofficial <e> <s> it is up to the union to decide whether or not to repudiate action taken at a local level <e> <s> there is a world of difference between those two concepts <e> <s> surely it must be better for a union that wants to hold a ballot on industrial action and contemplates making a dispute official to do all it can to convince its members taking unofficial action to return to work pending the organisation of a proper ballot <e> <s> that strikes me as being the most reasonable position <e> <s> however that is obviously not the case with the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the union can move perfectly fast enough to explain to its members that a far better course of action is to hold a proper ballot <e> <s> as the amendment stands there would be little incentive for a union to do that <e> <s> during the seven working days following the proposed notification of procedure the employer would be denied the freedom selectively to dismiss those taking unofficial action as a means of bringing it to an end <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn admits that <e> <s> the employer would be denied that option whether or not the union eventually held a properly conducted ballot <e> <s> that in itself leads to a further problem <e> <s> the employer would not be prevented from dismissing all of those taking the unofficial action during the seven-day period <e> <s> accordingly if the unofficial action was taken by only some employees those calling for the action might argue that other employees should join in to make it more difficult for the employer to dismiss them all <e>", "<cs> on the current groupings list amendments nos <e> <s> and are taken separately <e> <s> however i understand that on the proposed grouping list which was around yesterday and which the noble lord lord rochester has the government had proposed that amendments nos <e> <s> and should be dealt with together <e> <s> as it happens i have made my point about amendment no <e> <s> and i hope that the noble lord will accept that <e> <s> however the amendments should be taken individually <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness makes an excellent point <e> <s> no doubt the fact that the employees will not be hanging around the yard will be useful when we deal with other amendments <e>", "<cs> i simply used the example which the noble baroness gave <e> <s> if the workers who are on strike are in the pub that is entirely up to them <e> <s> the point is that if people are on strike it is a serious issue <e> <s> the union officials must know where to find the majority of them <e> <s> they do not have to contact every single one of them but they have to show that they have tried <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> that is why one working <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i do not call the decisions of the committee of experts of the ilo into disrepute <e> <s> we point out that the ilo has never condemned the government <e>", "<cs> i recognise that this is an immensely important clause of the bill and so i shall spend a few moments justifying our position <e>", "<cs> that is absolutely true if the unions repudiate the action <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has undertaken a great deal of impressive research <e> <s> it may help if i very quickly respond to the points that he makes because i think that i know what he will say <e>", "<cs> i do not have a great deal to add <e> <s> i am sorry but the only succour that i can offer the noble lord is to point out that for ordinary people not academics and others well-versed in legal procedure who wish to find out what the law is we shall be updating the present series of free guidance booklets issued by the department <e> <s> i do not believe that that will satisfy the noble lord but there is nothing more that i can say <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> would provide a special procedure whereby courts would be obliged to award a certain level of compensation if proceedings are found to be vexatious and frivolous and so on <e> <s> it is however unnecessary <e>", "<cs> this is a small amendment <e> <s> i believe that the noble baroness has become very excited about nothing <e> <s> in technical terms the commissioner is a non-departmental public body <e> <s> thus under the provisions of paragraph of schedule to the employment act the commissioner is already required to prepare audited accounts <e> <s> the noble baroness knows that because she mentioned it <e>", "<cs> what has that to do with the clause <e>", "<cs> this is extraordinary <e> <s> it is obvious that the noble lords opposite do not like the commissioner do not want union members to be protected by the commissioner and would rather that crotium were done away with altogether <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lady carnegy said the amendment is almost identical to one tabled on report in another place but not selected for discussion there <e> <s> as has been apparent from the debate the amendment arises from the anxieties of members of the plymouth or exclusive brethren <e> <s> i know that a number of members of the committee may have received representations from members of the

timeshare developers association was criticised somewhat within the report <e> <s> we have had a period of selfregulation for some time <e> <s> now the department must study the recommendations of the

trading has just made a comprehensive report about the whole industry <e> <s> we have now received that report and in the light of considerations we shall then be taking further action <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter is still under discussion as it comes under the threeyear future plan <e> <s> as regards the timing of the departments response that will be given as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord dormand of easington was rising to congratulate the government on the fact that long-term unemployment is now at its lowest level for seven years <e> <s> we continue to have a variety of programmes aimed specifically at the long-term unemployed such as employment training restart courses and job clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords i commend my noble friend for his words <e> <s> he is correct <e> <s> we now have more people working in this country than has ever been the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is right <e> <s> the effects of long-term unemployment on older people continue to concern the government <e> <s> however i must point out that among the over s unemployment is less than half what it was three years ago <e> <s> we have recently introduced a new framework on restart counselling which includes back to work plans a new advisory system of interviews a unified advisory service and more rigorous follow up of those who repeatedly turn down offers of help <e>", "<cs> my lords even for young people aged from to years the figures are down by over a quarter since <e> <s> the total figure is less than a third of what it was three years ago <e> <s> that is essentially good news but we still have the programmes involved with getting people back to work as quickly and effectively as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what the noble lord lord mccarthy is talking about <e> <s> i have given the figures <e> <s> if he feels that there is a problem with them no doubt he can ask me another question <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said we have beefed up the restart scheme to encourage older people to find employment <e> <s> we continually encourage employers to look at the full scope of the available workforce <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the long-term unemployed not people who are employed in manufacturing industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to my noble friend that the definition applies after months <e> <s> as for the individual figures we have three definitions to year-olds over s and over s <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord regarding those figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that that is within the scope of the question <e> <s> perhaps i may direct the noble lord to the remark of my noble friend lord wade <e> <s> he said that there were more people in jobs today than ever before <e>", "<cs> my lords we continually review employment training to make it more effective and responsive to the needs of employers <e>", "<cs> my lords we believe in providing people with real long-term jobs <e> <s> that is what we have been doing successfully since <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the creation of real jobs since <e> <s> it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison with the long-term unemployment figures for <e> <s> however i can tell <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already replied to the noble lord lord mccarthy <e> <s> i know that he has a long running battle with the statistics that the department of employment provides <e> <s> i have to tell the house that our figures are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords precisely because the figures are unadjusted and so subject to changes in coverage <e> <s> there is no consistent seasonally adjusted series of figures available for the long-term unemployed as there are for total unemployment <e> <s> prior to october the count was based on those registering at jobcentres rather than those claiming at unemployment benefit offices <e> <s> i believe that that fully answers the question of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords we have changed the system of claimant count twice <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear from the debate that this new clause represents another attempt by the opposition to deal with what they refer to as the abuses of economic league blacklists <e> <s> i make no apology for repeating what i said in committee <e> <s> the government believe that an employer should be free if he chooses to do so to use the services of organisations which compile information that may be helpful to him in selecting suitable persons for employment <e> <s> i take no view either way on the economic league when i say that <e> <s> it is a simple basic principle <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to the subject of secondary action most particularly to the definition of primary action in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come back to that point in a moment <e> <s> the real intention of the amendment so far as i can see is revealed by the second sentence which addresses the definition of primary action for the purposes of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords that was the way in which i read the meaning of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> the second limb of the proposed clause provides what is in effect the only appropriate interpretation of primary action for the purposes of the clause that is to say action where the employer under any contract which would be affected by the relevant call for or threat of industrial action is the employer party to the dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards that specific point the act did not have that effect <e> <s> a trade dispute is a dispute in contemplation or furtherance of a dispute between workers and their own employer <e> <s> but action by workers at plant a could relate to disputes at plant b <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to come back to this point on third reading so i shall try to clarify the matter now <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to undermine the intended effects of section of the act as it would be modified by the clause by enabling union officials to avoid proper responsibility for what members will see as acts of the union by getting others with whom they are associated to do the relevant act on their behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords if for example a shop steward goes to a union meeting to say stop the group from indulging in unofficial action there would be no problem <e> <s> however if the shop steward plays a full part in that meeting and perhaps even encourages unofficial action it is fair and basic common sense that the union should therefore be liable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have not made myself clear <e> <s> i said earlier that what constitutes membership of a group falls to be decided as simply a matter of fact <e> <s> you are either a member of a group or you are not <e> <s> it is that which comes under clear common sense principles <e> <s> there is no need to go further <e> <s> if noble lords opposite cannot understand that i am sorry <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and for clarification perhaps i can deal with that final point <e> <s> this is not about whether or not someone is at a meeting <e> <s> it is about whether someone is a member of a group <e> <s> that is the issue at stake <e> <s> that <e>", "<cs> my lords the green paper <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no reason why the public should be expected to bear any of the costs that properly fall upon trade unions which find it necessary to go through the process of effective repudiation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and to which the noble lord lord mccarthy has referred <e> <s> the new section a recognises that there are others besides relevant union members and the employer or employers of any such member who have a legitimate interest in knowing whether a relevant act has been repudiated by a union <e> <s> this arrangement therefore enables any customers and suppliers who have a commercial contract with an employer to ascertain whether a union has repudiated the inducement of workers of that employer which has resulted in interference with that commercial contract <e>", "<cs> my lords i too will follow the example of my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and stick to clause <e> <s> the essential purpose of this clause is to require unions to be responsible for certain acts of their officials and thereby curb the free rein which some officials currently have to call for unofficial action <e>", "<cs> my lords we discussed this at committee stage <e> <s> the amendment contains a new element which seeks to limit in a particular way those who can lawfully be called upon to take part in action which was balloted before they started to work for the relevant employer <e>", "<cs> as i understand it so long as the industrial action is the same as that which was voted on at the time of the ballot there is no problem <e> <s> we have maintained throughout the debates on the amendment and the amendment that we had at committee that we do not see that there is a problem <e> <s> we regard these amendments as being unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in committee the government have absolute confidence that the courts have not in the past confused the two activities of holding a ballot and calling for industrial action <e> <s> we have equal confidence that the courts will not fall into any such error in the future <e> <s> it follows that there is no question of a court holding that a recommendation by a union that its members should vote yes in response to a question or questions in an industrial action ballot amounts to a call by the union to take part or continue to take part in industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the courts always take the line of the <e>", "<cs> my lords in dealing with this clause we have to put forward one proposition <e> <s> that is one either believes in selective dismissal for unofficial action or one does not <e> <s> it is as fundamental and basic as that <e> <s> however i shall seek to justify the governments position in greater detail and i apology <e>", "<cs> my lords the same answer applies <e> <s> there is no right to go before an industrial tribunal if the employer sacked everybody for going on strike <e> <s> i am sorry but that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may reply to that specific point <e> <s> the tribunal can decide on the facts of the case whether or not the employer was correct in dismissing his employee selectively <e> <s> the principle behind this clause is whether we should now bring in the possibility of selective dismissal or whether we should stick to the old way where either the whole labour force is sacked or no one is sacked <e> <s> surely the noble baroness must feel that what we are doing in this respect is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i point out to the noble lord that we have made it quite clear that that is why we have not accepted any of the noble lords previous amendments on this bill <e> <s> there is no way out <e> <s> the union has to repudiate and if it does not do so it will become liable <e> <s> if it repudiates it must let the strikers know <e> <s> at that stage the employees will be fully aware of the course of action which they are taking <e> <s> if they take unofficial action they can be selectively dismissed <e>", "<cs> my lords it would make no sense to render non-members liable to selective dismissal while taking unofficial action because such individuals could never take anything other than such action <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may cover that point <e> <s> the noble baroness could give a list of possible permutations of people who have a union card and people who do not those who go on strike and those who do not and those who are authorised and those who are not <e> <s> we could spend all night talking about that <e> <s> however we have looked at every permutation and we are confident that the law is clear <e> <s> there is nothing much to add to what i have said but if the noble baroness has a problem perhaps i may write to her setting out the relevant law <e> <s> if that is not good enough i am happy to explain every different permutation <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> only union members can take official action <e> <s> if you are not a union member you cannot take official action because the law does not apply <e> <s> it is pretty simple stuff <e>", "<cs> my lords throughout these debates in committee and again today the government have made it quite clear that we fully share the aim of ensuring that health and safety standards at workplaces are maintained and improved <e> <s> we would never propose legislation that we believed would in any way undermine health and safety at work standards <e> <s> this bill does no such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to check out that reference <e> <s> however perhaps i may suggest that the motivation behind that case was to put undue pressure on the employer concerned <e> <s> i have always maintained that if it is a case of a simple refusal to carry out unsafe work no tribunal will declare such action to be unofficial action <e> <s> that would be quite ridiculous <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would drive a coach and horses through the intended effects of the new section a <e> <s> the amendment would allow any employee selectively dismissed while taking unofficial industrial action to apply to a tribunal claiming that his dismissal was <e>", "<cs> my lords in addressing this amendment i think it is once again useful to remind ourselves that the provisions of the proposed new section a are intended as part of a package which will help deter and discourage the longstanding problem of irresponsible unofficial action <e> <s> it may be helpful at the outset for me to clarify the purpose of the period of grace provisions to which this amendment relates <e>", "<cs> my lords the start date is at the time of repudiation <e> <s> for example if repudiation was to take place at oclock midday on monday there would have to be one full working day thereafter which would be tuesday <e> <s> at its extreme selective dismissal could not take place until after midnight on tuesday <e> <s> in many cases the period could be longer than three days taking into account that saturdays sundays and bank holidays will not in any case count <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mccarthy assumes that all employers are going suddenly to sack their staffs <e> <s> that is not going to happen <e> <s> i must make the point that the period of grace arrangements which we are discussing here are totally different from the requirements of clause the repudiation aspect <e> <s> in order to avoid potential liability the union must not only repudiate the relevant acts but must do its best to give individual written notice of the fact and date of the repudiation without delay <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the words of my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords to accept amendment no <e> <s> would imply a presumption that a tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the complaint of unfair dismissal unless the employer could convince it otherwise <e> <s> however there is simply no reason why the burden of proof should rest on the employer in that way <e> <s> present law is neutral as to the burden of proof in matters relating to dismissal <e> <s> that is surely right <e>", "<cs> my lords all we are dealing with here is a jurisdictional matter <e> <s> it is not appropriate for the burden of proof to be any other than neutral in respect of such a matter <e> <s> the burden of proof is always neutral on matters of jurisdiction <e> <s> therefore i do not think that there is any confusion or any problem about which to worry <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord renton i too am surprised by the words of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> perhaps i should summarise some basic points about the way in which <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment to clause is incompatible with the effective performance of the commissioners function and is also unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords of course if the question is as helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to reply to the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> i take it that he welcomes the regulations <e> <s> of course we apologise to the house <e> <s> perhaps i can direct the noble lord to col of <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the words of all noble lords who have spoken and in particular those of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i agree with him that in this case it makes good sense to bring in these changes in regulations rather than through primary legislation <e> <s> i am also grateful to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for giving a warm welcome to the regulations <e> <s> i hope that he will not take it the wrong way when i say to him that no doubt he will change his attitude toward the department of trade and industry and in this instance regard it as having done a very good job <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house joins me in congratulating the noble lord lord bruce of donington on the assiduous way in which he has tackled this subject and quite obviously the enormous amount of work that he has put into trying to work it out <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce made a telling statement when discussing the role of the european community <e> <s> it was slightly at odds with that of his front bench and the rest of the leadership of the labour party <e> <s> as we all know it has wholeheartedly taken on board the commissions proposals as regards almost every single issue <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say whether or not it was the first case of tax avoidance <e> <s> certainly it was a graduated tax with sharp increases for buildings which had more than windows <e> <s> it did not depend on how many people lived in the house <e> <s> that was why it was blatantly unfair and why the community tax is much fairer and considerably better related to ability to pay than was the window tax <e>", "<cs> my lords in this chamber we have windows <e> <s> i do not think that the number of windows has any great effect on the number of rooms which may appear in a property <e> <s> the community charge is about raising a certain amount of finance for local government <e> <s> it is certainly related to ability to pay and raises money from people rather than houses <e> <s> the labour party has an agreement to return to rates and that is a charter for freeloaders <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very useful information <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords introductory remarks made it sound as though the labour party intended to bring back a window tax <e> <s> the community charge will be with us for a very long time indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord heard me correctly <e> <s> when i said freeloaders my remark was aimed specifically at either those people in multiple occupation of houses who did not contribute to rates or those people who can pay and refuse to pay the community charge <e> <s> those are the freeloaders in our society <e> <s> the worst off in our society are well looked after by the rebate scheme <e> <s> the noble lord knows that that is true <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i can agree totally with the noble lord that neither he nor i have any desire to introduce a window tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> shame <e>", "<cs> my lords the debate is most interesting but the amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> it proposes to modify the roughly equivalent provisions of section a as they would stand as amended by the bill <e> <s> the most straightforward objection to the amendment is that it is simply unnecessary <e> <s> including the words proposed would only sow confusion and doubt as to what the relevant provisions involve <e>", "<cs> my lords this is territory with which we are familiar and no doubt we are fond of it <e> <s> we discussed the proposal extensively at committee and report stages and here we are with it back at third reading <e> <s> the noble lord lord mccarthy sought to extend the period of grace to seven days at report stage and the noble lord lord rochester sought to extend it to three days <e> <s> this amendment would extend it from one to two days <e> <s> while i appreciate that this deflationary tendency is inspired by the spirit of conciliation i am afraid i am unable to accept this olive branch because the amendment is based on a fundamental misconception of what the period of grace is all about <e> <s> the noble lord lord rochester showed me that quite clearly in his words <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it that question does not arise <e> <s> we are dealing with whether a union has repudiated unofficial industrial action <e> <s> there is then a period of grace between the repudiation and when the employer can take action <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly thank all noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i should like to thank them especially for the kind words which were directed towards me personally <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which my noble friend lord lucas requested should be unbundled from the rest of the grouping <e> <s> perhaps it would be useful if i explained what clause does <e> <s> it is in essence a restatement of section of the control of pollution act which gives disposal authorities in scotland the duty to arrange for the disposal of waste collected by them in their capacity as waste collection authorities <e> <s> in scotland the functions of waste collection and disposal authorities are integrated within district and islands councils <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the council of europe convention is important <e> <s> it may well be open for signature at the meeting of ministers of the pompidou group on th and th november <e> <s> we are hoping to sign on that occasion should that prove to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer the noble lord the leader of the opposition specifically but i can say that the government appreciate that adequate resources are essential for effective enforcement <e> <s> staffing in this area has been increased over recent years but this is not only a matter of staff numbers <e> <s> professionalism of enforcement officers the use of modern technology and the use of intelligence are all essential in the fight against this dreadful crime <e> <s> if the noble lord requires further information on the exact numbers i shall have to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume that since the enforcement officers are dealing with banks and accountants they themselves would need to be well qualified <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall reply in greater detail to the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> as regards ratification we are of course considering the convention in detail to ascertain whether or not any of its provisions will require amendments to primary legislation <e> <s> if as we think at the moment that is not required we hope to proceed to early ratification <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments provide that any restriction order must apply only to licensed premises in respect of which a complaint
