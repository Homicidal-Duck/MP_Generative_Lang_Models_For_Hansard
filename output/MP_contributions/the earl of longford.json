of objections been met than a whole lot of new ones were brought forward <e> <s> the minister paid friendly tribute to the drafting of the bill which was indeed a thoroughly professional job <e> <s>

desirable after further discussion he can bring the amendment forward again <e> <s> i should have thought that one victory against the government in one afternoon was almost sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord ready to give way now <e> <s> does the noble lord consider himself qualified uniquely qualified in this house to speak on sex education <e> <s> does he think that no one else has a right to a view <e> <s> he has certainly expressed one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will no doubt wish to make it plain to those who do not know the subject as well as he does that all this review he is talking about is something that takes place on paper it is conducted in the last resort by officials who in the vast majority of cases would know nothing about the prisoner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> to be absolutely frank about that that was a thought in my mind when i spoke to the noble lord about it at an earlier point but i did not say that in my speech today <e> <s> that is not my present attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am offering two options <e>", "<cs> or both <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble lords argument would not apply if it were an automatic appearance before a board because there would be no presumption that he was going to be released <e> <s> he would just be

very important question should be treated in this way <e> <s> i hope there is no sense of complacency about the situation <e> <s> a number of speakers highly expert have been mobilised tonight to speak on this question and now by some extraordinary misarrangement of the business the whole thing is off <e>", "<cs> but my lords this is a rather important question and i think a lot of people are shocked by the arrangement <e> <s> they are only thinking of withdrawing because of the failure of the government managers to give them a possible time to come on <e> <s> when i last inquired i was told that the debate would come on at <e> <s> that is just an example of a muddle i cannot put it more plainly than that but i should not like the government to think that in some mysterious way this whole initiative arose from the speakers and that they were very happy at the way it had been managed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord since he makes a point of this why it is possible in scotland and is not possible here <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask this simply on a point of information <e> <s> if that is so and i know that any figures supplied by the noble lord are per cent <e> <s> correct how is it that remand prisoners over a longer period than that we were told about earlier have increased in number faster than any other group of prisoners except those in detention centres <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who is always listened to with so much attention on these matters tried hard to find some gleams of comfort <e> <s> i do not think that many people will have shared even the limited measure of optimism that he permitted himself <e> <s> he followed the noble lord lord wigoder in saying that anybody who really understood these things would understand that we could not just copy the scottish system <e> <s> the noble lord lord wigoder was going to explain later in his speech when i raised that point why it cannot be done here although it is done there <e> <s> we have now been told again why it cannot be done but i am still going to ask the minister in the absence of any other answer why we cannot adopt the kind of limit to the time spent in custody which has been adopted in scotland <e> <s> if i may say so with enormous respect to those who have told me that it is childish almost to think that such a thing could be done here this is not quite a sufficient answer so no doubt the minister will give us a better one <e>", "<cs> well my lords of course i have not got that information but as one used to say when one was a minister if the noble lord is really interested i will write to him about it <e> <s> of course i have not got all the details to that extent <e> <s> i merely know the case <e> <s> if the noble lord really wants to know what lay behind it of course i can find it <e> <s> i am just giving a few cases and i am saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> at any rate there is a fairly widespread and almost unanimous opinion in the house today that it is a scandal <e> <s> there are other noble lords who are down to speak and who will give us their ideas <e> <s> however when the minister comes to reply i hope that he will tell us how he proposes to deal with this crying scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord moyola in view of his selfless service to northern ireland <e> <s> he <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot quite accept that <e> <s> with enormous and rather obsequious deference to the noble and learned lord i cannot believe that he just got there by accident <e> <s> i think that he had taken the usual steps to approach the throne <e> <s> but let us just leave it like that <e> <s> however mr paisley may want to be prime minister <e> <s> why not <e> <s> let him try <e> <s> it may be that he will finish up as other provocative politicians have finished up as a responsible statesman <e> <s> he may even be buried

sponsors will when the time comes to bury him there <e> <s> at any rate we must hope for good results in the end from the reverend ian paisley and others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did not seem to have read it <e> <s> that was the only difference between us <e> <s> mr haughey said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is not a logic worthy of the noble lord who was a moral philosopher and to whom a great book on moral philosophy was dedicated <e> <s> it would not have been so dedicated after that slight confusion of thought <e> <s> what mr haughey said was that the particular pledge given in that way the noble lord was not in politics at that time but i was in the attlee government and i protested against it at the time that it was given it was given in understandable circumstances and i do not blame the government for it although both i and my noble friend lord beswick protested against it was considered to be very provocative <e> <s> it marked a kind of decision that the british government preferred that ulster should remain disunited <e> <s> this is the historical context with which the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge is clearly not familiar <e> <s> that is the answer to the point that he legitimately raised <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a point to the noble lord which it may be he is going to deal with and if so he will shoot me down <e> <s> is it not possible that at any rate in the eyes of the government the policy might be entirely suitable for the united kingdom as a whole and yet have special penalties for northern ireland which might need special remedies <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not mean this in any offensive way but would it not be possible for the noble lord to go and talk to some of these life sentence prisoners <e> <s> could he not have a real conversation with a few life prisoners as the noble lord lord hunt did repeatedly when he was chairman of the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt but <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow my noble relative <e> <s> he was once my very efficient trustee but he reached the conclusion that the issues involved were not equal to his far-reaching talents and the arrangement lapsed by mutal consent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> the home secretary apparently just did it off his own bat

i really want to know <e>", "<cs> it is not <e> <s> on the face of it he obviously would not or he may not <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that most members of the house inevitably bring a kind of automatic reaction to this amendment <e> <s> some like myself will be supposed automatically to support the amendment of the noble lord lord nugent of guildford and certainly i do <e> <s> the noble lord lord willis is an old champion of the creative arts and he is very much entitled to speak on their behalf <e> <s> let us if we can just for a moment look at this matter a little more closely and not treat it as the old straight issue between pornography and censorship which has been debated a thousand times and no doubt will be debated another thousand times <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has visited broadmoor many times over the years may i ask whether the noble baroness would be able to say anything about the bearing of all this on broadmoor <e> <s> some of us admire enormously what dr mcgrath for example has done at broadmoor but there have been many criticisms <e> <s> what is the bearing of this on broadmoor <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may break in for a moment not in any form of advertisement but to supplement and support what has just been said by the right reverend prelate as chairman of a centre in central london for young people which is very well known to the right reverend prelate i would point out that we have found that the number of people attending our centre has doubled in the last year <e>", "<cs> my lords like some other noble lords i have reason to be grateful to the noble lord who has just spoken for various benefactions which he has dispensed <e> <s> he will however forgive me if i do not follow him on the poignant issue which he has brought before us tonight <e> <s> i have no doubt that all he has said will be very carefully studied by the government <e> <s> we have listened to a whole string of fine speeches beginning with the two from the front benches <e> <s> i hesitate to pick out any others even the speech of my noble friend lord weidenfeld because i might be thought to have a vested interest as he is my publisher though in

places and we have discussed the whole matter in terms of self-determination of local government and such topics <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question for clarification <e> <s> i am rather depressed by his answer which seems to leave those who dislike these sex shops in a rather less hopeful position than they were but i want to be sure that that is so <e> <s> does the noble lord say that it is very unlikely that under these provisions a local authority would be able to say that there should be no sex shops in its area <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that <e>", "<cs> can the

would say that he was referring to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and not to myself because it was the noble baroness who made that distinction <e> <s> it was no distinction of mine so far as i am concerned they are all evil <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great attention to what the noble baroness lady macleod says on these matters even though her first-hand knowledge tends to lead her to conclusions which are very different from mine particularly about the benefits of incarcerating young people <e> <s> a noble lord of great distinction told me earlier this afternoon that

previous occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite a jolly little joke but it does not really deal with the fact that the noble lord neglected his duty if he cares about victims or alternatively if

were for higher office <e>", "<cs> my lords two and a half minutes seems about par for the course at the moment and i have every reason for hoping that is correct because i was due some time ago to go and propose the health of my niece who is being married some <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me for pointing this out i do not want to take up time but there is at the bottom of page a reference to sadistic and masochistic practices <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down may i put this point to him <e> <s> the judges are no more infallible than anybody else <e> <s> we all take our chance when we come into public debate of being criticised and the judges are being criticised by me and many others <e> <s> but the noble and learned lord did not quote me correctly in saying that it was i who suggested that the judges had vetoed anything <e> <s> i was very careful not to use that word <e> <s> i quoted him as saying that the judges persuaded the home secretary to abandon his proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene that was not the opinion of the home office and appeared not to be the opinion of the home secretary when the matter was first put forward last may <e>", "<cs> my lords many years ago i was placed on more than one occasion in the situation in which the noble lord has found himself <e> <s> i was asked to represent a department at very short notice and to take a measure of responsibility for everything that was being done or not done <e> <s> so far as i am concerned i acquit the noble lord for the manifold failures of the home office <e> <s> no one will blame him <e> <s> he comes down here and it is his task to defend them <e> <s> however i am afraid that i regard his reply as profoundly disappointing not through any fault of his but because i consider the policy and the attitude of this government profoundly disappointing <e> <s> but before i deal with that matter i should like to congratulate the noble lord on the delightful way in which he has handled this task <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that a new minister who starts as well as that is going on to greatness and may even finish by sublimating the ideals of the home office <e> <s> however that is maybe a little further on <e>", "<cs> those are not the only options my lords <e> <s> there are always economic sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say just that i must make the point <e>", "<cs> i really must raise a point in defence of the rights of back-benchers generally <e> <s> i understood that the noble lord was trying to speak before lord mayhew and lord mayhew got up first <e> <s> that was the situation and it was just a misunderstanding <e> <s> i must just place that before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to a number of notable speeches including the last and i realise that the noble lord speaks with rather special experience <e> <s> the most significant speech of all came from my noble friend lady bacon <e> <s> although she mentioned that her experience was yesterdays rather than todays it was obviously relevant <e> <s> she was kind enough to recall the committee which was set up by mr harold wilson when he was leader of the opposition of which i had the honour to be chairman and of which my noble friend was a prominent member with the noble and learned lords lord elwyn-jones and lord gardiner and others <e> <s> there is no doubt that that committee unlike most of the other committees i have served on and i hope it will not be true of the one i am now working on with the noble lord lord redcliffe-maude had really effective results <e> <s> things happened and that was to a great extent due to the noble baroness lady bacon who was minister of state in the home office just afterwards as she told us <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he may think me tiresome but perhaps he may elucidate some aspect of the matter <e> <s>

certainly be in my interests for what they are worth <e> <s> the thought of making my maiden speech in the committee at is not an exhilarating prospect for me so from a selfish point of view i hope we may reach a decision <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept that as a general statement <e> <s> i visited prisons for many years during the stewardship i did not want to allude to this -of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich and i never met a prisoner who had had any interview with him alone <e> <s> i am only telling your lordships the committee must judge between us <e> <s> but i know that the noble lord lord harris has the idea that visiting a prison means seeing a group of prisoners collectively <e> <s> that is not what the noble lord lord hunt did <e> <s> i am only saying that i prefer the methods of the noble lord lord hunt to the methods of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i did not want to go into that matter but since i have been challenged i must put it plainly on the record of the committee <e>", "<cs> it is simply a question of fact <e> <s> my understanding and i have pursued this matter for a good many years is that there are five people three members of the parole board and two home office officials <e> <s> i believe that to be the position <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the noble lord who did not wish to be interrupted in his peroration <e> <s> he slapped me down the other day on the same ground so i think your lordships will probably agree that the introduction of eltons law that no minister should ever be interrupted in a peroration is one that will be widely acceptable <e>", "<cs> i have nothing against quangos <e> <s> some of them work harder than others and that of the noble baroness may be the most hardworking of all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord elton was brief and the least i can do is be brief also <e> <s> the noble baroness set the matter out strongly at the beginning backed up by the noble lords lord avebury and lord hutchinson who should always be lined up to speak immediately following the noble lord lord harris as an antidote to the official line <e> <s> that is an admirable feature of the new party and i think we in the labour party would agree with that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hutchinson dealt with the remarks of the noble lord lord harris and there is no doubt that the last point made by the minister was not the strongest he has been making in the last few hours when he said that the amendment would not lead to more releases <e> <s> the truth is that either one wants to see more people released on parole or one does not <e> <s> the minister is trying to have it both ways while he wants to see more people released i gather he is arguing that in some mysterious way giving reasons would mean fewer being released <e> <s> that was a very feeble point he was making <e>", "<cs> certainly but i was in the midst of my peroration <e>", "<cs> i must not use the word nonsense because i

whether he will take up the matter again with the home secretary and with his honourable and learned friend mr mayhew <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment moved by the noble lord not that i expect to see it carried but i think it would be a rather sad state of affairs if when someone came up with a generous forward-looking idea of that kind everyone began getting very pompous and frowning at it <e> <s> so i am supporting the noble lord in a mood of anti-pomposity <e>", "<cs> my lords there was an occasion when the famous orator edmund burke dealt with a subject so eloquently that when he sat down the next speaker who i think was oliver goldsmith but the noble lord lord elton might correct me was content to remark i say ditto to mr burke <e> <s> that is my position tonight <e> <s> i say ditto <e> <s> i am proud to say ditto to the noble lord lord bruce <e> <s> i promised to rise to my feet to support him but i assure the house that i am only going to detain noble lords

described is the one <e> <s> i have been denouncing <e>", "<cs> my lords to put the noble lord out of any anxiety i say at once that i shall not today be dividing the house on this question <e> <s> this is mainly for the reason mentioned by the noble lord lord hunt which has already occurred to me that it is not a very satisfactory amendment <e> <s> however it is a straight issue of principle

of principle <e>", "<cs> i am not sitting down quite yet <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will be clearer about my intentions before the next stage my lords since i gather that the government are allowing several months for all of us to think over these matters i do not suppose that we shall again be going into the question yet awhile <e> <s> but i should like to try to answer the noble lords point <e> <s> certainly i consider that it is monstrous that the prisoner should not be seen by a member of the committee <e> <s> that principle is accepted in the case of the local review committees <e> <s> it is argued that a member of the local review committee a local bank manager for example as it may well be is not capable of interviewing a prisoner <e> <s> to be told that the noble lord lord harris with all his immense abilities is incapable of interviewing a prisoner is not acceptable <e> <s> the same would apply in relation to the noble baroness lady macleod of borve or the noble lord lord windlesham <e> <s> such eminent people command the attention of your lordships whenever they speak yet we are told that they cannot interview a humble prisoner that it must be left to someone more skilled <e> <s> that is what we were told just now <e>", "<cs> i see my lords <e> <s> well it is a funny sort of board with about members if only the chairman is capable of interviewing <e> <s> that argument is quite absurd i can say that without giving offence <e> <s> it is asked who can interview the prisoners <e> <s> the noble lord says that they can be interviewed by governors and other people on the spot who know them well <e> <s> well let us accept that arbitrament <e> <s> i must not go into detailed cases but i know of more than one case where the prisons collectively are entirely on the side of the prisoner being sent forward for parole <e> <s> we know who has been standing in the way of that <e> <s> if it were said hand over the matter to the prison there would be many prisoners known to me who tomorrow i would not say that they would be out would pass to the review process <e> <s> the argument there i am sorry to say is far removed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i am afraid i missed his earlier remarks and it may be that he answered my point but surely he is not saying that it is the duty of every member of the government here to rule out the idea of a united ireland as an ideal aspiration <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord surely we are qualified to speak about the aged here <e>", "<cs> my lords i have such a respect for the noble lord lord houghton that i am always anxious to agree with him and i usually find it easy enough except when we deal with one of his special interests like pornography and then we sometimes have a little more trouble <e> <s> but tonight there was no difficulty at all about following him although i am perhaps slightly more optimistic about the future than he appears to be <e>",

context and let him answer if he feels it necessary <e> <s> i was quoting what she said and setting it against the real truth <e> <s> of course i know that she would never have said it if she knew

allowed to interrupt now <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i referred earlier to the noble lord as lord cock-field and i apologise for that but for nothing else <e> <s> i read out one sentence which he has at last got round to he has now read out the sentence i quoted although i do not have with me a copy of the complete quotation <e> <s> that was the sentence in which she said there was no reason

of or should be unemployed is absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords am i allowed to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> it is for him to say whether he will give way <e> <s> i quoted one sentence and i said that i was ready to hand over to the noble lord the whole passage if he wished to put it in context <e> <s> nothing could have been more straightforward than that <e> <s> i say again that the original remark which the noble lord has had to repeat was absolute nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords if the sex shops in scotland are half as bad as the sex shops in soho then they are awful <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble earl but i do not know whether he is going to say anything about the position of the unemployed <e> <s> i mean home ownership or indeed renting accommodation is just fantastic in their case <e>", "<cs> my lords like other members of the house i was much interested by what the noble earl has just been saying about dyslexia on which he speaks with special authority <e> <s> i do not know whether he knows of a book written by a famous actress about her life as a dyslexic person <e> <s> it was published by a firm with which i am connected <e>

i got to know a young man who could not read or write when he left school at <e> <s> he came of respectable middle-class parents and was a good athlete and prominent in the school <e> <s> but when he left school he became so frustrated and in a sense so looked down on that he took to armed robbery and killed a policeman <e> <s> it was a very famous case at the time <e> <s> when i first met him he had been in prison for some time <e> <s> slowly he had learned to read and write in prison <e> <s> the prison education sercvice is fairly good but there is nothing extraordinary about it <e> <s> nevertheless he was systematically taken in hand and learned to read and write in prison <e> <s> he came out some years later and he has led a blameless life ever since <e> <s> it shows what can be done with dyslexic people but i agree with the noble earl that it is a very intractable problem and that we ought to be doing everything we can to help him and his colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i have respect for the noble viscount who has just spoken and i agree strongly with his conclusions <e> <s> i differ from him in respect of something he said because i do not agree that my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby in effect wasted the time of the house and might just as well have not spoken <e> <s> i believe my noble friend raised some very interesting questions to which i want to attend in the few minutes i suppose it will not be minutes which i shall use up <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question <e> <s> what he says may be true about sex or at any rate some people would think it is true <e> <s> is he going to say that our attitudes to violence are changing <e> <s> are we moving in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i was given to understand that this would be a free vote <e> <s> this idea of concerted policy is new to me and rather unattractive <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for the bill of the noble lord lord robertson has been put so well by the noble lord himself by the right reverend prelate by the noble and learned lord lord denning and by the noble lady that it may be wondered whether it is very necessary for me to add anything <e> <s> but i am one of the relatively few in the house tonight who played a prominent part in the debates of which are now spoken of as though they are ancient history in fact i was leader of the house of lords at that time and i left my seat to speak against that bill <e> <s> my dear friend lady jeger and my esteemed friend lord houghton were otherwise occupied so they did not know what was going on here <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but they were not here <e> <s> therefore i must be allowed to speak on that one point with a little more authority than they can command <e> <s> i must just explain that to them <e> <s> there is no doubt at all in my mind because everything that was said at that time in various discussions was not necessarily said on the floor of the house <e> <s> so if i may say so respectfully it is no good my noble friend lady jeger saying that she knows everything that was said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if my noble friend feels that way <e> <s> she became very emotional when she was speaking and i realise that her emotions are deeply involved here <e> <s> but she must allow me to say that i have done as much social work as she has among people as distressed as any she knows about <e> <s> so i will not be lectured by her as though she were someone who just knew about sufferers and outcasts and as though i were not aware of cases of that kind <e> <s> i refuse to be lectured by her or indeed by anybody on that particular topic <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether that will go into <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a great point of the fact that there seem to be a majority of people in favour of the bill as it stands <e> <s> he made a great point of the fact that only the minority are against it <e> <s> i pay my tribute to my noble friend lord houghton and to those with him who worked for many years to turn a minority into a majority in favour of this bill <e> <s> for a long time the abortion law society was a tiny body which worked away and gradually converted opinion <e> <s> therefore it would not come at all well it was not the argument used by my noble friend lord houghton from anybody who had seen opinion diverted once in favour of abortion to argue that the minority as they are called at the moment have no right to try to get it altered <e>", "<cs> is that said seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords i will leave it <e> <s> well if the noble lord is anxious to get an answer i think it is because it would be too painful altogether <e> <s> i do not see any reason for not having a funeral but it would be too painful an affair <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl explain what orders are given to the army and to the police as to when they are permitted to shoot and kill motorists who drive through any kind of checkpoint <e>", "<cs> my lords i am privileged to follow the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge on a matter of this kind <e> <s> he speaks with much authority on all penal matters but with unique authority which he has not been too modest to explain on grendon <e> <s> i have visited grendon several times over the years but would not compare my knowledge of grendon with that of lord donaldson but like him i share a high opinion of what has been achieved there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always happy to speak following the noble earl lord cork and orrery but i must be brief at this hour and i have only two main points to place before the house <e> <s> first i entirely agree with the propositions set out by the noble lord <e> <s> lord carrington whose record as foreign secretary is second to none <e> <s> secondly i submit that that policy i am not saying that lord carrington would himself regard it as a total policy as was indicated by my revered leader lord cledwyn and others from this side is in itself incomplete <e> <s> thus i applaud the statement of lord carrington and i agree with my colleagues in suggesting that it is incomplete <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i misrepresented the noble lord in the light of what he has just said <e> <s> i can only point out to him that when he was very closely advising mr bevin with the assistance of the noble lord lord mayhew the policy was based on our having the atom bomb and using it if necessary if the russians invaded western europe <e> <s> in other words that was the policy supported presumably by the two noble lords on the liberal benches and myself and many others for many years <e> <s> so there cannot be what is called a moral issue here because on the moral side that was the policy of this country for many years and maybe it can be said to be still so <e> <s> it becomes a technical question and in these few minutes i will not try to deal with technical issues <e>", "<cs> my lords as the chairman of a large centre for the homeless in camden may i ask whether the noble lord is aware that except for the answer he gave to the noble baroness lady trumpington the answers he has given have caused enormous disquiet <e> <s> the other answers will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to offer strong opposition to this renewal order <e> <s> that is the convinced attitude of the labour party as expressed in another place and the noble lord lord wigoder referred to the matter <e> <s> no one has a higher regard than i have for the noble lord lord boston but he would be the first to agree that in what he said today he was not expressing the attitude of the labour party <e> <s> no one can possibly claim that he was <e> <s> the labour party to which i have belonged for years or so voted against it after giving considered reasons so let us not be under any misapprehension the labour party is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i did say that instances of this kind were difficult to come by <e> <s> i am sorry but my failure of articulation is responsible for a mishearing by the noble lord <e> <s> i said that it was not difficult to find extreme cases but that i was trying to cite what seemed to be a normal case where there was not any outrageous behaviour by the police <e>", "<cs> my lords i really must finish because i am taking up around minutes <e> <s> the house may ask me whether this ladys nephew was regarded with any justification as being a dangerous person <e> <s> the answer to that is that i have not the slightest idea <e> <s> i have not gone into the question of the nephew but i am saying that here is a woman who was intimidated for nearly four days in the hope of dredging out of her some information that would help the police in dealing with her nephew <e> <s> i am saying that if that is the act then the sooner it is got rid of the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i would never dream of taking a step of that kind without long consultation with my leaders <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to that point the only nephew of mine who is at all before the public is mr ferdinand mount who is a close adviser of mrs thatcher so i believe it would be very much out of order to cross-examine me about him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to interrupt on one point <e> <s> he inadvertently no doubt left out one word in his quotation <e> <s> the noble earl was satisfied that there should be some special legislation not just legislation <e> <s> the noble lord lord shackleton left out the word special <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt <e> <s> for once i cannot get the noble lords point <e> <s> he speaks of the society with whose goodwill i spoke to the house earlier and which i mentioned as those who had given written evidence <e> <s> they were not asked to give oral evidence so i do not think that would commit them to anything in the report <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> my lords i do not know why the noble lord should seek support for whatever his point of view is from an interview attributed to bishop daly in america in october <e> <s> bishop daly is known to many of us perfectly well and is much admired by many of us <e> <s> he comes to london quite often <e> <s> why has one got to pick out one particular article in america <e> <s> from where did it reach the noble lord <e>", "<cs> that i must repudiate <e> <s> bishop daly has repudiated the ira much more effectively and much more vigorously than it will ever fall to the lot of the noble lord to accomplish <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is far too intelligent to suppose for a moment that whatever happened in northern ireland the counties of southern ireland would turn into an eastern european state <e> <s> if the noble baroness is suggesting that she is falling a long way below her usual standard of good sense <e>", "<cs> my lords a phrase slipped from the lips of the noble baroness perhaps inadvertently <e> <s> she said that something which is being done in northern ireland today is the last bulwark against southern ireland turning into an eastern european state <e> <s> how did the phrase the last bulwark come into it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord look into the arrangements made at present for homeless people without fixed abode <e> <s> is he aware that in fact they are taken off to a separate office in i believe scarborough street <e> <s> will he satisfy himself that they are not treated worse than those who have an abode <e> <s> would he make sure about that <e> <s> because all my information is that they are treated worse if they have not got a fixed abode <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with particular pleasure to support the question introduced by my noble friend lord kagan who spoke effectively if briefly <e> <s> his speech was followed with purpose by two established favourites of your lordships house the noble baroness lady macleod of borve and my noble friend lord soper <e> <s> of my noble friend lord kagan i will say only that which was said by macaulay of warren hastings <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord leaving the matter of the judges <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to offer some support to the question asked by the noble lord lord harris and to join the noble lord lord harris my acting leader lord elystan-morgan lord avebury and lord kagan in pressing the government for a much more constructive reply than we have received on previous occasions <e> <s> like other noble lords i have visited more than one of these police cells <e> <s> i am not sure whether my experience has been as extensive as those of other noble lords who will have had their own experiences but i have visited two police cells and i should like to endorse what has been said <e> <s> i also join in paying tribute to the very gallant way in which the unfortunate police are trying to cope with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether he confirms that there is a wide ranging review of the staffing position now taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to raise a point of order <e> <s> it is a long time since i have raised a point of order in this house but i feel bound to raise one now as an old timer here <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask for guidance on how long that leaves for each of us

different way <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand but do not let us waste our time on what is ineffective <e> <s> i would think at any rate for the noble lord lord thomas it would be a pity to waste time on what is ineffective <e> <s> that is a point of view that it is either harmful or ineffective <e> <s> at any rate it is not likely that a government that take up that attitude are going to do much about increasing aid <e>", "<cs> well the noble lord is in a genial mood today <e> <s> my lords i shall simply compare my party with the party opposite <e> <s> i can only say that on this matter of aid and i do not always agree with what appears to be the official line for the time being of my own party as some speaking on defence may be aware there is a great gulf fixed between the labour party and the conservative party particularly under the present auspices <e> <s> i have never been more clear in my mind that the labour party is the party for any humane person to belong to <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened as always with great attention to the noble lord who has just spoken but he formulated one proposition in a way with which i disagreed <e> <s> he said that we had to tackle the soviet subversion first before we tackle the terrible social conditions in these third world countries <e> <s> i shall come to the whole topic as i proceed but i do not think that it is a question of tackling one before the other <e> <s> i think that they must both be tackled simultaneously <e>", "<cs> if i have said something which is unfair my lords i want it to be put straight <e>", "<cs>

what has been said about soviet subversion <e> <s> i am bound to point out to noble lords opposite that in a debate on overseas aid which we had only last week i am not sure which noble lords opposite

pleasantly <e> <s> this is not a criticism after all i have been on the noble lords side in past years <e> <s> but i hope that he will forgive me saying that he was inevitably reproducing arguments that were used by the minister in another place <e> <s> i say that for a particular reason <e> <s> it gives me an excuse for not answering the arguments at length <e> <s> they were in my mind when i made my introductory remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords the other day someone said to me that we have some of the most successful businessmen in our house and that we must benefit a great deal from their counsel <e> <s> i was bound to say that this does not happen as often as it should but the noble lord has made me regret all the more that other leaders of industry do not give us of <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord will say a word about the disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all who are concerned with the homeless as well as the homeless themselves will very much appreciate what has been said by the right reverend prelate <e> <s> he has defended the homeless briefly but eloquently against the charge of fecklessness which in my opinion is used as a rather wicked alibi for our own failure to do anything constructive for them and i am sure that what he said should be underlined very often <e> <s> like the right reverend prelate i must use up a moment of my time no doubt it should be more to pay tribute to the maiden speech of the noble lord lord mulley <e> <s> now that he has become so eminent he may have forgotten that for a while i was his tutor <e> <s> he came back from the war he had been a prisoner and he obtained a first-class degree <e> <s> there was no kind of connection between that and my tuition because i was followed in the role by i imagine the noble lord lord blake who taught the noble lord lord mulley a different kind of politics <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mulley owes much more to the noble lord lord blake but in fact he followed the same line of politics that he always intended to follow that of socialist idealism <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> may i say a word before the noble lord winds up <e> <s> i am sympathetic to the idea of including the word unreasonable at the beginning <e> <s> i have discussed this with some of my advisers and i think it was felt that discrimination in itself suggests unreasonable conduct <e> <s> i should prefer to see that in but having expressed that degree of sympathy before i hear what my noble friend lord ennals will say i hope that point will be left over to the next stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say just a word in reply to the noble lord <e> <s> i hesitate to set myself up against the noble lord on the question of mencap <e> <s> i was chairman many years ago and am still a vice-president though of course that is very small beer compared with a president <e> <s> on the other hand neither of us was present when they last discussed this <e> <s> i received a communication which i believe the noble lord has seen which was in some ways rather cryptic <e> <s> they said that they hoped to see discrimination outlawed and certainly made no reference in their letter to me about leaving out mental handicap <e>", "<cs> i express my sympathy for that point of view <e> <s> perhaps we might look at that although perhaps not carrying it through to the extent of putting the word unreasonable before every single word discrimination <e> <s> however i think this point does deserve careful consideration before the next stage <e>", "<cs> i feel that after the minister has been kind enough to intervene it would be only appropriate for the promoter to thank him at least for speaking so briefly and i gather he is not intending to say anything more <e> <s> he did not disappoint me in what he said because he made plain previously what his attitude was <e> <s> therefore i do not express my disappointment <e> <s> i am not going to attempt to reply because we are not dealing with the amendment but i hope that no one will suppose that because we have said we will look at the wording that there is any retreat on the main aspect <e> <s> the bill as my noble friend lord ennals said was given an unopposed second reading <e> <s> therefore the house must have decided in favour of the principle of this bill <e> <s> therefore we could not begin to accept anything that involved wrecking the bill <e> <s> i say that because i do not want to raise a lot of use hopes that we are weakening <e> <s> as my noble friend lord ennals said that is very much to the point <e> <s> there are a lot of possible definitions and it would be ridiculous for us to pretend that all wisdom has been delivered to our particular group <e> <s> perhaps those who do not agree with much of the bill may want to come and talk about the actual terminology <e> <s> so we ought to be open-minded on the terminology <e>", "<cs> i was merely pointing out that before we leave clause we may have got into a little bit of a muddle <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must reply to the noble lord lord i houghton before we go any further <e> <s> i think that it ought to be plain to everybody and i think that it is plain to the noble lord lord houghton that what is proposed would really amount to a vote against the bill on second reading it is against the principle of the bill <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lord mentioned clause other than incidentally <e> <s> he was not dealing with the proposal of the noble baroness lady lane-fox which i must say a few words about in a moment <e> <s> he was dealing with the bill <e> <s> he was if i may say so making the same speech as he made on second reading <e> <s> i was stupid enough to interrupt his speech then but i did not interrupt him again today <e> <s> however it was the same speech and of course he is entitled to take that view very strongly <e>", "<cs> i think that it is plain is it not <e> <s> although none of these matters is absolutely plain that mr rix is in favour of a bill along these lines <e>", "<cs> in order to avoid misunderstanding may i say that i also agree with what the noble lord lord renton said on subsection <e>", "<cs> may i make a suggestion in a desire to show i suppose how intelligent i am <e> <s> let us take west indians <e> <s> some west indians find it rather hard to make themselves understood the young ones particularly by people who are

yourself understood <e> <s> you are a west indian <e> <s> it might be quite untrue of him but it might be a label attached unfairly if you like to all people who are west indians <e>", "<cs> i did not mean it to apply directly in the case of this bill <e> <s> i was trying to lay the concept before the noble lord <e>", "<cs> may i just say that i shall be pleased to look at it again <e> <s> at the moment i stand firm on it but i am perfectly ready to look at it again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord campbell of croy very courteously refrained from criticising my bill when it was going through the committee stage and i therefore feel the least i can do is to follow his example and remain as silent as the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> i will make sure that on this occasion the best is not the enemy of the good <e> <s> i think my bill is better but i think there is a great deal to be said for the bill of the noble lord lord campbell and as the noble lord lord banks pointed out in some respects it would confer benefits on the disabled which are not covered in my bill <e> <s> all i can say to the noble lord lord campbell of croy is that i wish him well <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to listen to the noble lord lord beloff speaking as he does entirely without any script <e> <s> on this occasion it would be churlish not to join in extending to him the congratulations which he has bestowed so liberally on himself <e> <s> the noble lord presented himself on surviving in the face of possible odds <e> <s> i do not want to hurt the noble lords feelings

actually started a small university <e> <s> most of us have been students at some time or other at a university and a few of us have been college tutors <e> <s> when i initiated the first debate ever held in this house on universities in i was the only college tutor now there are quite a number <e> <s> so i am afraid that i shall not allow the noble lord to exercise a sort of monopoly in life at the coal face <e>", "<cs> my lords may i put a point to the noble lord lord alport with great respect <e> <s> when i put my motion down i was told it would probably come on at oclock <e> <s> it is now pm is there any chance of the noble lord postponing the rest of this stage until a later occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i just want to catch up <e> <s> who is going to look into the question of training <e> <s> the noble lord did tell us but i was not quite sure what it was he said <e>", "<cs> my lords am i allowed to speak twice at the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no objection to the suggestion of the noble baroness <e> <s> if at some later point when this bill is drawing even nearer to the statute book than is expected by the noble lord lord renton some lawyer comes along and says that we must have another look then we shall have to have another look <e> <s> but at the moment i am happy with this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i may have misunderstood him but did he say that he is now under the impression that we are anxious to omit the mentally handicapped <e> <s> that is not my intention <e>", "<cs> my lords it would seem to me the best course would be to withdraw the amendment giving notice that i shall be bringing forward an amendment analogous to this one if not an improvement on it at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made if i may say so a highly selective commentary on the findings of the inspector <e> <s> if he had read a little further he would not have found anything so favourable <e> <s> may i put this question is the noble lord aware that there are only three out of the women at the last count who

proposing to say a few words and it may be that the noble baroness would wish to comment on them adversely or otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not intending to keep silent altogether because i must at least begin by expressing gratitude to all the noble lords and noble baronesses who have given such close attention to this bill whether by attendance speech or both and that refers to noble lords and noble baronesses who have been sympathetic and to those who have been unsympathetic <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not propose to say any more after the effective reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to say a few words or any words at all because the matter has been so well dealt with by those who support this bill <e> <s> however the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby raised one

issue <e> <s> i will not press the matter further <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question of the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord i assume would not argue that the roman catholic bishops were on his side in this controversy would he <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord who has just spoken is entitled to present himself as an accurate if gloomy prophet <e> <s> i have no credentials of that kind <e> <s> after mrs thatcher had been in office for a little while i jotted down in my diary the thought that she would not last more than two years because i could not believe that any group of self-respecting

speak for five minutes <e> <s> if i have not said what i want to say by the end of five minutes that is just too <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the past years the gap in the

to counter anything that might be said by way of criticism but i thought he was rather faster than usual this evening to rise to his feet even before i had made a criticism <e> <s> i did not intend to criticise him <e> <s> perhaps that was what he was objecting to <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not follow my noble friend lord rea in his very interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mishcon

benches about this horror this new found curse <e> <s> it is relatively new <e> <s> i would express also a sense of the total inadequacy of the efforts of the government <e> <s> the noble lord lord mancroft at times seemed to praise the government and then at other moments he put some searching questions <e> <s> i think he has added to the confusion he referred to <e> <s> it was hard to know whether he was trying to assist the government or give them stick <e> <s> whatever he said it was very relevant but i found myself closer to the point of view of the noble lord lord harris who gave us a strong lead in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have all listened with much attention to the noble lord lord colwyn <e> <s> he said that the health service was working remarkably well except in one area <e> <s> that by a curious coincidence proved to be the one area of which he has special knowledge <e> <s> if he had special knowledge of and if i may say so politely a special interest in other areas he might not have found the rest of it so satisfactory <e> <s> he must allow me to point that out a little ironically <e>", "<cs> my lords may i <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> has he not therefore invisaged this as being on the footing of the arts council which after all has received very important government subsidies over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened most closely to the noble lord lord bancroft who speaks with such a vast knowledge of whitehall and other matters <e> <s> the noble lords mental processes have moved rather in the opposite direction from mine <e> <s> the noble lord said that he began in a mood of weary scepticism and finished with some kind of enthusiasm which during his observations i thought on the whole he concealed fairly well <e> <s> however i move rather the other way <e> <s> i started which a great deal of enthusiasm if only because of my admiration for the noble lord lord henderson which stops only just this side of idolatry and i have now reached the point of what i might call guarded sympathy <e>", "<cs> my lords everybody can produce something which the conservative government have done <e> <s> i do not say that in the last years they have done absolutely nothing but i say that they have done very little <e> <s> if the noble baroness could produce one other example it would be about all she could produce <e>", "<cs> not really my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to see the noble lord lord beloff about to leave the chamber because i was going to speak a little about him but no doubt he has other pressing engagements <e> <s> however i was going to say before that the main points in favour of the motion have been made so well by the noble lord lord wigoder by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and by many speakers including the last one although i could not quite follow where mr arthur scargill came into this particular debate i know he is usually relevant but hardly today that i can be very brief and i shall not keep the noble lord lord beloff for very long <e> <s> he seemed to be under the impression that mr clive ponting had not as much right to have a conscientious dissent as some others <e> <s> he referred to him in a rather patronising way <e> <s> mr ponting followed a course of action which i gather was followed before the war by lord vansittart

just finish the sentence <e> <s> and i do not believe he was alone in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not distinguish when it comes to conscience between the status of one public man and another <e> <s> i am sorry <e> <s> i have finished with the noble lord lord beloff so if he likes he can catch the brighton train <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder how the noble viscount knew that i was going to speak about mr bingham because i told him in confidence that i was going to refer to him <e> <s> is he playing the game by making a personal attack on a man who cannot be defended today and in whom i have a lot of confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not deal with that point at all <e> <s> i mentioned it as one of the matters for concern as indicated by the human rights commission but i did not offer an opinion myself <e>", "<cs> my lords no one is going as far as that <e> <s> i said at the beginning that the word of the accomplice has been accepted in english law for many years <e> <s> i am talking about the uncorroborated evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to refer the noble lord to appendix c of the report of the standing advisory commission which is headed <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to make a rather important point <e> <s> the noble lord has suggested that uncorroborated evidence is admissible in england <e> <s> in law it is admissible but i understand and i have confirmed this with several

regarded as ladies day <e> <s> however i know how indulgent the ladies are <e> <s> i know that the noble lord beside me will feel the same diffidence <e> <s> we are the only two out of the first nine speakers who belong to the weaker sex or whatever they call it nowadays <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may interrupt <e> <s> i am entirely in sympathy with what the noble lord is saying but how is it that these women who get turned out of their houses in the middle of the night know about the law centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it a privilege to rise in support of the question put by the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs which she expounded in such an effective and comprehensive fashion <e> <s> as president of the new bridge i am honoured to think she has taken on the chairmanship and the fact that she seems to be an old friend of the present home secretary must be an advantage <e> <s> for that reason and a lot of others i am sure that she will do great work there <e>", "<cs> my lords

agree <e> <s> the speech of the right reverend prelate will perhaps send us back once again <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say one or two things in reply to her but the noble baroness lady hooper

conclusively in this field <e> <s> but does caution mean caution about the violence displayed or caution about interfering with the violence <e>", "<cs> my lords i join the noble lord lord campbell of

this kind <e> <s> the mood of the house a few years ago was in favour of lighter sentences <e> <s> then the noble viscount lord whitelaw went to a conservative conference and got the bird <e> <s> as a result the mood of the conservative party changed and heavier sentences became the fashionable prescription <e> <s> now in this mood we are told that there should be a heavier sentence <e> <s> so i

contribution that the disabled make to this house facilities should be provided for them so that they can perform a similar service on the bench <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that representations from the various bodies involved with the disabled should be sympathetically considered by advisory committees <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope it will not be considered

ruc <e> <s> but he said that since then there had been dramatic changes <e> <s> could he just say one or two words about what those dramatic changes are <e>", "<cs> my lords as always it is a pleasure

grateful to the noble lord lord swann not only for initiating the debate but for his profound understanding of what is valuable in the life <e>", "<cs> i was the first person to suggest it <e>", "<cs>

short time available and i endorse what he said <e> <s> i also endorse the warm tribute he paid to the noble earl lord caithness who we are glad to see is carrying on at the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords all i would say about that speech which was quite short and no worse than my usual efforts over years is that i asserted that the distinctive doctrine of the labour party is that everybody is of infinite value in this house of god <e> <s> that was the point of the speech <e> <s> the noble lord seems to have missed that one <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some trepidation speaking after four eminent lawyers and preceding three others <e> <s> i hasten to say what a pleasure it is to debate after so many years on more or less equal terms with the noble and learned lord lord hailsham <e> <s> i say more or less equal terms because someone who has performed the duties of lord chancellor for a record number of years and with the utmost distinction is not quite on the same footing even now as the rest of us but he comes among us untrammelled and is perhaps i think all the better for that <e> <s> of course it was gladstone who said i come among you untrammelled <e> <s> after admiring the noble and learned lord for years or more with every year that passes i think he resembles mr gladstone more and more and i say that by way of a very high compliment <e>", "<cs> however my lords we are discussing this bill and my attitude towards it has been most effectively explained and expressed by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> i have no doubt that anything he left unsaid

hope my leaders will remember the old adage to understand all is to forgive all because i want to speak in total disagreement with the line unfolded by our spokesmen just now <e> <s> in other words i want to support very strongly the noble lord lord hutchinson on the abolition of this power to make recommendations <e>", "<cs> all of us must congratulate the noble earl on the gallantry with which

auspices of black rod or in the library <e> <s> there was an aspect of the noble lords speech towards the end which i will not go into now <e> <s> it raises difficult questions as to how far there is

has been no public recommendation until recently there were private communications and if so were they taken note of by the parole board <e>", "<cs> my lords subject to the views of any of the members

hardly any notice <e> <s> i suppose i might have hoped at the back of my subconscious that his department would have examined carefully the report of the all-party penal affairs group <e> <s> i doubt whether that has been so <e> <s> there was the idea that the review should include an examination and consideration of the prisoners conditions and career plans <e> <s> that is something of which the noble earl certainly has not had very much notice <e> <s> therefore i do not expect him tonight to deal with it thoroughly <e>", "<cs> my lords did people believe them <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt and ask the noble lord whether he will not agree that homosexual activity as distinct from homosexual feeling is forbidden both by christian and jewish teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord donaldson that it is unfortunate that we are starting two hours after the expected time <e> <s> there is something about local government that leads its spokesmen to orate at

credentials of that kind <e> <s> i offer the opinions of a rank and file member of your lordships house who has not been allowed near the front bench for over years <e> <s> i get as close to it as i can but not close enough <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble lord for clarification <e> <s> under his plan <e>", "<cs> my lords why does the noble lord draw the line at seven <e> <s> at that point there was a divergence of view <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that he will not argue with any roman catholic in this house <e> <s> will he accept the views <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord will make it plain because the noble lord lord ennals made it plain that this is not party policy but that he is speaking for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw out what i think is an implication contained in the speech of the noble viscount lord buckmaster which has been either implied or stated by earlier speakers <e> <s> however i mention it at the

composition was distinctly unbalanced to decide that the bill was totally inappropriate after this house had decided that it should go forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will go on to remind us that the ministers who were present including the new leader of the house voted for the bill introduced by bishop montefiore in the then form in other words in a form totally opposed

prisoners after they had been identified as mentally disturbed <e> <s> in the opinion of the doctor who examined this man there was a total shortage of accommodation for remand prisoners in general

accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl how that priority works <e> <s> the noble earl says there is a system of priority and i am sure therefore that there must be <e> <s> however
