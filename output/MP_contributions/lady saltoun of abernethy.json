earl sits down can he say whether the code of practice will be enforceable in a court of law <e>", "<cs> in support of this amendment i would say that if one is a good cook housekeeper and manager one can feed a family adequately on income support provided one has ones own kitchen where one can safely store the necessary ingredients <e> <s> if no kitchen is available i should imagine it would be pretty well impossible <e> <s> it would certainly be impossible for people recently discharged from mental hospital who are perhaps a trifle inadequate <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will tell us whether that sum was calculated for someone being cooked for at home or for someone who had either to eat every meal in a restaurant or buy it from a takeaway <e>", "<cs> i should like to add another point to those already mentioned <e> <s> the idea that someone under needs less to live on than someone over is not only quite ridiculous but i believe it is the other way round because many -to year-olds are still growing <e> <s> that means not only that they need more food but they outgrow their clothes and have to have new ones <e>", "<cs> my lords first i must apologise to the noble lord for not being here at the beginning of his opening speech <e> <s> i am afraid that it was largely due to the disorganisation of business which happened today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> how is the purchase going to be authorised before it reaches the point of sale <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible to include conditions of access in the disposition when the land is sold <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am delighted that after months brooding the government have at last hatched this egg <e> <s> in view of the enormous increase in the cost of residential <e>", "<cs> my lords i must point out one thing as the noble earl lord russell said one does not eat much on a week if one has to <e>", "<cs> i should like at this point to say a word or two in regard to scotland <e> <s> in scotland we have two tiers of local government regional and district and our community councils have no statutory functions <e> <s> england is quite different with county district and <e>", "<cs> if one read every notice that is put up in a supermarket one would never get around the place <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting and useful debate on the amendment <e> <s> i should like to say a lot of nice things to all those who have spoken in support of it however time does not permit <e> <s> i realise that my amendment is defective and therefore i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> can he say what happened to the previous carpet from this chamber to the furniture from the peers guest room and to the beautiful flowered loo from the new ladies next door to the princes chamber on which the plug seems to have been pulled <e> <s> many noble lords would have been glad to pay a market price for some of those items <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to support the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that it is ever a good thing except in dire emergency to remove a child without reasonable notice from where he is living <e> <s> apart from the reasons that the noble lord lord mottistone has mentioned the child should have time to be prepared for what is going to happen to him so that he can adjust to his change of circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the noble and learned lord one question <e> <s> we have already heard from the noble baroness lady david that many local authorities are not doing anything at present for their children leaving care <e> <s> is there any reason to suppose that those local authorities will do any better in the future unless there is some element of compulsion <e>", "<cs> my lords are all the widows who at present are not receiving the occupational pension widows of men who were killed in action or who died later from wounds <e> <s> if not can the minister say how many of them are and would it not be possible to give them the occupational pension <e>", "<cs> my lords how can the government justify the recent huge pay rises to members of another place when they refuse to raise the pensions of pre- war widows to the level of those of post- widows <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am most grateful to the noble earl lord ferrers for such a fair and impartial <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down how can we deport people who have not been convicted of a crime in a court of law <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome many of the provisions of this bill there are some aspects two of which i shall speak about which worry me <e> <s> the noble lord lord gallacher has already spoken about irradiation so i shall not speak about that <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way perhaps i might tell him that the clause to which he refers is clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that everything that can possibly be said about embryo research has already been said over and over again this afternoon and this evening <e> <s> if one had not seen the bill and had heard a handful of speeches one could have been forgiven for being under the impression that it consists of one clause only clause <e> <s> indeed i have spoken to some noble lords who were under exactly that impression <e> <s> there is in fact quite a lot else in it <e> <s> there is the whole question of the status of aid children <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply but i am still not absolutely clear on this point <e> <s> i did not quite hear what the noble baroness said about liability when food poisoning occurs as a result of bad sandwiches being sold by a charity on the registered premises of an hotel the food having been provided by the voluntary workers of a charity and not by the hotel <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> it sets my mind at rest <e> <s> i was very much concerned that the hotel would be liable for something over which it had no control and therefore that such premises would no longer be made available to charities <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i ask the noble and learned lord whether he really believes that the word carry is appropriate in that context <e> <s> it seems to me that the word carry could mean to carry in ones arms <e> <s> i wonder whether the word bear may not be better <e>", "<cs> it might possibly be of assistance if i said a word or two at this stage <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ashbourne is designed to prohibit all gamete donations <e> <s> i have enormous sympathy with the amendments <e> <s> there was a time when i would have supported them because i find the whole idea of gamete donation repellent <e> <s> however after lengthy reflection and it has been lengthy because i first raised the subject in this place six and a half years ago i have come to the conclusion that in an intensely personal matter of this kind it is not for me to impose my views upon others <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way i said that i thought that that was a different situation altogether <e> <s> the child already existed <e> <s> it was not being created for the purpose of going into a one-parent family <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may explain at this stage what i meant <e> <s> i think that it is wrong to bring children into single-parent families by artificial means <e> <s> we all know that children often occur in single-parent families <e> <s> that is in the nature of things but i cannot believe that it is right deliberately to bring a child into a one-parent family by artificial and possible expensive means <e>", "<cs> we have had a very interesting and far-reaching debate on these amendments <e> <s> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have taken part and put their views whether or not they agreed with me <e> <s> many of them did not <e> <s> perhaps i may comment on one or two of the views expressed <e> <s> i am sure that the young mother referred to by the noble lord lord ennals was a good mother <e> <s> i did say that many single women were good mothers <e> <s> but she could not offer the child the inestimable benefit of a fathers loving care <e>", "<cs> the inheritance of coats of arms is important in any country but in <e>", "<cs> i beg the noble and learned lords pardon i am not learned <e>", "<cs> i must tell the noble and learned lord that i am not descended from that person and i do not think that anyone today is descended from him <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for what he said about amendments nos <e> <s> and and i note that the government will bring in amendments at report stage to take care of our concerns <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> when the time comes i shall not move those amendments <e>", "<cs> under the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for that very helpful explanation and for his remarks about the possibility of guidance on certain matters in secondary legislation <e> <s> on that account i shall withdraw this amendment <e> <s> but before i do so perhaps the noble and learned lord could possibly arrange that when the draft code has been prepared a copy of it is placed in the library <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord for what he has just said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i entirely support all that the noble lord lord teviot has said about the marking of birth certificates of the donor children from the point of view of their descendants who may wish to trace their ancestry <e> <s> the need to know ones roots is a very fundamental one and it is a question of a persons sense of identity a lack of which could even lead to mental instability <e>", "<cs> there is one other instance in which a person badly needs to know at least whose son or daughter he or she is not <e> <s> it is in applying for life insurance <e> <s> one is then asked what ones mother and father died of <e> <s> therefore it is just as well to know who ones father was not <e>", "<cs> snowden and mitchell came down heavily on the side of requiring written consent from the father <e> <s> i mention that fact although it is at variance with what the noble baroness lady warnock said but i believe that it is important <e>", "<cs> i am a little worried about the whole question of incest <e> <s> young people today start living together from the age of and may well already have had at least one child by the age of <e> <s> that is the age by which it is suggested that the applicant could discover something about his or her genetic descent <e> <s> it could then turn out that two young people who had been living together from the age of and who had already had at least one child were half-brother and half-sister <e> <s> what does one do then <e> <s> i wonder how much this matters <e> <s> the pharoahs got by quite nicely marrying their brothers and their sisters <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the government for the amendments <e> <s> they go a very long way towards redressing the balance of the conflicting interests of the woman who wants to have a child and those of the resulting child which are not necessarily compatible <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to what the noble and learned lord said and to the contributions of various other noble lords <e> <s> i should like to say to the noble baroness lady faithfull that the amendment was designed to give the parents the choice <e> <s> however i appreciate the reasons the amendment is not acceptable and i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i shall be ruled out of order in this connection but it seems to me that it may be relevant at this stage to mention my amendment amendment no <e> <s> which is not in fact grouped with this one <e> <s> i think that it would save time at a later stage <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> would enable those whose duty it may be to ascertain that a particular person would be the right person to inherit under clause to have access to the minimum information necessary to enable them to carry out their duty <e> <s> it may be that clause covers the situation and that what is proposed is therefore unnecessary <e> <s> however it is important that the necessary information is available to those who need to know and if clause is to be capable of being implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i cannot accept that a donor child should be retrospectively foisted on to a testator or a trustor any more than a legitimated child should be <e> <s> i do not see why a testator should be presumed to have wished to include a donor child merely because he has not expressed a wish to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for moving the amendment which i believe meets the concerns that we expressed in committee <e> <s> i must confess to some surprise that regarding england the courts should have held that a coat of arms is a dignity <e> <s> i should be interested to know when and what were the judgments wherein the courts took that view <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say whether the overseas postal authorities agreed to honour the valueless stamps <e>", "<cs> my lords i remain in a state of confusion <e> <s> it appears that the resolution of a claim might be considerably delayed if it had to wait until the claimant was aged before he could obtain the information to prove or disprove his case <e> <s> however i shall read most carefully what the noble and learned lord said and take legal advice <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am worried by the idea that at the age of a person who wants to marry somebody should find out whether or not that person is their brother or sister or whatever in view of the way in which young people live <e> <s> nowadays very often they have been living together since the age of or illegally from before the age of <e> <s> they may have a child or two to their names <e> <s> it is thoroughly unrealistic to say that then if they find out that they are brother or sister they cannot get married but if they are not so related they can get married <e> <s> that situation could cause untold misery <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble is that i cannot accept that a child born by egg donation is the child of the woman to whom the child was born <e> <s> i regret that this is an area where i fundamentally disagree with the government <e> <s> however i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl also bear in mind in this inquiry that young people may have had to leave home because they were being assaulted or abused <e> <s> will the inquiry go into that also <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that as the situation stands at present the law is in danger of looking an ass <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble and learned lord will feel able to meet the concerns of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord for this amendment <e> <s> it goes a considerable way towards meeting very grave concerns as to the fate of the donor child of an unmarried couple should any misfortune overtake the mother and consequently the grave risk that the child might be taken into care because he has no family to care for him <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> i have to say that i simply do not see how someone interpreting a will or a trust made many years before this act or indeed possibly before some of the techniques now in use were ever thought of could possibly decide whether or not someone who had not mentioned the possible existence of a donor child in his will or his trust deed wished a donor child to take under that deed or did not wish the donor child to take under that deed <e> <s> with great respect i think that the most reasonable interpretation would be that he probably did not wish the donor child to take under that deed <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i should say that i am still not quite clear how he would envisage enforcing clause and <e> <s> he said that a minor would have parents who could be forced by a court to disclose information <e> <s> however in such circumstances certainly one parent would be dead and very possibly both <e> <s> i am not quite clear how in those circumstances the clause would be enforced <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i understand what the noble and learned lord is getting at <e> <s> i am not altogether happy but in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble and learned lord and the noble baroness for their inestimable patience in replying so fully to such manifold and varied amendments for their attempts to meet our many concerns where they and the government saw fit to do so and for their scrupulous fairness and even-handedness throughout the proceedings <e> <s> i should especially like to thank the noble and learned lord for the pains he has taken with regard to the welfare of children born as a result of gamete donation where the parents are not legally married <e> <s> i hope that by this evening as a result of announcements made by the chancellor of the exchequer in another place there will be a lemming rush of cohabiting couples to the altar or at least to the registry office <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government consider how legislation which has been enacted in certain parts of the united states of america such as connecticut oregon and maryland works with a view possibly to introducing legislation of their own <e> <s> will they also consider introducing legislation to make it an offence to send unsolicited advertising material to anybody on oftels list of fax owners who does not wish to receive it <e> <s> will the government ask oftel to get the list out as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if the post office must continue to issue these nvi stamps can the government ask it to be very careful never to issue them in the future in a colour such as red that colour blind people cannot recognise <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind that in a failing property market it is not always possible to sell a house in six months or even longer <e>", "<cs> my lords like many other noble lords who have spoken i have to declare an interest in that i plant and fell a few trees mainly for amenity <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the palace of holyrood house is not at present run by the historic royal palaces agency <e> <s> can the noble lord give an assurance that it never will be <e>", "<cs> my lords while the central belt has undoubtedly benefited from all this investment will the noble lord indicate how he sees the industrial future of the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> my lords any one of the three reasons advanced by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway against giving this bill a second reading should suffice to kill it <e> <s> leaving aside the question of whether or not the atrocities perpetrated were war
