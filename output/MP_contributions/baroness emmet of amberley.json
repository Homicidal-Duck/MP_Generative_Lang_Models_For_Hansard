on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to consider that while there are certain differences between the argentinians and

noble lord agree that bearing in mind the location on the map of the falkland islands to the argentine the only way for all these matters to be implemented is for the two countries to work together
