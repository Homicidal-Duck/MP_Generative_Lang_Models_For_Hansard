the point made in his reply but it would also increase the number of hours in daylight which are available for us to work and as productivity is of paramount importance would he not think it a good idea to give this matter a little further thought particularly as at the moment we are becoming progressively more european in our outlook <e> <s> with decimalisation and metrication does it not seem illogical deliberately to alter our clocks to get out of line with the time in europe <e> <s> would my noble friend not also agree that the majority of farmers in this country do not like having many potential hours of work in daylight taken from them just at the time of year when the sowing of winter and spring corn is of paramount importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware of the potential hazard caused primarily to livestock to say nothing

charged <e> <s> is he further aware that on the continent and in america in particular the deposits charged are substantial with the result that there is considerably less litter than exists in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would i be entirely out of order if i <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend lady young whether i am to understand that despite the fact that power is there for local authorities to make charges for meals or milk for pupils who can afford it none the less it will cost the authorities some million a year <e> <s> i should like to be clear on that point <e>",

billowing out black diesel fumes attempting to grind past others striving hard to <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend not aware that this overtaking is not allowed on the continent <e> <s> is there any good reason why a prohibition cannot be simply implemented in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply but is he not aware that the practice i mention is widely used in america and i believe also in many other countries <e> <s> would he not agree that to produce a few more green arrows would be advantageous <e> <s> also would he not agree that to implement such provisions would be of great assistance in easing congested traffic flow <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply and i would agree with the second part of his answer to my question <e> <s> does he not agree that there is an increasing tendency for motorists particularly those wishing to travel at low speeds to hog the centre lanes of motorways and who perhaps do not pay attention to the advice given in the highway code <e> <s> would it not be helpful if attention could be drawn to this problem <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not agree that one of the best forms of apprenticeship is compulsory apprenticeship in her majestys forces <e> <s> thereby alleviating the ever-increasing problem of unemployment particularly as it relates to school-leavers <e>",

agree with particular reference to the last one to some moving speeches <e> <s> i should like to add my voice to that of the noble countess lady loudoun and the noble lord lord noel-baker in giving further encouragement to the use and the bringing back into use of our neglected inland waterways system <e> <s> i was not going to touch on this subject but it seems to me that this afternoon there has been a predominance of support for the railways <e> <s> i myself am extremely keen about the railways but i feel this emphasis has been slightly at the expense of the inland waterways system <e>

<e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend the minister for his comments and in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may interject here and spring somewhat to the defence of the landowner it presupposes that owners of coverts and shoots and employers of keepers are there the whole time to see what is going on and that is really most unfair <e> <s> although one accepts that from time to time people do take action that is not approved of and is probably illegal it really is most unfair to expect the employer to be held entirely responsible the whole time <e>

particular species or one or several at a time or what <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which makes it rather difficult to ask my supplementary question because i appreciate the point he has made <e> <s> none the less will he not agree that the absence of litter bins on main trunk roads will inevitably lead to an increase of litter spread on the roadsides in the country and on the verges of main roads therefore making it more costly and rather more hazardous for it to be picked up <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of the noble lord lord spens would the government not agree that if a public holiday is needed st georges day would be more appropriate than may day <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to add my support to lord alports underlying theme and principle behind the bill which he has done so well to bring to your lordships today <e> <s> the principle and attitude i feel must surely be right but i have reservations over the means that might be used in justifying the end <e> <s> the noble baroness lady burton rightly said have a point and stick to it and her point was the justification of the second chamber <e> <s> my point this afternoon is the question of referenda as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not help if the western nations ceased providing wheat to the soviet union at a time when they are finding themselves short until they cease to carry out such inhuman activities against individuals and sovereign states <e>", "<cs>

government give a lead and encouragement in this matter <e> <s> would he not agree that the sight of a number of white caravans parked in virgin rural settings can completely ruin what is otherwise a peaceful and rather attractive view and if some effort were to be made to merge them into their natural surroundings the stark contrast would be somewhat alleviated <e>", "<cs> i apologise to my noble friend lord lucas and lady macleod of borve for the fact that i find myself totally unable to agree with the amendment which has just been moved <e> <s> i should have thought that anything which would ease the procedure of justice through the courts in order to prevent the back-log of matters which ought to be regarded almost as <e>", "<cs> may i come back in reply to my noble friend lord lucas or would it he more convenient for the committee if my noble friend the minister would like to reply to what the noble lord lord mishcon said earlier <e> <s> i want to refer to my words <e>", "<cs> my lords in intervening at this stage i must admit to not being knowledgeable or an expert in the health and social services of the country but i was interested to see the amendment tabled by my noble friend lady masham <e> <s> i read an interesting editorial in the <e>", "<cs> my lords to be put in to bat at number in a team of first-class cricketers is a very pleasant experience because most of the runs have been scored by the time one gets to the crease <e> <s> i can follow my noble friend lord margadale by saying that my prepared script has more or less gone into the wastepaper basket and that i am now left with a few notes scribbled on a piece of paper <e>", "<cs> i should like to interject if i may <e> <s> much as i should like to support the government i think that my noble friend lord mottistone has raised a point which needs elaborating <e> <s> the mere fact that the water authorities are dealing with and handling as my noble friend lord onslow said public money makes it rather important that this should be watched over more carefully <e> <s> if it is a public company where shareholders have shares and attend board meetings and so on there is no earthly need for the press to be present at their meetings <e> <s> but as a public board they do not have individual shareholders <e> <s> perhaps it begs the question whether the water authorities might not be run by a private organisation and then there would be no need to have the press attend <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to red tape does the noble lord not think that we should get on better if blue tape were reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i should start by following the example of my noble friend lord burton by declaring an interest in that i too am a tenant of a decent-sized acreage <e> <s> i am in the unique position of being probably the only tenant who had a rent review twice in one day once in the morning before lunch and once in the afternoon after lunch <e> <s> so i have quite a vested interest in this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am sorry if i am out of order and i thank the noble lord for putting me in order <e> <s> i take the noble lords point and move to clause <e> <s> i add my support to those noble lords who have said that they disagree with the principle of giving the president of the rics the power to provide the appointment of an arbitrator <e> <s> that is not the right thing to do in principle <e> <s> it could be seen to lend itself to a certain degree of partiality and perhaps the government would look at this point again <e> <s> if it is a question of economy or whatever i cannot believe that it will add that much to public funds <e> <s> if so why not make the fee payable to the minister as opposed to the president of the rics <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i just ask her what she means by stating categorically that there is no alternative for farmers other than to burn their straw <e> <s> could she possibly suggest another way of getting rid of it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i should like to echo the words of my noble friend lord alport and say that quite frankly <e> <s> i rather deprecate the necessity to discuss this matter at such a late hour <e> <s> i was going to say such a late hour of the night but it now seems to be an early hour of the morning or very nearly breakfast time as mentioned by the right reverend <e>", "<cs> yes hear hear <e> <s> who said that <e> <s> my noble friend almost put me off my stride <e> <s> seriously i take issue with the noble lord lord alport <e> <s> although sympathising with his views i think he carried them a little too far <e> <s> it is a little unfair to suggest that farmers burn straw and stubble purely for greed <e> <s> that is not right <e> <s> it is an economic and practical farming practice particularly in relation to the burning of stubble as the noble baroness lady nicol said <e>", "<cs> my lords i just wanted to raise that point <e> <s> if our predecessors of years ago were around today they would be relatively surprised to hear the house talking about this matter <e> <s> fifty years ago straw was a very valuable and indeed rather scarce commodity <e> <s> i am not that old but i can remember hill farmers going on their hands and knees begging for permission to cut bracken as bedding for their animals because straw was in such short supply <e>", "<cs> my lords one or two inches for oil seed rape <e>", "<cs> my lords my combine obviously operates in a different way from my noble friends combine <e> <s> the only way of getting rid of oil seed rape stubble effectively is by burning <e> <s> the danger of stubble burning is far less than that of a pile of straw burning <e> <s> so if this matter does go as far as legislation i hope that the matter of stubble burning will be treated in a slightly less heavy-handed manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that the words abolition of controls relating to properties are rather like a red rag to a bull to the party opposite <e> <s> however i would ask the noble baroness lady birk before she says categorically that there is no way in which she and her party could support the second reading of this bill to consider for one moment what we are trying to drive out or what i believe my noble friend is trying to drive out and what i believe the government might well support <e>", "<cs> my lords l take the point of the noble baroness but equally i am quite sure that there are very few members of your lordships house who could really go so far as to agree to abolish all the provisions of all the acts referred to in this bill <e> <s> there are very many points in the various rent acts which are highly desirable and necessary <e> <s> the establishment of rent officers and that sort of thing is entirely necessary <e> <s> you have arbitrators to arbitrate on agricultural rents and i think that it is perfectly correct to have rent officers to arbitrate between landlord and tenant if there is disagreement <e> <s> i think that is perfectly fair <e>", "<cs> may i follow my noble friend lord caithness and ask what is the purpose of the bill <e> <s> my understanding is that the main purpose is to endeavour to get more tenanted land on the market <e> <s> therefore i feel it is essential and a prerequisite that the term open market and the open market rent should be retained and put into the bill so that when in the future there are more agricultural lettings available on the market the term open market will have more meaning than it appears to have at the moment <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up one point that the noble lord lord walston made and ask members of your lordships committee not to be too misled and i do not at all mean that in any derogatory way <e> <s> the noble lord yet again made reference to the fact that there are very few arbitrations and that therefore we are appearing to talk about a very small number of eventualities <e> <s> i would suggest very strongly that if the bill goes through in the manner in which it is drafted in particular in regard to clause and the rent formula the number of arbitrations will be far greater <e> <s> i say that because i do not see how any tenant could possibly willingly agree with a landlord across the table on the basis of the reference and the power being given to the arbitrators <e> <s> i feel that that would be a minefield and would mean a joyride for barristers attorneys and so on <e> <s> please do not be misled into thinking that arbitration is something that is of very minor consequence <e>", "<cs> may i fully support my noble friend lord renton per cent <e> <s> in this amendment and also the noble lord lord northfield in his remarks about the scottish formula <e> <s> previous speakers have declared an interest and i suppose i ought to follow their example by saying that i too like many others of your lordships am not only a landlord but also a tenant <e> <s> i have one son and shall probably have a grandson like my noble friend lord de la warr but i have not reached that stage yet or rather my son has not <e> <s> so i hope i can speak impartially and not from a standpoint of vested interest <e>", "<cs> i too wish to lend my support to the amendment and to what has been said <e> <s> there is a problem in defining in legal terms a proper system of farming <e> <s> i am sure that barristers and perhaps even the government will say that this is an understandable and acceptable piece of phraseology but it opens the field for too wide a discussion <e>", "<cs> may i determine whether i am out of order to clear up a point at this stage <e>", "<cs> i was trying to save time but since we want to know what we are talking about i shall read out for my noble friend lord kinnoull what the rics suggests <e> <s> it may also help the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> the suggested format or underlying theme for replacing this paragraph it need not necessarily be verbatim might be based in the following way <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i do not know the answer to that question it might well do so <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend lord swinton for his answer and i appreciate what he has said <e> <s> i also hope that perhaps other amendments which have been put down and which have been canvassed this afternoon will to a certain degree take care of the intention behind my amendment and i shall look forward to their outcome <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i intervened at this juncture because my amendment no <e> <s> might go some way towards meeting the point made by my noble friend lord swinton that two wrongs do not make a right <e> <s> while in theory and in principle having great sympathy with my <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i am not sure that i go along <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that

chairman-designate is anything but a person of the highest calibre and integrity <e> <s> i was merely asking my noble friend about his qualifications and knowledge of red deer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene at this moment to remark that one of the reasons put forward by the tenant farmers association as to why this amendment might commend itself to your lordships house is that the tenants successor knows the maximum length of time of the farm tenancy and therefore has to plan his future rather than gamble that his father will reach the age of <e> <s> i suggest that perhaps some of your lordships have sons who will have to gamble whether they will reach the age of and if we are going to insist on a fixed-term tenancy up to the age of for tenants perhaps other people may think that

too must follow the example of others and declare an interest as a farmer <e> <s> i also partake of necessity in the burning of straw and stubble <e> <s> many of us here tonight and a great number of people in the country as a whole would welcome the underlying principles and feelings which have prompted my noble friend to move the second reading of his bill on the ticklish problem of straw and stubble burning <e> <s> however i must regretfully say that this bill is rather like the curates egg it is good in parts and it leads one to wonder very seriously whether we should allow this bill to proceed any further than its present stage at this time <e>", "<cs> well my lords i am very glad to hear it it is the first time i knew that and it may be the first time your lordships knew it <e> <s> the residual remains of oilseed rape when harvested are stubble call it what you like <e> <s> when it is burned i should like to know how anybody is going to tell the difference between the farmer who is burning oilseed rape stubble and the farmer who is burning his wheat stubble we should get into the most awful confusion <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be more appropriate to wait until there was such a processing plant and then to go ahead on these lines <e>", "<cs> i must correct my noble friend <e> <s> i am afraid that what he says is not correct <e> <s> it was a bale of straw that caught fire and caused the smoke and the incident to which he referred <e> <s> i too think that my noble friend lord onslow is trying to split hairs to pretend that there is no difference between stubble burning and straw burning <e> <s> it is not so <e> <s> the amount of smoke or smut given off in the burning of stubble is infinitely less than it is from burning unbaled straw and there should not be this concern or the inconvenience caused to people if the stubble and i emphasise stubble as opposed to straw--is burned <e> <s> to say that you then have to try to go round little pieces of straw that drop off the back of the combine is splitting hairs <e> <s> that in itself is not going to give rise to unacceptable amounts of smoke <e> <s> i think that the lily is being somewhat painted in this matter <e>", "<cs> i have one further point about the word unreasonable <e> <s> who is to decide what is unreasonable <e> <s> it is very airy-fairy <e> <s> one local authority may do one thing and another authority may do something else <e>", "<cs> we are talking about harvesting in july august and september <e> <s> if you apply to the court it might be october november december or christmastime before you get there <e> <s> meantime the straw and stubble lies there <e> <s> i am sorry but we are probably getting off the theme of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was very sorry to hear what my noble friend lord belstead had to say about not being very keen on the local ministry of agriculture possibly having the duty of issuing licences as would be required by this amendment in the name of my <e>", "<cs> it is a fact that this section of the firearms act provides that if a chief constable is satisfied that an applicant for a certificate has good reasons to possess one and he has no grounds for supposing that the applicant should not have one for whatever reason under the sun he is required to issue that certificate <e> <s> in this case there is no question of may <e> <s> it is a question of shall <e> <s> the same criteria might perhaps apply to the issuing of licences for straw burning provided i emphasise the word provided that certain safeguards are observed <e>",

very satisfactory for a farmer to be in a position of wondering what will happen if he has his application for a licence refused <e> <s> there is no use his saying that he can go to a court and apply

can be held over for another session <e> <s> cannot we do the same with this bill <e> <s> this would enable us to consider it thoroughly and get it right first time instead of compressing three days

"<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i wonder whether the government will be kind enough to bear in mind that currently as british summer time is brought to an end there are seven weeks before the shortest day and that we reintroduce it again approximately weeks after the shortest day <e> <s> reintroducing summer time at the end of february would mean a disparity of only weeks on one side and seven weeks on the other <e> <s> will the government be good enough to hear that point in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether my noble friend instead of concerning himself with clocks giving universal time will consider encouraging those atomic clocks that we do have to concentrate more on extended hours of british summer time <e>", "<cs> my lords more to the point of the question will my noble friend not agree that in a great many overseas countries in any place where tourists buy a postcard to send to their nearest and dearest they automatically also get a stamp if they ask for it <e> <s> the suggestion contained in the question of my noble friend would surely be of great assistance to tourists visiting this country <e> <s> should not this question be borne seriously in mind by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that the reintroduction of the death penalty would safely take care of the point raised by the noble lord lord molloy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether her majestys government will when considering their feelings and attitudes to south africa bear in mind the fact that south africa was is and i hope will be a staunch ally of the western alliance <e> <s> will my noble friend remember the part that south africa played under the leadership of general smuts that wonderful man and not ignore the assistance that has been given by south africa in the past to this country <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps we are getting it the wrong way round <e> <s> why not contact the landlords instead of the tenants <e> <s> after all the landlords will do their level best to ensure that their tenants interests are safeguarded <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble

"<cs> my lords following on from the question of the noble baroness i must press my noble friend on this point <e> <s> would it not be far simpler to have an across-the-board heating allowance for old-age pensioners and such people regardless of the winter temperature <e> <s> surely that must be administratively simpler and it would allow people to know where they stand <e>", "<cs> my lords some years ago the mythical mikado of japan was made to say by the late sir william gilbert that his object all sublime was to make the punishment fit the crime <e> <s> i think that notwithstanding the pages of the bill before us it is a question not so much of what is in it as what it leaves out <e> <s> i should like to address my remarks to and concentrate upon the theme with which i began <e>

ever-increasing rate of crime in this country <e> <s> i hope that we might be able to apply our minds to this and try to do something about it <e>", "<cs> it is not a frivolous question my lords <e> <s> if we could find a suitable place for people who could not be contained in this country and who cost the taxpayer an enormous sum of money and i do not have the figures with me there would be nothing wrong in letting them live on an island having given them the necessary equipment to start off their existence letting them get on with it themselves and letting them make their own rules <e>

patriotism not go amiss <e> <s> why do we celebrate a day which is generally associated with regimes with which we do not usually agree <e> <s> even if my suggestion could be accepted only in part

difficult to thank my noble friend for that lengthy reply but i thank him anyway <e> <s> would the government agree <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that the very problems that he has outlined concerning overcrowding in prisons would be much alleviated if the suggestions that i made on what i may perhaps call the first criminal justice bill which came into your lordships house before the general election were considered rather more seriously <e> <s> as some noble lords were not then present i shall briefly state the suggestions i ask the government very seriously to bear in mind <e> <s> i believe they reflect the wishes of many people in this country <e> <s> these are the reintroduction of the death penalty to the extent that it does not include hanging castration <e>",

the timing of the questionnaire <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the tourist boards and the development commission believe that thousands of jobs would be created and that the royal society for the prevention of accidents consider that up to deaths or serious accidents would be saved by having longer daylight hours <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend <e> <s> i just wanted clarification on that point <e> <s> perhaps i may with leave of the committee speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and the last of which is consequential upon the other amendments because if any or all of these are passed

remarks on the four amendments evoked from members opposite <e> <s> i do not think i have ever heard in this chamber of amendments that have been properly tabled being virtually thrown out before they have even been spoken to properly in detail <e> <s> members opposite presumably are speaking on behalf of their party and they made it perfectly clear that they did not even wish to consider evidence of these matters <e> <s> i find that an affront i deeply regret it and indeed deeply resent it <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord wigoder said much the same thing but i may not have picked it up quite so well <e> <s> i think it is wrong not to consider these matters and i am grateful for the support given by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter in that respect <e> <s> on the specific subject of amendment no <e> <s> in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords cannot small shopkeepers be left alone to make their own arrangements instead of being dictated to <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there is an undercurrent of feeling in certain local authorities that they might absolve themselves of the responsibility for the maintenance of local and minor roads and leave such maintenance and upkeep to the landowners occupiers or tenants who use them <e> <s> is not this suggestion to be regretted <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to join in thanking the noble lord lord carter for giving us a chance to debate this very important subject which is so dear to many of your lordships hearts <e> <s> it is clear that on all sides there is deep concern at the governments outline proposals for a substantial change in the forestry arrangements in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords when the existing arrangements for summer time were agreed in in association with our partners in the european community it was for a period of some three years <e> <s> the present arrangements are due to come to an end this year and something different will be organised for next year <e> <s> however there has been a feeling among a wide number of people including many of my noble friends and indeed some noble lords opposite that perhaps the existing arrangements are not entirely what we might like to see <e>", "<cs> my lords while hearing with gratitude the news of the number of stations being reopened i should like to ask the minister whether he is able to confirm that stations will not then be closed down thereby negating the good work done particularly in the settle and carlisle areas <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible for the government to consider reaching an agreement in particular with the european community whereby those who commit offences while abroad have their passports endorsed in the same way as a driving licence is endorsed for offences which have been committed <e> <s> if that were done should the person concerned return to the country in which the offence had been committed the authorities could consider whether to grant him admission and no doubt they would be circumspect if a football match happened to be imminent <e>", "<cs> my lords i like eggs even curates eggs <e> <s> if the bill has been likened to a curates egg by my noble friend lord swinton i can say only that i like the bill in principle <e> <s> i am not sure why curates eggs have always been singled out as being bad but that is not the subject before us today <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to cross swords with my noble friend but i am not sure that he is going about this matter in quite the right way <e> <s> the amendment seeks to put the responsibility on the applicant for a certificate <e> <s> i am sorry to say that in this instance i feel very strongly that the responsibility must rest yet again with the unfortunate gentleman the chief officer of police who seems to be a very busy man throughout this bill <e> <s> it is not very difficult for the police to ensure that an applicant will take

i sympathise with the aims of the noble lady is not the amendment somewhat superfluous <e> <s> the point which she made about unexpected sporting invitations or competitions is already covered in the bill as it stands <e> <s> clause b states <e>", "<cs> the answer is quite simple <e> <s> anybody who is over the age of may apply for a shotgun certificate <e> <s> provided that he shows he is keeping the weapon safely whether it is kept in his own house or in someone elses there should be no problem <e> <s> i very much regret what i have heard from the benches opposite <e> <s> i do not understand the thinking there <e> <s> the amendment is quite reasonable <e> <s> it does not lay down specifically the reasons for keeping a shotgun as my noble friend lord ferrers said earlier <e> <s> it is a guideline as to what will be regarded as <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to my noble friend for the courteous way in which he has <e>", "<cs> i can come to the aid of my noble friend and tell him that

bits and recocks it by hand <e>", "<cs> this amendment is a god sent opportunity to try to bring shotgun certificates into line with firearm certificates <e> <s> it seems to me that the method by which firearm certificates are issued and the weapons registered and so on should now be translated into shotgun certificates <e> <s> it may be deemed inconvenient to many people who are not used to handling firearm certificates but operated properly it is not a great inconvenience <e> <s> it is the price we should be prepared to pay to try to assist in bringing about some degree of control and preventing weapons falling into the wrong hands <e>", "<cs> i also join my noble friends who have spoken in support of this amendment <e> <s> it is important that this point is written into the bill <e> <s> if my noble friend on the front bench cannot support it then perhaps my noble friend will want to find out the views of the committee on this matter <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said that he would take away this problem and look at it again <e> <s> this is the committee stage and what seems to be happening is that such points are discussed in committee taken away and the whole matter is then debated again at the report stage <e> <s> is it not time that we came to a decision <e> <s> there may be points of substance that need to be considered very carefully and we can return to them at the report stage <e> <s> however this is not the point of substance but a point of fact <e> <s> there is no argument about it <e>", "<cs> i really do not follow the argument <e> <s> it is very simple to state for what purposes one needs a certificate <e> <s> it is clearly laid down in subsection b that a good reason for having a gun is if it <e>", "<cs> i did not understand that <e> <s> i thought that the bill was to change the act <e> <s> i am trying to look up quickly the reference in the bill but i cannot find it <e> <s> will my noble friend please tell me whether it is a fact that a certificate for a firearm as opposed to a certificate for a shotgun can only be granted provided that the purpose for which it is to be used is specified <e> <s> i believe that is so but i may he mistaken <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> my attention has been drawn to section of the act <e> <s> it does not state that the purpose for which the firearm is to be used is to be stated on the certificate <e> <s> i should like to see provisions relating to shotguns on similar lines to those for firearms <e> <s> it would be over-egging the pudding at this stage for us to include the purposes for which the shotgun is to be used <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will take the point on board to see whether we should include the purposes for which the weapons are being used <e> <s> at the moment it might be best if i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back to the noble lord lord harris on that specific point <e> <s> yes i am very surprised <e> <s> shoplifting could be one stage before breaking and entering <e> <s> if someone is prepared to go shoplifting and so on and he is the possessor of a shotgun certificate it could just be that he is not fit to hold a licence <e> <s> but i take the point <e> <s> how else does one word the proposal to satisfy the point one is trying to get at <e> <s> i agree about the areas the noble lord has mentioned <e> <s> but how else can we achieve the aim which i think ought to be considered <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i agree that the amendment is surplus to requirements <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> there is much to commend the amendments put down by the noble lord lord john-mackie and i should like to say a few words in their support <e> <s> there is no reference in the bill to the mental state of people which is a very relevant factor <e> <s> my noble friend referred to alcoholism <e> <s> such matters should be fairly well known locally by those concerned who would be able to judge whether a person was suitable for having a shotgun certificate <e> <s> the point made about references is per cent <e> <s> correct <e>

<e> <s> if the situation that my noble friend described arises the visitor is entitled to ask the <e>", "<cs> i listened with interest to what my noble friend lord northesk had to say <e> <s> i think we are being a little inward looking <e> <s> perhaps we should be outward looking and consider the position when a british person is invited or goes to shoot in a foreign country <e> <s> i went for a weekends pheasant <e>", "<cs> i find my noble friends remark most extraordinary <e> <s> the control to which he refers is control by the existing laws of the land <e> <s> if a person has a shotgun certificate and possesses a shotgun he can shoot anywhere he wants and at any time that he wants provided that he obeys the laws of the land <e> <s> if he shoots on land which does not belong to him or on which he does not have permission to shoot he is trespassing or poaching and is dealt with accordingly <e> <s> it is exactly the same with a visitor <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will give way i should like to point out that i never said that at all <e> <s> i said that this is covered by the existing laws of the country <e> <s> of course one does not accept that people come hither and thither and just shoot where they want <e> <s> i never suggested that <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will withdraw what he said <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend on this <e> <s> i suggest that he is being most reasonable in putting forward a time-limit of some hours <e> <s> it is astonishing the number of people who for some reason or another find it necessary to withdraw from a days shooting at much less notice than that <e> <s> i should have thought that it would not be difficult to be able to substitute people at whatever hour not just at hours notice <e> <s> anyway this is the amendment we are discussing and i hope very much the point has been taken on board by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> since the section dealing with group applications is creating enormous difficulties we cannot do this we cannot do that we cannot do the other yet we need to do something is it necessary to have a group application at all <e> <s> if every person who comes to this country applies for and is issued with a permit for the weapon that he uses whether a shotgun or rifle is it necessary to have a group application <e> <s> if not the question does not arise <e>", "<cs> in that case my noble friends amendment must be considered very seriously <e>", "<cs> i do not understand it all <e> <s> when we get the legal profession at it i become completely lost <e> <s> i should have thought it would be a good idea for the committee to consider every aspect of anything to do with guns <e> <s> however if my noble friend does not like that so be it <e> <s> perhaps he might like to think again about the matter <e> <s> i should have thought it made sense <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this is the second time this evening that i have been flabbergasted <e> <s> i certainly say that my noble friend lord ferrers is not a toothless and emaciated minister <e> <s> i am very pleased that he has taken this course and i am delighted <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but perhaps i did not say as much as i should have done on that point <e> <s> there is a wide disparity of views among chief constables when they come to consider the granting or otherwise of shotgun and firearms certificates <e> <s> it might be constructive and helpful to constabularies <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment per cent <e> <s> the remaining per cent <e> <s> is the area where i am concerned about allowing an employee to lend weapons to whoever he chooses <e> <s> that is dangerous <e> <s> i believe that i am right in saying that in law an employer is responsible for the actions of his employee where he performs them as part of his job <e> <s> therefore it must follow that if a keeper or stalker were to allow someone to use a firearm on his employers property and with his employers knowledge and consent that matter would be covered by the law <e> <s> the amendment as moved by my noble friend lord kimball is absolutely essential <e> <s> however we must be careful about extending lending permission to employees <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what my noble friend lord burton said in that i think that some people are getting slightly overexcited about the matter <e> <s> the concept of self-loading rifles and bullets flying off in all directions at mph <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the amendment is somewhat surplus to requirements <e> <s> while understanding entirely the intentions behind the noble ladys amendment i have to say that it cannot be regarded as necessary and in some cases it could be misleading <e> <s> the amendment clearly states <e>", "<cs> good lord <e> <s> my lords what has happened now <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a supporter of this amendment when we discussed it among ourselves prior to today but having listened to what my noble and learned friend lord hailsham and my noble friend lord campbell of alloway have said it seems to me that those of us who wish to try to make life easier for those who wish to hold shotguns are in fact making life more difficult <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend lord ferrers and the government have gone a very long way towards helping matters because if one takes out any reference to number <e> <s> of guns held and then goes on to say that the certificate shall specify the description of shotguns in the plural and if known the identification numbers of guns again in the plural <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the remarks made by the noble and learned advocates here i

point that my noble friend lord peel made about compensation <e> <s> the basic facts are that although a court or the chief constable of police may order a weapon to be confiscated or removed from the person who owns it the right to continue to own that weapon is not removed from that person <e> <s> there is a world of difference there <e> <s> one may have after such an order the right to have a firearm in ones possession but one will have to surrender the firearm itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> in the early stages of consideration of the bill i received in the post as other noble lords may have done certain magazines that i shall not name <e> <s> in them was depicted the most appalling collection of weaponry guns and every conceivable dreadful thing that one can imagine including crossbows <e> <s> i note that crossbows are not covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful for that assistance from the noble lord lord mishcon and my noble friend lord ferrers <e> <s> therefore with the leave of the house i speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing although some of us may have forgotten amendment no <e>

limit may be desirable <e> <s> i do not want in any way to pre-empt the remarks of the noble lord lord john-mackie and what he may feel about this <e> <s> if he wishes to intervene i shall he very happy to give way <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask for clarification from my noble friend <e> <s> am i to understand that persons may apply for and be granted a firearms certificate if they are under the age of <e> <s> and what is the age at which a young person may apply <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is happy with the amendment exactly as it is drafted in regard to the observations that i have made then i am equally happy with it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i disagree most emphatically with the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment because i think this subsection is somewhat unnecessary <e> <s> after all the secretary of state can surely terminate a committee any time he so chooses so why is it necessary to include this subsection <e> <s> i should have thought it was unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment <e> <s> there is an anomaly in that

certificate <e> <s> that seems to me to be slightly heavy-handed <e> <s> i understand the concern of my noble friend on the front bench but i hope that he has had an opportunity of reconsidering the position <e> <s> in principle i believe that the amendment of the noble lord lord monson has a great deal to be considered <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene as my noble friend lord campbell of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that reply which is rather as i expected it would be <e> <s> nevertheless i tested the water <e> <s> i dipped my toe into it and i found it somewhat cool <e> <s> the government have had plenty of opportunity to consider this aspect <e> <s> if they do not wish to take it on board i respect their view <e> <s> therefore if they are happy i for one am absolutely happy <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he answer the question put by the noble lord opposite on why the matter of privilege on this issue has been raised at this late stage <e> <s> it might have been of help to your lordships house to know that this matter was possibly subject to privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord forgive me and allow me to intervene <e> <s> he said that it was restricted to the first male child to be allowed to enter your lordships house and inherit the title <e> <s> that is not quite correct because it depends entirely on the way in which the peerage was granted in the first place as i am sure the noble lord is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord diamond seemed to be most concerned with equal opportunities and fairness for all <e> <s> i think i have a possible solution to his concerns which would obviate the necessity of trying to implement some of the ideas underlying the question of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> far from restricting members of this noble house from attending why not consider creating a whole lot more hereditary peerages only this time they might be entailed general as opposed to entailed male <e> <s> i am sure that would meet with the approval of my noble friend lady platt <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that it must be the desire of all noble lords to stamp out hooliganism in all forms <e> <s> therefore i find it somewhat disappointing that the bill has riot received the amount of support that i should have liked to have seen <e> <s> the government have been extremely courageous <e> <s> it is necessary to deal with areas of unrest and offensiveness which are not good for anybody or any country <e> <s> the government are trying to grasp the nettle <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled about this matter and wonder whether my noble friend can help me <e> <s> he said earlier that the government believe in the totality of the scheme and that it should embrace everyone <e> <s> i agree with him in that but if that is the case why has he introduced an amendment to make certain exclusions <e> <s> that must surely open the very floodgates that have led to the number of amendments tabled by noble lords this evening <e> <s> it seems to me that if we are to have some exclusions some of those that have been tabled particularly this one have a considerable amount of merit <e> <s> i believe in the totality of the scheme but the only way one can have totality is to have no exclusions whatever <e> <s> one cannot go half way <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend has made life a little more difficult for himself in this matter by moving the amendment that we are now trying to amend because it opens the floodgates <e> <s> as i said on second reading i regret that i have not been here for the other stages of the bill we either have a blanket identity card system with no exceptions and everyone knows where they stand or we have exceptions <e> <s> this amendment allows for a reasonable exception <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may ask him whether he is in a position to give the two assurances i sought <e> <s> i asked that after the consultation document is produced within the next month as intended time should be provided for debate <e> <s> if the debate were to show an overwhelming requirement to make a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend i am sorry that i did fire such a fast ball at him <e> <s> we are concerned because these proposals have taken

is an important matter <e> <s> it ought not to be allowed proverbially to be pigeon holed <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for the charming and courteous manner with which he dealt with the amendment especially in view of the short notice that i gave for which i wish to apologise to the house <e> <s> it was due to circumstances slightly beyond my control that notice of the amendment was so short <e> <s> i hope that i may be able to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say this from this side of the house <e> <s> the government must realise that there is a great deal of concern about the weight of legislation that appears in what is called the spill-over period <e> <s> we all understand and accept that it is not possible during the normal parliamentary timetable to get through the whole of the legislation which the government quite rightly wish to see and which has been outlined in the queens speech at the opening of parliament in the previous year <e> <s> but it seems to me to be quite wrong that in the spill-over we should have to deal with what is virtually the beginning of a bill <e> <s> it has not even been through a committee stage <e> <s> for us to have to consider the committee stage of the complex bill that we have before us and the even more complex bill that we had last week to go through all the ramifications of that properly for it to return to another place for them to consider all the suggestions that we have made and for them to give <e>", "<cs> my lords it is all very well for criminals to be apprehended <e> <s> but what does the minister think of the fact that they are let out after a certain time and then commit crime all over again <e> <s> is there not at least some case for considering capital punishment for certain types of murder <e> <s> i should have thought that such a case must be taken on board <e>", "<cs> i do not support the amendment although the suggestion for extending the period to nine months is most reasoned <e> <s> the proposal does not appear to achieve the result which my noble friend and his colleagues desire <e> <s> there are many areas in which employees are engaged on work which cannot manifest itself in a comparatively short space of time <e>", "<cs> i wonder if my noble friend is really getting the point across <e> <s> i do not wish to be impertinent in suggesting that he does not know his business but this matter is rather confusing <e> <s> there may be a feeling that an employee is dismissed and is then given written reasons as to why he is dimissed <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> i hope that i shall be corrected if i am wrong <e> <s> i believe that the current situation is and will be that before an employee is dismissed he must receive not one but two written notices of why he is dismissed <e> <s> is the noble baroness correcting me <e>", "<cs> i take the point of the noble baroness <e> <s> however under present legislation there is no requirement upon an employer to give written notice of complaint or intention to dismiss up to six months <e> <s> as i understand it the government wish to extend that requirement to two years <e> <s> the point i make is that it is desirable to extend it to two years because in many areas of employment it is difficult to ascertain whether or not an employee is actually proving his worth <e> <s> as i said when i intervened i find it rather sad that when an employer has to try to mark his card he must put it in writing to an employee why he is dissatisfied <e> <s> if you put it in writing or speak verbally you cannot undo it <e> <s> you sow the seeds of mistrust <e> <s> i prefer to have an opportunity of being given rather longer for a bedding-in period to ensure justice from the employees and the employers points of view <e> <s> that is why i do not agree with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the concern shown by many members of the house is it possible that the results of the consultation document and questionnaire might be attended to within a matter of weeks rather than months and a full and detailed report made available to the many people who are concerned about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the proposal put forward by my noble friend in his question were to be accepted there are many local small churches of even greater antiquity and importance to the national interest and they should not be overlooked by the government in their consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> however does not business currently conducted produce the somewhat unedifying situation whereby government can and do change the proposed date to suit their own <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that part of the problem is that historically consumers have had water somewhat on the cheap for quite a long time and that we are just beginning to catch up <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that there are many employees who occupy tied cottages for which the employers pay the rates <e> <s> the employees wages are commensurate with the benefits of those who live in tied cottages <e> <s> on that basis will my noble friend give any indication or assurance of what the government may be able to do to encourage those responsible for negotiating wage structures for people living in tied cottages in particular agricultural workers clergy firemen police and so on so that their wages will take into account the poll tax to be met rather than the employer having the benefit of not having to pay rates <e> <s> some measure in this direction will be most necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords when a property became unoccupied there was six months leeway during which no rates were paid <e> <s> will not the same apply to the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords have we changed names or changed sides <e> <s> your lordships will remember that there was a certain baron frankenstein <e> <s> he was a kindly man who created a monster <e> <s> as he was a kindly man i am sure it was a kindly monster he was trying to create but things went wrong and the monster got out of control <e> <s> eventually he was engulfed in flames and the creator of the monster was brought down <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that beef farmers are today experiencing unprecedented difficulty <e> <s> is she further aware that the price of beef has fallen in the past two months from a kilo to p a kilo <e> <s> does she recognise that this represents a loss to the farmer of about per animal <e> <s> this may mean the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say to the noble lord lord monson that his argument about the freedom of the individual perhaps goes too far on this occasion <e> <s> he will remember very well how we joined forces over the legislation requiring the wearing of seatbelts <e> <s> we used that same argument <e> <s> i must say that while i entirely support the idea of the freedom of the individual i have become a total convert to legislation which requires a sensible provision <e> <s> that is without doubt of the greatest benefit <e> <s> the result of the seatbelts bill is that more and more people voluntarily wear them <e> <s> the wildlife and countryside act requires people to keep their dogs under control by putting them on leads <e> <s> i have found from my own experience that more and more people who walk across my estate at home keep their dogs on a lead where before the passing of that legislation they did not do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord stoddart to an artist by the name of thelwell <e> <s> i have never in my life seen more violent brutes than those little ponies which can be far more fearsome than a large well-trained and lovely hunter <e>", "<cs> with such a charming plea how can i possibly do otherwise <e> <s> however i am not convinced by the arguments that have been proposed against my amendment <e> <s> i do not believe my noble friend lord brougham listened when i said that it was not a case of police constables hiding under bushes to see whether children were wearing hard hats while they were riding <e> <s> i cannot accept what my noble friend said <e> <s> the prospect of intrusion by the police on to private land is quite wrong <e> <s> police do not intrude into private motor vehicles to see whether seat belts are worn <e> <s> it is only when drivers transgress the law or something goes wrong that that factor comes into play <e> <s> i am merely suggesting that if an accident occurred on private land and the riders <e>", "<cs> i take that point <e> <s> i also accept what the noble baroness said that if children go out riding even off road they are likely to wear protective headgear in any case <e> <s> i just thought it would be more sensible to ensure that they did wear such headgear <e> <s> however not many members of the committee have spoken in favour of my amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness made a charming and impassioned plea for me to withdraw my amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say that i have a degree of sympathy with my noble friend <e> <s> provided that both these amendments i am afraid that we have not discussed the second one are taken together one would end up with <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down is it in order for me to ask for clarification <e> <s> he said that i appear to support the amendment <e> <s> i wish to correct him <e> <s> is this amendment contingent upon amendment no <e> <s> which we have not yet addressed <e> <s> on its own the amendment is unacceptable to me <e> <s> however in conjunction with amendment no <e> <s> it could be acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lord does my noble friend agree that one of the ways in which he could meet the point in the noble viscounts question is to consider setting the speed limit at a slightly more realistic level in these days of much improved roads and much safer and improved motor cars <e> <s> many people i have to admit that i am one find excessive difficulty in maintaining the statutory speed limit of miles per hour <e> <s> a slightly more realistic level might contribute towards solving this difficulty and might be respected by more people <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that despite what some people may think there are many ministers and former ministers who can bring an enormous amount of influence and practical experience to many companies in the same way that many people involved in companies can bring a good deal of experience and practicality to another place and indeed to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i have to take issue with my noble friend lord gisborough <e> <s> the amendment is quite unnecessary it opens the floodgates to people arguing about what is and what is not reasonable <e> <s> people can always think up an excuse for not doing things in this life <e> <s> if they are not given the excuse in the first place there is no argument <e>", "<cs> while i have sympathy with what the noble lord lord mcintosh said i sometimes begin to wonder whether we have lost the romantic feeling of rural england <e> <s> what is more attractive i ask myself than seeing the lowing herd being driven gracefully from field to barn and from barn through the village <e> <s> roads came about because farmers wanted to get their cattle from a to b it seems that the needs of the motor car and the hurry people are in have taken precedence over this nostalgic romantic attitude <e> <s> the word shall is a little strong <e> <s> consideration could be given to instituting something like that but it might be a little heavy handed <e>", "<cs> i do not entirely go along with my noble friend lord jenkin in thinking that there is a great deal of merit in the amendment <e> <s> how far do we carry this <e> <s> the amendment is designed to advise people when buying cigarettes that they should look at the packet to see that they could be fined or or whatever it is if they drop it <e> <s> then they have to decide whether to drop it and pay or put it in their pocket and take it home <e> <s> the amendment is self-defeating <e> <s> the law ought to be and i hope that it will be when the act is passed that basically we do not leave litter lying about <e> <s> it could not matter less what the fine is for the offence <e> <s> that is just to encourage people not to do it again <e>", "<cs> i hope it will be appropriate for me to speak to my amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with this amendment and is to an extent relevant to this discussion <e> <s> i should be grateful if my noble friend on the front bench could give me some guidance on my amendment <e> <s> it could be deemed by some people to be somewhat surplus to requirements <e>", "<cs> in the part of the world from which i come his throwing up is something which is not understood <e> <s> we always talk about feeding down the cattle and bedding them up <e> <s> i always thought that the farmers had it the wrong way round <e> <s> however so long as they knew what they meant and what had to be done that surely was all that mattered <e>", "<cs> i am not at all happy with that answer <e> <s> he has tried to play fast and loose <e> <s> i do not mind being taken for a bit of a dimwit at times because i am prepared to admit that i am and that i do not understand everything <e> <s> but what are we talking about <e> <s> we are talking about litter <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> we are not talking about snow on the motorways or anything like that <e> <s> the minister is using that as a cover for not accepting the amendment and i do not think that that is fair <e>", "<cs> we covered that point in an earlier amendment <e> <s> as i understood it one of my noble friends on the front bench confirmed that it was the duty of the local authority to keep pavements clear of litter and refuse <e> <s> it is common sense you put out the refuse so that it can be picked up more quickly <e> <s> i seek to remove the wheely-bins <e> <s> there should be a requirement for the council to collect refuse from peoples homes or from points adjacent thereto <e> <s> it is not right or proper that anyone particularly the elderly the infirm or the disabled should have to trundle that cumbersome thing down their drives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not think i can support the noble lord lord airedale in the amendment that he proposes for two very good reasons <e> <s> the first is that the words in the bill to which the amendment applies firmly state <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i simply wanted to say that i did that very thing at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch in his speech i am sorry that he is not here to correct me but i believe that i interpret something of what he said suggested that this country in particular and maybe the united states were in danger of acting in a manner that could be described as humbug at one moment seeming to be supportive of the iraqi nation and helping it with weaponry assistance and so on in its war against iran and on the other hand when it appears to suit us not seeming to think it behaved very well towards the nation of kuwait <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult to thank my noble friend for that rather inexhaustive and incomplete reply <e> <s> is he aware that more than per cent <e> <s> of the people of england and wales and of northern ireland have responded positively in favour of adoption of european central time <e> <s> despite the fact that on the other side of the coin per cent <e> <s> of those who live in scotland take an opposite view is he not aware that approximately of those responses came from england and wales and only from scotland <e> <s> should not the government take note of those observations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> i understand and agree to a considerable extent with the points that my noble friend made <e> <s> i only hope that if when the bill becomes law members of your lordships house members of another place or members of the public find that the amount of litter on our streets increases or rubbish bags are left lying around all over the place they will draw it to the attention of the appropriate authorities <e> <s> if someone has to be taken to task for that i hope the appropriate authorities will in taking the person to task be armed with a copy of todays <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stanley has touched on a subject which is very dear to my heart the conservation of wild flowers on roadside verges and the cutting and keeping clean of those verges <e> <s> many years ago when i was on the other side of your lordships house i raised the point but i have not had an opportunity to do so since <e> <s> my noble and learned friend lord hailsham who was sitting on the front bench on that occasion was overheard to say in rather too loud a voice my noble friend rather likes his partridges <e> <s> that may be true there is nothing nicer than an english partridge whether one goes after them for sport or just likes to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i am not only deaf but i must be blind because i genuinely thought that he had turned to sit down <e> <s> i was enjoying listening to his speech <e> <s> i have had a little trouble in stretching my legs and i apologise sincerely to him <e>"]
