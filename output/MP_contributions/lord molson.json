diplomatic privilege <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> is he aware that many cashiers find that when giving change for larger notes they are asked for pound notes and not for coins <e> <s> if the paper wears out unduly fast have the government given consideration to substituting a plastic pound note <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by my noble friend <e> <s> this problem can be approached from three different points of view but they are all so closely connected that it is extremely difficult to know how to deal with them by means of individual amendments <e> <s> my noble friend referred in particular to the cambridge colleges <e> <s> they are a case in point <e> <s> on the other hand they are only one particularly important case where large areas may be let not necessarily by a charitable organisation like a cambridge college but possibly by another organisation to a body which is going to develop them on a lease of perhaps years <e> <s> ninety-nine years may he a reasonable period for a pension fund which has to look far ahead <e> <s> if it is possible under the provisions of the bill for the freehold to be acquired it will be most undesirable for a lease of that kind to be let <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend will allow me to interrupt in respect of that particular point it happens to be the case that it was flats which were going to be built <e> <s> but they could perfectly well have been houses <e> <s> it happens that in that case fortunately the scheme was for flats which do not come within the mischief of this bill <e> <s> but had they been houses and it is natural that when profitable commercial development is taking place houses will be developed at the same time it would have been possible for there to be such enfranchisement as would have meant reversion of the whole of the area to the freeholder impossible <e>", "<cs> i will not repeat the points that have been so cogently put by my noble friend lord ingleby <e> <s> i wish only to emphasise one point and that is that i feel that in a number of provisions of this bill the government are a little inclined to take the short view and to consider the present generation without having regard to a subsequent generation <e> <s> they feel that it is wrong to deprive disabled people of the right to buy that the right to buy means that accommodation which is particularly adapted for the use of disabled people will go out of the category of the housing which is specially reserved shall i say <e> <s> for disabled people and will become part of the general stock of the housing of the country <e>", "<cs> at the outset i should like to say that my noble friend lady masham has raised some points which i hope the minister will deal with <e> <s> i rise again to answer on behalf of my noble colleagues and myself the question which was put by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> we did not have in mind at all the question of discounts when we framed this amendment <e> <s> it really is in order to try to preserve in the special category housing which is suitable and specially adapted for disabled people and to prevent it as a result of sale from going out of that special category and into the general stock of housing suitable for everyone in the country <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate my noble friends courtesy <e> <s> does he draw no distinction between inheritance of

see an item in <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that i voted on each occasion against the government on the last occasion i think that perhaps i ought to say a few words to explain my position this afternoon <e> <s> i did not think that the government were wise in introducing this provision in another place after having accepted the decision of your lordships house that the right to buy should not apply to the tenants of charitable housing trusts <e> <s> i largely agree with the views expressed in the article in <e>", "<cs> there is no need for me to speak at any length after the speech that we have heard from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> not only was he for a long time a lord of appeal but during that period he presided over the consolidation committee <e> <s> he therefore has expert knowledge not only from the point of view of draftsmanship but also in regard to the problem of getting these matters through the elaborate machinery of consolidation <e> <s> i think he has made out an unanswerable case for something to be done in order to consolidate this legislation before it goes out to be interpreted and put into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the regulations under which this clamping is done vary from one part of london to another <e> <s> if that is so which are the authorities that lay down the rules <e> <s> would the minister not agree that a motorist resident in london and observing the rules that apply where he lives would find it extremely inconvenient to discover that they do not apply in the same way elsewhere and that he may find himself unintentionally contravening the regulations in another part of london <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend to put to him one penetrating point <e> <s> he has accepted fully the line of reasoning of the noble and learned lord and of my noble friend lord broxbourne <e> <s> the point that we want to be assured about is that some form of consolidation will be published

short time because it is my intention to confine them to the bill before the house at the moment and not to go into the general question of whether these various local authorities should or should not

maintaining the essential infrastructure of the country rather than for it to be spent on unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords having at one time been chairman of the committee on national parks i

have been made to the water and sewerage authorities <e> <s> if so would he represent to the secretary of state that at a time when capital and current expenditure are being strictly limited when in every way the expenditure of local authorities is being restricted and when the grant from the treasury has been reduced below per cent <e> <s> this is an inauspicious moment to ask for the repayment of loans <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister has confirmed that under the present plans there will be million less available to the thames water authority this year will he represent to his right

cover the same ground could be discussed in a general debate on the two of them <e> <s> of course that will not preclude any noble lord who does not participate in the first part of the debate from rising when i rise later to move my own amendment <e>", "<cs> it is very simple to give an answer to that <e> <s> it is that the previous system was very unsatisfactory and was declared to be so at the time by an impartial inquiry <e> <s> but in any case my noble friend may avail himself of the opportunity of making a speech later when no doubt he will have very important points to raise <e>", "<cs> you are not <e>", "<cs> your lordships have listened to the contribution from my noble friend lord colville of culross <e> <s> just as in an earlier debate today he fired broadshots into me which were very damaging he has made a contribution to this debate which is of outstanding importance <e> <s> as the lawyer that he is he recognises that these matters cannot be dealt with within the ambit of the present bill <e> <s> but he has in confirmation of some of the things that have been said from the opposition benches mentioned how inadequate has been the enforcement of conditions that have been applied in the past <e> <s> in view of the free ways of discussion in this committee where strict relevancy is not enforced as it is elsewhere i wonder whether the minister will give an undertaking that the department will consider the interesting points that have been raised by my noble friend lord colville with a view to seeing whether at some more convenient time something could be done to deal with these obsolete provisions which apparently have not been enforced <e>", "<cs> i did not really mean that and i wholly accept it <e> <s> i know that the bill provides that they may be dealt with at different times <e> <s> i also know from discussions with my noble friend lord colville that there are some parts of the country where things are sufficiently well arranged and planned at the present time for there to be no urgent need about it <e> <s> but it remains the fact that the whole structure of this bill requires that there shall be unitary development plans <e> <s> some of them will impinge upon each other and others will not <e> <s> but to a greater or lesser extent it will be necessary for the secretary of state to bring into his purview the range and effect of each one of those unitary plans <e> <s> frequently he may say this does not impinge upon another one and can go ahead <e> <s> but the fact remains that under the structure of this bill where the secretary of state is taken as the strategic authority he is ultimately responsible for giving guidance in the drafting of part i of each one of the unitary plans to each one of the authorities <e>",

complicated procedure <e> <s> all i seek from them is an assurance that before the secretary of state commits himself to guidance there shall be reasonable opportunity for authorities and persons affected to make representations <e>", "<cs> i find myself in a very great difficulty <e> <s> there is such a strong feeling in support of the amendment <e> <s> it has necessarily been somewhat confused by the complications <e> <s> i should however like to put a plain and simple question to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> do i understand him aright in that all he really objects to is the word shall imposing a statutory obligation upon the minister and making it a justiciable issue <e> <s> i can understand the difficulty about that and i sympathise <e> <s> in return for my

appropriately be my last sentence <e> <s> i hope that if the government are not prepared to accept these amendments at the present time they will indicate that these are substantial problems which we are trying to raise and that we might have discussions between now and the report stage with a view to the solution of these problems being reached with agreement <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt my noble friend to ask for elucidation <e> <s> it is difficult to take in precise words about these rather complicated matters <e> <s> it is very difficult to see how the green belts can be efficiently administered if different planning authorities are going to be responsible for different parts of them <e> <s> it has been the great advantage of the intermediate tier that they have first in the case

which we were discussing rather fully the other day and which is in the hands of the secretary of state will be used for that purpose <e> <s> of course it will be difficult to do but if i have an assurance that the government really intend that it shall be effective i have no doubt that they will see to it that it is effective <e>", "<cs> it is at the same time the great advantage and the great disadvantage of your lordships house that it does not have the strict procedure which obtains in another place <e> <s> it puts an almost intolerable burden upon the noble lord who presides <e>

the government are anxious to preserve the amenities which exist at the present time <e>", "<cs> i am sorry if i misunderstood my noble friend in what he was suggesting <e> <s> i concur of course in what the noble baroness said <e> <s> but the point i really want to establish is this <e> <s> i think that probably a majority of your lordships will feel that to devolve the administration of all the

atmosphere at this stage is very different from the atmosphere at the committee stage <e> <s> while my noble friend the minister of state rightly abstained from committing himself in any way at this stage to any definite proposal i thought that his whole approach was different from what it had been at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the hopes which the government have aroused

tendencies of the councillors who happen to be at the present time in office <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government recognise that by introducing this bill they will be breaching the undertakings

hope is the case under planning legislation it is possible to take into account the quality of the limestone so that limestone that is valuable for industrial purposes is not indiscriminately used

before i come to the difference between the speeches of noble lords and members of the government and the wording of the amendment that we are asked to accept perhaps i may say that i was interested to note the remarks of my honourable friend the minister for housing that he thought the amendments carried in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of this very welcome decision by the government
