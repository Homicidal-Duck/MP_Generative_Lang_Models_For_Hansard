["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether or not he thinks that the scale of the problem as revealed in the articles referred to is really beyond the scope of local councils and should receive serious attention from central government <e> <s> secondly does he not think that the implementation of a large-scale scheme of remedial action in these areas would bring relief to probably the most hard-pressed area of british industry namely the civil engineering construction industry where unemployment at the moment is running at about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government how they reconcile their apparent willingness to fund research into either a second severn crossing or a barrage compared with their apparent unwillingness to consider any form of finance for an equally important fixed link namely the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether the detection and lifting of mines in the falklands is still proceeding satisfactorily <e> <s> in addition is it not a fact that the failure of the argentines during the hostilities to keep adequate records of such minefields under the geneva convention has made that operation even more hazardous than usual <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government bear in mind the possibility of using the service tunnel in the proposed channel link for any future electricity cables or indeed other utilities from this country to the continent <e>", "<cs> my lords can the government say whether they have any plans to increase the opencast coal workings in this country bearing in mind that the profitability of coal from that source is i believe something like times greater than from deep mined coal <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first declare an interest in this important debate in that i have for some years been the president of the channel tunnel association <e> <s> anticipating a few blank faces in the chamber i think i should explain that the association is a purely non-political and indeed noncommercial association and that its members who are fairly small in number have existed purely to keep prodding government and private enterprise for many years to get this project under way <e> <s> the only asset that the association has ever had is probably the largest collection of documents in excess of relating to the channel tunnel going back well into the last century <e> <s> i am happy to say that this collection is now safely in the archive of churchill <e> <s> college cambridge <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> what i wish to say is based on personal experience <e> <s> in january i found myself at nuremberg during the trials <e> <s> my duties were in a very humble capacity <e> <s> i was an officer commanding the ceremonial guard which mounted guard outside the palace of justice <e> <s> since we shared that responsibility with the other three great powers we had to undertake it only every fourth day <e> <s> it was not very onerous <e> <s> however one was able to watch the trials daily which i did for a period of some weeks <e>"]
