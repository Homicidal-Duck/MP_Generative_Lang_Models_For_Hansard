["<cs> my lords i must first of all declare an interest in the subject brought forward for debate by my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> in the autumn i become the master of birkbeck college where per cent <e> <s> of the students are part-time <e> <s> i hope very much that the difficult financial situation which faces the college can be resolved <e> <s> if not i fear that both providers and potential students elsewhere will be discouraged and will draw their own conclusions about the value attached to part-time studies in our system of post-school education <e> <s> birkbeck has a special symbolic importance as an institution which for over years has helped people who work in the day to study at night <e> <s> i know that many members of your lordships house have supported birkbeck in recent months and how much this has been appreciated <e> <s> i also appreciate the remarks of the noble baroness lady seear on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise that i shall not be able to stay until the end of this debate <e> <s> following as i do the noble baroness lady carnegy i should like initially to endorse everything that she said about adult education <e> <s> as she perhaps knows this is a subject which is very dear to my heart although i shall not talk about it this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that this bill is yet another example of centralist intervention in the work of elected local authorities who are trying to develop and implement policies which they consider meet the needs of their own communities <e> <s> if it becomes law without substantial amendment the bill is going to greatly increase central power <e> <s> as such it poses a further threat to the delicate balance between central and local government which has been built up over very many years and which is an important linchpin of our constitution <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the bill was rejected by this house <e> <s> what i said was that ministers in this house rejected it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord st john of fawsley on his really excellent maiden speech and i hope that we shall have the opportunity of hearing him again on many future occasions in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that professional opinion is united in the view that dismemberment of the inner london education authority will lead to a decline in the quality of educational standards in inner london <e> <s> is she further aware that in the house some two weeks ago she misquoted me in a misleading way by suggesting that my views were out of line with those of other professions when they are not <e> <s> can she say why the government are ignoring the views of experts on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two reasons i should like to support the amendment of the noble baroness lady platt <e> <s> the first relates to <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord lord colnbrook on his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall be hearing very much more from him in this house <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead for initiating this debate <e> <s> there can never have been a more timely subject for this house to consider <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i believe that the main problems of the inner cities relate to central government policies high unemployment and inadequate funding for housing <e>", "<cs> my lords on the subject of parents to which the noble and learned lord has just referred will be answer the question that i put earlier about the parents poll in ilea and what the government intend to do <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not believe that what the noble lord has just said answers my question <e> <s> it merely tells us something that we already know <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill before the house will do serious damage to our education system if it is enacted without substantial amendment <e> <s> it is riddled with false assumptions about the existing system <e> <s> it is a tragic missed opportunity as far as concerns remedying defects and of course there are defects <e> <s> it is a piece of social engineering based on the ideology of the market place <e> <s> as such it is flawed in its conception because a free market can never operate in relation to a public good like education in the way that it can operate for consumer goods like television sets or motor cars <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment but in doing so i want to assure the committee that i do not oppose the idea of a national curriculum <e> <s> there is a strong case for trying to develop a common <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness could say whether the government have abandoned the idea of multiple choice paper and pencil tests designed to create league tables within schools or local education authorities <e> <s> it was not entirely clear from her answer <e> <s> however i believe it would be in the spirit of the tgat report which she implied the government have accepted to abandon that kind of testing <e>", "<cs> i must beg to differ with the minister <e> <s> i do not believe it is the case that the tgat report accepted that those kinds of tests should be <e>", "<cs> i shall want to return to this matter on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what my noble friend lady lockwood said as regards amendment no <e> <s> and careers education <e> <s> i want to speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to try to introduce greater flexibility into the curriculum and to allow head teachers and governors to do exactly what the noble earl lord swinton told the committee was important during the committee stage of the act <e> <s> in other words to respond to local needs and circumstances and to the preferences of parents so that schools can have their individual curricula aims <e> <s> it will give parents through the governing body on which they will be represented a genuine opportunity to play a part in expressing their views <e>", "<cs> it has long been agreed by professional educators that assessment should be a continuous process and not something that just takes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister exactly what he means when he says there will not be syllabuses but that the degree of detail will vary from subject to subject <e> <s> can he tell us a bit about which subject there will be more detail for and which subject there will be less detail for and where the dividing line is to be between a syllabus on the one hand a programme of study on the other hand and guidelines as a third example <e> <s> it is very confusing and unclear <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> this has been unsatisfactory <e> <s> we are not only in a muddle about what constitutes core and foundation <e> <s> we are also in a muddle about where guidelines are to be operated where programmes of study will be operated and where we will have something rather more detailed and more like syllabi <e> <s> in agreeing to take this away i hope that he will not only look to clarify core and foundation but also say where we shall have guidelines where we shall have programmes of study and exactly where they will apply and what those terms mean <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> one of the great strengths of the british education system has been the opportunities available for grass root experiment and innovation for local education authorities to develop various new kinds of approach for heads to try out new ways of organising the school day and for classroom teachers to develop new teaching methods and new curricula <e> <s> are we to abandon all this in one fell swoop as a result of this bill <e> <s> if permission to experiment has to be sought from the secretary of state how is he going to cope with the many approaches that he is likely to receive <e> <s> clearly he will be unable to decide all of them for himself because he is a very busy man <e>", "<cs> i am perturbed at the position <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee understands how enormous is the process we are entering into with the system of assessment which is proposed in this bill <e> <s> we are building up a vast and costly new edifice <e> <s> it is not simply an occasional little test that children may carry out once or twice in their school career it is a vast new and untried system <e>", "<cs> i wish to query several of the statements made by the noble lord lord trafford <e> <s> like the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley i speak as an ex-education officer <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord trafford has been rather unfair to local education authority administrators many of whom are dedicated people working very hard and trying to do the best for children and young people in the areas they serve <e> <s> the noble lord was particularly unfair i think to the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley who seemed to me quite the opposite of arrogant in the manner in which he put his arguments he put them clearly rationally and in a convincing way <e>", "<cs> i should like to except myself from inclusion in that accusation <e> <s> i do not think that i always know i never did think that i always knew <e> <s> when operating in local education authority administration i tried not to take that view <e> <s> many of us speak as parents who have had children in the maintained system and who have been involved in exercising difficult choices about where to send our children <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly have the opportunity of answering that <e> <s> i should like as an aside to begin by correcting the sexist terminology used by the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> many schools have headmistresses and i think it is appropriate to use the neutral term head teachers rather than simply assuming that all schools are run by men which is something that many educationists have been trying to change <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble baroness will agree that if parents make choices on racial grounds there is a case for removing those choices <e> <s> if the government are serious about the importance they attach to removing racial prejudice and racial discrimination they will agree that certain basic principles and moral values must come before mere choice <e> <s> one of the most dangerous developments that can take place in a multi-racial society is a growth in racial prejudice intolerance and discrimination <e> <s> if that happens the likelihood of racial conflict and violence between racial groups is greatly increased <e>", "<cs> i should like the opportunity to respond to what the noble lord lord trafford has just said <e> <s> once again he has shown his rather attractive suspicion of the motives of local authorities <e> <s> he suggested that they would use the amendment as an excuse to find other ways around the legislation <e> <s> i do not believe that they would do so in this case <e> <s> however i accept that there are always practical difficulties in trying to qualify a basic principle <e> <s> nevertheless basic principles sometimes need to be qualified in the interest of other perhaps bigger and broader ones <e> <s> that is what i think the amendment is seeking to do <e>", "<cs> will it be possible for the minister to give a clear answer to my noble friend lady davids question <e> <s> we are still left a little confused as to the answer <e>", "<cs> i should like once again to refer to the fact that the noble lord lord trafford used the term headmasters <e> <s> perhaps i shall offer to put on a short course in non-sexist terminology <e> <s> i shall make a very small charge for noble lords to come on that course <e> <s> perhaps we will then avoid my having to make this speech every time i rise to speak <e>", "<cs> the minister referred to governors doing a job <e> <s> does he not accept that many governors as i said before will be parents <e> <s> they have other jobs to do besides being governors and as well as bringing up their children <e> <s> to ask them to take on all these extra responsibilities if they do not wish to take them on and if they feel trepidation about them and even to insist that they take them on will be likely to destroy the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> will the minister accept that having a business background does not necessarily qualify someone in understanding about the needs of schools in contemporary society <e> <s> that person may know quite a lot about finance but may not know how to apply that financial knowledge to the education system <e>", "<cs> speaking as a rough girl and that can be interpreted in a number of ways i believe that the ministers reply was nothing much more than a string of rather banal generalisations without any evidence or support for them <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness may not have used the words all over the country but she implied that parents are desperately unhappy <e> <s> i dispute that <e> <s> those were the words used by the noble <e>", "<cs> will the minister also tell us what will happen to the curriculum in a grant-maintained school if the numbers decline considerably <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> zb <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is very simple <e> <s> there are large numbers of pupils in primary and secondary schools in some <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that reply and especially grateful that the minister accepts the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> can he perhaps say what he will do when cases are drawn to his attention in which the guidelines have not been adhered to by governing bodies <e>", "<cs> i had hoped that the position could be made clear in regulations which would have safeguarded it rather better than merely issuing guidance <e> <s> however in the light of that answer i shall beg leave to withdraw my amendment in due course <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that assurance in the light of which i am content not to move the other amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer the question of the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> most new denominational schools have been set up in areas where the population is increasing not in areas where there are major declines in population and where rolls are falling <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that it would be a great pity if the two institutions to which my noble friend lady david referred have to revert from being tertiary colleges with all the flexibility that that involves to being either sixth form colleges or sixth forms <e> <s> it means that a possible future growth in part-time provision for to year-olds in the areas that the colleges serve will become more difficult <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the noble and learned lord will agree that it is valuable to have a mix of people on governing bodies and committees of that kind <e> <s> the government have become somewhat obsessed with representation from industrial and commercial interests <e> <s> we must remember that many of the students who leave the institutions will be employed by the public sector and not only by the private sector although many will and i do not doubt that is is desirable that they should be <e>", "<cs> i also have experience in these matters and speak as the head of an institution of the university of london <e> <s> i should like to refer to one or two points made by the noble lord lord annan <e> <s> he said that it would be difficult for a young person to go into a group of much older people many of whom had more experience in these matters <e> <s> my institution has many mature students <e> <s> even mature students who perhaps have greater confidence and more experience of speaking in committees would find it enormously useful to have a colleague so that they could confer together <e>", "<cs> i know what happened to the noble lord lord bellwin since he left his school but i do not know what happened to the other pupils <e> <s> i am sure that everybody in this committee will agree that almost all parents would prefer their children not to be educated in a class with children <e> <s> almost all <e>", "<cs> i have nothing to reply to that intervention which i do not think is particularly helpful <e> <s> i wish briefly to mention my point about costs <e> <s> it is true that ilea has had high levels of expenditure <e> <s> it is possible that in the past some savings might have been made that were not made <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> however as again the noble earl lord baldwin of bewdley has said the costs of providing services in inner london are very much higher than they are in many other parts of the country <e> <s> that applies to the police to the social services and to other services <e> <s> but the government introduced new legislation not very long ago to control expenditure by local authorities where they consider that spending is too high <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way for a moment <e> <s> does he agree that truancy is seen in every major city in all developed countries and particularly in cities suffering from urban decay <e> <s> to suggest that truancy is the fault of the inner london education authority cannot be fair <e> <s> perhaps the minister will also tell the committee what he thinks the inner london boroughs will do to reduce the rates of truancy <e>", "<cs> like the noble viscount lord combermere i have some responsibility for adult education in london <e> <s> indeed the university of londons extra mural studies department will be incorporated into birkbeck college on st august this year <e> <s> that department has had an enormous range of contacts with ileas further and adult education provisions <e> <s> many of us are extremely nervous about how far the universitys contribution to this area of work can continue when we have to negotiate with different authorities rather than with one <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may draw to the attention of the minister one particular aspect of the draft guidance <e> <s> it suggests on page that many areas will need to be the subject of discussion between the department and councils and ilea as appropriate <e> <s> i think it woud be very helpful if we could have some clarification as to what ilea as appropriate means <e> <s> i should have thought that ilea would have to be consulted about almost every aspect of this transfer if it is to be achieved in an effective and efficient manner <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say how this extra training is to be paid for in a context where local authorities have been substantially cut back and are finding difficulty in maintaining a number of services in the field of education <e> <s> can the minister also say how professional competence is to be tested <e>", "<cs> my lords like many other speakers in this debate i welcome the report <e> <s> there can be few more important areas of research than work that tries to advance our understanding of the causes and nature of disease and how it may be prevented controlled or cured <e> <s> new discoveries in medical research have transformed the lives of millions of people not only in this country but around the world <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that what the minister said on a previous occasion did not convince many of us and it does not convince the second time round <e> <s> i was very disappointed with much of her response and in one respect at least i thought she was being somewhat disingenuous in suggesting that many teachers support the national curriculum as proposed in the bill because they are already teaching it <e> <s> that is not the case <e> <s> the fact that many teachers are teaching it might be a reason for not being quite as prescriptive as the government are being <e> <s> it does not seem to me to be a good reason to introduce a straitjacket of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i should like to ask a question <e> <s> does modern languages mean european languages or can it mean the languages spoken by many of the ethnic minorities in this country <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to make it possible for those ethnic minority languages to be taught in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her long and considered reply <e> <s> but it leaves a number of unresolved problems <e> <s> i should first like to comment on what the minister said about scotland <e> <s> i accept that a form of national curriculum has been under development in scotland for some time <e> <s> however would it not be much more sensible to build slowly but successfully here in england and wales just as has been happening in scotland securing a consensus from all those who will participate in running the national curriculum the local authorities teachers and so on <e> <s> would not that be better than rushing to impose it on people who are extremely reluctant to take it on hoard <e> <s> to do that would be a recipe for failure when instead we could be proceeding on the same basis that we have seen in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to pursue the point just made by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> at the committee stage we were in some confusion about the differences between core and foundation subjects and about the differences between a syllabus a programme of study and guidelines <e> <s> i hope that we can have clarification on that second matter as well as on the first matter raised by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness for her response but to say that it leaves me a little puzzled <e> <s> i think what she was saying was that the government have decided to follow the recommendations of the tgat report in almost every respect <e> <s> nothing in anything that she said indicated that the government would be rejecting the tgat proposals <e> <s> if that is so it would surely be very easy to accept the amendment yet the minister appears not to be doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have a reply to my questions since i moved the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case i feel that i must divide the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support what has already been said on this amendment <e> <s> it is now at least years since we first heard criticisms about the narrowness of our sixth-form education in this country <e> <s> i should like to point out particularly how narrow it is compared with that of all our neighbours and competitors <e> <s> there is no other country which educates its able to year-olds in such an extraordinarily narrow and overspecialised way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down can be answer the question which i posed earlier <e> <s> it concerns how many more subject working groups the government intend to set up <e> <s> how many will be established <e> <s> when will they be set up <e> <s> what kind of reports are expected from them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i am not altogether convinced by it <e> <s> i believe that there will be a problem in relation to these diverse subject working groups and the way in which they relate to the national curriculum council <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment was to ensure that there would be a clear role for the council in setting the framework <e> <s> however at this late hour i do not intend to divide the house in the matter and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether there is a cabinet split on this matter since the secretary of state for wales seems to have a rather different view <e> <s> in the welsh grand committee last month the secretary of state for wales said <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i do not agree with very much of what he said <e> <s> while i recognise that there are of course difficulties in setting up a system of this kind a great deal of work has already been done <e> <s> some local education authorities of which the ilea is one have already established a scheme of weighting for social factors which is much fairer to individual schools that happen to have a very high proportion of socially deprived pupils <e> <s> it gives far better information about the quality and performance of those schools and indeed schools with a high proportion of socially advantaged pupils which simply publish crude examination results <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i may ask her whether she agrees that if a parent or even two parents have two three or four children in a school all at different stages the importance of the decision about whether the school should become a grant-maintained school will be considerably greater for them than if they only have a single child who may be towards the end of his or her educational career in the school <e> <s> surely it is perfectly legitimate and acceptable that if you have several children in a school then you would have more than one vote whereas it is not acceptable where there are four or five parents and step-parents with a single child in a school that all those parents should have a vote <e> <s> that seems quite illogical <e>", "<cs> my lords regrettably i also feel unable to support the amendment for the reasons given by my noble friend <e> <s> however i should like to point out most strongly that i support the objectives of the noble lord lord st john of fawsley <e> <s> of course it is highly desirable that more children and young people should have a better understanding and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my support for the amendments tabled in the name of my noble friend lady david <e> <s> we have seen the governments original objectives being frustrated <e> <s> their policies as regards ctcs can be <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> there was nothing in what i said which suggested that we do not support public expenditure but public expenditure used for sensible causes <e> <s> i am concerned about obtaining value for money in education <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will agree that it is not value for money to build new secondary schools where there are already too many school places <e>", "<cs> my lords too briefly support the amendment <e> <s> it is a simple change to the bill and a progressive amendment to encourage young people to participate more fully in decisions about their own institutions <e> <s> it will be highly desirable from an educational point of view <e> <s> i very much agree with my noble friend that young people on such bodies can often make an extremely useful contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords should also like to support the amendments <e> <s> we spent a good deal of time yesterday talking about truancy <e> <s> many young people at the ages of and are not especially committed to education and find it rather hard to attend school every day <e> <s> that is regrettable but it is a fact <e> <s> when they reach their twenties and thirties some of those young people will regret the fact that they did not go to school every day when they should have been going <e> <s> it is especially that group that i think could benefit enormously by the provision of adult education on a wide basis <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor able to comment a little more on the desirability of some kind of independent review which might monitor the work of the funding councils <e> <s> one of the characteristics of this bill is that it sets up much new machinery with new functions and new roles <e> <s> i believe it is commonly understood that it is a very good practice in government to build in some kind of mechanism for reviewing new organisations to see whether they have fulfilled their objectives or whether there is need for some adjustment or change <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to hear that i very warmly support these amendments <e> <s> in doing so perhaps i should declare an interest as the head of the only institution in the university sector that is wholly dedicated to part-time education <e>", "<cs> my lords i also do not wish to repeat everything that i said in committee but i feel that i must respond to some of the points made by the noble baroness lady cox <e> <s> that is so particularly because she at least implied that some of the aspects which she most dislikes about the inner london authority have something to do with me <e> <s> i only wish that during the time when i was one of the deputy education officers and then clerk and director of education i had had as much influence as she implied <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> size has disadvantages it also has advantages <e> <s> one of the advantages of size in the inner london education authority has been its ability to provide certain kinds of specialist provision in a way which would be exceedingly difficult for the boroughs <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the secretary of state plays an important role in overseeing the maintenance of this specialist provision <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down may i ask whether it is the intention of the government to prevent excessive salaries being offered by the successor authorities <e> <s> my noble friend lord peston mentioned the london borough of kensington and chelsea which is a very small authority that will only have one county secondary school and which has offered a salary to its chief education officer that is far in excess of what other authorities of that size normally pay <e> <s> will the government be doing anything about that <e> <s> will they at least be issuing some guidance to these successor authorities about the levels of salaries that they ought to be offering <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for her reply which has given me some assurance <e> <s> i very much hope that she will be able to take away these suggestions consider them again and <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it is vital to restore the morale of the teaching profession at a time of great educational change and that a general teaching council might be a most constructive move in that directionwould it not bring teachers collectively together to participate in the implementation of the new legislationcan the noble baroness also say why the government are insisting that pupils should be involved in such a general teaching council i think i heard her correctly when the government have resisted the participation of pupils even at sixth-form level in governing bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should very much like to support what my noble friend lord morton of shuna has said <e> <s> i should also like to defend my noble friend lord peston <e> <s> he is by no means an extinct volcano he erupts very effectively on many occasions when the circumstances require it and i think that this is one of those occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that neither dance nor drama are core or foundation subjects in the national curriculum <e> <s> that is the point that i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like very briefly to support this amendment <e> <s> it provides a fall-back position for the secretary of state to intervene in three very important areas in which i think there is broad agreement on the need for london-wide provision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness for this amendment <e> <s> the introduction of flexibility and the removal of criminal charges will be a great help <e> <s> i know that most members and officers of ilea will be grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to speak in support of the amendment <e> <s> i am involved in the management of staff in universities and at the moment i have just such a case to deal with <e> <s> we have been requested by the ugc to close a department and have agreed to do so <e> <s> however the staff concerned are most worried about moving and are expressing an unwillingness to do so merely because they will lose tenure <e> <s> the agreement to this fairly minor amendment would be of enormous help to those responsible for rationalisation in the university system <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his answer but is he not aware that an increase to per cent <e> <s> does not represent an improvement in the overall numbers in higher education <e> <s> in the circumstances should not the government be taking far more positive steps to expand overall numbers and in particular the participation of those who are currently underrepresented in higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that increasing the age participation rate can be achieved without any increase in the overall numbers because of demography <e> <s> we must therefore try to expand the numbers by bringing in more mature students <e> <s> in those circumstances surely the minister will want to say something positive about how we can encourage mature students rather than discouraging them as we do at present through charging fees <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> however is the minister aware that the secretary of state recommends that per cent <e> <s> of time in the school week should be allocated to mathematics whereas the working group recommends a higher proportion <e> <s> is the minister further aware that in japan as high a proportion as per cent <e> <s> of the school week goes to mathematics <e> <s> does not the minister agree that it would be retrograde to reduce the amount of time available for this extremely important subject in the new national curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware that the time available for preparing in-service training courses for existing teachers of mathematics is extraordinarily short <e> <s> can he reassure the house that the secretary of state will do something about providing both increased resources for teacher training in this area and more time for the preparation of courses <e> <s> can he also reassure the house that the whole issue of a profile component in the practical application of mathematics will be looked at again by the secretary of state who is currently rejecting that proposal of the working group <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not doubt that some changes are needed in the system of student support if only because a great many students are now living in very considerable hardship <e> <s> i say that both as a principal of a higher education institution and as a parent trying to discourage the bank overdraft <e> <s> we cannot continue with a situation in which students cannot afford to buy enough books and sometimes cannot even afford to eat properly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one reason why we have such a poor staying-on rate in this country is the content of sixth-form education <e> <s> despite what the noble baroness has said about some improvement making it less specialised and widening the opportunities are the government going to take any further steps to implement the recommendations in the higginson report and move us away from a very overspecialised three a-levels system <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by apologising for the fact that owing to a long-standing prior commitment i shall be unable to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> secondly i should like to say at the outset that contrary to what some members of the house may be expecting i am not going to devote any time this afternoon to the diplomatic service although it may be quite well known at least among some of your lordships that i have some experience perhaps not as much as the noble baroness lady young or the noble lord lord greenhill <e> <s> however it is experience in a rather different context of our embassies and high commissions overseas of the foreign office in london and of relationships between the foreign and commonwealth office and home departments <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there have been considerable delays in setting up the trust to which he has just referred <e> <s> i believe that that was first discussed as long ago as nine months <e> <s> is he also aware that matters are not entirely as they should be in the city of westminster <e> <s> the chief executive who has been the main officer negotiating the transfer of education from the ilea has just been sacked and has not been replaced <e> <s> will the minister reassure the house that if there are to be further delays he will consider transferring responsibility for the centre for young musicians to a more reliable london borough than the city of westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the society for the protection of unborn children and life have been distributing written material and videos of a quite unsuitable kind for adolescents <e> <s> is he aware that this material is emotionally disturbing technically inaccurate and politically motivated and that it is causing parents a great deal of concern <e> <s> can he say what action the des is taking to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is an extremely difficult question to answer <e> <s> i apologise to the house for some duplication in my question but think it is important for us to take into account that there is a great deal of blurring between moral ethical and political <e> <s> i wish to ask the minister whether he is aware of the blurring that takes place on the subject <e> <s> also is he aware that the health education authority has not been consulted about these extremely unfortunate and emotionally disturbing videos <e> <s> will the des be consulting the health education authority as to their suitability <e>", "<cs> my lords there can be few more serious failures of planning policy-making and administration in the public sector than the discovery that there are too few teachers to achieve our educational goals <e> <s> our future depends more than ever on our population being well educated <e> <s> to achieve this we must value our teachers <e> <s> we must give them the status they deserve for we entrust them with the enormously important task of influencing how the next generation thinks what knowledge it has and what skills it can muster <e> <s> i was rather sorry that the noble baroness lady carnegy of lour should suggest that teachers have been responsible for a change in public perceptions of them <e> <s> i simply do not believe that that is the case <e> <s> teaching our children and doing it well is the most important investment any society makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for his reply to the debate <e> <s> there are many points which he made in his reply that i should like to take up but unfortunately time does not allow me to do so <e> <s> however there are just two or three points that i should like to comment upon and raise further questions about <e>", "<cs> my lords the economic future of britain is being undermined by the present performance of our manufacturing industry <e> <s> as a trading nation we must expand its capacity and increase the output of goods which we sell abroad <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ezra said todays trade figures are a matter for regret and not for rejoicing <e> <s> his debate today is especially timely for that reason <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him for introducing it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the period covered by the report average academic book prices rose by over per cent <e> <s> and the price of periodicals used in universities by just under per cent <e> <s> in these circumstances does the minister not agree that the increase in the universities recurrent grant for spending on libraries is totally inadequate to allow them to catch up and to maintain standards in their libraries <e> <s> is he further aware that the minister responsible for higher education has now admitted that there is a serious brain drain not just of scientists but also of social scientists and academics working in the humanities who are highly dependent on books both for teaching and research <e> <s> those academics are being driven out of the country by the deplorable state of academic libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords like other speakers in the debate i am most grateful to my noble friend lady turner of camden for introducing the debate on a subject of central importance to us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that under resolution koevoet was meant to have been disbanded and demobilised by th september <e> <s> the date now is th october and that has not happened <e> <s> although personnel were demobilised earlier this week there are still another members of koevoet in the south west african police force <e> <s> does the minister agree that unless they are rapidly removed from that role there will be continuing intimidation of voters and members of the civilian population in the north of the country which will jeopardise free and fair elections <e> <s> in those circumstances is it not important that the united kingdom government as a permanent member of the security council should use every pressure that they possibly can to bring that about <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister reassure the house that there will not be a substantial number of schools especially small schools with reduced budgets at a time when educational expenditure has been for some time under pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords i make a short contribution to this debate this evening not as a social scientist not as someone who has expertise in the area of social policy nor even as someone with a long-standing interest in health care but as someone who has personally benefited and whose family has personally benefited from the hospice movement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the time available for wives and relatives to visit remand prisoners is restricted in nearly all prisons to only minutes <e> <s> does he agree that it is highly desirable that contact between prisoners especially those on remand and their families should be maintained <e> <s> does he also agree that minutes is an absurdly short time for any wife or relative who has any distance to travel <e> <s> will he look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the past year there has been a very substantial increase in the number of practising teachers resigning from the profession <e> <s> does he not agree that steps taken to improve recruitment are only part of the problem <e> <s> is he also aware that one of the key areas of shortages is deputy heads where there are a number of vacancies <e> <s> does he agree that it is extremely important to take some action to stem the tide of resignations of practising and experienced teachers <e> <s> can he say what the government intend to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> however is he aware that the des guide for parents on the national curriculum states quite clearly that childrens progress will be measured partly by teachers assessment and partly by national tests known as standard assessment tests <e> <s> is he aware that in spite of this commitment on the part of the des the schools examinations and assessment council has done very little to support teachers assessment whereas it has already spent nearly million on the development of standard assessment tasks <e> <s> in the light of that can the noble viscount say how the system of moderation will take <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful that the noble lord has reaffirmed the governments commitment to teacher assessment <e> <s> in the light of that is he prepared to ask the schools examinations and assessment council if it can prepare much more in the way of in-service training for those teachers who will be involved in assessment <e> <s> that is per cent <e> <s> of them <e>", "<cs> my lords notwithstanding what the noble lord lord beloff said is the minister aware that the audit commission has identified a shortfall of advisers and inspectors which are needed in order to monitor the national curriculum adequately <e> <s> can he say how the government intend to make up that shortfall <e>", "<cs> my lords last year the government published an important green paper on penal policy entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that ctcs have been established in a number of areas where there are already spare spaces in secondary schools <e> <s> in view of the very considerable constraints on public expenditure can he justify the establishment of those institutions <e> <s> does he not agree that were they not to take up substantial amounts of public money there would be more available for nottinghamshire county council to provide an adequate number of places in music schools drama workshops and bands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount for his kind remarks <e> <s> i greatly look forward to debating with him on many future occasions <e> <s> however i am afraid to say that i do not think i shall be able to reciprocate the kindness he expressed in his general comments in what i have to say about the proposals in the order before us today <e> <s> this is a sad day for education and a sad day for teachers <e> <s> i say sad because we are witnessing yet another broken promise to the teaching profession <e>", "<cs> my lords the question facing us is not whether german unification will happen but when and how <e> <s> the political and economic pressures for unification within east and west germany seem likely to grow rather than diminish and to make the process inevitable <e> <s> the two germanys not britain or any other power will have the decisive influence on the pace of change and the extent to which it is staged through loose confederation to tight federation and into complete unification <e> <s> what britain and the rest of europe must avoid is taking any actions which make the process more difficult and disruptive <e> <s> instead with the united states and the soviet union they must ease the process so that it can take place as painlessly as possible <e> <s> above all the western powers will need to create the conditions which minimise fears in the soviet union and other eastern european countries notably poland that a reunited germany will pose a military threat <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a useful and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> the common strand that has run through the speeches of many noble lords is concern about the governments record in investing in education and training <e> <s> the main points have been very well put and i shall not go over them again other than to stress that social and economic goals in education go hand in hand and that education must promote greater social equality to achieve greater economic success <e>", "<cs> my lords i made it perfectly clear in my speech that nursery education was of <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a number of these new city technology colleges are being established in areas where there is already a great number of surplus places in the secondary schools <e> <s> does she not agree that to build new secondary schools in areas where there are already spare places is a ridiculous waste of public money <e> <s> does the minister not further agree that it is particularly strange that the government should be following this route when for many years they have exhorted local authorities to run their secondary school provision on a more value for money and rational basis <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness who is speaking on behalf of the government aware that the des itself has identified a backlog amounting to billion in repairs to school buildings <e> <s> in those circumstances does she not agree that the additional amount of money for capital that has been identified is far too small <e> <s> will she tell the house whether the des will be asking for new money for capital in the light of the hmi report <e>", "<cs> my lords few bills recently coming to this house have provoked such <e>", "<cs> since neither the noble lord lord kilmarnock nor the noble lord lord butterfield mentioned it perhaps i should mention that amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e> <s> i want to speak to both of them <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow on from what the noble baroness has just said <e> <s> i should hate the committee to have the impression that most part-time students are paid for by their employer <e> <s> they are not <e> <s> while some part-time students are undertaking short courses that are specifically training courses from which their employers companies public sector bodies or whatever it may be believe they will benefit we are talking this evening about part-time students doing undergraduate degree level courses <e> <s> most of them are not supported by their employers and have to cover all their costs themselves <e>", "<cs> given what has been said in this committee about the value of part-time students their commitment motivation and anxiety to improve themselves can the minister give us further enlightenment as to why they should be given lower priority than full-time students <e> <s> that is not fair <e>", "<cs> does the minister not agree that we will have two systems any way under the governments proposals <e> <s> we will continue to have a mixture of grants and loans <e> <s> local authorities will continue to spend quite a lot of time and effort dishing out grants <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed with the ministers reply in answer to concern on all sides of the committee about the problems for existing students <e> <s> the amendment deals with the guarantee given to existing students at the beginning of their courses that they would receive a grant subject to means teasting and other regulations associated with the grant <e> <s> now we are saying you will no longer receive a grant instead you will receive a loan <e>", "<cs> i take back my comments <e> <s> yes they will still receive a grant but it will be a grant plus a loan rather than a grant uprated by a more significant amount taking into account inflation and other costs <e>", "<cs> there are going to be very many demands on the access funds which are not very large sums of money <e> <s> i am doubtful whether they will cover all the claims that will be made on them <e> <s> the issue of principle still remains and on that basis i ask the committee to divide <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his clarification <e> <s> i am not sure whether i followed all the details about the offsetting of income tax but perhaps i may read carefully what he said and come back on report <e> <s> nor am i sure that i understood why repayments would necessarily be so modest if someone were to return to full-time employment after some years by which time i should have thought he would have incurred quite high interest repayments <e> <s> however i am grateful to the minister for telling us that there will be careful monitoring and that special provisions will be made for those groups which on the evidence of that monitoring appear to require additional help <e> <s> on the basis of that promise i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i very much agree with everything that the noble baroness lady seear has said but i should like to return to the remarks of the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> her argument seems to be totally self-defeating <e>", "<cs> the reasoning behind the amendments is that it is unjust that someone who fails to complete a course through no personal fault should be further penalised by having a debt to repay <e> <s> similarly it is unfair that a student who takes longer to complete a course because of illness should face an additional repayment burden <e> <s> the extra interest accrued would increase the repayments compared with those of a student who completed a course within the usual period <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell the committee what evidence there is that students who have failed to complete a degree course actually have higher earnings than other people with similar earlier qualifications like two or three a levels <e>", "<cs> i am still not quite clear why postgraduate research students should have benefits removed from them but not be eligible for loans <e> <s> i do not think that we have had a satisfactory answer on that <e> <s> i was also interested in what the minister said about the possibility of research students supplementing their income with teaching and other related work <e> <s> it was true at one time but it is becoming more and more difficult for postgraduate students to do partly because of the financial constraints under which universities are operating which mean that there is very little spare financing available to take on research students to do that kind of teaching <e> <s> it happens a little but on a very small scale and many of them cannot get such work <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words to what the noble earl lord russell and my noble friend lord peston have said about the amendments <e> <s> as the bill has gone through the house many of us have been extremely concerned with the question of access and of being convinced that the proposals will not put off young people from starting the process of higher education particularly young people from working-class homes <e> <s> a number of us have registered our concerns about the fear of debt among young people from that social background but there could be fear about what might happen if those who have taken out loans have some difficulty in repaying them <e>", "<cs> is the noble baroness telling us that it is the governments intention to reconsider what they said in the white paper and the reassurances which have been given that the proportion of student maintenance which will be covered by loans is to be per cent <e> <s> and no more <e> <s> i interpret what she says to mean that when we reach that later date the government will wish to consider whether they wish to take the level above per cent <e> <s> otherwise i cannot see why she cannot accept my amendment <e>", "<cs> in the light of what my noble friend has said i believe that we should divide the committee and provide the noble baroness with the support she needs in discussing this matter with her right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> in the light of that assurance i shall not divide the committee on this occasion <e> <s> however if we do not receive a satisfactory result from that consultation we intend to come back on report in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i said this is a probing amendment and i have no intention of pressing it any further <e> <s> i certainly would not want to push an amendment that had the perverse effect described <e> <s> in the light of the helpful clarification given by the noble baroness i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was about to say that i looked forward to debating these issues again when the regulations are brought before the chamber <e> <s> however i do not look forward to spending every supper break during the summer on these matters <e> <s> i am a little disappointed in the answers given by the noble baroness who is speaking for the government <e> <s> i had hoped for one or two possible signs of concessions in discussing this amendment <e> <s> however we did not receive any <e>", "<cs> amendments were tabled on the first day of the committee stage on the subject of students on longer courses but rather disappointing answers were given by the government <e> <s> there appeared to be little acknowledgement of the fact that those students will be disadvantaged compared with others on shorter courses or the standard three-year undergraduate degree courses <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down can she say what the government intend to do about those students who have had a very serious illness with subsequent infirmity or a very serious accident that prevents them from working for the rest of their lives <e>", "<cs> my concern is that in cases of this sort it would surely be far more sensible to cancel the requirement for repayment rather than leaving a debt of this kind hanging round the necks of such unfortunate people <e>", "<cs> there is a substantial difference between deferment and cancellation so i do not think the noble baroness has answered my question <e> <s> but at this time of night i have no intention of pressing the amendment further <e> <s> i shall read what she has said and consider it further <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in an earlier intervention the noble baroness lady young made reference to the need for the opposition to say what they would do <e> <s> of course it is a long time since the noble baroness has been in opposition but it will not be very long now <e> <s> we shall watch with interest the commitments she makes when she speaks on behalf of the opposition <e> <s> i should also like to remind her that her partys record on setting out clearly what it will do is not all that good <e> <s> it said for a long time that it would abolish rates but it never said what would be put in their place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness who is speaking for the government for that reply <e> <s> i am particularly glad to hear that there is no hidden agenda <e> <s> i had hoped she would tell us today that this amendment was acceptable <e> <s> i was also interested to hear her say that the per cent <e> <s> point would be reached early in the next century <e> <s> the noble baroness was a little more precise in committee when the year was mentioned <e> <s> a number of estimates have been made which suggest that the loan portion will be equal to the grant by about to <e> <s> perhaps the government too have reached a similar conclusion <e> <s> if we are to reach that point considerably earlier the need to have statutory control over the loan portion is all the more important <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> there are a number of courses of undergraduate study which entail students studying for longer than three years <e> <s> we heard a great deal about medicine and at committee stage i supported an amendment with particular reference to both dentistry and medicine <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to intervene <e> <s> however there are a couple of points that i should like to make in the light of comments made by the noble baroness lady young <e> <s> perhaps i can help clarify the question raised by the noble baroness lady elles <e> <s> i agree with what the noble baroness lady young said that this does not commit the government to anything <e> <s> on the contrary it is designed to help those members of the government who believe that it would be desirable to consider bringing in part-time students at some later date and to do it relatively soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her reply <e> <s> she made a good deal of the issue of deferment as she has done throughout our debates <e> <s> but that is not the point <e> <s> i am fully aware that nurses who are below the threshold for the purposes of the bill will not have to repay their loans immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl lord russell i have seen the letter that the noble earl lord caithness sent to my noble friend lord peston which i imagine is identical to the letter that he sent to the noble earl <e> <s> i am a little puzzled by one or two points in the letter but i should like to say that i am grateful for the explanation that referees will not be asked to guarantee the loan in any way <e> <s> that is a step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister may be surprised but i welcome the amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for bringing it forward <e> <s> there are a couple of questions that i should like to put to him <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the arts council has been receiving reports from all round the country of cancellations of school visits to theatres because some parents cannot afford to pay <e> <s> is she also aware of the survey by the royal opera house which shows that charges are having the worst effect on those schools where there is less parental support for visits to the theatre the opera and ballet <e> <s> in those circumstances does she agree that charges are widening the gap between privileged and less privileged pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain the governments intentions on payment first of unqualified licensed teachers and how that will compare with a new graduate and secondly of licensed teachers once they are registered and how that will compare with graduate teachers pay <e> <s> there seems to be some confusion on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may put to her one <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for bringing forward the amendment <e> <s> i am extremely glad to be able to say that i find large parts of it highly acceptable <e> <s> however i have one reservation which relates to the final paragraph of the amendment where the government yet again appear to want to provide a let-out whereby either they or a future government could go above the per cent <e> <s> figure in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment from these benches <e> <s> all of us who are involved in running higher education institutions know the difficulties of the current financial situation <e> <s> we are speaking not just about universities but about polytechnics and colleges of higher education <e> <s> as the noble lord lord beloff so rightly said this scheme could well mean the diversion of funds from the main responsibilities of higher education institutions which are to teach our students and to undertake research into supporting the government in the administration of a scheme involving student maintenance <e> <s> as i have already said that would be a highly undesirable situation in the context of so little funding being available for new developments in research and teaching <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a substantial number of prisoners are still being locked up for hours a day including those in brand new prisons <e> <s> in the circumstances is it surprising that the frustration that builds up among prisoners in particular among young men on remand who should never be in prison in the first place leads to riots <e> <s> when will the government do something to improve prison regimes and to reduce the number of people who should never be in prison in the first place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness may wish to defend her noble friend <e> <s> however will she agree that unfair castigation of the teaching profession as a whole which we heard in the first contribution of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is exactly what lowers the morale of teachers generally because they consider that they are unappreciated by people who ought to know better <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble earl lord swinton i too have served on a number of governing bodies of both schools and colleges though i cannot begin to compete with him in terms of the number of schools or colleges on whose governing bodies i have sat <e> <s> indeed i wonder how he finds time for anything else in his life <e> <s> perhaps he sleeps rather less than the rest of us <e> <s> but what both he and the rest of us taking part in the debate must remember is that since the education reform act the powers of school governing bodies have been greatly increased <e> <s> my noble friend lady nicol <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the fact that owing to a long-standing prior commitment i shall be unable to be here for much of the rest of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness say what the average per capita expenditure is in the existing grant maintained schools that have been established and how it compares with the average per capita expenditure in lea county schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for offering to send me the figures that she is unable to give today <e> <s> although i accept that she cannot give precise figures today does she accept that the average per capita expenditure in grant maintained schools is higher than in county schools and that that builds in inequities in the funding of the education of our secondary school pupils <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to focus entirely on the dtis responsibility to encourage research and development and to create a climate in which it can flourish <e> <s> before i go any further i should like to assure the noble lord lord boardman that any criticisms i make apply entirely to ministers who are responsible for policy and not to their officials <e> <s> i am sure that i speak for all speakers on this side of the house when i say that <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the figures relate to civil research <e> <s> research and development spending by the government is also fundamentally flawed in the way that it is distributed <e> <s> first spending on defence is far too high in relation to civil research <e> <s> the united kingdom spends over billion a year on defence rd <e> <s> attempts to switch some of that spending to civil rd and to improve the civil spin-off have been singularly unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that over one-fifth of the fellows of the royal society live abroad <e> <s> does she not agree that the loss of those most eminent scientists is damaging to the nation <e> <s> will she say what the government propose to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords i can help the noble baroness by assuring her that the figures i have provided are accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that poor pay and poor facilities must be a disincentive for academics <e> <s> is she not aware of the fact that many academics feel deeply demoralised by the fact that their pay has fallen more than that of any other public sector group in this country over the past years <e> <s> can she say what the government will do to rectify the problems of the universities and polytechnics in paying their staff adequately <e>", "<cs> as a former member of the iba educational advisory council i should like to comment on something said by the noble lord lord quinton <e> <s> it is highly undesirable that educational programmes in particular should be ghettoised and separated from the normal output on independent television <e> <s> what the government are proposing and what emerges from the noble earls response to the amendment is that education and information can go out on channel and bbc and that it does not matter if they do not appear as good programmes on independent television <e> <s> to go down that route would be a disastrous mistake <e>", "<cs> the noble earl lord halsbury referred to the general advisory council of the bbc and i am its chairman <e> <s> that body has within it the chairmen of all the other advisory councils of which crac is one <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool is a member of the gac <e> <s> a number of other people are appointed to the gac who are representative of a variety of different interests <e>", "<cs> i do not know the answer to that question but i do not believe they are <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord lord barnett who is a governor of the bbc can help on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his response but i am afraid that it is not satisfactory <e> <s> is he aware that the authorities which are starting new schemes for tvei this autumn have had their budgets cut by between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> in other words by a very large sum of money <e> <s> can he say how much money these authorities have wasted in preparing for schemes that they now cannot put on <e> <s> can he also indicate why the government attach so little importance to tvei that they have made cuts that dash the hopes of both teachers and employers about the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the point <e> <s> the budget has been cut <e> <s> i am sure that the minister can confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the budget has been cut for authorities starting new schemes <e> <s> that will be damaging in those areas <e> <s> does he also agree that it is bad government to make cuts at such short notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up a point made by the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> we are not asking under this amendment for more money <e> <s> we are simply asking that the money currently spent on housing benefit should continue and in particular that it should continue for postgraduate students <e> <s> i support what was said by the noble lord lord beloff and the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> it is postgraduate students in particular who will suffer under these arrangements <e> <s> they will not be eligible for student loans <e>", "<cs> my lords awards are normally paid from the beginning of the academic year <e> <s> therefore i would be extremely surprised if the uprating were to take effect in april <e> <s> perhaps the minister will confirm that point <e> <s> is it not the case that the vast majority of postgraduate students are in fact on research council awards and that the des scheme is a very small part of the total <e> <s> in that case what i said earlier still stands most postgraduates will be worse off during the greater part of the next academic year than they have been in the last academic year in addition to losing housing benefit <e>", "<cs> i regret to say that i think this debate is deteriorating in that it is becoming much too personalised <e> <s> i must defend my noble friend lady birk against some of the accusations that have been made by the noble lords lord morris and lord wyatt among others <e> <s> at no point in her speech did she make any personal attack upon mr rupert murdoch <e> <s> i hope that the noble lords who oppose the amendments will withdraw these very unfair comments <e>", "<cs> like the right reverend prelate i very much hope that the minister will respond positively to the amendments as no new issue of principle is entailed <e> <s> i fear that he may respond by saying that there will be illustrative guidelines <e> <s> an unfortunate aspect of the bill is that the itc will not have the powers that the iba had to ensure the broad range of high quality programmes that we have become used to <e> <s> illustrative guidelines are simply not enough <e>", "<cs> i should like to add my name to those supporting the amendment <e> <s> a high proportion of the population from all social groups greatly enjoys watching major sporting events on television <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool referred to boys and pensioners but many women and girls also enjoy watching those sporting events <e> <s> one of the great benefits of television has been its capacity to bring exciting and entertaining sport of the highest quality to millions of people who would never have been able to obtain a ticket to go to any of those events because they cannot afford to buy them they cannot travel or there are not enough tickets to go round <e>", "<cs> my lords like every other speaker so far in this debate i condemn the iraqi invasion and subsequent annexation of kuwait <e> <s> i condemn the taking of western hostages <e> <s> that is a cruel cynical and cowardly way of trying to manipulate events and distract those nations concerned from their determination to re-establish international order <e> <s> but above all i condemn saddam hussein and his regime for a decade of the grossest violations of basic human rights within his own country and for the dissipation of his countrys oil wealth on a cruel and useless war which lasted eight years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was a little premature in his remarks in suggesting that no one who had not put their name to the amendment wished to speak <e> <s> it was simply that some of us on this side of the house were a little slower to get to our feet <e>", "<cs> my lords before we go any further with the debate perhaps the minister will reply to the request made by my noble friend lord boston of faversham by the noble viscount lord whitelaw and now by the noble lord lord peyton that the government should withdraw the amendment and return at third reading with a revised amendment or perhaps with no amendment at all after further discussions <e> <s> it would be helpful if the house could be informed of the governments intentions at this stage rather than our continuing any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak against amendment no <e> <s> but perhaps i should declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the general advisory council of the bbc <e> <s> however whether or not i held that position i would still be saying now that i believe it is wholly inappropriate to introduce this new clause for the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has admitted that there is a great deal of public anxiety about reading standards in schools <e> <s> in the light of that and of the new commitment to monitor standards can the minister say why the government abandoned the assessment of performance unit and its work in and in doing so gave up monitoring national reading standards <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government wish to encourage higher reading standards among pupils in school and to encourage children to read more why have the government presided over a major reduction in spending on school libraries <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the answer given by the noble lord speaking for the government <e> <s> however does he approve of school admission registers in independent schools being used for party political purposes <e> <s> that is the nature of my question and i have not received a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister at least agree that some parents find it distasteful for their names to be given and used for propaganda purposes on a party political basis <e> <s> surely the minister must agree that that can upset many parents and that the practice should therefore stop in independent schools as well as maintained schools <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the government have abandoned targets that they set in legislation introduced in to bring schools up to standard by <e> <s> is the minister aware that that condemns many pupils and teachers to work in appalling and squalid conditions in our schools <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister really believe that it is acceptable to spend as much as million on buildings and repairs for ctcs which represent a tiny handful of institutions compared with only million plus spent on every other school in the country <e> <s> does she not agree that that ratio is utterly absurd <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the minister is saying that not a single primary school out of the with over pupils has applied for or been granted grant-maintained status <e> <s> if that is the case how can she possibly claim that applying for grant-maintained status and obtaining it is so popular among governing bodies head teachers and parents in primary schools <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging debate on investment and quality of education which is a very broad subject <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for taking the time and trouble to reply to many of the points raised <e> <s> there were of course a number of issues on which i could not entirely agree with her <e> <s> similarly there were points raised by other noble lords on the benches opposite which we would wish to take up on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to participation in full-time education <e> <s> the minister tried to bring in part-time participation where the figures are different <e> <s> the issues involved are quite different <e> <s> we are talking about young people on work-based training courses as well <e>", "<cs> my lords contrary to what the noble lord lord beloff said can the minister confirm that nearly major companies were <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness kindly answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for taking time to explain the background to the currently complex situation in relation to grants for education support and training <e> <s> i wish to make <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down perhaps i may pick up what she just said <e> <s> giving the overall per pupil increases in spending over the past decade is hardly relevant to this argument <e> <s> if it is indeed the case that only per cent <e> <s> of the share of total lea spending is allocated through this mechanism it is particularly odd that the proportion should actually be reduced when the government have a number of priorities that they have allocated and many are priorities that we on this side of the house would welcome <e> <s> i do not feel that i have had an adequate explanation of why there has been a cut in real terms for esg <e>"]
