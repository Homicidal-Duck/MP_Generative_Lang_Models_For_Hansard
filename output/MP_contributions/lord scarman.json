chancellor <e> <s> the question is this is it really a very serious situation if we have in a statute that contempt in the county court is wilfully doing this that or the other and we have in a statute a provision that someone who insults the justices intending to do so is guilty of contempt <e> <s> if one gets behind the rhetoric and looks at what is proposed in its proper context is there really any very great danger to drafting practice or to the consistency of the law if the obsolete model still goes on for a bit in and the modern model in language we all understand finds itself in

years as president the most popular judicial institution in the country <e> <s> of course everybody flocks to it including litigants <e> <s> so of course we have this burden of delays due not to an austere forbidding inability to make up its mind but to exactly the reverse virtues all three of them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could intervene as one who has had his own judicial life insured by

eec <e>", "<cs> my lords may i enter a protest against this drafting <e> <s> the words titled and not titled as used in the bill are not used in the english sense <e> <s> i was so distressed when i

effective clauses but those clauses enjoy the support not only of the law commission but of the committee presided over with such distinction by the noble lord lord renton which inquired into and reported on the preparation of legislation <e> <s> the bill short as it is does not go as far as the law commission recommended but it does go as far as it could go enjoying the consent of both the renton committee and the law commission <e> <s> it is therefore an uncontroversial bill and if i may say so i hope it will be so regarded if and when it reaches another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i

learned lord the lord chief justice of england on quite one of the most distinguished witty entertaining and instructive maiden speeches that this house can ever have heard <e> <s> we owe having heard that maiden speech to the noble lord lord renton who has put down a motion that has enticed the lord chief justice of england out of the strand back into the neighbourhood of westminster hall to which

that so long as he is with us the judges can on occasion answer back and when they do there really is not the slightest atomised hope of a further reply <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will stick with the word bereavement <e> <s> it illustrates exactly what this conventional award which is now introduced is intended to deal with <e> <s> it is compensation for grief <e> <s> it is not loss of society <e> <s> it is loss of a person by death <e> <s> it is very limited <e> <s> it is very conventional <e> <s> it amounts only to a recognition by the state that in such a situation as this the fact of bereavement should qualify for some sympathetic recognition <e> <s> i think therefore that the word bereavement it is only one word instead of three or indeed five should stand as appropriate

extremely important topic <e> <s> the attitude of her majestys government as illustrated by the speech of the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin with an apology to the house and to the noble lord

extremely important business it could not have been anything else which kept me away <e> <s> perhaps the house might like to know what the business was <e> <s> strangely enough it was closely related to one of the subject matters of this debate <e> <s> i was talking in another part of london to the london branch of the royal town planning institute to the members of the planning profession who are members of that institute who are concerned with the decay and the deprivation of our inner city areas <e> <s> i was attempting to persuade them of the immense importance of tackling the decay and deprivation of the inner city areas such as brixton <e> <s> since my apology has led me to mention that i will in the few moments during which i shall detain the house ask as my first question of the government what is being done or what is contemplated for establishing and developing a co-ordinated programme at every level of government central local and below that in the communities to tackle the physical and social environment in which unfortunately so many members of the ethnic minority groups of this country have to live <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not stand long between the house and the speech to which we are looking forward from the noble and learned lord on the woolsack <e> <s> first i must apologise to the house and <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the house would wish me at once

many years and it came as no surprise to me to hear a speech delivered in such an incisive and penetrating style and with that lovely salting of wit which i am sure will mark the contributions which

noble lord spoke the words and i failed to hear them that is a matter for apology <e> <s> it is perhaps also an indication that as one gets older ones hearing is not quite so good particularly when the speaker is looking towards the woolsack and not towards the cross benches <e>", "<cs> my lords having heard the recent exchanges between the noble lord lord mishcon and the minister i do not know whether i now rise as the white rabbit looking at his watch or as the dormouse waking up from the tea party <e> <s> whichever it is this has been a stimulating and constructive debate <e> <s> each noble lord who has contributed to the discussion has brought to it something new something original something sensible and almost always something constructive <e> <s> one cannot often say that of a debate whether it is in good time or rather late <e> <s> i also welcome the attitude of her majestys government to the report and i am delighted to hear the use that they hope to make of it in their deliberations <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be very grateful to the noble baroness for the formal expression of views on behalf of the government which we have just heard and also the care with which she has dealt with a number of questions arising upon passports questions which do not strictly arise out of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill <e> <s> it is not a bill of fundamental law reform <e> <s> the fundamental reform in family law was as noble lords have already pointed out fulfilled in when irretrievable breakdown was introduced as the sole ground of divorce

lords as a lawyer i feel a very great humility in rising to address your lordships house after the passionate assertion of faith which we have just heard from the noble lord lord soper <e> <s> if he

convicted of the offence alleged against him in december <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to say so <e>", "<cs> i most humbly apologise but as a judge i was concerned to ensure that a man was not spoken of as having committed a crime of which he was acquitted <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the real importance that the ceiling should not fall down on the cross-benches <e>", "<cs> it is always a refreshing and stimulating experience to hear the noble and learned lord the lord chancelllor outline a case against an amendment not yet proposed and the arguments for which have not yet been developed <e> <s> i really feel myself in the position of david gower who has lost the toss and found that somebody else has decided that they would bat before his team <e>", "<cs> this has been an extremely good debate and some very weighty and interesting points have been made <e> <s> i shall deal with a few of them but of course in view of the indication which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor gave on an earlier amendment i have confined my argument before the committee to the point of principle <e> <s> i sense that the committee notwithstanding some doubts or misgivings has very great sympathy i will put it no higher than that with the point of principle to be found in this amendment <e>", "<cs> i will say no more than that i think with respect the noble lord has

lord on the woolsack and after he had adjusted his sights from the noble and learned lord lord denning was most impressive <e> <s> but of course they were firing at the wrong target <e> <s> they completely destroyed the american automatic inflexible rule of exclusion <e> <s> however of course the supreme court of the united states of america is already busy doing that and is with respect the more appropriate body to do it <e> <s> i would simply say to the noble and learned lord lord denning what the noble lord lord mishcon has already said that the murder case which he cited which of course one knew about when drafting this amendment and the drugs case that he cited are both taken care of in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess that i am deeply troubled by the speech that the noble lord lord elton made on behalf of the government <e> <s> it appears to me to be based on a misunderstanding if not complete ignorance about the feeling among the black communities and the west indian community in particular <e> <s> with respect even though it was done with charm grace and ability it really is absurd to suggest that race relations is a subject that ought not to be touched upon in the police and criminal evidence bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the one who moved the amendment which found favour with your lordships house i think i owe it to the house to indicate at once my position upon the message from another place <e> <s> i confess that the longer i listened to the delicate shafts directed by the noble lord the minister towards what i would impertinently call

dislike of your lordships amendment <e> <s> i still think that it has great virtues and that it is preferable to that which has emerged from another place <e> <s> i do so for two reasons <e> <s> first i see the virtues and qualities in the amendment which has come from another place <e> <s> i believe that it has absorbed those virtues and qualities from a certain ministerial study of your lordships amendment <e> <s> it is certainly an amendment which will provide the judges with a useful exclusionary rule where it is right and proper that evidence should be excluded by which i mean where improperly obtained evidence should be excluded <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the speech of the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth outlining the governments general agreement with the recommendations and proposals contained in the report <e> <s> towards the end of the noble lords speech it was clear that the specific recommendations to which the committee attached enormous importance those concerned with the enforcement of powers of investigation and inspection inside the united kingdom were specifically accepted by the government <e> <s> i have no doubt that the acceptance by her majestys government of those proposals will mean that very serious attention indeed will be paid by the commission to the recommendations contained in this report and to the arguments adduced in support of them <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to hear that my lords <e> <s> however i remain incorrigible in my view that difficulties of the kind to which the noble lord lord bruce of donington referred

noble lord has expressed some concern about the opposition to this clause <e> <s> i support my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones and all other noble lords who oppose this clause standing part

this clause has been touched upon by several noble lords <e> <s> first it is a constitutional monstrosity <e> <s> under our constitution the crown has concentrated in it all the functions of the state

crown executive judicial and legislative be kept stringently apart <e>", "<cs> may i ask a question of my noble and learned friend <e> <s> does this mean that the government will not be opposing the motion this afternoon that clause as at present drafted does not stand part of the bill and that we can leave the rest of the debate until such time as a new clause is proposed <e>", "<cs> may i pour

rights day by giving it a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this initiative perhaps because it is a belated although modest attempt to put into effect a recommendation made in a certain

to oppose the amendment and i hope that the committee will reject it <e> <s> the trouble about the amendment is that it confuses the procedural law with the substantive law <e> <s> the law reform committee of which i had the honour to be a member considered this proposal and rejected it <e> <s> the proposal was rejected not because it was outside the committees terms of reference but because of the confusion <e> <s> that confusion has practical results <e> <s> for instance if the amendment was introduced it would be possible for the period of limitation to run out before the cause of action had accrued <e> <s> of course one could achieve the object of the amendment that the time should expire six years after the breach of duty by changing the substantive law that is to say by saying that the accrual of the cause of action for negligence arises not when damage is suffered but when the breach of duty is committed <e> <s> that would put the law of tort in the same position as the law of contract <e> <s> but the amendment does not do that <e> <s> it seeks that result while not changing the substantive law <e> <s> it has always been a menace to our common law that procedure should take control over substance <e>", "<cs> i should like to reassure the noble lord lord hacking that i certainly regard the intention behind this amendment as helpful and loyal to the bill <e> <s> as the committee made quite clear in the passage to which the noble lord has referred there is a balance of advantage and disadvantage to be considered here <e> <s> the committee went into it very carefully and gave their conclusions in paragraph that although the proposed amendment has the advantage of simplicity the more complicated formula for which the committee opted gives more guidance to a plaintiff uncertain as to his position than does this simple proposal <e> <s> again clearly this is a balance of advantages and the committee has come down in favour of more detailed guidelines than are possible in the simple formulation proposed by the noble lord lord hacking <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who has just sat down has emphasised the facts that the committee had very much in mind when it proposed a long stop without judicial discretion to extend it <e> <s> i wish to say only a few words to the committee about the views of the law reform committee which i believe are perfectly plain on its report <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order <e> <s> i am not sure whether my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale was in order in addressing the house after the vote had been taken <e> <s> i hope that i may follow him now in that irregularity so long as we recognise that it is irregular <e> <s> however the bill has not yet passed and therefore i think that both my noble friend and myself throwing ourselves on the mercy and the compassion of the house can be heard to say a few words about the bill <e> <s> i propose to follow my noble friends excellent precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i reassure the noble lord on a point of order <e> <s> he can do anything he likes so long as he carries the consent of those of us who are here and at the moment i think he has it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say this to the noble lord <e> <s> if the word shall is used the judges will interpret it as may <e> <s> if the word may is used the judges will interpret it as shall <e>", "<cs> my lords before i ask my supplementary question i must declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of the court of the university of london which is the body that is responsible for allocating among the schools of the university the block grant received from the government on the advice of the university grants committee <e> <s> it was with a hollow laugh that i greeted the initial reply to this question that the scale of finance for birkbeck is <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the house would wish me at once to congratulate the noble lord lord brocket on his interesting and excellent maiden speech <e> <s> we have heard two admirable maiden speeches in what so far has been even for your lordships house a debate of very high standard and quality <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike my noble and learned friend i find the amendment a great improvement and a great clarification of the meaning of the clause <e> <s> i rise only to draw attention to the valuable contribution towards that clarification made by the law society and by the noble lord lord hacking <e>", "<cs> follow the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones in submitting that this clause should not stand part of the bill <e> <s> a very good reason for that submission i find in the entertaining and fascinating account of cases that the noble and learned lord lord denning has just given to the committee <e> <s> the committee will have noted the extraordinary range of activities which are covered by those cases and which it is said that this clause would cover <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is quite right to suggest that recent developments in statute law indicate that there may be a gap <e> <s> the last thing i wish to do is to mislead the committee or the house <e> <s> if i have doubts the committee and the house are going to hear of them <e> <s> i share the concern that the common law powers which one has known for a long time may have suffered some erosion <e> <s> if so to that extent the power of my argument is diminished <e> <s> of course it is <e> <s> but i would say that we must face that directly <e> <s> we should not try to bridge a gap which may or may not be there <e> <s> it has to be looked at much more carefully than we can do this evening <e> <s> we must not try to bridge that gap by enacting an offence with trivial judicial consequences in terms so broad that a great number of people may find themselves criminals where on any view of it they would not be guilty of criminal conduct <e>", "<cs> i rise for a moment before the noble lord lord hutchinson speaks to make a personal statement <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for having at this very moment to leave the chamber <e> <s> i do so for urgent family reasons <e> <s> i had hoped to stay to listen to the whole debate which will be a very interesting one but for family reasons i cannot do so <e> <s> i make my apologies to the committee and to the noble lord lord glenarthur <e>", "<cs> my lords while i welcome the statement on the part of the government that there is to be a further inquiry <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord two questions <e> <s> first in any review departmental or otherwise that may now be undertaken into this case will particular attention be paid to the fact that each individual defendant and there are in the two cases has the case against him or her carefully considered separately from the sort of general case that can be levelled against all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> i do so as the only honourable member of the brixton domino and social club <e> <s> we have just opened new premises financed repaired renovated and refurbished entirely by the members of that club <e> <s> the indications of active community life that one finds there with sheer happiness bubbling over even in this terrible weather lead me to think that perhaps the noble lord believes that the rest of us are more bankrupt of ideas than we really are <e>", "<cs> i am paid for words but i am actually taking action <e>", "<cs> my lords after the political exchanges of the past to minutes i am returning thankfully to intone a quiet lullaby in the presence of the lords spiritual before i go to bed <e>", "<cs> i reluctantly find myself having to disagree with this amendment <e> <s> i declare an interest <e> <s> i live in east kent <e> <s> i know the unemployment anxieties arising from the shuttle service and the possibility of a substantial curtailment of ferry services <e> <s> i am also aware of real fears in the county of kent as to the growth of lorry traffic on the main roads the m and others which will feed the lorries across the county into folkestone or ashford <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that there are proposals today for a bill dealing with the use of empty properties for residential purposes <e> <s> if the government are aware of that may we take it that this is completely consistent with government policy and that when formulated the bill it is at the moment only a proposal should have a swift non-controversial passage through both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords i should explain that i have with me a broadsheet containing a bill of nine clauses and two schedules which i shall see that her majestys government have almost at once <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the truth that the pelicans are in st jamess park as a symbol of political life <e> <s> the beak holds more than the belly can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a personal delight for me to be the first member of your lordships house to speak after the maiden speech of my noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> i say that not merely because i happen to agree with everything that he has said in his entertaining and forceful speech but because we both come from the same legal stable brasenose college oxford <e> <s> brasenose college as balliol is beginning to appreciate is strongly and wisely represented in your lordships house <e> <s> we lead the lords spiritual and now with the arrival of my noble friend we are gaining strength among the lords temporal <e> <s> very soon we shall be the envy of balliol new college and ruskin college <e>"]
