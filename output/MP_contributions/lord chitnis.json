["<cs> my lords i too would like to congratulate the noble lord lord carver on his maiden speech and also to say how glad i am to find myself following the noble marquess without whose assistance i have been led to believe it would have been difficult for me to get into rhodesia a country where i was in danger of being declared a prohibited immigrant <e> <s> that too is a subject i should like to talk about and i would start by referring your lordships to chipinga which is a small township in rhodesia near the mozambique border <e> <s> i am aware that rhodesia is a subject on which i am considered to have somewhat eccentric views in so far as i believe that the recent rhodesian election was not free and fair whereas other observers think otherwise <e> <s> i am frequently asked what i saw and heard but others did not which led me to this conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl could give me the first page reference again <e>", "<cs> my lords generally speaking i stand by the figures which i have given in my report but i am afraid that i cannot see those figures on pages and of my edition of my report <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the second figure i believe that i have as good evidence as i am likely to get <e> <s> on the first figure i say in the text here that because the authorities have not given the figure one is able to rely only on estimates given by others <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but it does not alter my view <e> <s> people have been telling me for the past several weeks that these elections were fair and free <e> <s> i still think that they were not <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships permission i should like to deal with the two matters raised that is the sipolilo incident and the number of detainees about which since the noble earl lord lauderdale asked a question i have been able to make inquiries <e> <s> let us take the sipolilo incident first <e> <s> the noble earl has asked a question and i am sorry if the answer is long <e> <s> i should like to tell your lordships exactly how i discovered the incident <e> <s> i said in my speech that i discovered it almost by chance <e> <s> i was setting up a meeting with some people and was told that it was a great pity that so and so was not there but something awful had happened and he was unable to be with us <e> <s> i thought that the chap had flu or something similar <e> <s> the conversation proceeded and at the end only because conversation lapsed i said as a matter of interest why isnt so and so able to be here <e> <s> i was then told this tale which frankly i could not believe because it was a tale so awful and of such horror <e> <s> i then asked if i could see the chap <e> <s> i have spoken to him and i know that the story is true <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord know what facilities were afforded to those who sought to campaign against voting in the election on the grounds that to do so might be taken as signifying their acceptance of the constitutional settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i would apologise for addressing your lordships twice within two months on the same subject had it not become increasingly clear to me during the past two months that i am not the worst offender in this respect <e> <s> in any case i am not going to speak precisely about the same subject because despite provocation and particularly the provocation of the noble viscount lord boyd in the speech he has just made <e> <s> i do not intend to talk much about the april election <e> <s> on that i have stated my views i have given chapter and verse explaining how i arrived at them <e> <s> nothing i have said has been convincingly reputed least of all by what the electoral commission said about the shabani teachers and my case rests <e> <s> whatever ones views of the april election it is now clear that it was little more than a diversion from the fundamental problems now facing rhodesia <e> <s> the debate has now returned to what has always been the real issue the question of the constitution and whether it provides for the irreversible transfer of power from the minority to the majority <e>", "<cs> my lords when i am faced with problems as regards which there are no people conducting censuses or taking polls i ask the best informed people in the field <e> <s> that is what i have done <e> <s> it is only an estimate and i said so <e> <s> they may be only x per cent <e> <s> of the population but they are rhodesian citizens who i think should play their part in determining their countrys future <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will know that when fairly recently the question arose of quoting in this house private conversations the noble lord lord carrington leapt to his feet and said what an appalling thing that was to do <e> <s> i am sure that if the noble earl were ever to repeat to the noble lord lord carrington what he has just said lord carrington would respond in kind <e> <s> however that is indeed what i said but at similar social occasions the noble earl has said to me that he is incapable of reading <e> <s> if however he will set his mind to the job and read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene in this debate in what must seem to be an unscheduled way but in fact i put my name down to speak but it was inadvertently missed off the list <e> <s> i will none the less try to be as brief as i can <e> <s> i must say that despite all that has been said this afternoon i cannot help feeling that it is still strange that there has been this hasty and frankly ill-timed introduction of the enabling bill at this delicate stage of the lancaster house negotiations <e> <s> frankly i was not convinced by the explanation given by the noble lord lord carrington and while i sympathise with his desire to mollify those of his party who have consistently championed white supremacy in rhodesia the proposal to allow section sanctions to lapse before an agreement with all parties is concluded can only jeopardise the chances of achieving a lasting settlement it seems to me and is bound to be interpreted by some as a demonstration of bad faith <e>", "<cs> my lords like so many others who have spoken i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord avebury for giving us an opportunity to debate these rules today <e> <s> i must say that i speak with some reluctance in this debate because i do not like speaking in your lordships house as an asian although i think that perhaps on this occasion i should do so as i believe i am the only member of your lordships house at any rate of those who attend of my precise ethnic background <e> <s> i would much prefer to talk to your lordships as a yorkshireman having lived there for years but as the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford said people did not accept him as a yorkshireman and thought that he came from the deep south and was daft <e> <s> so my lords what do your lordships think those people think of me <e>", "<cs> my lords however the occasion has arisen i think it is probably a good thing that in this house we can spend a short time discussing zimbabwe at the start of this most exciting week in that countrys history and after the rather extraordinary year through which that country has passed <e> <s> co-incidentally it was exactly a year ago today that i was in salisbury at a party held by bishop muzorewas united african national congress when the general election in this country was in progress and the labour government were quite clearly under threat from the conservative opposition <e> <s> much of my time at that party was spent listening to and i hope prudently being somewhat dis <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible that two or three years ago some apology or explanation might have been needed for justifying taking time in a debate on foreign affairs to talk about the situation in central america in general or in el salvador in particular <e> <s> but now while quite naturally much of the days debate has been taken up with talking about afghanistan iran and iraq poland and other countries closely involved in the relationship between east and west there is i think a much greater appreciation in britain that the situation in el salvador has deteriorated to the point that in that country people are dying violently in enormous numbers <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord wolfenden for introducing this debate as i am to him for steering us through the discussions in the committee when we were talking about the fund <e> <s> as he and every other participant in the debate has said so far the most important thing about the fund is that it should have a proper set of priorities and sufficient funds to tackle them <e> <s> in this context although we are debating the activities of the fund in the financial year none the less it was depressing to read recently that the money available to the fund for represented an increase of only per cent <e> <s> on its inadequate resources <e> <s> but i do not want to dwell on that <e> <s> i should like to talk about the lesser but by no means insignificant aspect of the fund its administration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for that reply may i ask whether he would agree that the scale of military involvement in el salvador is increasing and that whatever the differences may be now american military assistance is already being used by the russians as a reason to legitimise their own imperialist adventures <e> <s> would he also agree that the military containment of the opposition front guerrillas is not the solution to el salvadors problems but will merely prolong them <e> <s> in so far as labels are put on the opposition front by both the salvadorean and american governments may i ask him to recognise that virtually every member of your lordships house would be considered by the civilian and military junta in el salvador to be a dangerous communist <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to say whether among the home office officials who will be conducting this inquiry there will be some members of the ethnic minorities themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in the four years in which i have sat in your lordships house i do not think that i have ever agreed with a single word that the noble lord lord barnby has said in this chamber on any occasion <e> <s> i thought when i looked at the subject of todays debate that today was unlikely to be the day in which this position was going to change <e> <s> even though i recognise that the noble lord is old enough to be my grandfather i have to say that he talks more rubbish on this subject than any other person i know inside or outside this house <e> <s> however he need not feel that his security is threatened by my presence here nor will i crowd him out since i suspect that it will be a long time before i shall find myself sitting on the same bench as the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords like every noble lord who has gone before i shall be as brief as i can because <e>", "<cs> my lords like everybody else who has spoken this afternoon i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for giving us the opportunity to debate the report of this royal commission <e> <s> but i must confess like the last speaker to a certain surprise that it should have been left to him a cross-bencher to bring this matter to the floor of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government a policy about the launching of a disaster fund for the suffering people of el salvador <e> <s> if so have they conveyed their views about this to the broadcasting authorities <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not believe an election is just polling day does he <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to see that this house was going to be given an opportunity to debate the changes in these rules but i hesitated about participating in the debate myself because these occasions can so often become just a dialogue of the deaf with faults on both sides <e> <s> the asian community in this county that is the immigrants themselves and their children who have grown up in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble viscount for introducing this question tonight and particularly because i want to talk specifically about e salvador congratulate him on its timeliness because it is at the end of this month that the american administration has to certify yet again whether there has been an improvement in the human rights situation in e salvador thus to justify continuing sending military aid to that country <e> <s> president reagan has just set up his commission on the long-term problems of central america and former president duarte has just visited this country <e> <s> i would say in parenthesis that i am glad the government gave him a warm welcome <e> <s> i do hope that while they did so they reflected that without the ill-conceived and unnecessary election in e salvador last year he would still be the president of that country <e> <s> secondly i should like yet again to echo his request to the government that a british embassy may again be established in e salvador <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to intervene in this argument between the noble lord lord kennet and the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton but i hope i may do so if only to thank the noble lord lord kennet for having tabled his unstarred question and given me the chance to recover from having my name inadvertently put down for the foreign affairs debate which took place a couple of <e>", "<cs> my lords like all noble lords who have spoken i am grateful to the noble viscount lord buckmaster for introducing a debate on this fearsomely difficult subject <e> <s> i suppose all refugees have enormous problems and always have had but perhaps contemporary refugees have a new problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord kennet for again introducing the subject of nicaragua to this chamber though if this is to become an annual or bi-annual occasion with roughly speaking the same cast saying dare i say it <e> <s> roughly the same things then it might he better if next time we could have a rather larger stage on which to play and perhaps have a debate about the problems of the entire troubled region of central america <e>", "<cs> my lords like i think every noble lord who has spoken so far i too want to speak about the position of the hong kong indians but from a particular point of view <e> <s> i know that there are the other people of non-chinese origin who are in the same position about nationality as the indians <e> <s> but it is for the indians that i have a particular fellow feeling <e> <s> i remember in when india <e>", "<cs> my lords rather than rushing through any changes in refugee procedure when the furore about a particular case is at its height would it not be better if the dust were allowed to settle on this case and for there then to be calm and considered discussions with the agencies concerned with refugees not only about fines and airlines but also about referrals to ukias <e> <s> were not such specialised agencies given an assurance that this was how the government intended to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway ended with an apology <e> <s> i think i must start with an apology to him and perhaps to your lordships house because i fear that i suffer from the same defect in the reasoning process of which he accused the noble lords lord mishcon and lord avebury and the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure that i follow the noble lords point <e> <s> i suspect that in so far as i do i was coming on to that and the particular point of the bill in what i am about to say <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> my support for it was increased when yesterday by chance and on a wholly different matter i met an old friend of mine mr donald woods <e> <s> i can perhaps retell his tale with which some of your lordships may be familiar <e>"]
