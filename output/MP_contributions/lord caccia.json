["<cs> my lords may i ask whether those bilateral discussions will be extended in particular to the nine so that with good fortune by the time we reach madrid there may be some common european approach to these problems <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that various interested bodies were going to be consulted which of course <e>", "<cs> my lords may i from these benches also welcome the third reading of this bill <e> <s> in the previous stages the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts the noble lord lord campbell of croy and others raised the various problems that may arise over greek accession and the minister dealt with those fully <e> <s> so i thought it as well not to take up the time of your lordships house on those occasions by going over again what was being so thoroughly debated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the gratitude with which his remarks will be received by many of the monitoring groups outside the iron curtain and in western europe <e> <s> without any breach of confidence may i <e>", "<cs> my lords while very much welcoming what the minister has said and also looking forward to spain <e>", "<cs> my lords while very much welcoming what the minister has said in answer to these various questions they do address themselves perhaps principally to the review period when the conference starts in madrid <e> <s> may i ask him therefore what progress there has been so far in regard to persuading the soviet union to allow sufficient time for this review to be a reality <e> <s> has there been any progress to report on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords while also welcoming the statement made by the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs may i ask him a particular question <e> <s> he made some welcome remarks about what europe felt they could and should do to contribute in regard to the various crises that may occur in the middle east or in europe over poland <e> <s> but in speaking earlier about what happened last year over afghanistan he himself said that he did not think that europe at that time at any rate had the mechanism and the methods for what might be described as crisis management <e> <s> is there anything that he could usefully say about the situation as it has developed during this last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the house and to the noble lord lord orr-ewing in particular that my intervention is not specifically addressed only to the air defence of this country <e> <s> that question has been already well developed by him and by succeeding noble lords <e> <s> my intervention derives from the fact that towards the end of the last war i was for a time the chairman of the joint intelligence committee of the chiefs of staff succeeding another member of your lordships house the duke of portland <e> <s> in that job at that time the rule was i before o intelligence before decisions on operations <e> <s> it is on that single subject that i am going to speak and make a single plea this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not interrupt the noble lord in the course of his argument because i thought it fairer that he should deploy the whole of it but as he referred to me and to the previous correspondence which we had may i be allowed to say that this particular weapons system is aimed at the s <e> <s> all i said was that i was confident that it would be idle to sit down now and predict what the dangers and risks of those years might be because intelligence appreciation would not be worth the paper that it was written on <e>", "<cs> may i take up the subsidiary point which the noble lord has just raised <e> <s> before doing so i must declare an interest <e> <s> for many years i was the chairman of standard telephones and i am now the chairman of itt united kingdom <e>", "<cs> i said carefully that it has been known that there had been supplies from abroad <e> <s> the reason given in each case was that the supply was the cheapest one available <e>", "<cs> it may not be a great risk but it would be of comfort and i should have thought that the government would not find it very difficult to come some way to meet this point <e> <s> as the minister has said what he wishes to see is a lively and prosperous telecommunications industry not only the bt but also the industrial companies supporting it <e>", "<cs> with your lordships permission before clause comes before you i should like to move <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i specifically accepted what he is now saying that this is a practice which goes on but only for strictly limited periods <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for what he has said both on clause one part of the amendment and the director-general of fair trading on the other <e> <s> this is obviously a difficult area to prescribe in statute <e> <s> this was more in the sense of a probing amendment to get information and i happily withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to that important question may i ask him also to deal with the subsidiary point <e> <s> so far as i read the bill it does not of itself prohibit the sale of unapproved apparatus subject possibly to this amendment <e> <s> it is therefore possible though one would hope unlikely that a purchaser might connect unapproved apparatus to the corporations system <e> <s> if that were to happen the bill provides that in the case of an infringement of british telecommunications privileges the offender will be liable to conviction <e> <s> should it be assumed that the crown intends invariably to initiate legal action against such persons found to infringe bts privilege in this way <e> <s> or is it intended as in some other cases that in practice bt will itself on occasion be expected to initiate such action as may be available to it based on breach of contract by its customers <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to take another side to the same line of thought as that just put forward by the noble lord lord lloyd <e> <s> it is for the particular reason that a telecommunications system is nowhere defined in the bill and as the noble earl lord gowrie said earlier that the government wish to find entrepreneurs the suppliers and so on who will adapt themselves readily to the new circumstances provided by the bill that there is a case for the minister to help when he replies by giving some instances of the kind of telecommunications systems which will be licensed <e>", "<cs> i would like to ask if the minister could help not so much about the future but about the immediate present <e> <s> clause makes provision for the approval of subscriber apparatus where a standard is not for the time being approved under subsection <e> <s> the necessary technical committees of the british standards institution are just in process of being set up to begin the work of preparing standards <e> <s> on form it is understandably unusual for a new standard to be published in less than about a year after work preparing it has begun <e> <s> thus it seems certain that there will be no standards when the bill comes into force later this year <e> <s> in order to give effect to the intention to liberalise the supply of subscriber apparatus it will be necessary to grant approvals under subsection and this raises to my mind two questions <e> <s> first do the government intend to approve all apparatus currently accepted by the post office for connection to their system and also apparatus currently purchased by them and supplied to their customers whether or not formally approved by them <e> <s> secondly will the government consider appointing a person under clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister would allow me just one word before he replies to the debate <e> <s> all sides of the committee have urged that flexibility should be shown by the government <e> <s> may i from these benches be allowed to urge the same theme <e> <s> i was given to understand earlier by the noble earl lord de la warr that some moves might be afoot which would allow for a certain amount of flexibility and that in the commercial market there was a confident prospect that provided permission were given money would be available without much difficulty from the private sector <e> <s> this is subject of course to some move in that direction being in prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and clear account of the various ways in which the secretary of state will as he already is be brought to account to parliament <e> <s> i should like to study carefully what he said <e> <s> if necessary i shall return to this at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the minister for this response and particularly for the precise words in which he put it i would be ready as far as i am concerned to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> if in the passage of time it is found that this particular procedure does not meet all the requirements which can reasonably be expected by industry and other interested parties then naturally there will be further opportunities to reconsider whether another look should be taken at the need for an annual report <e> <s> with your lordships leave i beg to withdraw this amendment on that understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords in the unavoidable absence of the noble lord lord chelwood this afternoon i beg leave at his request to ask the question standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that forthcoming reply on a factual basis and also for his undertaking to circulate further information in a convenient form <e> <s> may i ask in addition to this factual information two questions <e> <s> first is it right to conclude from this reply that it is a confirmation of the importance which her majestys government have attached and are continuing to attach to the polish issue <e> <s> secondly taking all due account of obvious political and financial constraints will they continue to stress the importance of this issue in their dealings with other powers and not least while they hold the presidency of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords no one on these benches can normally speak for others who sit there but on this occasion i am confident that they would wish to be associated with what has already been said about lord butler of saffron walden <e> <s> this perhaps especially as of course constitutionally in the other place they can have no voice <e> <s> even so i speak with all due diffidence for although i was one of a number of permanent secretaries who served him as their minister my direct experience was relatively short-lived as his period of office as secretary of state for foreign affairs was only to last barely a year between and <e>", "<cs> my lords if what the government had in mind and hoped to get out of the debate was an expression of support from party leaders for the course on which the government are set then i hope that they will be content with what has been said in the house today <e> <s> even more i would hope that the government of the argentine would also take note of that conclusion if it is the one which the government have reached <e> <s> otherwise i submit that in a democratic assembly like this many views on possible solutions on attitudes to be taken have very rightly been expressed and provided that they do not mislead the argentine government that in a sense as has been said is what we are here for <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the reported statement of mr george schultz do the government not think that there is something to be said for the suggestion which he made that at the moment the best thing to do is to allow the arabs some time to reflect on what has taken place recently between the plo and the king of jordan <e>", "<cs> my lords even though encouraged by the noble lord lord thomas of swynnerton i must say straight away that i shall not attempt to answer the questions which he suggests should be the subject of a white paper by the foreign office <e> <s> indeed it is somewhat audacious for someone not immediately involved in defence to intervene in this debate on defence estimates <e> <s> at the same time i think that the noble lord <e> <s> lord thomas of swynnerton is right to say that we should from time to time in this debate do as the white paper itself does and as the noble viscount <e> <s> lord whitelaw who introduced the debate did and look at the purposes for which defence is undertaken <e> <s> on that i may perhaps be allowed also to poach on clausewitz <e> <s> your lordships will remember his well known saying <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am most grateful to the noble earl lord selkirk for raising this timely question <e> <s> i hope that it will be equally welcome to the government for it is in our national interest that the soviet leaders should not be persuaded by silence to entertain the belief that the rest of the free and third world have by a mere effluxion of time begun to forget let alone to condone the occupation of afghanistan <e> <s> of course no one here would imagine that the soviet government would be ready to withdraw because of mere words alone <e> <s> but equally we should not altogether forget that there have been rare instances since when the soviet union have been ready even under stalin and khrushchev to retreat from areas which they might claim to be within their <e>", "<cs> my lords as an old china hand having served there over years ago may i from these benches add my words of congratulation upon the agreement that has been reached and to the people who have been engaged in it <e> <s> it is a remarkable agreement <e> <s> i cannot speak for those on these benches but i should not want them to remain silent on such an occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords like the two previous speakers i had thought that this would be an occasion for what might be called a serious review of our relations with the united states <e> <s> at least one possibility advanced by the noble lord lord jenkins he has himself i think already destroyed <e> <s> that is to make us an alluring partner as the st state of the union <e> <s> so that at least can be put aside <e>", "<cs> my lords we should be grateful to the noble lord lord mayhew for bringing forward this subject even if only in a short debate and particularly for the terms in which he started it <e> <s> the noble lord pointed out clearly that there was nothing ignoble in the presidents original thought <e> <s> indeed in another part of the speech which he made on rd march the president said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to deal with this question and to know precisely what is meant by parliamentary control <e> <s> if it means more open inquiry into the activities of the secret services plural does the minister not agree that the example of the united states where there is more senatorial investigation into the cia illustrates the dangers involved in that sort of procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords one further question if i may to follow up one put by my noble friend lord chalfont <e> <s> as i had understood it this peace process was started in february by the initiative of king hussein in which we were given to understand that arafat had accepted and concurred in the general move forward <e> <s> therefore when considering which elements in the palestine liberation organisation might be covered by the two representatives or quasi representatives was not the important point for her majestys government that they did apparently represent the views of arafat who was in the initial stages part of the initiative of king hussein in february <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible to have published the photographs that have been taken of the incident so that we can have some further information which is really already available <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness also agree that it is rather sad to see a once proud and rightly proud nation behaving in what can only appear as such a petty manner <e>"]
