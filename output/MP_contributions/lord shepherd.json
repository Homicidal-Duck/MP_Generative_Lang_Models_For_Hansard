["<cs> my lords my noble friend said that the opposition gave a warm welcome to this order <e> <s> i share it with some hesitation however <e> <s> i still believe that section of the west indies act was not the proper vehicle for sending associated states to independence <e> <s> but my lords let us forget it three have already gone that way but i felt that i should remind my noble friend that i took the labour peers into the division lobby on the first order <e> <s> when i look at the circumstances of grenada i cannot help but feel that perhaps we might have been right <e> <s> however it is not a real issue now <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of what my noble friend said and the fact that we have a foreign and commonwealth secretary in your lordships house something we must all be conscious of may i ask the leader of the house whether he will approach the foreign and commonwealth secretary to see whether he would be willing to make a statement in the house in regard to the conference in geneva something which the house would very much welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very appreciative of the full reply which the noble lord has just given <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether his department in particular will consider with sympathy the suggestions which i believe are being made by the hong kong government that the officials who are looking into the credit of the refugees who wish to come to the united kingdom should be strengthened and should be able to remain in hong kong for longer periods than they have during <e> <s> secondly recognising that many of the refugees have very little knowledge of the united kingdom in the main it is knowledge of the united

proposal of the procedure committee for the setting up of a select committee on science and technology <e> <s> i believe that this is one of the crucial areas <e> <s> however having recognised the importance of this committee i should have hoped that we could be a little more generous in our support of the committee <e>", "<cs> i believe my lords that we shall be in a similar or even worse situation than in and and that members of this house will be saying we are passing legislation under great pressure legislation which has hardly been examined <e> <s> we as a revising chamber are once again failing to perform our real role as a revising chamber <e> <s> may i say to my noble friend that at the end of this session memories of and may come back and that those noble lords who have only recently joined your lordships house will recoil with horror and dismay at what the situation will be <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i put a question to him or perhaps to the minister <e> <s> i really pose the question to my noble friend because he has been very much involved in science and research <e> <s> i was at a meeting of the medical research council the other day and i believe that there is concern i do not know for what reason within the medical research council in regard to this bill <e> <s> i wonder whether through my noble friend or through the minister we can have an assurance as to whether there has been consultation with the medical research council <e> <s> if there has not been consultation can the noble earl see whether contact can be made because i believe that there is some concern in this respect <e>", "<cs> my lords may i pose one question to the noble lord <e> <s> there are a number of territories in the south pacific that are in a similar situation in the sense that they are countries made up of many islands with many tensions <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord in the light of the situation in the new hebrides and while the responsibility is that of her majestys government and of the french government whether there is consultation with the governments of fiji the solomons gilbert and ellice although their names have been changed <e> <s> i am concerned about consultation with the governments and the peoples within the commonwealth in the south pacific <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord allow me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords the pay research unit does not i speak with some authority in this matter advise as to what the settlement is to be <e> <s> it provides the information to the negotiating parties <e> <s> it is not the unit that advises the government or any other body as to what the settlement should be it merely provides the information <e> <s> it is for the negotiators to decide how that information should be used <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord should make it clear that the pay research unit provides information in a raw sense to the two sides it does not weigh or balance one factor with another <e> <s> it deals purely with raw material <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the chairman of the board of the pay research unit and i intervened only in order that the factual position was clearly established <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree that there is a dilemma for those in industry in the junior management field between their responsibilities to their companies and their aspirations in being involved in the auxiliary forces <e> <s> is the minister satisfied that there is sufficient relationship between the ministry of defence and the management of industry so that if young men and women wish to join the services they receive the encouragement of such management <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has pointed to the problem but what i was asking the noble lord is this is there sufficient relationship and understanding between the ministry of defence and industry to overcome this particular problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that your lordships are wasting a great deal of very valuable time <e> <s> the noble lord the chief whip was quite right when he said that there can be no guarantee as to what another place will do with legislation which your lordships have considered have amended and sent back for their consideration <e> <s> on the other hand some of us in this house who have been concerned with the machinery between the two houses know that things can be done if it is possible for them to be done <e> <s> i do not know whether that is so but i believe that if things can be done the noble lord lord denham will find ways to see that your lordships views are understood considered and acted upon by another place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one question <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the trade attach within an embassy <e> <s> the trade attach if my memory is right is responsible to the ambassador <e> <s> am i to take it therefore that if under this bill there is to be recourse to the parliamentary commissioner in regard to a trade attach it therefore follows that an ambassador may also be held accountable for the performance of staff within his embassy or his high commission <e>", "<cs> first the house needs to be resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord the foreign secretary will allow me to make two remarks <e> <s> if i did not do so i think that i would find myself in trouble with many of my friends in gibraltar who have written and asked me to speak in support <e> <s> i negotiated the constitution under which they now live which contains the very important words that the people of gibraltar are part of her majestys dominions and will not be handed over to anyone else without their agreement <e> <s> i want to remind the house of those words because my anxiety in all debates concerning gibraltar is that when we start talking if we should or we ought to maintain our support for gibraltar in gibraltar it undoubtedly creates an element of doubt which i know is not intended <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the foreign secretary will make it very clear that the preamble of the constitution is there and that those words cannot be removed without an act of both houses of this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will i am sure appreciate the difficulty of the minister in replying in regard to mr selby <e> <s> but i hope the minister will appreciate that until all the facts are known mr selby is in a very difficult situation <e> <s> i therefore hope that the minister will undertake that once the court proceedings have been concluded the government will consider making a full statement on the whole situation other than that which has arisen in the courts <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether there is not an officer superior to mr selby who must equally carry the responsibility of mr selby in this respect <e> <s> it seems to me that the responsibility is being placed very prominently upon one individual whereas the whole service might perhaps be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords may i take it from what the noble lord has said that there can be no agreement by her majestys government without prior approval of the two houses <e> <s> will the noble lord recognise that there are many who are british nationals who live within overseas territories which carry our passports and that if we wish to avoid a second relationship and may i say how much we applaud the governments decision in regard to the nationality act as it applies to the people of hong kong in particular there should <e>", "<cs> in to when i was a minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office i was in close negotiation with mr price the chief minister of belize and with the foreign minister of guatemala <e> <s> it is a very involved story and one that goes back many years <e> <s> i should be less than frank if i said to your lordships that the guatemalans were very clear that belize belonged to them <e> <s> this goes back to a period when south america was spanish and when the british had a particular position there <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that there is to be a spillover period into the middle of october <e> <s> bearing in mind that the government have control of the business in another place i should not have thought that if your lordships committee were to pass the amendment that would necessarily delay the bill <e> <s> there is one point i should like to put to the noble lord lord home of the hirsel i might have made it in my earlier speech <e> <s> while belize was a dependent territory have we not from time to time in recent years found it necessary to have added reinforcements to protect the boundaries of belize <e> <s> that must have been because of uncertainties as to what might have been guatemalas attitude to belize even as a dependent territory <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the lord chairman referred to <e> <s> at that time i had the honour to be leader of your lordships house and i know many of the problems <e> <s> may i ask the leader of the house whether perhaps in consultation with the lord chairman she would have a look at the list of questions for written answer that are now set down on the order paper <e> <s> many questions are now being put there because it is not possible to get them answered quickly orally <e> <s> may i ask and i have to admit that during my period as leader of the house i was not sure how it could be adopted whether it is possible that questions for written answer could be disposed of with a greater degree of expedition than at present <e> <s> i think many peers are putting down questions for written answer because they cannot get them on the order paper for answer orally <e> <s> if this course could be adopted then i think there might <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to the position of the united kingdom and the commonwealth <e> <s> do i take it that those conditions relate to organisations drawn from the united kingdom or the commonwealth <e> <s> i have very much in mind the medical research council complex in the gambia which has been under attack and stress <e> <s> can i take it that this new arrangement will give security and tenure to that organisation <e>", "<cs> in my time in your lordships house i have spent time on quite a number of constitutional bills bringing colonies into independence <e> <s> i cannot recall any previous occasion when your lordships house spent so much time in committee on a constitutional bill <e> <s> canada has been an independent member of the commonwealth i was going to say for many years but it is for very many years <e> <s> it has been a leader in many things certainly in the fields of human rights <e> <s> i can understand the anxieties but there are anxieties are there not <e> <s> in any country in regard to minorities <e> <s> the minorities problem exists even within our own state <e> <s> legislation itself cannot deal with it <e> <s> i share the view that has already been expressed that it is a matter for the people of canada through its parliament to deal with the anxieties which quite genuinely have been expressed here this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lord i do not believe any noble lord would disagree with the need for confidence and confidentiality in these discussions but would the noble lord not agree that to attain stability and prosperity there must be a degree of confidence in hong kong and that i think can come about only by divulging some progress as the talks proceed <e> <s> would the minister consider with the prime minister whether from time to time it might be opportune for statements to be made in the two houses in this respect <e> <s> would he also agree that perhaps as one of the benefits of this procedure we therefore might not feel it necessary to put down questions which might be embarrassing at that particular moment in the negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite some years ago when i was sitting on the front bench opposite as leader of the house and made a speech in support of the present concept that we should retain our present system of elections and should reject the formula that was then being put i think from the liberal benches for proportional representation <e> <s> my argument on that occasion and i suspect it is still the same for both the main political parties was that under our present system governments can emerge that are strong in the house of commons and that under proportional representation you could well have a split vote within the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness the minister of state will agree that since september when the issue of hong kong became of singular importance the british parliament has been not only restrained but also highly sensitive to the seriousness and delicacy of the negotiations taking place between her majestys government and the government of the peoples republic of china <e>", "<cs> my lords most generous congratulations have been given to her majestys government and to the government of the prc in regard to this agreement <e> <s> i think that that includes the officials in the foreign and commonwealth office i dare not mention names and equally the officials within the <e>", "<cs> my lords if the secretary of state has a legal duty would it not have been more prudent if the secretary of state had seen these councillors at the department and not at conservative central office <e>", "<cs> my lords one thing is certain that i can speak in complete unanimity with all quarters of this house in congratulating the noble lord lord zouche of haryngworth not only on making his maiden speech but on the quality of the speech that he has delivered today <e> <s> it is a clear message to this house that when one talks about business and i shall be talking a good deal about business and the commercial aspects of bus operation one has to recognise that there are many within our society who require special understanding and assistance <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the consultant that my old company employed mrs claudia flanders <e> <s> i well remember one thing she said to me that if you can improve the quality of service to the disabled and those in need you have the repercussive consequences of raising the standards for all your passengers <e> <s> therefore when one is doing it for the disabled one is not doing it out of a sense of charity one is doing it in a straight business commercial sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i suspect that i did better today <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way <e> <s> first he talked about a billion pounds in terms of subsidy <e> <s> i think he will accept that at least half of that arises from concessionary fares which i think is not a subsidy to an operator but a subsidy to the general community <e> <s> that is one factor <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to me <e> <s> i am sure that he would agree that in the case of the isle of wight you have double-deckers in order to carry the peak service during the summer months <e> <s> if you have small vehicles and no large vehicles you will not be able to carry the number of passengers in the isle of wight during the summer period <e> <s> therefore balancing one period of the year with another a decision has to be taken as to what is the right vehicle <e> <s> it has nothing to do with size it is a question of the number of passengers to be carried <e>", "<cs> my lords what happens to the large vehicles when they are not in use <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is aware of the desk study and he may have seen the maps <e> <s> i wonder whether between now and committee stage taking the supposition that he has made we could have a discussion as to what could be put into the maps to relieve what i believe will be the disappearance of the services <e> <s> the noble lord has made the suggestion that there is a resolve in it <e> <s> i should like to know what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord exhorts those within industry to give value for money <e> <s> does he not agree that we should expect our local authorities also to do likewise when one considers the squalor in many of the main streets in the centre of our capital <e> <s> much of it is old litter <e> <s> cannot something be done to clean up these streets to make them more like the streets found in other cities of europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be right but surely the fact is that we have deep squalor in main streets in the city of london <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene to ask the minister or the mover a question <e> <s> i fully support the proposals in the bill <e> <s> i have some doubts about the severity of the penalty when one considers that in certain countries in south-east asia they have an automatic mandatory death penalty but that still does not seem to stop the dreadful business of trafficking in drugs <e>", "<cs> and others <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to the registration period but he did not touch upon the tendering period <e> <s> can he help us on that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very optimistic <e> <s> he says that the amendments will be put down in good time before we take schedule <e> <s> i suspect there is a reasonable chance that with the co-operation of your lordships we may well be considering schedule by the latter part of next week <e> <s> since the noble lord is at present unable to say specifically when these amendments will be laid i do not know whether his idea of good time is the same as mine nor whether the point is as clearly understood as i would hope <e>", "<cs> i do not question at all the sincerity of the noble lord in the case that he has made <e> <s> i wonder whether in the light of what has been said and the genuine anxiety that has been expressed this is not a party political issue we are debating not a question of principle but a very essential part of the machinery under which this bill is either to be successful or otherwise the minister will help me at least if nobody else <e> <s> will he agree to consider very carefully what has been said during this short debate <e> <s> certainly there is no commitment on his part but if he will undertake to look at it and perhaps seek to have further consultations with various parties to see whether these anxieties can be overcome i shall certainly not press the amendment <e> <s> but if he will not give me that undertaking it will place me in a very difficult situation <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee must be grateful for that intervention <e> <s> the noble lord lord nugent and i have participated in debates over a number of years and hopefully we shall continue over a good number of years on subjects other than transport <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness referred to

occasions when a small firm has great advantages over a big company <e> <s> a big company has inherited overheads <e> <s> i suspect that one of the difficulties of norfolk and hereford is inherited overheads over many years <e> <s> a big company has this competitve advantage it can survive the times and the tensions <e> <s> on the other hand a small company operating from a close base has great advantages of costs and productivity <e>", "<cs> i am not terribly sure whether it is per cent <e> <s> or whether ministers have said per cent <e> <s> in terms of the improved productivity of midland

proposed the amendment <e> <s> i have merely been called <e> <s> i made a short explanation of the situation as i saw it <e> <s> if it is the wish in view of the importance of the amendment that i

received it <e> <s> i can well understand the ministers difficulties in going further <e> <s> as he said it is subject to further discussion both in the department and elsewhere <e> <s> in these circumstances i think it would be wise for me to seek to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has reminded me of an important point <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead made an overture to which i shall naturally respond let us have further talks about it <e> <s> before i withdraw the amendment perhaps i may put all this in its proper context <e> <s> in the stage carnage or local services as it is now defined in the bill the operator will have to register with the traffic commissioner <e> <s> if he fails to maintain a proper service within the notification which is part of his registration he can be held to account <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord has not ascertained or discerned i think was the expression he used from what i have just said i think that i shall leave my noble friends to decide how this amendment should best be dealt with <e>", "<cs> my noble friend must not assume in any way that i have changed from the days in your lordships house when i was very much younger <e>", "<cs> if one was dissatisfied with the government there was only one solution one divided <e> <s> the only question now and i have more grey hair than i used to have is what is the merit of doing so <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not sure how satisfied or assured i should be in the light of that reply <e> <s> i read all the traffic commissioners reports which all indicated a shortage of staff <e> <s> am i to presume that the people that the noble lord is talking about are in addition to the present establishment <e> <s> if that is so even then i wonder whether the figure of which i suppose working it out very quickly is two examiners per traffic area is not exactly in line with the growth that one is expecting in new vehicles or new operators coming into service <e>", "<cs> my lords before the question is finally put perhaps i may say that the noble lord lord belstead like all his colleagues true to the traditions of the front bench always seeks to be of help to your lordships house in considering legislation before it <e> <s> the noble lord was very helpful on monday in giving an explanation as to what changes the government had in mind in regard to schedule <e> <s> we fully understand the noble lords difficulties in having those amendments on the marshalled list today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the statement and particularly for the latter point which he made which is certainly different from the one which i understood was made to me on monday night <e>", "<cs> i personally welcome this amendment although like the noble lord lord beloff i can see some difficulty in the governments accepting it <e> <s> there is a great deal that could be done for the disabled without a great deal of money having to be spent by the company <e> <s> i appointed mrs claudia flanders who had unique experience in the whole field of the disabled <e> <s> the disabled are not only those who like our noble friends have to sit in a wheelchair <e> <s> the disabled are also the blind and the deaf <e>", "<cs> i should like to put this question to the noble lord <e> <s> there is a very considerable difference between the capital costs of the types of vehicle that we are talking about namely vehicles suitable for dealing with the disabled <e> <s> if my memory is right they cost in the region of some to apiece <e> <s> there may be an operator who is providing those services and doing his best with a vehicle that is suitable to a certain degree for those who are handicapped and then a new competitor comes along as he will be able to under this bill with some coaches which he may have bought for each <e> <s> that is about the price of those vehicles <e>", "<cs> more than that <e>", "<cs> i hope so <e>", "<cs> on a point of order i think that my noble friend gave way to the noble lord lord mottistone when he intervened in

will say just a few words <e> <s> i was delighted to hear my noble friend if i may still so call him lord marsh using certain words in the same kind of tone as that which i had been using because of my experience like himself as chairman of a public company <e> <s> i believe my noble friend will agree i think he said so that the problem of cross-subsidy was of minor importance certainly in his time as minister of transport <e> <s> the problem has developed in recent years and cross-subsidy is really not to the advantage of the operators <e> <s> the element of cross-subsidy that we have today is the consequence of a conspiracy of successive central governments and successive local authorities using the traffic commissioners to bring it about <e> <s> when one pleads for continuation for a period of time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord cannot get away with that even if we can forgive him at this fairly late hour <e> <s> what was said by the noble lord lord marsh was not as just stated

noble lord will do what i shall do and check his source of information we could perhaps have further words later not necessarily in your lordships house but elsewhere to see whether there is agreement between us <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to the noble lord lord trefgarne and i have to be frank and open i think i am satisfied <e> <s> i shall take just one precaution <e> <s> i shall read with great care the report of what he has said <e> <s> there seemed to be just a slight difference between the very strong standards in london which we all know about and scotland and those in the rest of england and wales <e> <s> but i think i got enough of the drift of what the noble lord said to leave me satisfied with his response <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> but why not <e> <s> if the noble lord has made the case for england and wales and benefits are to accrue why cannot benefits accrue to london even though the legislation is different <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred in an earlier exchange to the government giving i think urgent consideration to all the legislation concerning taxis and hire-cars <e> <s> according to my memory successive governments have said exactly the same thing <e> <s> all of them have baulked at the enormity i think that is the best word of the problem of redrafting legislation for the present day <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has only reminded me of the position that i knew of when in a different situation sitting on the bench opposite <e> <s> but there has been a change in your lordships house in that things done in committee which have been resolved or withdrawn should not automatically be understood to be able to be moved at a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i think that is correct <e> <s> that is one issue though my memory goes back to some other debates we have had <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peyton is correct in drawing our attention to a later clause with most welcome powers for the traffic commissioners to deal with any failings of bus operators in the field of bus maintenance and bus safety <e> <s> this amendment is not post it is more pre <e> <s> i should have brought with me the statements made by the traffic commissioners at hereford <e> <s> there were three independent operators at hereford who had never been in the bus transport business <e> <s> they were lorry operators and haulage operators who decided that there was a justifiable opportunity for running bus services in hereford <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord nugent is always courteous when he refers to me as being persuasive <e> <s> i should like to say that the noble lord is equally persuasive and perhaps he will answer this question directly <e> <s> he is well aware of the situation in hereford of the damning statements made by traffic commissioners as to the maintenance of those vehicles and that the reason for those vehicles being in that state was that the operators did not have the resources <e> <s> the noble lord is saying to the committee is he not that for the purpose of the long-term objectives he is willing to accept those statements that he is willing to accept that there is a risk in terms of safety merely for the pursuit of the government policy which he clearly supports <e>", "<cs> i certainly welcome what the minister has said that he will look at this between now and report stage <e> <s> i am quite sure that it ought to be in legislation because in other parts of the bill it is clearly stated that commissioners will not notify another commissioner of certain circumstances in their own traffic area <e>", "<cs> may i ask the committee whether i was asleep <e> <s> has the noble lord moved that clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have given notice of my intention with the noble baroness lady vickers to oppose the question that clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> my first apologies must be to the chairman of the committee for intervening earlier but i have already missed two amendments because of the speed at which the business has been conducted <e> <s> but no doubt we can come back to those at a later stage <e>", "<cs> as the subject of victoria a national bus centre has been raised i think that i should say a few words <e> <s> i have nothing but sympathy for

summer <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone referred to vehicles that are taking passengers on sightseeing tours <e> <s> one difficulty and part of the problem associated with this bill is that

agreement among the various operators to spread out their services <e> <s> they are reacting to what the market is saying <e> <s> i do not know what the solution is <e> <s> one problem is that there is nowhere that the vehicles can go to park while the passengers are away from the vehicle <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord help us a little on this matter <e> <s> where will the government be in this

never been the case that has been made to the government by the trustees of the pension fund <e> <s> the limited objective is that at privatisation no employee or pensioner should be worse off in his pension entitlements earned and paid for by members <e> <s> that limited objective falls closely to the final words of the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> i am so glad that we have agreement on that <e>", "<cs> that certainly would be the case <e> <s> but i should like to put this question because i think it is very central to the issue and much depends on how the noble lord replies to it <e> <s> the noble lord has said that there were discussions with various insurance companies <e> <s> the insurance companies have made their position clear and i suspect as the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peyton has really cast a massive slur upon the noble lords lord gridley lord barnett and lord chelwood <e> <s> they put their own names to this amendment <e> <s> certainly i had no involvement in their names being put to it <e> <s> what the noble lord is saying is that because some of us have spoken on the general nature of the bill we are <e>", "<cs> i meant a guarantee that was competitive whereas the noble lord suggested that i referred to a guarantee at any price <e> <s> my question assumed a competitive situation <e> <s> clearly i am not suggesting that the government should pay whatever price any insurance company demanded <e> <s> obviously one is talking about a competitive situation <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to the noble earl perhaps i may make a point in a similar vein <e> <s> of course this matter depends very much on what your lordships wish to do <e> <s> clearly this is an on-going situation <e> <s> i believe we are due to return to this bill at report stage on th october <e> <s> we will not therefore have the usual facilities for discussion and information <e>", "<cs> in regard to what the noble lord lord sandford said of a broader nature i hope that we shall have another opportunity to discuss the important points he raised <e> <s> i share his view on what is called the hybrid approach which has been adopted by the government in regard to these initial companies <e> <s> it is a recipe for disaster <e> <s> there is no clarity whatsoever because it is so involved in the normal work of a council and a municipality <e>", "<cs> i accept that it is a technical amendment but could the noble earl explain in what way it is technical and what was at fault in the bill originally <e>", "<cs> if i might use the jargon that has been developing in our debates on this bill i suspect that the noble baroness has fallen into this trap <e> <s> some <e>", "<cs> i have been under some pressure from my noble friends <e> <s> we have had one long statement we have made very little progress on the bill and we are now to have another statement <e> <s> the noble lord has certainly provoked me into a good deal of debate but i had intended to restrain myself <e> <s> the noble lord wishes to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> what the minister has said is quite unsatisfactory <e> <s> it will be a question for your lordships house at a later stage to decide whether it believes that the noble lord lord sandford is right or the noble lord lord trefgarne <e>", "<cs> really <e>", "<cs> in some respects this amendment could be a watershed as to the way in which we proceed on this committee stage <e> <s> this amendment is not in any way a radical approach <e> <s> it is not in any way seeking to undermine what the government have in mind in terms of this legislation <e> <s> the noble lord said that if the amendment were passed one of the dangers would be that certain local authorities could well use it to ask for this information or that information perhaps with the objective of causing difficulties for the operator <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has read the amendment <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i was not in the chamber earlier <e> <s> on page of the marshalled list the amendment is referred to as no <e> <s> e but on page it is referred to as no <e> <s> d <e> <s> perhaps there has been a printing problem <e>", "<cs> these are in fact the bus stations that i had in mind from which various existing operators are running <e> <s> facilities have been developed over a period of time perhaps to meet the needs of the biggest operator in the district <e> <s> my only anxiety is whether that subsection would create difficulties in the future for the continuation of those facilities <e>", "<cs> i do not know what my noble friend has in mind in regard to this amendment <e> <s> he has certainly sought to deal in i will not say an ingenious way a pragmatic way with what is a genuine concern throughout the bus business and the local authorities <e> <s> perhaps by report stage there will be a great deal more information available as to what existing operators have in mind as a consequence of the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> it may be a question of drafting <e> <s> the noble baroness lady carnegy was saying that if this amendment were passed many of the rural services would not pass muster and would not i was about to say have the benefit of concessionary fares but in truth there is no profit to an operator in running a concessionary fare scheme <e> <s> the amendment uses the words <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to come back to what my noble friend said in regard to subsection in amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> is it necessary to draft paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to be informed of that fact <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness lady carnegy will be willing to support the proposition that what is available in scotland should also be available to the less privileged who live south of the border <e> <s> i am seeking a little movement within what is drafted here <e> <s> secondly i am asking whether something could not be done about the unemployed and particularly the unemployed youth in that there should be concessionary fares to help them in the seeking of employment <e>", "<cs> the committee finds itself in the situation that it does not really know what needs to be provided as a consequence of deregulation and the abolition of cost-subsidy <e> <s> in this situation million is clearly to be welcomed but i hope that the noble lord lord belstead will not take me too wrong if i say that that sum is peanuts in relation to the syphoning out as i said on second reading of the element of cross-subsidy which i know exists within the national bus company which operates in the main in the shire counties <e> <s> the noble lord lord monk bretton is clearly concerned with those <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead said that if the amendment were passed it would prevent or not encourage the entrepreneur to come into the bus operating field <e> <s> does the noble lord really believe that an entrepreneur will come into the bus operating business with a subsidy that will last for four years but which will give diminishing returns <e> <s> i do not think that is a very serious point <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord teviot i fully support the government in the intentions that they have in this clause <e> <s> clearly if an operator has registered and the public are relying upon that operator to perform according to the registration then if there is unreliability there needs to be some degree of sanction <e> <s> i wonder whether the proposal that is in clause is the right way to go about it and whether we may have a more difficult situation in regard to that operator because of the way in which he could be penalised <e>", "<cs> i just had a slight fear <e> <s> was the noble lord saying that if an operator was not registered which i think would be a very serious matter there would be the possibility that there could be fuel duty rebate <e> <s> i find it very difficult to believe that <e>", "<cs> the penalty is there <e>", "<cs> i intervene only because there is so much noise <e> <s> could the noble earl do it again and with a little caution in terms of speed <e>", "<cs> i am not entirely wedded to the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> but i should like to ask the noble lord lord brabazon what he means by the disposal programme of the nbc companies <e> <s> my understanding is that the nbc companies will remain within the national bus company that they will be competing with each other but certainly not in the time-scale that we are now discussing and that there will be a disposal programme into the private sector <e> <s> what did the noble lord mean by a disposal programme <e>", "<cs> so what the noble lord lord brabazon said in terms of the disposal programme is not exactly appropriate to the amendment that the noble lord lord teviot moved <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> under the relevant clause the companies shall be free and able to compete with each other and with all other organisations <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord mcintosh spoke in regard to amendment no <e> <s> za and said that it was not his intention to move it <e> <s> i have an amendment before that <e> <s> it was always open to me to move it <e> <s> i should like to address a few remarks to the deputy leader of your lordships house the noble lord lord belstead <e> <s> i believe that the leadership of your lordships house has a duty to the house whether it is sitting as the house as a whole or in committee <e> <s> it is not there solely to get government legislation through <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord belstead can help us in this respect <e> <s> assume that the committee accepts all the amendments that the noble lord lord belstead moves to schedule <e> <s> would he then recognising what i said earlier and what the noble lord lord sandford has said agree that schedule could be recommitted when we come back in october <e> <s> my understanding is that we have at least three full days for consideration on report <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord belstead one very simple question <e> <s> i can understand his position but will he explain to the committee why he cannot meet the request <e> <s> the question was submitted that these amendments to schedule be recommitted taking into account what has always been the understanding within your lordships chamber that there must be agreement that we are not seeking to frustrate or to delay <e> <s> why is it that the noble lord cannot meet us <e> <s> recognising that we are in this situation not because of the noble lord <e> <s> lord belstead but because of the governments managers <e> <s> whatever he may say about it having been agreed through the usual channels we have had a long delay today because of the way the government managers <e>", "<cs> i think that first expressions of appreciation must be addressed to the noble lord lord belstead for having honoured the commitment he made in committee that this very important matter would be recommitted prior to report stage <e> <s> the noble lord lord belstead will understand that some of us are in particular difficulties because he himself referred to a meeting held last wednesday when he made it very clear to me and to others that it was not in the governments mind to take the recommittal this day but that it was to be taken later <e> <s> therefore some of us had put this very important matter aside in terms of the consideration of other amendments which we are going to deal with later when we get to the report stage <e>", "<cs> my understanding is though i may rely upon the minister who has a greater brief than i have that under the governments proposals those who are already pensioners and those who will come within pension in the period between the passing of the bill and three years later will have all the security and all the benefits which exist under the present scheme <e> <s> within a pension scheme it is of course the members who create the ability to pay existing pensions <e> <s> it is they according to my advice who will be the greatest sufferers <e>", "<cs> i understand that the existing schemes are based upon national average earnings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has got it right in the end it is the ability of the trustees to pay what they have agreed to pay <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord belstead i hope will be agreeable to meeting some of us to pursue this subject between now and third reading or maybe the report stage <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will respond that way because i believe there is a solution to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i was shaking it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness launches forth on the situation in glasgow i may say that this amendment has been drafted solely for one purpose to exclude glasgow strathclyde from the consequences of the amendment <e> <s> whether or not we have succeeded in that i do not know <e> <s> certainly such was the purpose of our drafting <e>", "<cs> it is not meant to do so my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords governments have introduced legislation which goes to the high court only to find that on what was legislated for the high court takes a different view <e> <s> when i was seeking an amendment to eliminate tyne and wear from the bill for a period of time i asked that the amendment be so drafted to solely apply to tyne and wear <e> <s> the noble baroness and the minister say that the amendment is so drafted that possibly strathelyde would be included <e> <s> all i can say is that like the government i have it wrong <e> <s> however the purpose was solely to have a debate on the tyne and wear situation which in my view is unique within the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we might buy the noble lords vote by extending it <e> <s> i do not know whether that would require a resolution from the county or the pte <e>", "<cs> my lords please let me finish because i think we should like to have a solution to our problem <e> <s> i can only say to the noble lord lord nugent that if he and i were in business i do not know who would walk out of the partnership quicker <e> <s> i suspect however that i would walk out because i do not think he fully understands the rigours of commercial need <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord started off better than i did <e> <s> the first order that i took in life was for pieces of yards of tootals riverena haircord which i took in singapore <e> <s> that was if i may say so infinitely less than being in a farming community <e> <s> the point i am seeking to put to the noble lord is that if we were in partnership we would not wish to share our revenues with a potential competitor <e> <s> the metro would always be a potential competitor to our bus company <e> <s> i suspect that what we would do and what the bus companies will do is maximise routes into the centre of newcastle and not participate in any sharing arrangements with the metro <e> <s> i believe that will be the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether it will help your lordships house if i say that i warmly welcome these amendments <e> <s> they are a gesture <e> <s> they certainly are complex but i am quite sure that those who will be required to administer them will be able so to do <e> <s> i welcome these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords it may well be that the amendment is not an attack upon the principle of the bill but let us be very clear that if we were to pass it we would at least be expressing what many of us who have taken part in the debate feel is a very great concern on the consequences of deregulation and in particular the loss through cross-subsidisation in the very early months <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my voice to those of other noble lords speaking in support of this bill <e> <s> i had the privilege of representing her majestys government at the accession of king carlos to the throne of spain a week after the funeral of general franco <e> <s> even then as the noble baroness said there were thoughts and questions among the leaders within spain on the possibility of spain at some stage being able to enter the democratic community of europe <e> <s> therefore we must all be pleased with the stability of spain despite its many difficulties and that it has been able to pass the test and has now been accepted by the community <e> <s> in the same way that is true of portugal <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earl any information to give to the house as to the comparisons between the pay of lrt drivers and those who also work within the vicinity engaged in similar <e>", "<cs> my lords i would add my words of congratulation to the noble lord lord clitheroe <e> <s> and also to the noble lord lord aldington and his committee <e> <s> they have rendered a very notable service in this report <e> <s> i think that it would also be right to express appreciation to all those who gave evidence both written and oral because in truth those parts of the evidence that i have read perhaps could be re-read more ominously than the report itself <e> <s> some of the remarks of most senior industrialists made me wonder when the noble lord lord young of graffham was speaking whether in a sense we were talking about the same country or the same industry <e>", "<cs> i only intervene to see whether the noble viscount the leader of the house would agree with me that the noble and learned lord lord simon was quite wrong when he said that amendments of this character were an abuse of parliamentary procedure <e> <s> the committee stage has been called and the committee will remember that the title of the bill has been postponed <e> <s> it has been postponed for a very special reason that amendments could be put down and in no way be limited by the title to the bill <e> <s> i intervene only in this respect <e> <s> when we had the transport bill in the last session a number of noble lords opposite took the same view as the noble and learned lord lord simon <e> <s> if this is so that because one has a bill that has been given a second reading one then is limited to the basic principles within it inevitably one will have divisions on second reading <e> <s> i think one of the more sensible conventions of your lordships house is that bills whether they be private or government should be given a second reading so that we can then freely examine them and make up our minds on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to security during the flight of an aircraft can the noble earl say whether that could be enhanced if a much more stringent limit were placed upon the amount of baggage passengers are allowed to take upon the aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords my question related to the amount of luggage passengers were taking on board aircraft <e> <s> would it not enhance security if less baggage were taken on board the aircraft <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord understand that there is some concern when he speaks <e>", "<cs> but my lords in the event that the yard has been privatised as in the case of westland how do the government ensure that after privatisation that company will not fall into foreign hands <e>", "<cs> my lords will the right reverend prelate permit me <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to raise a small matter but i shall come back to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to be critical of the right reverend prelate in regard to the statement that he has made but it is very clear that ministerial statements are not a cause for debate <e> <s> one of our great anxieties in this particular matter is that it is very difficult to deal with a subject of this kind without a debate <e> <s> there are many questions and many explanations <e>", "<cs> i had intended to ask the minister what was the definition of financial institutions which is in the amendment that has been moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i entirely support the objectives of the noble and learned lord in his amendment but i agree very much with the noble lord lord harris that the question of laundering is absolutely fundamental to the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in the process of privatisation which i presume the noble lord supports would he not accept that in order to get a

motors <e> <s> it is no good saying that it was part of the negotiations <e> <s> we wish to know when the breaking point arose <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord todd was right when he said that this was not a party matter <e> <s> nor when we express our concern about the ethnic minorities in hong kong is it in any way criticising or creating any doubts as to the integrity and honesty of the

inquiry so that <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with great reluctance to move that the motion for third reading be not agreed to <e> <s> i do so not in terms of the merits of the bill but in regard to

about it and that they would wish to listen <e> <s> they gave an undertaking that in another place they would deal with it <e>", "<cs> my lords he did not say that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that i could have moved a motion to the effect that this third reading be postponed for seven days <e> <s> if we are asked to vote against the bill i think we are then placed in an intolerable position <e> <s> all that i am seeking because of the circumstances that i have explained is the adjournment of the third reading <e> <s> if we were to vote against the third reading the bill would be

postponement of the third reading <e>", "<cs> seven days <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the advice of the noble lord lord henderson to delete the word now and insert seven days hence <e> <s> i beg to

themselves of their passengers on the right hand side of the vehicle which means right in front of oncoming traffic <e> <s> would it not be sensible for that class of vehicle to be required to disgorge passengers in more suitable places <e>", "<cs> my lords i intended to intervene only to make a plea to my noble friend in regard to this amendment <e> <s> i hope that he will not seek to press it because this is a matter which i think ought to be pursued at a later stage when the government have given further consideration to the issues before them <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl explain what he means when he says that services are being maintained <e> <s> does he mean the number of services or that they will operate with the same frequency in terms of the daily operation which was previously in being <e> <s> does he also mean the maintenance of early morning and late evening services which were factors which caused considerable concern <e>", "<cs> my lords i was grateful to the noble earl for his reply <e> <s> however i should like to know when he will be able to place before the house a full layout showing the way in which the tendering process has gone through how much has been saved and whether there are any anxieties within the counties as to the shortage of provision of services <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord diamond has much alternative but to go over and over again the arguments on this matter because this is a revising chamber <e> <s> we are looking at a piece of important legislation <e> <s> the difficulty

to the noble baroness <e> <s> she quite rightly declared her interest <e> <s> however i think she would agree that in the past the building societies have been within the friendly societies

involved in the public sector i entirely agree with the noble lord lord beaverbrook when he said that ministers are birds of passage and that civil servants brought up in the narrow confines of

went there first in on business <e> <s> there has hardly been a year since then when i have not visited the colony for one purpose or another <e> <s> therefore i believe that i can claim that i have seen the way in which the colony has evolved growing in numbers emerging in stature and in every form of respect <e> <s> i can understand therefore what is bound to mean for some of those in hong kong <e> <s> i say some of those because many the vast majority remain at heart although they work earn their living and live within hong kong still part of mainland china <e> <s> we are concerned today with the others who have emerged during that period <e>", "<cs> this bill was introduced in another place in the name of the secretary of state <e> <s> it is the tradition in this chamber that when a minister has been asked to take another look at an issue before him in the light of the debate he would agree to do so <e> <s> it would be done in an honourable way so that there would be consideration not only by himself but by the secretary of state in whose name the bill was originally introduced in another place <e>", "<cs> we are only in the difficulty that the bill is at this stage at this part of the session <e> <s> the bill had its second reading some three weeks ago <e> <s> if it had been so important to get the legislation through the bill could have been brought forward a week or parliament could sit into august <e> <s> we are dealing with the last of our colonies the last of our responsibilities <e> <s> i apologise to the noble earl lord ferrers and to the committee <e> <s> i spoke on an earlier amendment thinking that it was a general debate <e> <s> i shall not say who misled me but i was misled <e>", "<cs> it is not legislation <e>", "<cs> i take it from what the noble lord has said that he has closed his mind to any situation that may arise between now and when in the interests of the stability of hong kong both the governor and the secretary of state may feel the figure should be uplifted not by dramatic figures but maybe by in order to ensure stability <e> <s> the government have closed their mind so far as this legislation is concerned but in order to deal with the situation they would need a bill similar to that before the committee today <e> <s> that is what the noble lord is saying is he not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has gone a little further than i had in mind <e> <s> i was putting to the minister that by rejecting the amendment before the house if in the interests of the stability of hong kong between now and proved to be unattainable new legislation would be required <e> <s> in other words if the amendment were passed it could be done by statutory order order in council or whatever it might be subject to the affirmative resolution of either house <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee i supported the amendment which had been moved by the noble lord lord bonham-carter <e> <s> i did so with some hesitation because i did not believe that it went far enough in providing for parliamentary control <e> <s> i am very grateful that the noble lord has added to that original amendment the words which would require the approval of both houses of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords in fairness to the noble lord lord henderson and the house will the noble lord now reply to the question that was put to him by the noble lord lord henderson <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will not think it discourteous on my part if i do not seek to reply to the very many points made in regard <e>"]
