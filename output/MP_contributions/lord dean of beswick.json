["<cs> my lords rising to make a maiden speech in this illustrious chamber is something of an ordeal even though one has made numerous speeches in another place along the corridor <e> <s> first may i thank noble lords from all sides of the chamber for the kindness and consideration they have shown me since i took my seat a fortnight ago <e> <s> perhaps i may digress for a few moments from the subject under debate to compliment the noble viscount lord tonypandy although unfortunately he has had to leave the chamber on his maiden speech <e> <s> mine as your lordships are aware is the second one today <e> <s> i should also like in complimenting him on his speech to place on record my appreciation of his services in another place and for the kind and considerate way he dealt with back-benchers like myself <e> <s> he had no favourites and both the most powerful in that chamber and the humblest backbencher received the same consideration <e> <s> he left a record there as speaker that any of his successors will have a job to live up to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for repeating the statement on this particular dispute <e> <s> may i also extend our sympathy to the people who were injured last night especially the policemen and the pickets concerned <e> <s> i must emphasise here that violence has no part in our philosophy in the resolution of industrial disputes <e> <s> it serves no purpose whatsoever and very often has the effect only of delaying a settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the dismay that will be felt by local authorities in response to that answer <e> <s> the question of course was superseded and somewhat dismissed from this order paper by the fact that the secretary of state himself a fortnight ago announced a reduction in the housing investment programme <e> <s> how does the minister advise local authorities to deal with this problem when it has now become an accepted fact that the industrialised and semi-industrialised houses built since are the most urgent problem that they have to deal with <e> <s> where are they going to get the finance from based on a housing investment programme which has now been reduced in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that there have been by some local authorities specific identifications <e>", "<cs> of this particular problem <e> <s> may i ask the minister what he is prepared to do for authorities who have had to take decisions to demolish properties that have been built less than years <e> <s> they have been identified and demolished <e> <s> what are the government going to do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one particular block of flats in leeds has had to be demolished because of structural deterioration and that it is unacceptable socially <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that the demolition of that block of flats will place on every council house in leeds a p increase in rent a week for the next years <e> <s> does the noble lord think that fair and equitable treatment of the other council house tenants in leeds who will have to pay for it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all thank the noble lord the minister for his statement delivered in reply to the private notice question tabled in another place <e> <s> parts of the statement refer to legal processes and my information is that mr shah has activated some other legal processes today <e> <s> so i do not propose nor would it be right to comment on those <e>", "<cs> my lords may i once again reiterate to noble lords as i did last week that my party is not prepared to instruct encourage or suggest violence in any industrial situation <e> <s> i think it is to be somewhat regretted that there have been undertones in some of the utterances in the chamber today that that might not be the standpoint of my party <e> <s> we completely and utterly reject that <e> <s> we are saying that people must on all occasions act within the law as it stands <e> <s> if there are bad laws they need changing <e> <s> i rest my submission on that <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i join the previous two speakers my noble friend lady denington and the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes in their congratulations and compliment the noble lord lord cornwallis on his very informative maiden speech <e> <s> i found it very interesting <e> <s> the noble lord certainly has specialised knowledge of housing associations and building societies on which i am sure we shall hear from him again in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the record ought to be put right <e> <s> as an ex-whip in another place who dealt with all the housing bills i would say that the official standpoint of the labour opposition was and still is that the prerogative to sell council houses ought to be left with the local authority which owns them taking into account local need <e> <s> the local authority ought not to be dictated to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness tell us what effect the p per week increase in the recommended guidelines issued by the secretary of state for the environment some time ago will have on the figures she has given us today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first congratulate the noble lord lord seebohm and his colleagues who served on the select committee for the very thorough and obviously efficient and first-class job they have done on behalf of your lordships <e> <s> it will be obvious to anyone who has read the report from the number of witnesses who were interviewed and the number of organisations from which information was taken that their efforts to find a proper solution and present a report to this house were very wide-ranging indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords before i start to put the case as seen by the main opposition party in another place let me commence by stating at once that i have no pecuniary interest in this dispute nor do i represent the nga nor have i met any officials of the nga regarding this dispute <e> <s> in my maiden speech in this chamber i expressed my delight and appreciation at being ennobled and sent to this place in order to take part in the deliberations regarding the affairs of the nation <e> <s> i was aware however and still am aware that i was not joining a mutual admiration society <e> <s> politics being what they are even though this place has a reputation for being somewhat less controversial or political than another place i knew that there would be times when the differences that divided us would be minor and at other times more profound and serious depending on the nature of the issue before us and i submit to your lordships that the debate taking place today comes into the latter category <e>", "<cs> i will on that point <e>", "<cs> nevertheless my lords the noble lord did not take the subsequent action that i would have expected him to take if he had a violent disagreement with things that were taking place under a government in which he was serving <e> <s> so not only does the alliance party have two parties two leaders and two policies but it can also be seen on this occasion to have quite blatantly two faces <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not giving way <e>", "<cs> i am not giving way <e> <s> then <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am not giving way <e> <s> the noble lord is down to speak and no doubt he will make his point when i shall not interrupt him <e> <s> those acts of parliament have been described by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls <e> <s> he said that he had become very conscious notably during his national industrial relations court experience that the legal system was not <e> <s> in practice evenhanded as between employers and unions <e> <s> current functions put the courts almost entirely in the business of restricting or penalising the latter and not remedying their grievances <e> <s> in view of those opinions how can we say that the trade unions if taken to court will receive justice <e> <s> they will receive the verdict of the courts based on the law as it stands <e> <s> but what to them is that sort of justice bearing in mind the opinions expressed by the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords if i have transgressed the normal practice of this house i willingly withdraw <e> <s> nevertheless the facts are on record <e> <s> the prime minister met mr shah on the day he was awarded his injunctions by the court <e> <s> i leave noble lords to judge whether this was socialising or what did they discuss <e> <s> i am sure it was not a case of the prime minister discussing with mr shah a course of action which would resolve the dispute in a manner acceptable to all the parties concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i say that i thought it was not in keeping with the traditions of this house for me to give way when i was reading a statement made by somebody else <e> <s> the intervention ought to have come at the end of that statement when i could have dealt with the matter and with the points of other noble lords who may also have wanted to intervene <e> <s> it has been made quite clear that when one speaks about violence it means violence from any quarter <e> <s> i do not for one moment condone nor does my party the fact that people who have no interest in the dispute are going up to warrington <e> <s> perhaps noble lords would take the trouble to read page of todays <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord lord campbell of alloway permit me to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the point that the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls does not think so either <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl indicate to the house whether the people responding to the consultative documents such as the trade unions representing the low-paid workers will receive better consideration of the points that they put than they did some time ago when the present government were scrapping legislation that had been placed on the statute book years ago <e> <s> that legislation which was in fact passed by conservative governments protected the low-paid workers and it was scrapped in what some believe was a contravention of the ilo agreements existing at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first thank the minister for repeating the answer made in another place to the pnq on this very important dispute <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount <e> <s> lord long for the spirit in which he moved the regulations <e> <s> they cater for people in society who because of circumstances beyond their control have gradually deteriorated through industrial disease and have no recourse to action against their former employer because the firm no longer exists <e> <s> from various inquiries i have made i understand that the largest group of applicants to and recipients from the fund is now textile workers <e> <s> the noble viscount is correct when he says that the applicants come mainly from the declining industries <e> <s> i should think that steel smelting and engineering generally come a very close second to the textile industry <e> <s> the number of applicants from those industries might even equal the number from the textile industry <e> <s> at one time we had a tremendous industry in steel iron and brass foundries <e> <s> they were a large percentage of the engineering industry <e> <s> anyone who saw even a few years ago the conditions in which people were working in the fettling and blasting shops knows only too well the type of matter that was being inhaled <e> <s> as the noble viscount said <e> <s> the disease is regressive <e> <s> very often it starts as a slight cough but as time moves on it becomes very serious indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords some of the worst scourges of industrial disease have almost disappeared because of new techniques <e> <s> that certainly applies to <e>", "<cs> my lordswill the minister explain whyas he said in reply to a supplementary question he expects that one metropolitan district might provide the service on behalf of another bearing in mind the jealousy that already exists among the various authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord really expect one local authority to allow another authority to act on its behalf bearing in mind the jealousy that already exists among local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in cash terms that means a weekly increase of to be followed by another pence this year as dictated by the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> is the minister aware that that is a per cent <e> <s> increase <e>", "<cs> i am not reading <e> <s> my lords <e> <s> is the minister aware that that is a per cent <e> <s> increase in council house rents an increase which is in fact twice the present rise in the cost of living <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister the following question <e> <s> bearing in mind that over per cent <e> <s> of council house tenants have borne the full brunt of this financial attack on their standard of living without any rebate or social security payments from the government when will the secretary of state and the government cease this attack on council house tenants who do not wish or in some cases <e>", "<cs> cannot afford to buy their council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that the government guidelines state that the pence must come from either rents or rates <e> <s> it may well be that in his replies the minister could be a little more factual <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister then turn his mind to part of my first question <e> <s> can he given an undertaking that the government will not be imposing annual rent increases of per cent <e> <s> on council house tenants in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that despite the predictions of the government and those from other sources that the economy is on the upturn these figures are continuing to rise at a considerable rate <e> <s> can the noble earl tell the house when her majestys government expect these figures to level out and to start to move downwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl must be aware that a large number of the people who are unemployed were formerly employed in the public sector <e> <s> therefore will he urge her majestys government to respond to the overtures of both the cbi and the trade union movement the tuc to reflate the public sector in order to get jobs moving in that sector and get these appalling unemployment figures moving downwards <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express to the noble lord how i welcome the decision of the government to proceed in that manner <e> <s> however is the noble lord not aware that there are insufficient inspectors with the necessary qualifications under the safety and welfare acts to carry out this function <e> <s> that being the case may not the shortage of inspectors negate the legislation that the government are bringing in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that further information from the noble lord <e> <s> but it is a sad fact that in the recent past there have been fatalities and serious injuries among youngsters employed in the various youth schemes and i hope that the increased number of inspectors which the noble lord has announced will be sufficient to prevent any such tragedies occurring again <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join with previous speakers in congratulating and complimenting my noble friend lord cledwyn on introducing this debate and on the manner in which he did so <e> <s> in fact he covered a very wide area indeed <e> <s> i should like to approach this matter in a slightly different way from that of other speakers because my view of the infrastructure of a nation does not necessarily relate to roads railways and civil <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many noble peers will be disturbed at receiving such an important announcement at such short notice and that they would have preferred more notice in order to understand the implications of the governments action <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware that the way in which trade unionists have been ignored on this matter carries undertones which suggest that to be a member of a trade union could indicate some disloyalty to the crown <e> <s> in spite of the fact that past efforts in this country certainly as recent as the falklands affair have shown that that is not the case and that trade unionists are as loyal to the crown the government and the people of this country as any other sector <e> <s> i am amazed that the government have become involved in such action without discussing the matter <e> <s> i am not suggesting that they are not entitled to take the decision that is their prerogative <e> <s> but i am amazed that they have taken such a far-reaching decision without consulting the responsible trade unionists who have represented these people over a number of years <e> <s> i hope that i shall not be proved right if i say that in some respects they may regret the decision they have taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back so soon and i thank the noble baroness for her courtesy and the way she has answered the probing questions that have been put <e> <s> however there will be no doubt in my mind i may be wrong but i have an idea that i will not be that it will be taken by outsiders that somebodys loyalty was in question <e> <s> i do not think you can draw any inference other than the fact that the government have taken a decision that people in certain places in certain jobs cannot be totally trusted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply but because of the situation may i urge the government to move faster <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the governments own fire statistics covering to show that people living in multiple occupation died from fire or through its effects and that those figures also show that people living in multiple occupation are nine times more at risk than people living in ordinary accommodation <e> <s> could i therefore urge the minister if there are any proposals in the pipeline to ask the secretary of state to speed them up <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister for his answers so far may i press him on the last point mentioned <e> <s> after the local authorities and the other bodies involved submit their findings and the government come forward with proposals will consideration be given as a matter of urgency to making the powers mandatory and not optional since so far only local authorities in the whole of england and wales have taken out control orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement that has been made in another place <e> <s> may i ask him bearing in mind the very substantial changes proposed in this white paper whether it would not have been better for the government first to issue a green paper to allow the fullest consultations to take place with all the people concerned <e> <s> may i also ask the minister whether he is satisfied that the fullest consultations have taken place <e> <s> i ask that because the statement refers to such bodies as the tuc and my information at the moment is that production of this document has come as rather a surprise to some of the people involved in it <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the announcement conveyed in the statement repeated by the chancellor of the duchy but speaking as a former engineer my welcome is somewhat guarded at this stage <e> <s> there seems to be a sense of euphoria that the project has already succeeded but i should like to press the chancellor on the question put by the noble lord from the sdp benches regarding the second phase and the gaining of jobs <e> <s> bearing in mind the history of the japanese industrialists in the post-war period in regard to their capacity to flood domestic markets in other countries all over the world very often with tragic economic industrial and social consequences for the countries involved can the chancellor tell us that the jobs will not be at the expense of our own domestic motor car industry <e> <s> can he also tell us whether the japanese can be held fast to the agreements that they make if they decide to open the tap further and damage our own domestic car-producing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the point that i am trying to make is that i do not think that the intervention if it was intervention by the american government or by some of its agencies is the deciding factor but i think that it is part of the parcel that brought about this misguided decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not suggesting that anybody else thinks or has said that their loyalty has been impugned <e> <s> but some of the workers themselves have drawn the conclusion that their loyalty is being impugned not other people <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> my lords just briefly i did refer to that particular dispute though i did not put a date to it <e> <s> i said that subseqently when the trade unionists at that establishment were called to become involved in a later dispute it is to their credit that they refused to do so <e> <s> i said that it looked as though the child is being whipped for behaving itself <e> <s> that was the dispute i referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords the question posed by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is fundamental <e> <s> it is one of the main issues we are arguing about <e> <s> the government over the last few years in and now have broken two agreements <e>", "<cs> i am going to ask a question <e> <s> they have broken two agreements with civil servants <e> <s> what guarantees can the minister give even if these proposals go through that the government will not break them <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords taking into account the governments recently published white paper on youth training can the noble lord state when the centralisation proposed in the white paper takes place who will have the final say in the dimension and variety of this type of training course <e> <s> will it be the commission itself or will it be the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his answer to my first question but will he give an undertaking that the type of schemes we are now discussing will not be funded at the expense of the more mundane schemes <e> <s> some schemes which employ a considerable number of youths at present are unfortunately being closed down at this moment because of the withdrawal of government support <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join previous speakers in congratulating my noble friend lady lockwood on introducing this report for debate and for the manner in which she did so <e> <s> however i hope that noble lords will forgive me if i direct my contribution such as it is more along the lines that have just been enunciated by my noble friend lord stewart <e>", "<cs> my lords if we lived in a perfect world that would probably he the best solution but people and societies are not like that <e> <s> certainly experience in this country has shown that the only time a national government in the real sense works is in a time of strict adversity <e> <s> when people are entitled in a democracy to opt for the type of society they want it would he dangerous to try to interfere with that <e> <s> the point i make and repeat and i do not know whether it has been taken on board by some noble lords opposite is that to start turning the clock back and to deny million people a vote which some have had for only the past decade to elect a tier of authority between them and the government is a dangerous philosophy <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister is correct and sincere in saying that the government do not consider that there is a case for two tiers why are they leaving per cent <e> <s> of the country alone and retaining a two-tier system of government there <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble minister for that reply but may i press upon him as a matter of urgency that when the government do have some proposals they put them into effect as quickly as possible bearing in mind the widespread ravages that acid rain is causing not only to this country but to some of our friendly neighbours in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will be aware that there have been responsible programmes on television indicating the appalling damage that has been done by acid rain to vast areas of beauty not only in this country but on the continent as well <e> <s> it is undeniable that we as a nation are the biggest contributor to this <e> <s> when the government decide on some action will the noble lord press them to act swiftly because of the damage that is being inflicted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for that reply but is he aware of the report published at the weekend which <e>", "<cs> my lords i was of course referring to the figures <e> <s> the minister referred to young people as being the groups most adversely hit <e> <s> i am referring to all females including those in the younger age groups <e> <s> the figures show quite clearly that women as a group have lost more jobs than any other section in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl not aware that his answer to the very pointed question of the noble lord lord diamond indicates clearly that the figure of claimants that he has given on behalf <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> is the minister aware that between leeds western area and leeds eastern area there are almost people on the orthopaedic list awaiting surgery <e> <s> even on the basis of the most optimistic forecasts that have been made many of those people will be on the list for far too long and certainly for a length of time that could not be considered tolerable <e> <s> will the minister press the regional health authority to make resources available so that the leeds area health authorities can deal with this matter in a satisfactory manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reference to the increased facilities that may be made available at chapel allerton <e> <s> is he also aware that a decision is about to be taken as to whether to keep the margarita hepton hospital at wetherby open or not <e> <s> if this hospital is closed and it caters for a lot of post-operative orthopaedic patients it will have a further detrimental effect on the services <e> <s> will the noble lord try if possible to influence a favourable decision regarding that hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords may i commence as have other noble lords by paying tribute to the noble earl lord lauderdale and the noble lord lord kearton for the way in which they introduced the subject under discussion and for the facts that they were able to disclose during their speeches which i am sure are of tremendous assistance to other noble lords in debating this subject <e> <s> i do not want to dwell too much on the coal industry because i think that that has been adequately covered by such previous speakers as the noble lord lord ezra with his expertise which certainly i could not match <e> <s> i found the comments of the noble earl lord lauderdale on the electricity supply industry very illuminating having worked in that industry myself for nearly years <e>", "<cs> my lords can i ask the noble minister whether before any announcement is made he will seek to influence the secretary of state to include in any such scheme individual metering for all the households and properties involved bearing in mind the disastrous financial consequences suffered by householders in the past when individual metering has not been provided <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to the previous speakers to this amendment <e> <s> i do not want to give the impression that i am speaking against the amendment because i am not <e> <s> but if someone can tell me that it is a simple exercise even to establish co-operatives within the present housing structure in this country i can only say that they have never dealt with the situation <e> <s> first if x number of houses or tenants and their families in those houses decide to become a co-operative where does the extra funding come from for the improvements that they may decide they want <e> <s> will they try to implement the separate rent structure from the total pool of housing in their city <e> <s> i suggest that people are interested in housing co-operatives because they want to cast their sights a little higher than their existing facilities <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said when he moved this clause that it was a very detailed one and one which would require some understanding <e> <s> i must pay my respects to him in saying that i think he tried to explain it in detail but he must not be surprised if the whole exercise is viewed with cynicism by some people involved <e> <s> this is the second time that this piece of legislation has been before another place and this chamber and it seemed strange in another place when after a substantial number of hours had been taken on this bill in committee this new measure which is an implementation of the existing policy but by another <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that i am glad that in his answer to the question on the order paper he has reiterated the undertaking given by his noble colleague lord trefgarne when answering the debate in this chamber on th february and also i understand the undertaking given by the foreign secretary in another place on th january that there was no intention to extend the exercise at the cheltenham gchq to other people working in other government establishments <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of some reports in the local press that the secretary of state for defence may be toying with this idea <e> <s> do i understand that the previous undertakings given by the minister still are official government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will understand if i consider that the noble earl did not answer my supplementary question <e> <s> i did not ask the noble earl about the gchq <e> <s> i asked him about other government establishments but he made no reference to them at all in his reply <e> <s> is it the governments intention to reconsider the previous undertakings regarding other government establishments <e> <s> that was my question to the noble earl <e> <s> will he please answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that i agree with the noble baroness in her welcome for the ministers first comment <e> <s> the full attainment of the proposals in the white paper when that happens will be welcome <e> <s> surely however the minister must be aware that there are already hundreds of thousands of people with special skills ranging from the professions to artisan types highly skilled and highly trained who are waiting the opportunity to work <e> <s> when will the government implement some proposals to get these people who are already trained back in work <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister not aware that whatever criteria are used for publishing unemployment figures they show a progressive increase in unemployment among all age groups <e> <s> how does the noble earl square this with the continuing statements from government ministers and some of their friends in the community that the economy is improving <e> <s> does he think that the people who are joining the dole queues in increasing numbers will have regard to those statements and think they are correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to follow the noble lord lord evans because i agree very much with what he says <e> <s> we are talking here about housing repairs mainly in the public sector <e> <s> this is of course one of the most difficult areas of housing to deal with <e> <s> the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes was a little wide of the mark when she spoke as if there would be some compulsion over tenants using the sort of facility suggested in the amendment <e> <s> my experience in local authority housing has taught me that all the tenant wants is to get the repair done as quickly as possible <e> <s> i do not think that the tenant is over-worried about whether it is done by direct labour or by the private sector <e> <s> there is no question therefore of the proposal of my noble friend lady denington if the government were kind enough to accept it being in any way compulsory on the tenant <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords although i welcome the answer of the noble baroness she must be aware that it will be received with some disappointment by noble members of this house and by a wider audience outside <e> <s> bearing in mind that the cost to each individual income taxpayer in this country is per year to support the fortress falklands policy of the present government does not the noble baroness agree that it is time for a further urgent initiative to be taken with the argentine government in order to get direct talks moving so as to reduce this colossal burden <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the noble baronesss assurance about the response of the argentine government is she aware that an early day motion sponsored by back-bench supporters of the government is on the order paper in another place urging support for the type of action that i have suggested <e> <s> is the noble baroness aware also that in the foreign affairs debate which was held recently in another place prominent back-benchers of her own party suggested the course of action which i put to her in my question <e> <s> may i therefore ask the noble baroness whether in view of the financial implications the governments response to the argentine governments response will be urgent <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply but is he aware that the total financial responsibilities of these authorities taking into account current expenditure and capital expenditure or revenue are nearly billion <e> <s> in a day and age when people are asking for more say in their own affairs does he really think that these bodies should be able to meet in camera and take decisions about such sums which are actually public funds without the public and the press being aware of what the decision is about at the time it is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there was a meeting in another place between the chairman of the yorkshire water authority and a number of labour mps when the chairman categorically refused to allow the facility of open meetings and his excuse was that the people appointed to the board by the secretary of state were too inexperienced <e> <s> where do we go from there <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and in order to assist the house i shall be brief <e> <s> can the noble lord give an undertaking that the trade union movement will receive deep and sympathetic consideration in future proposals by way of their retaining rights that have been granted in the past by successive governments regarding this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that whatever analysis he places on the figures that have been given both by himself and by the noble lord lord stallard they will be seen by the general public at large to be nothing but a squalid attack by the government on some of the poorest people in our community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl the minister for his answer to the noble lords question and the information he has given <e> <s> is the noble earl aware of the broadcast this morning on radio in which a senior employee on the staff of shell stated that there are further considerable reserves of oil that can be developed in the north sea and in the shell zone of the north sea but that of course the costs of exploration and of getting the oil will be a dearer and more expensive exercise than in the past <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he will impress on the government to bear this in mind and to give this industry further assistance if it is needed in order to keep the employment levels at what they are and if possible increase them through the downstream effects on engineering and other related industries <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister aware that for the government to expect this very serious subject to be dealt with on a voluntary basis is complete nonsense and that some of the good employers will respond while most of the others will not <e> <s> will the minister agree that any exercise on behalf of the disabled giving them increased employment opportunities will be meaningless till the existing general rates of unemployment are reduced dramatically <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl the minister whether he will take this opportunity to disabuse people of the widespread belief that the mining industry in this country is at present feather-bedded to a greater extent than our chief competitors in europe <e> <s> is it not a fact that british coal is the cheapest produced among that of our main competitors in europe and also carries a far lower subsidy than is the case with any of those competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back to the minister but the latest figures available were given in another place in and they confirm the impression that i have given namely that we are the producers of the cheapest coal among the main coal-producing countries in europe and that our industry in fact receives a far lower subsidy per tonne of coal than any of our competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether in the figures she gave and an increase of that dimension is something of a success story there is any variation in waiting times in the different regions of the country bearing in mind that in leeds people are being confined to wheel chairs while they wait for this operation <e> <s> if there is a regional variation will she look at it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> is she not aware of the growing concern about the slowness of real and meaningful negotiations starting <e> <s> can the noble baroness tell the house whether the slowness of those negotiations getting off the ground is in any way retarding the governments redevelopment programme for the islands <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that having the redevelopment programme take place in the present climate of disagreement is placing an intolerable burden on the taxpayers of this country <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the sooner negotiations start and some agreement is made the sooner this financial burden may be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer and like all members of this house i welcome the fact that the unemployment figures showed a fall last month <e> <s> but the minister must be aware of the answer given by the secretary of state in another place yesterday when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords in an earlier reply the noble lord the minister referred to the major factor in the present unemployment situation as being the world recession <e> <s> he also disagreed with me on the second part of my supplementary question regarding <e>", "<cs> may i briefly say that the noble lord the minister in his reply in effect has said trust the government they will look after the situation <e> <s> although i know that the present amendment and the government proposals refer to scotland they embrace a far wider field than that <e> <s> we have had similar arguments concerning proposals originating in england <e> <s> the minister is saying we will look at the situation and we will decide <e> <s> we think that we can come to a more equitable <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to lengthen this debate but i should like to put a brief question to the minister <e> <s> with his long experience in local government he will be aware that in the past where financial allocations have been made to various authorities if there has been a low take-up in some areas another authority which can prove the need for resources has been able to apply for them and use them <e> <s> obviously they kept the government within the global sum which the government considered unexpended <e> <s> i do not think anybody would argue that the needs of all the constituent authorities in the united kingdom are the same <e> <s> it is not even arguable that the inner-city areas of london and other big cities need much greater funding than other areas <e> <s> could i ask the minister to consider the possibility i do not ask him necessarily to answer just now where there has been a proven need as time goes by of the bar on the penalties of certain authorities being lifted <e> <s> because we are talking about a three or four-year period perhaps he might consider the need to lift that bar on the basis that it may be money which would have been allocated to somebody else anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware of the report which appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble minister not aware that in areas such as greater manchester and wigan and the leigh area where pits have previously closed unemployment has increased further under this government and they have almost become no-hope areas <e> <s> the question is about alternative employment <e> <s> what are the government going to do about this <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that answer <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister not aware however that i have information from leeds city council which shows that in the case of people who have purchased airey houses from leeds city council and of course this follows on a national basis the imposition of vat on the structural measures needed to bring those houses to standard will increase the cost of remedial treatment by per house <e> <s> may i ask whether on that basis <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord the minister a little further <e> <s> is he aware of the figures given during the debate in another place by the honourable member for manchester central on the second reading of the housing defects bill which showed the appalling sum of money which manchester would have to find to correct structural defects in its housing stock <e> <s> i think that it is in excess of million <e> <s> is the minister saying that that money on his statement today will not be liable to vat <e> <s> if that is what he is saying it will be well accepted if not it will be deplored <e>", "<cs> where my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord the minister accepts too readily the congratulations of the noble lord lord rodney at the increase from per cent <e> <s> in to per cent <e> <s> in could he possibly tell the house how this compares with our industrial competitors in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that rather unhelpful reply but may i ask the noble earl whether he is aware as i am sure he will be that double glazing installed in domestic property produces a saving in heating costs of approximately per cent <e> <s> or upwards <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that on the basis of present figures the introduction of vat on ist june will increase the cost per house depending on the type of job done by between and <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that will be a disincentive to people to involve themselves in double glazing and that it will cut across the very policy that the government have on energy conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that in one of his answers today he referred to loft insulation and cavity wall filling <e> <s> is he aware that by combining those two with double glazing there can be a per cent <e> <s> saving on heating bills and energy costs <e> <s> is the saving not so significant that it ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that despite his answers the prospects under this government of adequate housing for the homeless are being reduced quite dramatically from the point of view of accommodation and also social security payments <e> <s> when are the government going to bring in measures to reverse this trend <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the answers that the noble lord the minister has given to the previous questions may i ask him whether he is aware of the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak briefly in this debate in accordance with the time schedule that has been set and i rise to speak not about the second bill that will be before us in the next session but about the exercise that is being commenced today <e> <s> i wish to put my point of view <e> <s> however it is masked this is a gross interference with the democratic processes of this country <e> <s> i am a born democrat and a convinced democrat like i think or at least i hope the overwhelming majority of noble members of this house <e> <s> what we are seeing here is an attempt by the government to interfere with the rule of the ballot box <e> <s> if democracy does not mean the rule of this country at various levels and by various types of authorities by the ballot box then it does not mean anything <e> <s> that in my view is one of the most dangerous propositions that is before us today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister not aware that there is the possibility that firecracker in terms of future job prospects and exports may not be the best choice <e> <s> can i ask the noble lord the minister to give an undertaking that the question of jobs and future exports and increasing or retaining jobs because of the present unemployment level will be one of the paramount reasons or considerations when the government do make their decision on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl the minister agree that any type of work-sharing among people would have only a minimal effect on the appalling unemployment that there is among young people today <e> <s> could the noble earl give any indication at all as to whether there is any reason to look forward with any optimism to the situation changing or to the governments policies which are subscribing to this situation being altered <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply but is it not a fact that one conclusion transcends any other in these figures namely that the plight of the long-term unemployed continues to increase both in depth and numbers <e> <s> is it not a fact that apart from the young people employed in youth employment training schemes anybody at present being made unemployed has a far greater chance of joining those long-term unemployed figures than was the case months ago <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl the minister not recall telling me last week that political decisions do not make jobs and employment <e> <s> will he have regard to what has taken place since last thursday in this country bearing in mind that most responsible people accept the view that per cent <e> <s> of present unemployment in this country is a direct result of government policies <e> <s> is it not time for the government to review their policies in their own interests in view of the election results that are now coming through <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak to this amendment because with amendment no <e> <s> in my name and that of my two noble friends the end product would be the same in its effect on the bill <e> <s> i rise with some diffidence because as a lifelong trade unionist myself i find what is proposed in this particular clause to be totally unacceptable <e> <s> during proceedings in another place the secretary of state and the minister of state referred to the fact that they were not putting the trade unions in a straitjacket <e> <s> but i believe it was only last week when the secretary of state announced there would be further amendments brought before your lordships to be dealt with at committee stage here that the minister used the word straitjacket and it is obvious that the government intend completely to tighten the straitjacket <e> <s> it is not lightly accepted when we hear some noble lords on the other side talking as though they had support for trade unionism in general when they really mean that they are like the person who believes in acrobats and circus performers so long as they can perform in a straitjacket and with leg irons on <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord campbell of alloway said that certain officers of trade unions appointed under the system with which he does not agree may have behaved badly in the past or may behave badly in the future <e> <s> we shall look at <e>", "<cs> i will do so <e> <s> i am merely pointing out that the noble earl himself introduced the question of company law into a trade union bill <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble earl cannot set the rules to suit himself <e> <s> he did introduce company law into an amendment earlier in this section of the bill which was not dealing with company law <e> <s> i think i am entitled to draw a comparison <e> <s> he referred of course to mr sidney weighell the ex-member of the nur as though he were talking about somebody who would be a friend to all of us on this bill <e> <s> i do not know how mr sidney weighell came to be elected to the general secretaryship of the nur but i know that his resignation was precipitated by his doing some of the very things for which the noble earl is criticising other people <e> <s> so he cannot have the argument both ways in my opinion <e>", "<cs> i listened with great care to what the noble lord lord howie said when he moved the amendment <e> <s> it is a very important amendment concerning some of the smaller unions and the way they amalgamate on a small scale more like an association <e> <s> i think that those trade unions who through their members want to do this ought to be able to proceed in this manner to have their elections to certain positions <e> <s> then if their rules comply with this bill they can proceed to elect their executive councils from those people who man the bodies that have already been subjected to the restrictions of this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i am sorry that he does not accept the amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that the two words in the bill cover the wide spectrum of people involved in these large unions <e> <s> certainly nobody involved in what you could call a trade union could lightly assume that because they are a member of a trade union they are in fact carrying out a craft because they are not <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to the activities or the responsibilities of shop stewards under this bill <e> <s> i think he ought to be aware that under this part of the bill the shop stewards if they have any responsibilities <e> <s> will have them taken from them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is making some rather oblique assertions and accusations <e> <s> would he substantiate them <e> <s> finally would he get on to the amendment on the marshalled list <e>", "<cs> it is about time <e>", "<cs> the noble lord would rather smear <e>", "<cs> of course it is <e>", "<cs> you are smearing people <e> <s> give the facts <e>", "<cs> unpaid <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that on the basis of the figures he has given the proportion of seats in total held by local authority representatives is far too low in a democratic society <e> <s> will he not consider approaching the secretary of state in this regard to see whether the boards could be enlarged in order to make more places available for representatives of local government at various levels <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer he has just given to my noble friend will the noble viscount the minister make himself aware of the fact that the oecd report which has been issued in the last few hours casts grave doubts on the question of a sustained economic recovery <e> <s> there is quite a serious note of pessimism in it <e> <s> bearing this in mind can the noble viscount the minister tell us when the ever-increasing pool of long-term unemployed in this country can look to better future job prospects so that they can leave the dole queues <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount the minister seriously saying when there is a considerable number of long-term unemployed in each months figures that can be termed as containing the situation <e> <s> surely that is a misuse of the english language <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble baroness lady jeger and spoken to by the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> some of the figures are too selective when one looks at unemployment in the general sense <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock suggested that ought to be added to those in receipt of long-term supplementary benefit <e> <s> but there is a minimum of million unemployed people in this country <e> <s> i am not suggesting that the should be deducted from the million <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilmarnock was not referring to those aged between and who probably form a substantial part of the total of million <e> <s> it is safe to assume that this leaves million to /million people adrift and drawing unemployment benefit <e>", "<cs> i should like to press the noble lord further in respect of the figure he used of million as being the cost of some of the provisions for which we have asked <e> <s> how does he consider million extra spent on the unemployed of this country would compare with the monolithic sums of money which the government have found to ensure the quality of life of the falkland islanders <e> <s> is there something different about the unemployed citizens of this country are they second-rate citizens by comparison <e>", "<cs> i am bound to tell the noble lord the government chief whip that shall i find it extremely difficult to finish the case on behalf of six million trade unionists by oclock <e> <s> i can assure the government chief whip that this is not a filibuster <e>", "<cs> i do not think that is possible <e> <s> i would rather come back another day <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl not aware that the ilo as a body has condemned this government for the second time for breaching agreements to which this country has for a long time been a signatory <e> <s> is this not a strange action from a government whose members from the prime minister downwards constantly talk about the right of the individual and the right of people to have their rights in a democratic society <e> <s> is this not a complete and absolute example of a government deciding on their own basis what they want to do in defiance of agreements previously entered into <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that the way that the noble lord lord annan put the point regarding the industrial dispute being the reason for this is complete nonsense <e> <s> if he had been present during the debate on the unstarred question on this dispute he would realise that it was only a small part of the explanation given by the government as the reason for their action <e> <s> may i ask theminister as i understand it he was the minister <e>", "<cs> there is possibly some slight confusion in this matter <e> <s> it does not follow that the only uncontested election is one where there has been only one nominee <e> <s> if that were the case the noble lords argument would be indisputable <e> <s> there have been a number of occasions as there will be in the future where there has been more than one nomination <e> <s> i am saying that if under the existing rules of that union of two nominations one is declared out of order in accordance with the rules of that union it shall be deemed to have been an uncontested election and shall not be liable for court action <e> <s> could the noble lord look at the second point i have made <e> <s> i have no desire to waste the time of the committee by pressing the amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the offer which has been made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl comes to the box to reply or to speak again i should like him to tell us something about one particular matter <e> <s> in an earlier contribution to this debate on whether the <e>", "<cs> may i seek the guidance of your lordships <e> <s> i should obviously like to speak to amendment no <e> <s> because it has the same effect and carries the same message as the other amendment <e> <s> i should like to join in on this debate if that is the normal procedure <e>", "<cs> in rising to speak to amendment no <e> <s> i should also like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> in view of what the noble and learned lord has said i should like briefly to come back to this point <e> <s> the bill when it becomes an act will imply that the fact that you vote in a postal ballot means that under the law you have voted <e> <s> perhaps the noble and learned lord lord denning will tell me what he means when he says that a person may vote by postal ballot and be interfered with <e> <s> what does he mean <e> <s> i am assuming that the act will say that if the person gets the postal vote fills in the ballot form and puts it in the post box the trade union will have total immunity if that action is carried through <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord lord denning saying that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to delay the committee but i was a little surprised by the stone wall we met from the secretary of state based on the contribution of the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> i would have thought that there was some case made for taking a look at this situation to establish whether there was any way in which the desires of the opposition could be met <e>", "<cs> other than with a particular amendment which may have been desired i do not know in another place <e> <s> the point i am trying to make is that noble lords would be wrong to proceed with this bill on the premise that the overwhelming number of trade unionists to whom we are supposed to be returning the unions welcome every measure in this bill <e> <s> quite a lot of trade unionists may have some reservations about the behaviour of some of their leaders in the past and may have some reservations about their behaviour at present but if noble lords proceed on the premise that everything that they do in this chamber on the advice of law lords or others is welcomed with open arms by the overwhelming number of trade unionists outside then they are <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i think that the reply of the noble lord the minister to both myself and my colleague lord mccarthy is totally unsatisfactory <e> <s> i can only assume that he does not understand what is being said <e> <s> i am a member of the second biggest union in this country <e> <s> it relies totally on the branch meeting <e> <s> no nomination from any other body is valid other than from our executive council unless it starts life in the branch <e> <s> from the branch it has to go to the district committee to see whether it is in order at district level and from there it is forwarded to the executive council of the aeu <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord that this union which is one of the biggest unions with over million members so far as i am aware does not call special meetings on the basis of discussing political nominations and support for political candidates <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his answer <e> <s> on the basis of his response and because of the time i seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble minister for that reply <e> <s> does it not indicate that in the timescale that he has quoted <e>", "<cs> my lords while taking account of the points that the minister has made in reply to various questions may i ask him whether he is aware that as a result of the economic situation and of unemployment among men in innumerable households the woman has become the breadwinner <e> <s> despite the figures that he has given the number of women becoming unemployed is increasing substantially <e> <s> does he not appreciate that where this happens and the woman who is the breadwinner is made unemployed we are creating on a still increasing scale families of despair <e> <s> when is this going to alter <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that the political positions are related solely to another place as a legislative assembly <e> <s> are they related solely to that and not included in the provisions of this bill <e> <s> if that is the case i will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay your lordships any longer <e> <s> if the noble minister is saying that the present procedures are accepted and that there will only be a violation of those if meetings are held specifically or funds are used specifically for candidatures of those particular types of positions that i have highlighted in my amendment i shall obviously beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my colleagues and i have given notice that we wish to oppose the question that this clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it would be quite spurious to refer to the amendments that have been debated as regards this clause because i want to debate the main thrust of the clause <e> <s> while we would say that part i and part ii of the bill are motivated against the trade union movement we think that this clause is a total attack upon the main opposition party <e> <s> we do not see it as anything else however it is presented <e>", "<cs> to be brief there may be a difference on some of the points of argument between my own party and the liberal party but at least there is some measure of agreement on the question of how the noble earl interprets the way in which companies act <e> <s> he has probably conveniently forgotten the large sums of money expended by the cement lobby the building trades lobby and the sugar lobby in order to <e>", "<cs> i indicated when i started to speak on clause stand part that we were opposed to the clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> therefore we divide the house on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that if the government cut off funds immediately as suggested by the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne the total withdrawal of government support now may well prevent certification being obtained which of course is crucial to the whole future of the project <e> <s> would the noble viscount use his best endeavours with her majestys government to deal with this very carefully before taking any such tragic decision because of the high levels of unemployment in that province <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his response <e> <s> he said that he would deal with the amendment in two parts and i am grateful to him for his response to the first part <e> <s> however when we debated this amendment a couple of weeks ago my main thrust was that inherent in the proposals was the fact that we could see the day coming very soon when a tribunal of three is drawn up with no trade union representative on it <e> <s> that is the major reason for the amendment and as far as i am cncerned that is the most damaging part of this clause <e> <s> on that basis i do not think that the minister has gone far enough <e> <s> because the government are altering what has become custom and practice i am bound to say that i want to divide the committee and i so move <e>", "<cs> i wish to be brief <e> <s> my amendment was specifically designed to retain the historical right and role that the trade unions have had under the old system of the two sets of appeal panels from which the tribunals were drawn <e> <s> my amendment is designed to convey that custom and

noble baroness lady gardner of parkes on her winding up speech on behalf of the government <e> <s> i do not think there is much left for the noble lord lord glenarthur to say <e> <s> however i propose to speak on a much narrower front during my few minutes and i do not thinki shall detain the house as long as did the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble minister whether there is a regional imbalance in the supply of consultants in this particular category between the regions in the north and the regions in the south <e> <s> can he also tell the house whether there are any regions in the south of england where there has been a surplus of consultants in this category that has resulted in redundancies <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly may i ask the noble minister if he might care to write to me after investigation to see if there have been any redundancies among this category of consultant in some of the southern regions <e> <s> i have been told that there have been but i have not definite proof <e> <s> but it seems a serious case of imbalance if that is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord the minister aware that not only has sir kenneth newman drawn that conclusion but that numerous other chief constables in the united kingdom have also made the observation that where unemployment has risen the crime rate has risen accordingly <e> <s> would the noble lord the minister not agree that if the government were to institute policies which included launching a sustained attack on the ever-growing numbers of long-term unemployed that would have a beneficial effect and would reduce the crime rate <e>", "<cs> my lords may i then take it that the noble lord the minister is saying that the numerous chief constables who hold that belief are wrong <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving way <e> <s> he must be aware that two of those ex-ministers have just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord wedderburn for the way he has spoken to these amendments and the way he introduced the two with which i shall be briefly dealing <e> <s> earlier in the proceedings today the noble lord lord houghton made the comment that there was a lack of grass-root trade union opinion and views in this house <e> <s> for my sins perhaps i can claim still to be the nearest to that point of view and to bring in that knowledge having been a shop steward until i became a member of another place just ten years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that it must have a bearing on next years financial agreements could the noble minister tell us what really happened in the settlement between the government and the liverpool city council <e> <s> did the government suffer a humiliating defeat as printed in militant tendencys newspaper or was an accommodation reached under agreed criteria <e> <s> if the settlement was reached on the latter basis would the same criteria be afforded to the local authorities in manchester leeds and sheffield in order to avoid any confrontation in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister finally sits down may i press him and ask him whether he is aware that in the press over the weekend there have been two projections <e> <s> one is that there will be a moratorium on local government spending for the next financial year <e> <s> secondly in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support the point that has just been made by my noble friend lord glenamara and by the two previous speakers <e> <s> i think it should be made quite clear that not all the members who retired before receive that sum of <e> <s> whether such a member receives it depends on a strict means test and some receive nothing which is the insulting part about it <e> <s> in this day and age if we cannot put that right there is something entirely churlish about our society and i hope that this issue will be looked at as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that on each occasion when the question of gchq has been raised in the chamber from this side of the house it has been raised by me <e> <s> as recently as a fortnight ago i brought to the notice of the government that they had been found guilty by a committee of the ilo of breaking agreements to which we have been long-time signatories <e> <s> they have now been found guilty at present though the appeal may decide otherwise of being in breach of the law of this country <e> <s> does this not appear to be a case where the government are in agreement with the referee so long as he always blows the whistle in their favour <e> <s> i would urge the noble viscount who i know is a fair-minded man that the best way to resolve this situation is not in the courts but by arriving at an agreed solution with the trade unionists involved <e> <s> that would avoid the appalling damage that would linger for a long time if the matter were decided in the courts in an adverse manner to those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> although at present the country is beset by a variety of very difficult problems such as the dispute in the mining industry and gchq is it not a fact that the main problem facing us as a society is the unacceptable high level of unemployment that continues to increase despite what the minister says although possibly at a slower rate <e> <s> is the minister not aware of the utter despair that is now felt in some families who look upon the situation with no hope <e> <s> is he really saying that when i start to question him as i hope to do in november in the next session of parliament we shall still be facing the same future of despair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for the announcement he made a few minutes ago about the increasing number of people in work <e> <s> but is it not a fact that the number of people who were added to the long-term unemployed total over the same period exceeded that figure <e> <s> so what comfort is there in it for them <e> <s> of course we are glad of the increased number of jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that if one goes back to the statistics regarding infantile deaths in the period before the last local government reorganisation when the medical officers of health for the local authorities used to submit their annual reports one sees that the horrendous figures for infantile deaths then arose mainly from the overcrowded and deprived areas of the inner cities <e>

henderson in his persistence in raising this question <e> <s> it is three months since he raised it last time <e> <s> i commend the msc on its progress towards producing a code of conduct perhaps on a quota basis <e> <s> is it also not a fact that over the last few years history has shown that unless we make the proposals mandatory on employers their response will not be as generous as noble lords in this house would wish <e> <s> would the minister not also agree that unless there is a substantial increase in the economic situation as a whole with a corresponding reduction in unemployment in general quotas or even mandatory proposals on behalf of the disabled in this country regarding unemployment would mean very little <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is also true that the results of the european elections only confirm what people voted for in the previous general election <e> <s> of the major party groupings the party which the electors of this country least want is the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join in thanking the noble lord for repeating the statement that was made in another place <e> <s> during the course of the statement the noble lord said that later they would be having the usual consultations with the local authorities and their associations <e> <s> based on what has been said today i would suggest that there is very little to consult about because in this case it appears that the local authorities are faced with a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he be prepared to give us some information on the order of batting of the two authorities that i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment so eloquently moved by my noble friend and colleague lord stallard <e> <s> it is always easy to stand up and say i told you so but i believe that in another place i raised the first warnings about the situation that the nation was in through the use of system building <e> <s> the first move towards compensating people who had purchased houses from their local authority and then found themselves left with albatrosses occurred in another place <e> <s> in order to appease one of their back-benchers the last conservative government two years ago brought in the airey house order which provided for financial assistance to be given for repair or remedial work to people who had bought airey houses from their local authority <e> <s> on that occasion i initiated a debate in another place on the problem we were then experiencing and i said that the problem was surfacing <e> <s> what was being dealt with was only the smallest tip of a gigantic iceberg which would surface with frightening rapidity <e> <s> that has been borne out by subsequent events <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i ever had a reputation in another place or in this place for long speeches <e> <s> i did not speak in the second reading debate because of the number of people involved and the time factor and i did not speak at the further stages but i am bound to say that i may take a little longer than normal to develop my case <e> <s> that whole kernel of what the bill is not about or what ought to be included is contained in the amendment in the names of the noble lord lord stallard myself and my other noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the stock answer that the noble earl the minister has just given but is he not aware as i am sure he must be that since million people have been classed as long-term unemployed and that that figure is still growing month by month <e> <s> is he also aware that within that figure per cent <e> <s> have been unemployed for over two years and per cent <e> <s> for over three years <e> <s> does he not understand that these people view themselves as now becoming engulfed in a reservoir of despair or as the dust bowl of society <e> <s> when are we going to get some answers from the minister other than the stock ones that he uses to upbraid us in this chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i did not use the word dustbin i used the words dust bowl <e> <s> one can understand that situation only if one has actually stood in a dole queue recently and experienced the despair which those people face <e> <s> they do not see any future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for the constructive and informative manner in which he has introduced this order <e> <s> before i became a peer and was sent to this house when i was a member in another place i was a person employed in general engineering <e> <s> because of belonging to that particular industry i am as aware as probably most peers and perhaps better informed on the subject of the rundown in skilled apprenticeships in that particular industry <e>", "<cs> my lords may i with leave briefly ask the minister something <e> <s> just to illustrate the importance that i and other noble lords place on apprenticeship training i was rated as a highly skilled man in my job <e> <s> i left the industry years ago <e> <s> if i were to re-enter it now i would no doubt find it a strange new world <e> <s> that is why i think this type of activity is so important <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount not agree that under the law as it stands there is a great contradiction in that a member of a trade union could be paying a political levy from choice yet could be employed by a company that was formerly nationalised and is now privatised and he may have to pay donations to the conservative party not from choice <e> <s> therefore under present legislation he could be paying to the two main parties one from choice and the other not from choice <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all join with the noble lords lord henderson and lord renton in the best wishes that they have conveyed to the noble earl on his promotion to cabinet rank <e> <s> there is no question but that after the disappointing employment figures that have recently been issued he will be ever more in the firing line <e> <s> i also commend the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i commence by expressing my congratulations to my noble friend lord brimelow and to the members of his committee on the very full and comprehensive report which they have submitted on this very delicate subject <e> <s> having said that i think i part company with every preceding speaker because i have to say from the start that i am totally opposed to the eec becoming involved in this type of matter in this country <e> <s> various speakers have said and it is of course true that we have had a first draft report a second draft report and only this week a third draft report <e> <s> not being a member of this very distinguished committee i have to say that my knowledge of the individual components and mass of detail in that report is not as great as that of other noble lords but i wonder whether this will be followed by a fourth draft a fifth draft and a sixth draft <e> <s> i do not really know <e> <s> i have made extensive inquiries as to what the changes really mean <e> <s> all that comes back to me is that in principle the changes mean very little that we are almost back to where we started but that we will give the commission the right to adjudicate without using percentages and they will be the referee on all occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be so in that respect but i said i had a preference <e> <s> what i am pointing out is this <e> <s> is it the wish of the noble lord lord bethell that we should hand over our future <e> <s> lock stock and barrel to europe for it to determine all our future policies on everything <e> <s> there was today a question on spain and portugal coming into europe and on whether or not we should support that <e> <s> bearing in mind the additional cost that it would inflict on us yet again i should be totally opposed to that too <e> <s> i may possibly be the only speaker apart from the main opposition speaker who will speak against this motion but i hope that if and when these proposals come forward members in another place and noble lords will for a change in european terms think of britain first and vote them down with an adamant no <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that some of it is open now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and for the information about what i would regard as the further minor measures that are being taken to advance the training of young people <e> <s> but is the minister not aware that unless the government change quite forcefully their present financial and economic policy the training of these young people will be a waste of time and that only such a change of direction by the government in their present policies can alter the present appalling situation and deterioration in job prospects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that information but would the minister not agree that really at the best that is in some respects the provision of more seed corn for our industry <e> <s> how does he expect that additional seed corn to flourish in an industrial desert that is substantially the creation of the governments present policies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not agree that while no one would condone activities or industrial action that create hardship at the sharp end this problem has its roots in the fact that the present government two or three years ago quite arbitrarily abrogated long-standing agreements with the civil service unions over this type of employee involvement <e> <s> that is where the roots of the dispute lie <e> <s> had we kept to those agreements there would be no need to involve acas <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl agree that the previous speakers suggestion that the administration of education can be divorced from local government is nonsense bearing in mind that all of the local authorities outside the greater london area have the responsibility of looking after the education of the people in those areas <e> <s> is the minister aware that that is an accepted fact <e> <s> those of us with a history in local government were always taught that there were three political forces in local government conservative <e> <s> labour and the education lobby <e> <s> i think <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and i await with interest the figures that he is going to circulate <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the figures he has just given indicate quite clearly the devastation and destruction that has happened to our manufacturing base as a manufacturing nation over that particular period <e> <s> would he not also agree that a far better use could have been made of the huge sums of money from our north sea oil revenues <e> <s> that money would have been better used for investment into our manufacturing base to retain jobs rather than being distributed not needlessly but in a way that was no use whatsoever in an objective sense in the creation of jobs in unemployment and related social benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret coming back to the dispatch box so soon but i think that it is accepted that in the search for more jobs the service sector will have to take a larger percentage of people into employment in order to have some effect on the dole queue <e> <s> however the main area for provision will once again be the manufacturing sector <e> <s> the minister would do well to look at the figures and say whether the government have any ideas when they will increase the per cent <e> <s> investment into a more realistic figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however would the noble lord agree that the figures that he has just given indicate that the number of people who will be out of work in the long term is still showing a substantial and dangerous increase <e> <s> would the minister care to predict when he expects this reservoir of despair to begin to reduce <e> <s> while i accept the measures that the government have taken to attempt to alleviate unemployment which the noble lord announced in answer to another question last week is he aware that the lifebelt being thrown to people in this pool of despair is nowhere sufficient <e> <s> when can we expect some additional measures of an urgent nature to deal with this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that as regards the figures that have been quoted today the biggest single tragedy occurs at the top end of the age scale where there are becoming unemployed an increasing number of people who may never work again <e> <s> if further resources are to be made available will the noble lord use his good offices within her majestys government to consider allocating some of those resources to that group in order to make their permanent unemployment more bearable <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the interests of the water authorities would be far better served by opening up their meetings to the press the public and the media instead of insisting upon meeting in secret and in camera as they do at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> i should like to make him aware of the fact that he and the government will have the support of most noble lords i hope in restricting any extension of the imposition of vat on any sector of the building industry <e> <s> is the minister aware that if vat was imposed on new construction it would have the effect of completely cutting across the governments policy and intentions for regenerating and refurbishing our decaying inner-city areas such as those in london manchester and leeds <e> <s> i hope the government will dig in their toes because of the adverse effect such an imposition would have also on the unemployment situation which presently exists in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to press the minister further <e> <s> i am talking not only about new housing i am also talking about development in a general sense <e> <s> will he turn his mind just for a moment and if possible give us some figures on this to what adverse effect the imposition of vat would have on unemployment in the building sector <e> <s> would it mean that a further or people would join the dole queue to suit the commission of the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but he must be aware that nobody in the building industry outside will believe what he said that they are to benefit from the chancellors statement <e> <s> is the minister aware of the policy <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the ministers reply that various organisations views have been taken into account those mentioned by both the noble earl himself and the noble lord lord howie of troon is it not clear that the government are standing in splendid isolation on this issue <e> <s> if they should decide to do something positive may i urge the minister to do it as a matter of urgency before the building industry haemorrhages to death <e>", "<cs> my lords let me commence by thanking the noble lord lord balfour and complimenting him on the remarks that he made in his speech <e> <s> it is obvious when he looked back to his earlier days in the political arena that he was comparing what is happening today with some of those very difficult years in the early s <e> <s> i for my sins am old enough to remember those and i think he spoke from the heart <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> i did not mean to convey the impression that i thought expansion into the public sector was a cure for all ills <e> <s> i believe it is the quickest way of providing some relief but it would only be part of a package <e> <s> when i spoke of a / split between the international recession and government policies my point was that some aspects of the public sector have suffered literally thousands of jobs being wiped out because of the withdrawal of government finance from local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for correcting that slight error and for repeating the statement made in another place by the secretary of state for employment <e> <s> however it appears a bit odd to me that this statement had to be made at all today <e> <s> this time yesterday up to oclock we were involved in a debate on unemployment and this fact was known had been made available to the press and was embargoed i think for oclock <e> <s> i make no accusations against lord belstead for whom i have the greatest respect but i think if it was made public at that time it ought to have been made known here and it might have saved us this exercise today <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly ask the minister before he sits down whether he would care to comment on that part of my question in which i stated that the tuc the cbi and other organisations had expressed the opinion that both the packages put together would further increase unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister tell the members of this house what it would cost to take one child into care if these payments were not made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the prime reason why these wages councils were originally set up years ago was the appalling and disgracefully low wages that were paid in the catering sector to such people as waiters bar staff and cleaners <e> <s> the rates paid in those days were compared with today totally unacceptable <e> <s> i urge the minister to press the government to think long and hard and to refuse to pursue the policy suggested by the noble lord who tabled this question because it can only be a reverting back to wages that none of us would deem suitable to pay to anyone <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say first that i am grateful to the minister for the sympathetic manner in which he has introduced the regulations <e> <s> i am also grateful of course for the increased amounts contained within them <e> <s> these are very acceptable <e> <s> i fulfilled this role about the same time last year <e> <s> it may be that there will be a repeat performance by myself or someone else next year <e> <s> i know that the minister because of his thoroughness and assiduity will have taken the trouble to read the proceedings of the statutory instruments committee that dealt with this subject on behalf of and in another place <e>", "<cs> it was not the bill that was opposed we were talking about three votes on something else which eventually did not matter anyway because the government fell <e> <s> i hope i have put the record right <e> <s> it seems a little garbled but that is what actually took place <e> <s> i think the bill had almost total support itself in another place at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister find that surprising bearing in mind that the fears raised by the statement that was made in august have been borne out and it is bearing fruit in the sense that there is a genuine reduction in building activity and in the business related to it as well as increasing unemployment in the building trade sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister how he relates that to the fact that in there were bankruptcies or liquidations in the building sector and that so far this year in the months the figure is <e> <s> that represents an increase of nearly per cent <e> <s> in bankruptcies and liquidations in the building industry <e> <s> how on earth can he relate that to increased activity <e> <s> are not he and the government suffering from a large dose of self-hypnosis in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when the bill to force local authorities to sell council houses was in another place i was the whip on the committee <e> <s> one of the main excuses given by the government at that time for the forced sale of council houses was the revenue which that would raise to enable local authorities to conduct their own policies and it was said that they could use the money to build new council houses and refurbish their stock <e> <s> will the minister now tell us why the government have so disgracefully and outrageously reneged on that promise <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that that is like having money in the bank and the bank manager refusing to honour any cheques <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the ill-feeling and distrust that was generated and displayed in another place yesterday over the governments action to halve the amount of money being allowed back to local authorities from their own capital receipts will the minister give an undertaking now that the billion which has been raised by the sale of public assets by local authorities will remain untouched and will not be used by the chancellor of the exchequer to lower taxes in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i am afraid that i have to challenge the ruling of the noble viscount <e> <s> the question is about the sale of public assets <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not out of order <e> <s> will the minister answer my question <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all may i express my appreciation to the noble lord lord belstead for the very sympathetic and detailed way in which he has moved this order today <e> <s> he will know that when this was debated in another place on tuesday more than an hour was spent on it <e> <s> i can assure noble lords who are present here today that i do not intend to take anything like that much time on it <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i express once again my appreciation to the minister for the way he has presented these three orders in his usual courteous and very informative manner <e> <s> however i have to strike a little sour note on the question of availability of the material the time factor <e> <s> i am not criticising the minister by any means but i always think that in this place being a second chamber when these statutory instruments and orders are first placed we ought to have a little time to study what is behind the governments thinking from what is said in <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that detailed reply because the question is a difficult one to answer <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he agrees that those figures indicate that the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the minister whether he is aware that the figures he produced are very similar to those that i received as a result of research in the library <e> <s> they show that the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister be more specific about whether the government intend to allow any companies to remain nationalised bearing in mind their present policy of disposing of very valuable publicly-owned assets <e> <s> if the government continue with that policy at the same speed this whole question may become totally irrelevant in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether the editorial in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give a copper-bottomed undertaking that the substantial sums of money which belong to the local authorities will not be used by the chancellor of the exchequer in the future to effect a further cut in income tax which appears to be the only policy he has at present <e> <s> may i further ask what in global terms are the financial sums involved in the cut from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> this year <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that one of the major areas of conflict at this point in time is that between her majestys government and the local authorities with the shameful rate-capping legislation may i ask the noble earl the minister what effect the dramatic increases in borrowing rates referred to in his last two announcements will have on the amount that local authorities have to repay on their loan debt charges <e> <s> i have in mind that as i understand it todays announcement will mean that in order to cope with the situation the city of birmingham for instance may well have to find a sum of million without any extra spending and that leeds may have to find about million to million without extra spending <e> <s> can the noble earl give an undertaking that if that is the case it will be taken into account in the rate-capping process <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> would the minister not agree that however those figures are massaged or presented they show a further serious deterioration in the employment situation in this country which cannot be dismissed by such phraseology as was used by the prime minister in another place last week when she referred to a disappointment <e> <s> the secretary of state for employment i understand also used the same description <e> <s> when is the situation going to alter and the present trend be reversed bearing in mind of course that it is obvious that such measures as have been taken so far by the government are not sufficient to alter the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> but as a matter of urgency will he ask the government to make mandatory those powers which at present are optional for local authorities <e> <s> he must know that since people have died in houses in multiple occupation or properties that could be described as such some of them in quite horrendous circumstances <e> <s> is the minister also aware that most of the national organisations of repute which deal with housing are firmly of the opinion that it is now time to introduce mandatory legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i for one among many others am grateful to the government for this debate taking place <e> <s> i take part in the debate as i think other noble lords do on the basis that the government will take note of what is being said <e> <s> noble lords and members of another place where this subject was debated extensively some weeks ago may take the view that this debate is just about the alterna <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves the question of vat part of the argument about the cowboy is that he evades vat <e> <s> but the main argument is that it has driven some of the industries related to the building industry such as double glazing almost to the wall <e> <s> small companies are going out of business by the dozen <e> <s> i see the noble earls colleague wagging his head but obviously he has not seen the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first of all express my appreciation to the minister for the way and the spirit in which he has moved this order <e> <s> i do not think there is much more that can be said on it <e> <s> i have perused <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that there are calculations which suggest that in global terms the increase in percentage rates which local authorities will have to pay means that between them the authorities will have to find between million and million for no additional services <e> <s> does the minister think that fair and just bearing in mind the fact that they have already had their resources severely cut by the government with resultant cuts in services <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that the ama which is a responsible body has produced figures which show that in real terms it will cost the local authorities the sums of money i have suggested <e> <s> i find it hard to reconcile the amas views of the matter with those of the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state in another place which he has done in his usual courteous manner <e> <s> however my praise stops there because i find nothing in the statement that gives me any comfort nor i think will it give any comfort to unemployed people in the country <e> <s> i should like to put some points to the noble lord and in view of the time factor i shall do so briefly <e>", "<cs> my lords i should briefly like to ask the minister if he would once again look at the major point that i made <e> <s> i am sure it was by accident that he missed dealing with it <e> <s> i should like to know what is meant by the reference in the statement that no individual closures will take place until satisfactory alternative provisions have been made <e> <s> what does that mean <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow up the question put by my noble friend on the front bench may i ask the minister whether there is any evidence to show that the employment of children outside this act in other words illegally is affecting the job prospects of children who are leaving school <e> <s> there appears to be evidence to support this suggestion <e> <s> if that is the case will the noble lord ask his honourable friend in another place to look at the situation as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back on this matter but may i make the point that the number of cases where this is going on is not being monitored because of the the lack of inspectors and that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether he is satisfied that when these proposals have borne fruit the needs of the armed forces the army and the navy will be met by the resulting companies in an emergency situation bearing in mind the sort of situation the government are now creating where profit and not need is the prime motive <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply but the noble lord must be aware that the answer which he has given will in no way be acceptable to the relatives of this lady to the people in that particular area and to the people at large

"<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask my supplementary question and then conclude <e> <s> is it not a fact that despite the convictions to which the noble lord has referred this terrible brutal and degrading crime is still on the increase <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether the government will now consider making rape a non-parolable crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask

so-called responsible press that the government may be considering a moratorium on those capital receipts <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he is aware that both local authority building departments and the private sector are of the strongest opinion that the cut from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> in the money being made available to local authorities from these capital receipts will result in further unemployment in the building sector which as i think the minister will agree has already been ravaged by unemployment <e> <s> the situation if this is carried out will further deteriorate <e> <s> may i also ask the noble earl whether as a matter of urgency he will go back to the secretary of state and the chancellor of the exchequer and see whether they will reconsider their decision and restore the amount to per cent <e> <s> to prevent this further unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i do not think that the minister has dealt with the question that i asked <e> <s> he must be aware since he has <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for introducing this northern ireland appropriation order <e> <s> i must apologise for the fact that i am speaking a little late in this debate <e> <s> i had put down a series of questions for written answer relating to the northern ireland assembly and received the

finally may i ask the minister this question <e> <s> is he not aware that despite all the precautions taken and the so-called severer sentences over the past decade the crime of rape has increased by per cent <e> <s> will he keep an open mind on the basis of making it a non-parolable offence in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply but is he aware that calculations are that last year in total householders in this country spent on building extensions and improvements

undertaking that this type of thing will be looked at with the utmost thoroughness in order to recoup such money at a time when local authorities are having their own money withheld from them which

national imbalance but a regional imbalance for the treatment of this very dangerous and serious disease <e> <s> and if there is shown to be an imbalance of any kind is it not the fact that it ought to be corrected urgently on a national basis <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put this to the minister <e> <s> if he said that the level of activity on this particular illness or disease would be at the prerogative of the district authority and dependent on the resources that they have allocated for this and for other uses and responsibilities that they have to carry out would this not indicate that depending upon geographical location there could be a different level of service all over the country <e> <s> does he really think this is desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords it would appear from the list of names that the minister has given from the people who were on this delegation and the interests they represented that there was nobody specifically representing the building industry from this country <e> <s> bearing in mind that in the developing countries some of our biggest success stories have happened by way of the building industry may i ask the minister why the building industry was excluded or would he ever consider it at any time <e>", "<cs> absolute rubbish my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with previous speakers in the appreciation they express to my noble friend and colleague lord barnett for initiating the debate <e> <s> i am certainly grateful for the opportunity to place on record in this chamber my appreciation to my noble friend lord murray for the quality and content of his maiden speech <e> <s> also as a life-long trade unionist of nearly years standing i wish to express my appreciation of the work that he put in during his stewardship as secretary of the tuc <e> <s> he had to contend with one of the most difficult periods for trade union public relations and their public image <e> <s> i think that he did extremely well in a difficult situation <e>", "<cs> rubbish my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he not agree that various independent outside bodies come to the definite conclusion that the government are understating the case <e> <s> will he confirm that if the government were using the same criteria as those they used when they took office we would be talking in terms of nearly / million people <e> <s> therefore why are the government indulging in this exercise and not presenting the real facts <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the article published in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am not someone who is invited to go on television or radio and that i have never used the term million unemployed <e> <s> however i am saying to the minister that the figures being presented do not in any way convey the truth of the situation <e> <s> when will the government give us the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord will forgive me for intervening but may i ask him why he has neglected to reply to the comments that were made by one of the few speakers from this side of the house the noble lord lord kagan whose record as a successful business entrepreneur stands comparison with that of anybody in this house <e> <s> why has the noble lord omitted to reply to him <e>", "<cs> my lords like previous speakers i should like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord colwyn for the manner in which he introduced this important bill <e> <s> we should place on record also our appreciation of a member of another place mr michael mcnair-wilson for introducing the bill in the first place <e> <s> i had some practical experience of complaints procedures before the health service was reorganised <e> <s> in fact i was the last deputy chairman of the old manchester executive council of health <e> <s> although that body at the time did not deal with hospitals it did deal with medical complaints <e> <s> i have to say now as i have said previously that one of the most difficult facets of complaints against medical people is getting colleagues who work alongside them to give critical evidence <e> <s> that is proved beyond doubt from my experience as chairman of a service committee at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords may i deal with that point briefly <e> <s> the minister has kindly said that the professional bodies would be consulted regarding the measures to be included <e> <s> do i take it from that that he will also include the particular organisation i mentioned cohse <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether any of the differential rates levied have been due to the fact that the government have changed the formula and criteria and ploughed money into conservative areas at the expense of labour ones <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house why the government continue with this fallacy of lowering wage rates at the bottom end of the scale among the poorest paid section of our community when in fact they are already lower-paid than most of their contemporaries in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first express appreciation like other noble lords to my noble friend lady fisher for introducing this debate on housing and the homeless <e> <s> this is in natural accord with her longstanding interest in the topic <e> <s> as my noble friend has herself stated she was a former chairman a distinguished one of birmingham housing committee <e> <s> our political careers appear to have progressed somewhat in tandem <e> <s> during the same period i was chairman of the housing committee of another large city having like birmingham severe housing problems <e> <s> that was manchester <e> <s> it is for these reasons that i speak today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but may i ask whether he is surprised at such a lack of reaction <e> <s> i put that question bearing in mind that in the past the group of eight which widely reflects the views of the building industry has normally been allowed a meeting with the chancellor of the exchequer prior to his budget but this year was fobbed off with the financial secretary to the treasury who did not even stay for the whole of the meeting <e> <s> is that the type of shabby treatment that the government ought to be meting out to one of our major industries <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house whether there are any figures to show that the situation has deteriorated since about a decade ago when the seebohm report was implemented <e> <s> as a result childrens departments that specialised in the care of children were absorbed into new huge social services departments <e> <s> has that not in fact created a deterioration in the service <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that along with other noble lords i await the report with interest and am pleased to hear that it will be forthcoming shortly <e> <s> bearing in mind that the figures just published show a further increase in unemployment by about despite the rosy predictions of an economic recovery would he like to tell this house how he believes those people will view the statement that he has made today <e>", "<cs> will the minister agree that if some of the boroughs have this responsibility forced upon them when they do not want it then as they are the arbiters of the financial priorities in their own area this type of activity may suffer <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister does not see a problem <e> <s> is it not a fact that when local authorities are being severely restricted on spending on such vital services as housing education and so on they are bound to place the lowest of priorities on this aspect which they may not have wanted anyway <e> <s> has that entered into the consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however he must be aware of the growing controversy regarding the way in which this contract was let <e> <s> is he aware that information was given or alleged that british aerospace were notified of the closing date by telephone but that nobody at british aerospace can be found who received such a telephone call <e> <s> is it not a fact that the statement which the secretary of state made in another place that shorts is cheaper by a fair margin is not quite correct <e> <s> in fact the british aerospace tender was million less than that by shorts <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say to the minister that it seems to be a question of who one believes <e> <s> british aerospace are adamant that they cannot find anybody who received any such telephone call <e> <s> they are also adamant that the price that they submitted like for like for the same job was million less than that submitted by shorts <e> <s> who is telling the truth <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the minister have some qualms of conscience last thursday bearing in mind the results of the elections which took place at the fact that the government bill disfranchised million people from recording a vote in areas which historically are literally the centres of labour support <e> <s> is it not also a fact that they did so badly in their own traditional areas that there would have been a massacre in the areas where they disfranchised the people from voting <e> <s> was not that one of the main reasons for the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting what has been said by other noble lords may i as a noble lord who lives not too great a distance away from the scene of this tragedy put a couple of points to the minister before discussion on the statement is finished <e> <s> in response to other questions about expense he referred to the fact that in the final analysis it is the responsibility of the football clubs concerned <e> <s> he must be aware that if this designation that has now been extended to the third and fourth divisions is carried out on a short-term basis it will mean the end of most of the third and fourth division clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord rochester on introducing this subject for debate and on the moderate way in which he did so <e> <s> it seems odd when we have so many illustrious ex-trade union leaders who have led the national trade unions for a mere shop steward to be sweeping up on behalf of the official opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point but i think i am right in saying that the noble lord questioned the practice of people calling elections at times to suit themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords no i am not suggesting that any malpractice is all right <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that one could argue about the timing of any election <e> <s> obviously whoever is in charge whether it is in the trade union movement or in the political field can call the election at the time most suitable to themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister should be aware that my own party will be particularly opposed to the suggestion made by the noble lord lord banks that they can be bought off with an increase in the basic pension <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the record of his government has shown that by the inflationary process that basic increase could be eroded very quickly <e>", "<cs> my information is that we are going to take amendment no <e> <s> b and my amendment amendment no <e> <s> ba together because they deal with the same problem although they are worded differently <e> <s> i rise to move my amendment which is as i said very similar to the amendment <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord winstanley <e>", "<cs> we can debate this subject as guided by the noble lord in the chair <e> <s> with many other noble lords i have sat for a great number of days on the committee stage of this bill <e> <s> we discussed various wide-ranging subjects which have had plenty of time on the floor of the committee with on odd occasions setbacks for the government <e> <s> these wide-ranging debates have covered such subjects as refuse disposal road plans and so on <e> <s> however this amendment is dealing with the most valuable commodity that we are handling in the present circumstances <e> <s> probably most of your lordships are familiar with the figures i am about to give but i have to tell noble lords that we are talking about people employed in the glc and the six metropolitan counties <e> <s> but it does not end there because dependent on those people are a number of other people such as the families who are sustained by the fact that these people are in regular constant and reasonable work <e>", "<cs> does not the minister in his reply indicate that there are not two sets of conditions <e> <s> if one has regard to the speech of the noble lord lord plummer no one could have put it better there are now three sets of conditions in operation <e> <s> the people transferred from the glc with the housing stock to the boroughs are in receipt of a scheme that i understand is much more generous than the proposals put by the government some time last year i think as the minister said <e> <s> so we really have a dogs breakfast from whatever angle you look at it <e> <s> you have people moving through no fault of their own it is a government decision that is forcing them to move who if the governments proposals as they stand are accepted will certainly be at a disadvantage compared to people alongside whom they have worked all their lives who had to move because the government took a decision on another matter a couple of years in advance <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way on this point <e> <s> he has repeated more than once that the schemes that have been brought into being by the three metropolitan counties that have got them through are more generous than they should be <e> <s> however it is a fact that they are less generous than the scheme brought in by the previous secretary of state in the last conservative government in order to facilitate the transfer of houses from the glc to the london boroughs <e> <s> that is the point that i am making <e> <s> they are i understand quite considerably less generous than what was imposed by mr heseltine when he was secretary of state <e>", "<cs> briefly i welcome what the minister has proposed in these amendments <e> <s> they will benefit the people involved <e> <s> i wish he could have been more generous on the previous amendment however having said that i welcome this one <e>", "<cs> i rise as a signatory to the amendment to support what the noble lord lord rochester has said <e> <s> this amendment expresses the wish to give a continuity of service that perhaps was missing in the bill as drafted <e> <s> it has become common practice when a like-to-like job is transferred where <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will not be surprised if some of us do not accept one of the main thrusts of the statement not i think raised so far by any noble lord that an industry which in the terms of the statement is doing so well should be privatised at this stage <e> <s> it is obviously for no other reason than to suit a particular narrowminded political philosophy <e> <s> it is also obvious that the government or the minister involved in another place have had no regard at all to points made in a recent debate in this chamber by some of us who come from the hinterlands in the north <e> <s> the points that we made have been almost totally ignored <e> <s> to include the bare announcement that development at stansted will eventually involve million passengers a year will be seen once again in the north as a death blow in favour of the south <e> <s> the maximum development that could have been attained in the north will be killed by that statement alone <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord to confirm that in answer to my noble friend lord glenamara he gave the names of two <e>", "<cs> my lords i hate to put the minister right but scunthorpe of course is in lincolnshire and the noble lord lord glenamara was in fact referring to the area he used to represent and with which he is so familiar which has the worst unemployment record on the mainland <e> <s> i believe that was the point my noble friend was making and i think we ought at least to get the facts right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he comment on statements in the press that the chairman of the successor authority to the glc has been approached if not officially appointed <e> <s> that person is tag taylor who retired some time ago from local government politics upon his acceptance of a well-paid post with a quango as chairman of the southern water authority <e> <s> may i also ask the minister how many approaches or soundings have been made in respect of the chairmanship of the successor authorities to the six metropolitan county councils <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister further on this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely sorry if the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls thinks that asking legitimate questions in your lordships house is throwing mud <e> <s> i am acting on behalf of what i believe to be the public interest <e> <s> whoever are the people appointed they will be responsible for a great mass of services to the public <e> <s> i will now put another question to the minister <e> <s> will the person who has been appointed be permitted to retain the first post to which he was appointed that of chairman of a water authority in addition to holding the new appointment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that non-answer <e> <s> bearing in mind that these people will be in post in the not-too-distant future after the passage of the bill what criteria are the government using in looking at this position <e> <s> in the most recent set of quangos created by government legislation i am talking about the chairmen of the water authorities the lowest paid at present draws a year and the highest paid draws <e> <s> the salaries can be and reach a maximum of up to a year <e> <s> i think the minister will agree that those are very high salaries indeed <e> <s> are not noble lords in this house entitled to a full explanation when we are talking about that amount of public money being spent <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a final question <e> <s> the main thrust of the bill that has created these positions is to cut expenditure <e> <s> does the minister not consider it odd that publicly-elected people in receipt of considerably less sums of money are to be dismissed from office in favour of very highly paid appointees to quangos <e> <s> does the minister consider that such action is in accord with our reputation as the cradle of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister further on that question <e> <s> those of us originally from engineering have seen all too often in the past a manufacturing base in this country surrendered for what at the time looked to be rather an attractive financial deal <e> <s> it would be no good swapping jobs in the west midlands to satisfy the very important need for jobs in swindon <e> <s> the minister ought to be aware that if we now surrender our engine manufacturing capacity which is totally british and go out of it in this round of discussions we will never get back in <e> <s> top priority must be given to ensuring that a fully british input in the manufacturing of motor car engines is retained irrespective of the japanese involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the merchant navy was very hard put to supply the capacity and to provide the logistics for the limited campaign in the falkland islands <e> <s> what would be the situation god forbid if we were called upon to supply the logistics for a bigger conflagration than that <e> <s> would we have the capacity within our merchant navy to carry out that function <e> <s> most people i believe take the view that we have not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the chief whip sits down perhaps i may say that the whole of this bill is about people <e> <s> this particular part of the bill is about the people who service people <e> <s> bearing in mind that during this session of parliament we have proceeded on many occasions well past eleven oclock when it suited the government i think it is a little churlish for the government chief whip to apply his own guillotine at this point in time <e> <s> i think it is totally unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be so but i think i retain the right as an individual member of your lordships house <e> <s> i was always under the impression that nobody in this chamber has the power to apply the guillotine <e> <s> it would appear that the government chief whip thinks that he has that power to apply whenever he thinks it necessary <e>", "<cs> not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not moving anything <e> <s> i was asked to give reasons and i am giving the reasons why i am not going to move certain amendments <e> <s> i am adopting the same procedure as the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> it was challenged as to whether it was out of order to do that and to come back to the amendment on third reading <e> <s> i have to tell noble lords that i sought the advice of the clerks and was told that it was perfectly in order <e> <s> if there was a variation or something which was not delivered at the report stage it was possible to come back to it on third reading <e>", "<cs> not moved my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it was past <e>", "<cs> my lords it was past <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not given the chance to explain why <e> <s> i was beginning to say that the minister has made a very extensive statement today <e> <s> i left this chamber to discuss with people representing those involved with the bill and the amendment what it meant <e> <s> they said that it did not mean anything it has not changed anything <e> <s> i shall not know until i can look at it in the cold light of dawn read it and see what has actually been said <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister indicate in the figures of increased spending he quoted how much is taken up in increased hotel charges in london <e> <s> the levels these have reached have become a matter of concern to many people <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords though i fully accept that the court case tomorrow has rather caught up with this question and i also accept the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may have said yes in answer to the original <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the ministers difficulty in releasing at this time when replies to the consultation paper are still being received points of view on it <e> <s> but is the minister aware that the select committee on employment in another place came to a decision on this matter some weeks ago in which they said that while there was a case for reviewing such practices of long standing they did not find any case for abolition as some people were suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement made by the secretary of state in another place <e> <s> i give it a welcome though a somewhat qualified welcome <e> <s> any extension of a service which takes young people into something gainful is to be welcomed although i have said it is a qualified welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that detailed reply <e> <s> may i correct a figure that he used <e> <s> i used my figure of for updating from at the time of the last labour government not from <e> <s> will the minister please confirm something which if i am correct will be very welcome and that is that there will be no compulsion about this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for giving way <e> <s> i should like to refer to something that took place on the last occasion we discussed this particular subject <e> <s> it is on record that in reply to one of the amendments the minister said that the people involved in this exercise could not be afforded the same rates of redundancy as were afforded on previous occasions <e> <s> he said that no one could expect the residuary authorities to carry such a burden <e> <s> i may not have got the words quite right but i think the message that the noble lord conveyed to us was that they would not receive the same benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house the noble baroness has questioned the role of the opposition labour party and its concern for staff <e> <s> i must remind the noble baroness that during all stages of this bill amendments have appeared on the marshalled list in my name in the names of members of the liberal party and in the name of my noble friend lord mccarthy who unfortunately cannot be present today <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened intently to the ministers reply to the amendment <e> <s> when i rose earlier i was perhaps out of order and i have no wish to pursue my reply to the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes but i must say that i have not noticed during any of the proceedings on this bill where she herself has been so compassionate that she has tabled any amendment on behalf of the staff <e> <s> i do not think that my party or i need any lessons from that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press upon the leader of the house the need for urgency in this matter bearing in mind that before a select committee is set up or a debate held in the house there are figures already available which show that since when we had nearly vessels in commission totalling million tonnes we have managed to halve that to vessels totalling only million tonnes <e> <s> are we not now in a situation where we should consider the matter with extreme urgency and do something about it <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to my noble friend lady fisher the minister said that market forces determine the level of employment in the manufacturing sector <e> <s> was he able to take on board an interview on the today programme on the radio this morning in which a representative of the cbi from either london or the south-east quoted a case where the goods the price the quality and the delivery were right and the firm almost got the contract but at the eleventh hour there was an intervention by the japanese who came along with better financial arrangements underpinned by their government and took the contract away from our manufacturer <e> <s> does he not agree that such practices should be stopped as quickly as possible and when are we going to start bowling a few bouncers <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply but i regret the negative approach that the government have adopted in this situation <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister aware that quite recently i have been in personal contact with some of our finest post-war ambassadors for football such as sir matt busby mr joe mercer and mr john charles who are respected all over the world and who all think that the fifa worldwide ban is totally unnecessary <e> <s> may i further ask the minister whether he is aware that fifa will be reconsidering this ban on th july <e> <s> i believe that some form of support from the government would help to rebuild what a lot of us now consider a completely spurious loss of confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the comments made by my noble friend lord mishcon on the front bench <e> <s> this could be a very controversial topic and any noble lords who have read the report of the proceedings in another place on this bill will know that if it were to become an act in the form in which it was presented there it could be very grievously flawed <e> <s> noble lords have a duty to make sure that what started as a public relations exercise to assuage what happened in the terrible incidents in brussels when it leaves this place is a realistic measure that can be applied to football in general <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that the formidable list which has just been given by the noble lord lord sainsbury of people who have a vested interest in this particular problem and who are against abolition indicates that the situation would be well left alone and that the usual procedures for dealing with salaries should continue <e> <s> it is a fact of life that the particular sections of the community covered by those particular agreements have been some of the most industrially peaceful communities in our society and as such they ought to be left alone <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will give way again <e> <s> i do not know whether he has read what was said in another place but the home secretary stated quite clearly that he had the support of all the parties in another place <e> <s> he named the two people who represented the sdp and liberal alliance in the persons of mr beith and mr maclennan and he thanked them for the support they had given

has a great deal of expertise to offer your lordships on certain subjects <e> <s> we can look forward to hearing some first-class contributions from him in the future <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way on this point <e> <s> i think the minister ought to be aware that the provision of boxes is in fact a growth industry and more of the top clubs are installing these boxes <e>

will be killed off <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> is the minister really saying that there is no possibility of looking at the situation <e> <s> i have applied for licences in the past and i believe that there could be some accommodation so that the days for permission to sell drinks under the bill as it stands would not be lost <e> <s> i think that this problem could be overcome with some effort <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord the minister could not have been more sympathetic and responsive to what i still think is a reasonable request <e> <s> i do not know when the minister last stood on a football terrace or sat in a football stand <e> <s> i do not go to football matches as frequently as i did <e> <s> i was blooded at the same two grounds as the noble lord lord wigoder namely manchester city and manchester united and probably at the same time so maybe we stood there together as boys <e> <s> i know that in the early s of the two manchester city was the premier side <e> <s> i was sent to watch united if i had misbehaved because the team was playing so badly <e> <s> but the position has been reversed a bit since <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister cannot have the argument both ways <e> <s> i fully agree that it has been a success in scotland but numerous noble lords have indicated today that where the experiment has been tried in england and the grounds were completely dry there has been the worst possible crowd trouble anywhere <e> <s> in some cases abstinence must fire the blood <e> <s> i have never seen that but that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is the case <e> <s> i do not want to detain the committee much longer <e> <s> in this country we have a ground which although it is not now the best in the world is still the citadel of soccer internationally <e> <s> i am talking about wembley stadium <e> <s> it possibly stages more showpiece games than any other stadium in the world <e> <s> before any footballer of note from any country in the world hangs up his boots he wants it to be known that he has played at wembley <e>", "<cs> i am sure the minister will understand that i am not trying to delay anything <e> <s> what goes from your lordships chamber should have almost unanimous support if that is possible <e> <s> however there is no question at all that a number of noble lords who have spoken do not feel inclined to give this particular clause in the bill as it stands at present unanimous support <e> <s> i do not want to divide the committee on this issue <e> <s> however i am bound to tell your lordships that if the evidence comes in that because of the time factor the finances of clubs will <e>", "<cs> i shall not proceed further other than to say that if the position is as rigid by the time we reach report stage next wednesday this may well be an issue that cannot be resolved simply by debating it <e> <s> some of us feel very strongly over a part of the bill that we consider unnecessary <e> <s> however not wishing to delay proceedings any further tonight i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating my noble friend and colleague lord molloy on choosing this very important subject for a debate i join with the noble viscount lord hanworth who has just spoken in saying that it is a pity that the debate could not be held at a more prime time in the house <e> <s> as my noble friend lord molloy said in his opening remarks we are of course discussing the future of ourselves as a nation and what plateau of social structure and life our children and their children will have to endure or live on <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to the motion which was so well put and so well detailed by the minister i take a point that he mentioned <e> <s> it is related to the engineering industry which as the minister said is our biggest single employer of labour <e> <s> it is a fact that over the last to years the engineering industry has in total lost more jobs than mining and steel put together <e> <s> if the country is really to put its act together on the question of the export potential of manufacturing industries this is the major industry that has to be able to take the lions share of that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that if industrial recovery is to take place and is to be of the dimension and rapidity that we all wish it is essential in order to get the maximum effort from the workforce in the various sectors of the industries involved that maximum consultation takes place <e> <s> experience has shown that where this happens it very often eliminates almost entirely industrial unrest <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister will not be surprised if i have to reject totally that what he has put on the table means anything at all <e> <s> he has not changed the position one iota since last thursday and last monday <e> <s> i have to say to my own front bench that i am saddened that there appears to be such a negative approach <e> <s> i think that this is what happens when front benches in another place go into secret concubine producing instant answers to very complex problems and hoping that we will rubber stamp them <e>", "<cs> my lords i plead guilty to an obvious slip of the tongue <e> <s> nevertheless i made the point when i began to move this amendment that we were granted an extra day on the basis of going into the bill thoroughly and meticulously to see whether it was flawed <e> <s> i do not think the case has been made adequately by the minister or by the one speaker who supported him from behind who said that our argument was illogical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for repeating the statement which has been made in another place <e>

lords do not imagine that i was trying to mislead the house in saying that the noble lord lord sainsbury was not against retaining the <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord brought in the question of rugby <e> <s> there was a unique case some years ago where there was a plane crash <e> <s> i think it was going from south wales to murrayfield to a rugby match <e> <s> all the people in the plane were killed <e> <s> the investigation showed afterwards that some had thought that it was an open cockpit-type plane where there was access to the pilot by the passengers <e> <s> the theory was that somebody had thrown a beer bottle in the plane <e> <s> so you have got to be careful when you are talking about other sports and thinking that they are totally free from violence <e> <s> some of them are not <e> <s> there were quite a lot of people killed in that crash <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to bradford and to the fact that if rugby league games were played liquor would be available but would not be available for soccer matches <e> <s> but coming from there myself i believe that same set of spectators will watch both matches <e> <s> they are not that different <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had had the advantage of being in another place he would find that they were discouraged from doing any such thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in wishing the bill well when it becomes an act <e> <s> i too agree with the view expressed that it will do a lot to help football clean up its image <e> <s> i say that as someone who has watched football for most of his life and who has never partaken of much drink in that process <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into detailed figures too much does the minister agree that on the question of training and our competitors we spend less than half of what west germany spends and proportionately less than our other european competitors also <e> <s> can he say how far the recent training initiatives announced by the government will go to make up the leeway or the deficit <e> <s> unless we do that does he not agree that we are falling far short in providing the seed corn for our future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell the government chief whip that there has been only one back bencher to question the minister and he was from the other side <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i too express my appreciation to mr justice popplewell for the speed with which the report has come forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the plea that has been made from this side of the house asking for delay in the implementation of this order <e> <s> if the order is acted upon now we shall be at a point of no return <e> <s> i have read as no doubt have the other noble lords and the noble baroness who have spoken in this debate the proceedings in committee in another place <e> <s> certainly the case for this action was not compellingly made by the minister in that committee <e> <s> i shall not attempt for one moment to go into details as my noble friend on the front bench did in a very technical review of what has happened <e> <s> certainly in this house today the minister has not had any more of a convincing argument to put than was put in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i will paraphrase it by saying that the comment was made by that member that there was a lack of attendance in northern ireland by ministers over a recent period <e> <s> that is not my phrase that is the phrase that was used during the committee stage <e> <s> i know from my experiences both under a labour government and under successive conservative governments since that any minister who has had to serve in northern ireland has had to do so very often at great personal risk both to himself and to his family <e> <s> i know that irrespective of politics they have done that assiduously and i think they have done it very well <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to comment on reports in the press at the weekend that the figures due to be released on the current unemployment situation show a further substantial deterioration in the last month <e> <s> does this not indicate that whatever the size of inward investment at present it needs to be more than it is in order to arrest a further decline in the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that noble lords involved in debating the bill when it was passing through this chamber in july are grateful to him for reinforcing the governments undertakings given at that time that the workings of the new act would be kept under review with a view to possible amendment in the public order bill <e> <s> is he also aware that we are grateful that he has taken to task some of the media for the irresponsible way in which they reported the fact that football clubs were applying for licences to sell alcohol under the provisions of the bill as deliberately intended and that no loopholes were found because that was not the ball game anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister further on the point that was raised by my noble friend lord murray as to where this increase of plus jobs has actually been created <e> <s> are they in the service sectors or are they in the manufacturing sectors <e> <s> secondly cutting across all the figures of jobs created while the government can claim some statistical success is it not a fact that if the record over the last months is repeated there will be million out of work next year which is quite an increase on the present number <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and obviously welcome the slight improvement to which he referred <e> <s> but is he aware that the general figures show that in five of the regions of the united kingdom excluding northern ireland which has the highest ratio of long-term unemployed in the united kingdom the figure for long-term unemployment has now reached more than per cent <e> <s> in some of them it is now approaching the dangerous level of per cent <e> <s> are the minister and the government really aware of the increasing despair and depression that is felt in the five areas to which i have referred <e> <s> does the minister not agree that now is the time for urgent and drastic action in order to arrest the decline in employment <e> <s> the palliatives at present being applied are nowhere near sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on reports in the responsible press that the inquiry calls for a minimum of billion to be spent in order to deal with the present situation <e> <s> bearing in mind that that view has been reinforced by the institute of maintenance and building management and the building employers confederation can the minister say what we are waiting for <e> <s> when will the government take the necessary action <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that most of the bodies which have reported on this subject are non-political but have expertise in this particular area <e> <s> they include the national housing improvement council <e> <s> it is not a question of loose newspaper talk <e> <s> will the minister be more sympathetic to the large conurbations in the united kingdom such as the city of manchester which has submitted a claim under its housing investment programme for million to deal with its problems in a modest way but which was granted access to only million <e> <s> is this really good enough <e> <s> that situation is mirrored in every other major city of this country <e> <s> when will the government do something about it <e> <s> action in this area would create tens of thousands of jobs which would be beneficial to everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all in accordance with the traditions and customs of this house welcome the noble lord on his promotion to his new post although that is a little belated as we have been waiting for him for a week <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister if he will join with me in disabusing people of the idea that the wage rates paid in british manufacturing industry are a major factor at present in losing orders bearing in mind that we have some of the lowest rates of pay within the ec and that wage rates among most of our major competitors in europe over the last five years have risen far faster than they have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the right reverend prelate in congratulating my old friend and colleague lord mellish on his maiden speech <e> <s> for a few moments i should like to refer to part of that speech and what it was about <e> <s> for my part i have no fond memories of what the past secretary of state mr heseltine has done for housing in parts of the country other than the london docklands <e> <s> in my opinion all that has happened was that it was a good policy and well worth trying but where did this money come from <e> <s> the other major cities in the hinterland the midlands the north and also the london boroughs have seen their housing resources savagely cut ruptured beyond belief <e> <s> the sums of money that were made available to the london development agency for its exercise is but a small pittance from that money taken in a global sense <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful that the noble lord gives way <e> <s> he has brought me back into the debate <e> <s> is it not a fact that in real terms the total money spent on housing in the public sector by the government this year is less than one-third of what the last labour government spent in <e> <s> where does he get his arithmetic from <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is not the minister aware that the programme showed quite clearly that the self-regulation system as applied at present is quite inefficient to deal with the present situation and that there is a large number of people who are misappropriating huge sums of money and getting away scot-free <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that any legislation which is brought forward should contain provisions which will ensure that these people will be dealt with most severely by the normal processes of law and will not be treated as a special class of people <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that despite the cases quoted by the noble lord opposite where some of the financial agencies and institutions have dealt with people that it comes across to laymen as rather peculiar that people who are deliberately breaking the law and obtaining huge sums of money thereby are being dealt with on the basis of membership of a club andnot by the law agencies <e> <s> to lay people in this country that is very difficult to understand when we have the present government taking a stand on the policy of law and order <e> <s> there are two sets of conditions being applied <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but is he not aware that by now the national average figure for long-term unemployment within the unemployment total is per cent <e> <s> the five areas referred to in my question have of course suffered deprivation and shocking conditions for a much longer period of time than some other areas <e> <s> when will the government do something positive and meaningful <e> <s> if they can be induced to do it will they do it urgently because of the long-standing conditions in these five areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i will ask a final question <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be as brief as i possibly can <e> <s> is the minister not aware that despite the numbers he gave of people in employment those figures mean nothing at all to the long-term unemployed in the five areas i mentioned <e> <s> i reiterate the question asked by my noble friend lord glenamara what are the secretary of states proposals and because of the urgency when will they be implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord the minister not recall that some time ago when i questioned him from the dispatch box regarding this particular scheme he said quite categorically that it was a voluntary scheme <e> <s> is it not a gross misuse of the word voluntary when youngsters who do not join it or leave it can be subject to penal sanctions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that as an ex-leader of a major city council i along with all my colleagues deplore the tactics that have been pursued in liverpool by militants <e> <s> but will the minister answer in more detail the question put to him by my noble friend on the front bench the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> the minister talks about the amount of assistance being given by the government but is it not a hard fact that through government grants all the major cities and the major conurbations have lost million for every week that this government have been in office <e> <s> will he stop shedding crocodile tears and give them some funds to get on with the job <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report which has been referred to is the last of a series of reports by various non-politically motivated bodies which all point to the same problem <e> <s> may i say to the noble lord that the increase he mentioned if it is such in financial terms is of course welcome but it is totally insufficient <e> <s> is the minister aware that the inner cities are in fact dying at an accelerating rate despite the measures that he has announced and that it is becoming a matter of extreme urgency that a rescue operation should be mounted before our city centres become total deserts <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl the minister aware that he dismissed rather lightly the comments made by the noble earl lord kinnoull regarding the increasing concern in the north of england at this project going ahead without a public inquiry <e> <s> i come from the north <e> <s> is the noble earl not aware that the people up there consider that to go ahead with this tunnel without full consultation or a public inquiry could further exacerbate the grave economic differences between the north and the south <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however is not the noble lord aware that the people in the building industry who are involved at the sharp end the people who are at the receiving end of the chancellors statement would contradict the statement <e> <s> they say that the capital building programme on housing has been cut by million <e> <s> they are using terms like weve been the victim of a confidence trick <e> <s> does the noble lord know to whom they are referring <e> <s> would they be referring to the chancellor of the exchequer or the secretary of state for the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that even when one applies the figures which he has given to the building industry and considers the problem as highlighted in a succession of reports culminating in the latest one by the committee of the most reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury they are only very faintly scratching the surface <e> <s> i urge the noble lord to urge the chancellor of the exchequer and the secretary of state for the environment to release some of the vast sums of money which they are holding and which really belong to the local authorities in respect of the sales of their capital assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to a certain degree for the fact that this debate has been initiated by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> i have taken note of some of his remarks and also of some of the remarks of the noble lord lord beloff in his speech which preceded mine <e> <s> but there are a number of factors that ought to be looked at very closely when we talk of what brought about this situation <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord lord mellish we are not talking about the same thing <e> <s> the noble lord is talking about a conglomerate of london authorities which could stand to be criticised <e> <s> i am talking about a series of big cities which stood on their own <e> <s> manchester and liverpool under historical control and before militant took control had to export a quarter of a million people mainly outside their borders <e> <s> they received nothing like the financial assistance that was afforded to the docklands development corporation to the urban development association or to the new fetish which came in the new towns <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly the point i was making was that they shifted resources out of the city to hinterland where their voters are and that is established beyond doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor bearing in mind the answer that i received on a previous occasion that one case however bad was not viewed seriously enough to activate a review of the whole system whether he is aware that since that case there have been at least three others where the person convicted for violent rape has been paroled and has committed the same act on a girl of and on a girl of luckily with no death in the physical sense <e> <s> there is ample evidence that the crime of rape is increasing <e> <s> i understand that in the debate in another place figures showed that it had increased by per cent <e> <s> over the last six months <e> <s> is it not time we decided that the women of this nation require and receive some increased protection against a bestial crime <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the very detailed replies he has given but is he aware that in the first case which prompted the original question some months ago not only was the woman murdered but before she was murdered a vicious rape took place <e> <s> i put the point in my first supplementary question today that there have been at least two subsequent cases in which the parole board knowing all the facts have in fact paroled people who were convicted of violent rape and then those people have again committed that crime <e> <s> is it not time that the situation was looked at and people were given better protection than they are getting at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> bearing in mind that the priority in this dispute is to restore to nearly a thousand pupils the normal education facilities to which they are entitled i understand that they have been denied these facilities for three months now may i ask whether a time limit was placed on the reply sought from the manchester education authority <e> <s> if the reply was negative can the minister tell us now so that alternative action can be taken to restore these education facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before i am extremely grateful to the noble earl for the manner in which he has dealt with the question <e> <s> but is he not aware that the whole situation in schools in manchester at present is very fragile <e> <s> it is almost at the point where some of the teachers are talking about a withdrawal of educational services right across the board <e> <s> i have no desire to embarrass or impinge on any negotiations that will be taking place but i must ask the minister to take note of the fact that if this issue is not resolved quickly and it may need the intervention of the secretary of state to do so some of us fear for the education services in manchester with which we have been historically proud to be associated <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief <e> <s> within the meaning of the act do not the needs of the pupils transcend the views of the authority where education is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also first congratulate my noble friend and colleague on this side of the house for introducing this subject for debate <e> <s> it is well realised that it is the most important social problem that the country is facing at present <e> <s> i was interested to hear some of my noble friends proposals regarding measures for training on a mandatory basis and that type of thing <e> <s> i agree with the previous speaker too that it was a false economy for the government to have butchered the original list of training boards as they did on the so-called premise of cutting public expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but is he aware that there is an increasing danger of manufacturers who are big users of electricity moving their future activities abroad <e> <s> will he use his good offices if possible to speed up the process with a positive answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in expressing thanks to mr justice popplewell for the very detailed report that he has presented <e> <s> as one who was invited to give evidence and who did so i have to part company with my colleague on the front bench in respect of his observations concerning executive boxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say briefly that there is no doubt in what mr justice popplewell is saying concerning the tremendous and adverse effects being experienced <e> <s> how long must we wait and how much money will be lost before something is done <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the answer of the noble lord the minister as factual that these funds are held by the local authorities themselves but is it not true that the government have severely restricted access to those funds by halving the amount accessible from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> some time ago <e> <s> can he now give us the amount of this money that is being held in reserve by the local authorities <e> <s> bearing in mind that the governments own report on housing shows a need for billion expenditure in order to deal with some of the problems which confront local authorities and other housing authorities these days will the minister consider pressing the chancellor of the exchequer further to release those sums at absorbable amounts so that the local authorities can grapple with the situation that now confronts them <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the minister must know the figure bearing in mind that the last time it was quoted it was billion plus <e> <s> during the last financial statement there were reports from very reliable quarters that those sums had increased quite considerably in excess of billion so much that the chancellor of the exchequer was considering reducing the per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> so will the minister tell us how much money is involved and stop hiding behind some rather vague answers to some very pointed questions <e>", "<cs> they are the same my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that in answering my questions the minister has appeared to be more evasive than is his usual standard when he comes to the dispatch box <e> <s> if he is not prepared to give the answer now i may be able to appraise him of the figures during the debate that is due to take place in a short time on the report of the duke of edinburghs commission on housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join the other speakers in supporting the facts that have been made public today <e> <s> briefly i should like to put two matters to the minister <e> <s> i believe that the report criticised quite directly both the district health authority and the yorkshire regional health authority <e> <s> is the minister aware that within days of this tragedy happening the <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to the regional health authority not the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but may i ask him whether he is aware that i have information from the institute of housing which shows that per cent <e> <s> of the applications that have been dealt with have been refused and per cent <e> <s> have been granted <e> <s> it is taking five months for decisions to be made <e> <s> does the minister consider in view of the per cent <e> <s> refusal that the professional officers misunderstood the criteria <e>", "<cs> but my lords is it not a fact even with the new figures that the refusals are at an unacceptable high percentage having regard to what was said in this chamber by ministers at the dispatch box opposite when these amendments were going through the house and were voted upon <e> <s> there is a strong feeling among the professional people involved in this matter that the government have broken their word on it <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to join with all other previous speakers in thanking the noble lord lord seebohm for the opportunity to have this very important debate <e> <s> i should also like to thank him for the very impartial and informative way in which he has led the debate <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the people who were on the committee chaired by his royal highness the duke of edinburgh and to thank them for the work which they have done <e> <s> having spent a lifetime in some respects in the public housing sector and with a very close interest in it i can appreciate the detail with which they have looked into the matter where they have had to go and the questions which they have had to ask <e> <s> obviously the areas which would receive most of their attention would be the very high-problem areas <e> <s> it is a little difficult to follow the line taken by the noble lord lord seebohm and to try to keep the debate completely non-political because there are in some <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way after that very detailed exposition <e> <s> he will recall that up until not last years autumn statement but the autumn statement the year before that local authorities were allowed to use per cent <e> <s> of their revenue <e> <s> the figure was then cut to per cent <e> <s> is the minister trying to make out that a cut of per cent <e> <s> is an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the north-west of england as referred to by my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn was traditionally the largest employer of engineers in the whole of europe <e> <s> does he not understand that the disposal of british leyland to companies outside our own country may well further exacerbate the decline of the areas concerned which have almost become an industrial desert <e> <s> will he ask the new secretary of state for trade and industry to reflect on the governments decision to sell off british leyland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for his reference to the canary wharf scheme <e> <s> however it has been reported that the corporation of the city of london has opposed the railway link between canary wharf and bank tube station which of course is vital to the scheme <e> <s> can the noble lord say what other petition if any has been received as i understand that the closing date is today and whether the government think the issue between the corporation of the city of london and the developers can be resolved <e>", "<cs> may i first of all say that i came in only at the end of the speech on this subject by the noble and learned lord lord denning but that i was able to catch the remarks of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter about this matter <e> <s> i have been privileged to be a member of this chamber for just over two years and it is not very often that i have heard noble lords of whatever political persuasion in this house mention the names of individuals <e> <s> but the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did mention mr david blunkett who is the leader of the council in sheffield <e> <s> i do not think for one moment that mr david blunkett would expect me to rise in his defence since i do not view politics through the same eyes as he does and i do not say that as a pun because mr david blunkett suffers the tragedy of being blind <e> <s> he is not blind politically politically he is very mature <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord from the liberal bench but i want to say that whether noble lords from the same political party or different political parties agree or disagree with mr blunketts viewpoint nevertheless he has a privilege possessed by none of us in this chamber whether we i support my party the government party minority <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree for one moment that that is the case but it seems to me that inescapably the person concerned must face the verdict of the electorate <e> <s> we do not have to go through that procedure and i would venture to say that that consideration may well govern some of the remarks made on occasions in this chamber <e> <s> i think that one of the mistakes that we make in this chamber whether we are sitting on this side of the house are supporters of the government members of the sdp/liberal alliance law lords or cross-benchers is to assume that we know better than the electorate what the people want <e> <s> i think that we are in a very dangerous position if we go to the end of the road with that argument <e>", "<cs> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> however will he not agree that since the noble lords own stewardship commenced at the department of employment one conclusion that can be drawn from the latest set of figures issued by his department is that the number of people unemployed has increased by over and that perhaps the most dangerous and relentless trend is the increased number of people who can be classed as long-termed unemployed <e> <s> is not this one of the key figures within those latest statistics and can the minister tell us when he expects that particular figure to start falling <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the statement itself and the alternative criteria will bring no comfort whatsoever to those people who remain unemployed <e> <s> if the calculations already announced mean that the figures will benefit by about through moving back the period why does he not move it still further back when unemployment may disappear altogether statistically <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the present prime minister fought and won the last two general elections using as one of her main planks a promise to reduce unemployment and bearing in mind also that the statistics show that during her period as prime minister of this country unemployment has in fact trebled when will the minister be able to tell the house that the prime minister and the government will achieve the objectives that they set themselves at those two general elections <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that we on this side support the noble lord lord hylton in his appeal for more funds for housing associations <e> <s> but is it not a little dangerous to pin a question about the future role of local authorities on one sentence extracted from a very informed and long debate on housing <e> <s> bearing in mind that local authorities still cater for more than million families in tenanted accommodation can the minister give an undertaking that if any further funds are to be made available by the government for the public housing sector local authorities will receive their fair and adequate share <e>", "<cs> my lords on that point the noble lord knows as well as i do that that will not happen in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i too am grateful that more money is being found than the secretary of state mentioned in his original statement on the rate support grant <e> <s> the minister has indicated in answer to a question by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the shire counties possibly quite genuinely grumbled earlier and they will now benefit <e> <s> but is it not a fact that there will be a difference in the degree of benefit even to those shire counties <e> <s> can the minister tell us what the shire counties originally contributed towards the million surplus that has been found <e>", "<cs> my lords so what the minister is saying is that some of the local authorities that have already had financial penalties inflicted on to them under the previous statement will get some of it back under this statement but they will not get all of it back <e> <s> they will receive financial penalties under the original statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we are talking today almost as though we accept this crime as some form of growth industry <e> <s> questions about the incidence of this particularly revolting crime have been raised on numerous occasions lately in your lordships house and i must say that the answers have given very little satisfaction <e> <s> does the minister agree that we are now faced almost daily with headlines about this particularly vile and obscene crime which is taking place on an increasing and ominous scale <e> <s> those of us who have been following the situation with care think that the fall-back position of having more centres where the victims of rape can report is not preferable to instituting methods which may reduce the incidence of this terrible crime and we are far from satisfied that such measures exist at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that answer and for the fact that the information will be made available today <e> <s> but is she aware that there is great concern in west leeds because of the removal of mr robin wood the chairman of the health authority in whose area i reside <e> <s> i understand that mr wood is a supporter of the government <e> <s> the only quality he does not seem to have is to be a yes man for the chairman of the regional authority <e> <s> is the minister aware that a delegation of all the consultants in west leeds based on the leeds general infirmary which is one of the largest teaching hospitals we have saw the chairman of the regional health authority to seek support for the reappointment of mr wood <e> <s> the chairman made an explicit statement in which he said i understand that he would not be prepared to support that <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether we are now in the ball game of people like the chairman of the yorkshire regional health authority being able to pick his own team

some of them have done only one term <e> <s> some of us find it strange that certain people have been reappointed <e> <s> it is not the regional chairmans turn for appointment but he has obviously had

old people through salmonella poisoning appear to have been reappointed <e> <s> what really is the standard that the government apply <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state not recall a couple of weeks ago saying in your lordships house in answer to a question that he would like to go and see the areas that were described as industrial deserts <e> <s> on the figures that he has given has he not described one of many such areas today <e> <s> will he try to oblige my noble friend lord stallard with his request to visit this area which is an industrial desert in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i know that your lordships present will bear with me if for a few moments i pay my respects and regards to the right honourable michael cocks the member for bristol south who piloted this small but important bill through another place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i very briefly say that i do not intend at this time of the night to delay your lordships for very long <e> <s> may i express my appreciation to my noble friend and colleague on the front bench lord underhill for his kind support of the bill <e> <s> may i also express my sincere thanks to the minister the noble earl lord caithness for the very kind considerate and objective way in which he has responded <e> <s> i should like to pay special regard to the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> in the short period that i have been in your lordships house i have quite clearly come to understand that to have the support of the noble and learned lord lord denning on legal matters is very good support and is a bonus on any legal bill <e> <s> he encapsulated what the bill is really about when he said that it remedies a grave defect in the existing law <e> <s> that is what the bill is meant to do <e> <s> that is why i think it has received such universal support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the answer but really how can the minister say that we have already adjusted to the decline in oil revenues when that has been taking place only over the past weeks and there has been no cut in production as yet <e> <s> would the minister like to say why the chancellor has essayed a guess of dollars a barrel and it was only a guess when the price of oil could go up to dollars or unfortunately go down to dollars a barrel <e> <s> will this not blow a hole in the chancellors calculations for the coming financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords to get back to the price of oil is the minister not aware that due to the initiatives of the previous labour government successive conservative governments have had the benefit of between billion and billion of financial assets from energy resources in the north sea <e> <s> can he tell us what monument from the receipt of that money has been left us by this government other than record unemployment and dole queues <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first add my tribute to the noble lord lord marshall of leeds <e> <s> we have been in some respects long-standing political opponents but across the political divide we have established a form of friendship and have discussed similar problems although sometimes we may have wanted to find different answers <e> <s> the weaknesses i find in his approach and certainly in the analysis and the proposals suggested by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter are absolutely beyond belief <e> <s> are the noble lords aware of the size of the problem in some of the areas of the country today <e> <s> there is no system that this government or a future labour government could devise that could be applied universally because some areas would find it totally impossible to raise increased finance by any means <e> <s> i shall try to illustrate that in the time left to me <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble baroness refers to my speech and the situation in manchester i am sorry but i have to rise <e> <s> let me briefly put forward the point i made a few weeks ago <e> <s> i do not necessarily agree with all that the present political leaders in manchester are doing <e> <s> but i have to say that if i with a more moderate approach had still been in control in manchester the problem would have been of the same dimensions <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the fact that manchester has mismanaged money <e> <s> it has had million withheld million-odd a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> unless therefore any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords in following other speakers i also pay tribute to the noble lord lord bruce of donington for initiating this debate and the manner in which he moved the motion <e> <s> during his speech when he somewhat castigated the secretary of state for questioning the motives of a member of the opposition in this house who referred some time ago to the service industries i think he was referring to me <e> <s> the point i was making at the time was that unless we live by our manufacturing industry we do not live at all <e> <s> i was not trying to devalue what was being done in the service industries because what is being done is valuable work <e> <s> but it is economically impossible to fund an increasing service industry with a shrinking manufacturing base <e> <s> there is no possible way that that can succeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for repeating in this house the statement made in another place by the secretary of state <e> <s> may i ask is it not a fact that this particular measure has been triggered by the fact that the city of birmingham has chosen to challenge the government in the courts <e> <s> i understand the case is to be heard as early as next week <e> <s> does it not indicate that the government may have been acting illegally for six years <e> <s> it appears that they are breaking with precedent by using their majority in parliament in a somewhat hurried way because they fear the possibility that they may lose the case against birmingham in the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords while not demurring for one moment from the request made by my noble friend lord mellish for additional funding for housing in london docklands which would be a good investment is the minister not aware he must be aware that some of the areas of highest housing deprivation in the country are in the big cities other than london <e> <s> is it not a fact that cities such as manchester which submitted proposals for a million spending plus in the current year received only one-third of the allocation it applied for <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords speaking previously in this debate indicated that there was a non-political approach to this subject but this is a politically motivated bill <e> <s> i recall that earlier in the debate a speaker referred to the fact that the municipal airports of which there are a number of very successful ones were spawned by municipal enterprise <e> <s> that was not the prerogative of one party <e> <s> i have no widespread knowledge of this industry on a national basis but i want to relate my remarks to my native city of manchester which outside of london has perhaps the largest and most rapidly developing airport <e> <s> that airport was developed because just after the war people of both major political parties decided that a city such as manchester needed an airport <e> <s> that decision had the support of both parties <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that figures published by responsible housing organisations and authorities show that over the five years there has been a total loss between the private and public sectors of over housing units for letting <e> <s> does that not indicate a very large falldown on the governments responsibility in one of the areas of greatest need <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware in regard to the figures that both he and i have given that the number of families requiring sheltered accommodation or wheelchair accommodation has increased over the last months by to a total now of <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether the government have any plans to deal with this very high area of priority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that helpful reply <e> <s> he must be aware that now that owner-occupied houses have reached per cent <e> <s> of our total housing stock they are one of our greatest assets <e> <s> there are reports indicating that varying sums of money are required to put houses into good repair <e> <s> the sums vary from to per house <e> <s> as most of those houses are occupied by people who are growing older and do not have the finances to put them in order will the government consider some form of assistance perhaps loans at a cheaper rate of interest than in the market to stop the deterioration gathering pace <e>", "<cs> my lords may i assure the minister that in my first supplementary question i was not trying to place the blame on the present government <e> <s> this is a difficult problem which has been accelerating and growing over a number of years under successive governments <e> <s> the point i am making is that according to figures produced in various reports the problem is accelerating quite quickly <e> <s> so would it not be prudent for the government whether this one or the next to do something soon to halt this decline <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the noble lord who spoke previously is not from the north-west <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state for his reply <e> <s> how does he relate his answer today to the headlines in the press a couple of weeks ago from parts of the press that are normally very favourable to the government that said rise in unemployment the biggest for four and a half years <e> <s> does this not indicate that though the government and the noble lord as secretary of state may alter the criteria for calculating the number of unemployed the real situation is one of continuing deterioration in a very dangerous fashion <e> <s> when will the government and the secretary of state realise this stop indulging in self-congratulation and do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the secretary of state tell the house how many times since this government took office in they have altered the criteria for calculating unemployment <e> <s> why has that been done <e> <s> is it not a fact that despite all the figures that are given there is still a dangerous and underlying increase in the number of adult unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords let me join with the previous speaker in congratulating the noble baroness lady vickers on behalf of myself and my party on bringing forward this bill <e> <s> my one regret is that the bill had to have a second reading on a friday afternoon <e> <s> i am sure because of the all-party support this terrible problem has received that if the debate had taken place at a more reasonable time on some evening during the week there would have been a much more extensive list of speakers <e> <s> a number of speakers who were down to speak when the debate was previously due to be held have conveyed to me that they are desperately sorry that they are not able to come <e> <s> they have asked me to convey their apologies <e> <s> among them are the noble baronesses lady denington and lady ewart-biggs <e> <s> i have no doubt that there are other peers who cannot be present who will feel the same <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister appears to have turned this issue into one of political argument <e> <s> i made it quite clear when i introduced my bill which was the first bill introduced in either house on this particular subject that it was an all-party bill <e> <s> at no time did i or my party claim it as our sole entity <e> <s> it is a little naughty of the minister to start implying now that certain parties have only just woken up to this matter and that it has been a back-bencher from his own party who has brought it forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i should hate to prolong the debate but the government had to be prodded by myself and other people to take the steps that they have done <e> <s> they did not take them voluntarily <e> <s> this bill would not be here today if the government had done the job that they should have done when they were asked to do it six years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to join previous speakers in congratulating my noble friend and colleague lord wells-pestell on introducing this subject and giving us an opportunity to make our case regarding government policies and their effect on people <e> <s> it would appear from previous speakers that the debate has in some respects been broken down by members of your lordships house speaking for areas and more or less presenting the case as they see it for the areas from which they come <e> <s> i have spent all my life in the north of england eventually in one of the largest cities <e> <s> i live in another large city in the north of britain <e> <s> i think noble lords will understand if i restrict my remarks to that part of the country <e>", "<cs> if noble lord are wondering why i have wandered for a moment from my job as a whip on the front bench it is to give my support to this amendment based on a programme which was on television at the weekend <e> <s> i do not know whether any noble lords or noble baronesses saw the programme which showed a number of young people suffering from spinal injuries and broken necks from the rugby field who were literally paralysed for the rest of their lives <e> <s> the subject of the programme was rather different <e> <s> it concerned the question of insurance to <e>", "<cs> conservative view <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i was not here for the early part of the debate on this amendment but i was engaged somewhere else <e> <s> i would not have thought that laymen would find the words confusing <e> <s> the phrase means surely something that is indepen <e>", "<cs> i was not going to speak in this debate and i do not disagree with some of the points of my noble friend and colleague lord sefton <e> <s> nevertheless history is very often the history as written by the individual <e> <s> some historical facts to which my noble friend lord sefton referred are quite correct <e> <s> there was the basis of an airport at liverpool before that at manchester <e> <s> but he used the word geographical which says it all <e> <s> if one draws a -mile radius around manchester it is the biggest centre of population in the united kingdom <e> <s> liverpool has the disadvantage that one side of it is water and the coastline <e> <s> before i left manchester in political terms the catchment area for manchester airport was then million people <e> <s> that is mainly the reason why manchester progressed <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down it would be as well to make noble lords present aware of the facts of the situation <e> <s> there may be a slight difference of accent between the noble lord lord sefton and myself regarding liverpool and manchester airports <e> <s> however there are some facts on which we totally agree <e> <s> the reason for some of the difficulties is that a government some years ago decided to reorganise local authorities <e> <s> at that time the airport in liverpool was owned by liverpool city council and the airport in manchester was owned by manchester city council <e> <s> i do not know what happened in merseyside but i know what happened in manchester <e> <s> the greater manchester county the new body immediately put it on its shopping list to take over <e>", "<cs> does the minister not understand that in his answer lies the inherent unfairness to the local authorities which spawned these airports developed them and were the sole controllers <e> <s> they were taken off them without any compensation <e> <s> manchester got a per cent <e> <s> arrangement with the county but in order to put a package together to form a plc manchester suggested that per cent <e> <s> of the shares be divided among the other nine metropolitan districts who played no part whatsoever in the birth or development of manchester airport <e>", "<cs> i wish to put a question about employees conditions of transfer <e> <s> as the minister is aware there are provisions in the bill which mean that if local authorities want to receive government assistance or the right to go into the open market for finance they will need to divest themselves of per cent <e> <s> of the shares in the company <e> <s> i believe that that is correct <e> <s> on privatisation the local authority will have per cent <e> <s> of the shares and that carries total protection for the employees <e> <s> that point was highlighted by the minister <e> <s> what will happen if per cent <e> <s> of the shares are taken up by people in the private sector <e> <s> will they be responsible for providing the benefits guaranteed in the original scheme <e> <s> will that carry over to a company which is dominated by private investment <e>", "<cs> i am talking not only about pensions but about general working conditions and rates of pay <e> <s> i do not criticise the private sector but history shows that people employed in the public sector tend to have a right written into the terms of their contract which gives them better protection for future employment pensions and redundancy payments than are given for those employed in the private sector <e> <s> the employees may be given guarantees under the scheme as it is envisaged at present but the government may decide as they can as the bill now stands that the local authority must sell per cent <e> <s> of its shares to the private sector if it wants to go into the open market for investment <e> <s> in other words it will become per cent <e> <s> dominated by the private sector <e> <s> what will then happen to the employees who were employed within the public sector <e> <s> will they lose their protection or not <e>", "<cs> that may be so but does it not lose certain benefits under the bill which would accrue to it if it sold per cent <e> <s> of the shares <e> <s> that is part of the bills provisions is it not <e> <s> certain sections of the bill are twisting the arms of the local authorities to make them divest themselves of per cent <e> <s> of the shares of the company <e> <s> if they do not certain financial facilities will be withheld from them <e> <s> that is the point that i am trying to make <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that the government by pursuing this policy are imposing a form of to use another description rate-capping on publicly-owned airports unless they privatise themselves per cent <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may put the point following the previous noble lords speech that if the debt to the ratepayers is increased in certain circumstances could that not substantially be to put the local authorities concerned in the brackets where as i implied a few minutes ago they may be ratecapped for doing something that is totally unavoidable in servicing a debt that they have taken over <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> surely is not one matter the government might look at that if an authority finds itself in that situation it should receive the most sympathetic consideration from the government in its rate support grant the block grant it receives <e> <s> otherwise they may well find that in servicing that they are milking resources away from other services which are more important to the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i was glad to hear the extended list that the secretary of state read out <e> <s> however does he not acknowledge that there is a glaring omission from that list which is the institute of maintenance and building management <e> <s> it represents the group of people who manage local authorities own building departments and who probably <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the last unemployment figures show that in the regions where unemployment is worse in the united kingdom as a whole unemployment is increasing whereas in the south-east the south-west and east anglia where unemployment is at its lowest it is now falling <e> <s> is that occurring by accident or by design <e> <s> when will the government do something to reverse that trend <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened to the statement repeated by the minister i ask whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords taking those figures as an indication of the economic barometer is the noble lord the minister aware that the figures issued by the government today show that over the first quarter apart from an increase in oil production of per cent <e> <s> the highest oil production we have ever had the economy grew by per cent <e> <s> and manufacturing output fell by per cent <e> <s> is that not a dangerous trend <e> <s> does it not indicate that the government even with the fall in oil prices are allowing an increase to balance their books <e> <s> is that not a dangerous way to run the economy when the manufacturing base is still falling while service industries are increasing <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that it is clear from all the figures bandied about today that a further fall in the price of oil of the dimension mentioned by my noble friend and colleague lord williams would be absolutely disastrous for our economy <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that unless the suggestion made by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that this problem should be dealt with on an international basis is adopted recent incidents will only lend weight to the argument of those people who are already shouting over here about the possibility of ceasing almost immediately to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes <e> <s> is it not a fact that if we did opt out prematurely but our competitors in nuclear energy did not we might well lose out for all time because we would never keep up with the technology required to make nuclear installations safer anyway <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak only very briefly on this amendment because in moving it the noble earl lord dudley made an absolutely first-class case of the reasons for it <e> <s> but the clause and the amendment are really about the impact of the financial consequences of this bill on local authorities <e> <s> i think your lordships will recall and i hope the minister does that during the last proceedings in your lordships committee on this bill i made a rather pre-emptive point that is relevant today <e>", "<cs> does the minister not understand that his reply is not very convincing to those of us who have seen the development of these airports over the years <e> <s> i speak specifically about manchester <e> <s> historically the airport has been run by a committee of manchester corporation <e> <s> although there was an airport director the person who serviced the airport was the town clerk or an officer appointed by him <e> <s> the local authorities will in my opinion wish to retain the majority shares in any of the companies that are formed <e> <s> i see nothing odd in the majority of the shareholders in a company wishing to say who <e>", "<cs> the government are not being consistent in their approach on the basis that per cent <e> <s> of the holding shall literally determine who the secretary will be <e> <s> there are some spin-offs from local government reorganisation and the dissolution of counties which mean that per cent <e> <s> of some substantial financial holdings have become the responsibility of chairmen of residuary bodies <e> <s> that per cent <e> <s> formerly held by counties is now held by the districts <e> <s> but no such condition is being applied at present by the outgoing secretary of state <e> <s> he is allowing the private sector that has per cent <e> <s> almost <e>", "<cs> i beg to support the amendment so well moved by my friend and colleague on the front bench lord williams because i think this is one of the most important clauses of the bill <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> may i raise one point with the minister before we go any further with the amendment <e> <s> the minister will recall that during my previous speech on this amendment i referred to the fact that it must be quantified if manchester airport is to develop on behalf of the region and is accepted as the major regional airport outside the south-east <e> <s> the figure quoted for the third terminal and all the support services for that at this time is million <e> <s> the city of manchester holds just over half the shares in the airport and the other districts have the other half <e> <s> i think it is fair to assume that manchester would need to raise capital of about million to develop that facet at the airport based on todays prices <e> <s> it must be borne in mind that since the city of manchester which is a very deprived area and is accepted as such by everybody has lost million in rate support grant <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again but does the minister really expect local authorities to accept that guarantee in view of the fact that when another policy was implemented by this present government the sale of council houses local authorities were given a guarantee that the resources from the sales would be made available to them <e> <s> in fact the overwhelming majority of the money is being withheld <e> <s> does the minister really expect the local authorities to believe the undertakings that the government are giving on this issue <e>", "<cs> but does the minister really think that when the bill becomes an act the people who become the shareholders in this body will pay a high regard to conservation bearing in mind that their main objective in privatisation is to make it pay commercially with the priority being their own interests <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise again but i do not think it does where the main motive for what is being done is profit in the private sector <e> <s> unless the guarantees are included as stated by previous speakers from the various benches <e> <s> i cannot see any such thing happening to the degree that we want it to <e> <s> that is why i say that the amendment should be considered more seriously than it has been so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however would he not agree that welcome as those measures may be they are in no way sufficient to deal with the present situation of nearly million unemployed half of whom it is calculated will never get another job <e> <s> will the minister tell us to whom he directed his statement last week that the country has never had such a good time <e> <s> was he directing it at and taking into account the million people who are unemployed or was he directing it to the millionaires in this country whose numbers have increased by per cent <e> <s> over the last five years <e>", "<cs> my lords cutting through all the figures that have been bandied about today is it not a fact that the most dangerous feature of unemployment is that our manufacturing base is still shrinking <e> <s> is it also not a fact that we still have lower wage rates than most of our major competitors <e> <s> when can we expect the shrinkage of our manufacturing base to stop and the base to start moving upwards <e> <s> is this not the absolute keystone of our real economic recovery <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that in the north of england there is evidence at hand to show that for some beekeepers whole colonies of bees have been wiped out and that these people are facing bankruptcy <e> <s> will the minister cast his mind back to two or three winters ago when because of severe snow falls farmers in various parts of the country received government assistance to save them from such bankruptcy <e> <s> could this type of financial assistance for people who are facing financial ruin be extended as suggested by the noble lord who put the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and naturally for the report which contains some optimistic predictions <e> <s> but is it not a fact that the report also says that unemployment especially long-term unemployment is likely to remain with us until the s and that per cent <e> <s> of all the people unemployed have been so for more than two years <e> <s> may i ask the secretary of state when he expects this figure to start to fall significantly in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware with reference to his reply to an earlier supplementary question that neither wales nor scotland are featured in the report <e> <s> the manpower services commission will be reporting later on both these areas of the united kingdom <e> <s> is the minister also not aware that the report itself states that because of the criteria being altered by the government there are another half million people who could be added to the current figure of million unemployed in real terms <e> <s> are we not in fact talking about million unemployment and not million which is the number now being given <e> <s> also does the minister have any intention in the near or far future of altering the criteria yet again to mask the situation and not present it as it really is <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak in favour of the amendment <e> <s> i support the comments of the noble lord lord lloyd regarding the brief intervention of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> his advice is always valuable but in a strange departure from his usual <e>", "<cs> my lords as with the privatisation of the bus companies the noble lord has missed the bus <e> <s> i was not talking about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord obviously was not listening to me <e> <s> he may have been talking <e> <s> i was making the point that it is not a question of the siting of airports it is a question of the equalisation of treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing the bill and not what has happened in the past <e> <s> we are discussing what effect the bill will have on airports <e> <s> during our earlier proceedings on the bill i referred as did others to the fact that to develop manchester in the foreseeable future will require another terminal costing in excess of million <e> <s> whatever format manchester takes after the passage of this bill it will be expected to find that million <e> <s> during my contribution on this amendment i said that with a turnover of just over million stansted had made a loss of almost the same amount <e> <s> that money was found by somebody else <e> <s> i am asking what will happen in the future <e> <s> it is not equal treatment whichever way one looks at it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister referred to the governments intention to repeal the rent act but is he not aware that the last time a conservative government did that in no extra houses for letting were produced at all <e> <s> all that happened in taking away the protection from the tenant was to force up rents and introduce rachmanism which no one wants to see return <e> <s> since the government took office there has been a loss of properties for rent in all sectors the waiting lists have increased from just over million to million the homeless have increased from to and requests for sheltered and wheelchair accommodation now stand at a quarter of a million <e> <s> does not the minister agree that the measures outlined in his answer to the noble lord lord grimond are totally inadequate to deal with the problems we now face <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay your lordships much longer <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord brougham and vaux to my colleague on the front bench lord underhill and to my colleague the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for their support <e> <s> i can understand the concern of lord graham regarding the london boroughs because if there are major parking problems generally surely the metropolis itself has the worst one of all

ministers prejudice against public sector housing <e> <s> he mentioned my reference to private capital being involved in housing <e> <s> he obviously had not read carefully the motion on the order paper <e> <s> the point which i was making and which i have made again and again is that private money will not flood in to rescue the public building stock <e> <s> it never has done and it never will do so unless it is matched by government money <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble and long-standing friend lord fitt for giving way <e> <s> is he being fair when only one member of the ulster unionist party was in attendance at that debate <e> <s> as a former mp i represented a constituency in england <e> <s> i would have loved a four-hour debate on the area i represented <e> <s> it

areas of the country where power station manufacturers are in the main situated in the north-east the north-west and the midlands there could be further serious unemployment problems if there is no increase in the ordering programme of the cegb <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether he is aware that the cegb itself has forecast that probably from onwards it could be ordering megawatts a year <e> <s> would it not make sense in view of the unemployment situation for the secretary of state to intervene to bring forward the ordering of some of these coal-fired power stations bearing in mind that they have a very good export potential <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to put a further question to the minister <e> <s> i made the point to him that if a programme is not brought forward there could be serious consequences regarding further unemployment in the north-east the north-west and parts of the midlands <e> <s> will the minister take this into account and use his best endeavours with the secretary of state at least to consider bringing forward such a programme in the interests of the people in those areas of the country <e>", "<cs> i should not want to develop the line of argument so ably and well put by my noble friend on the front bench but having heard the ministers reply i should like to study some of his comments bearing in mind that he clearly indicated that the employers in clothing factories certainly did not want to go as far down the road as this bill will take them <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw my amendment but i shall consider what the minister has said and perhaps return to this point at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to the ministers replies to some of the points made on this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that the minister understands how many of the establishments which come under the different wages councils work <e> <s> if the minister and the government are so convinced that wage rates decided by the boards are too high can he explain why such a substantial proportion of people covered by the boards are paid wages so low that the establishments in which they work have to impose surcharges of per cent <e> <s> in gratuities in order to attract people to the jobs <e> <s> how does he relate the two if the base rate is overpaid <e>", "<cs> the minister a few minutes ago was philosophising on the main purpose of the bill <e> <s> he actually said that it was to lower rates of pay in order to spread jobs out <e> <s> i did not draw any other conclusion <e> <s> the bill cannot have any other effect or intent <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in various parts of the world where there is no nuclear energy whatsoever there have been surveys which show clusters of leukaemia <e> <s> would it not be rather premature to start talking about closing successful nuclear energy plants based on so much inconclusive evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the kind of fears expressed by my friend and colleague on the front bench the noble lord lord graham of edmonton about the group of workers at that factory are also expressed by the workers at the royal ordnance tank factory at barnbow in leeds <e> <s> may i take it that the workers at the tank factory at barnbow in leeds can carry on on the understanding that in the foreseeable future there will be no change in their circumstances or ownership <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that on th june the very responsible magazine <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to give the house an idea of what the governments response is can the minister tell us whether it is correct that the previous secretary of state for the environment put in a bid for an extra billion for local authority housing which has been reduced by mr ridley his successor by billion <e> <s> is that the governments answer to turn their back on the problem by reducing bids <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only express my absolute disappointment at the emptiness of the reply <e> <s> i think that the noble lord who spoke from the government back-benches made a miniature second reading speech rather than a speech in reply to what i said on moving the amendment <e> <s> i made the point and i think i made it quite clearly that we are dealing with people at the very lowest end of the wage scale working in some of the poorest conditions <e> <s> i am convinced that to remove the wages councils and the protection that they give will only exacerbate that situation <e> <s> when i was talking about the people who had died i said i was aware that it was not a wages council responsibility and i was using that as an example to indicate the type of conditions for some of those people in their so-called workshops <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the questions that have already been asked today may i ask the minister whether he has had any discussions with the small boat manufacturers in this country regarding this matter <e> <s> it could have serious consequences for them in terms of employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply from the noble lord the secretary of state but i find very little comfort in it <e> <s> may i ask the secretary of state whether he can tell us what are the latest figures available to him and whether they show a further diminution in our manufacturing base <e> <s> if they do does this not in conjunction with the fall in the price of oil to less than nine dollars a barrel bode ill for our economic future <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is she aware that according to page of the report in dealing with deaths from heart disease infant mortality cervical cancer and lung cancer we are not anywhere near as successful as other people and that in fact we are slipping considerably down the league <e> <s> can the minister possibly tell your lordships the reason for this and say whether the government have any plans to deal with the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware that one of the most disturbing features in the report is the fact that as was predicted over years ago when the first reports were published on the dangers of smoking increasing numbers of women in this country are now dying of lung cancer <e> <s> could the minister take special note of this and see whether there are any measures that could be introduced which might deal in some way with this increasing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i too welcome the statement although i have some dubiety about some of the assumptions that are contained within it <e> <s> may i ask the minister what he meant when he said in paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the secretary of state in setting the gre levels which i do not think are being set here has power to move them downwards and depress them <e> <s> is it not a fact that if you depress them below a certain point you could be in a net gain position with the clawback you would get by people being drawn in because they have exceeded their gres <e>", "<cs> my lords may i answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the minister to respond to what i think was an important point i made on the question of consultation <e> <s> may i also tell my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls that the difference between us is probably that i got to a photocopier quicker than he did <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that members of my trade union and other <e>", "<cs> my lords first i wish to join previous speakers in complimenting and congratu-lating our two new peers the noble lord lord hesketh and the noble lord lord davies on what i think we all agree were excellent contributions to this debate we hope that on numerous occasions in the future we shall have the benefit of their wisdom and experience <e>", "<cs> i should like to come in here very briefly to deal first with the points made by the noble lord lord bellwin and we have quite often clashed in local government <e> <s> he is not quite correct in this particular instance because the minister who resigned from office the noble lord lord elton during the speech he made at second reading gave as his sole reason for the introduction of the high discount the fact that there was a disappointing response from people wishing to buy the flats in which they lived <e> <s> the previous minister made no mention at all of any pressures from outside to increase it <e> <s> i think that response was the sole basis which debunks the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of repeating the first point that i made in my previous small discourse at this box regarding my own partys previous position concerning the sale of council houses <e> <s> but here i have to say quite forcefully something that i said or years ago when conservative local authorities began the sale of council houses <e> <s> at that time i called it a form of legalised <e>", "<cs> they are not allowed to <e>", "<cs> it will of course come as no surprise to the overwhelming majority of noble lords present if i say that for once i am in total support of the minister and what he has said <e> <s> i think the difficulty is that if this amendment was accepted it would once again create not one category but a sort of conglomerate of categories depending on when people decided to exercise certain options within the whole movement <e> <s> whether the noble lord lord coleraine would like it or not this particular amendment could result in some rather lucrative rackets in housing <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the minister has made <e> <s> obviously when arriving at a figure such as a maximum rebate that a person can obtain one must be very careful not to become too parochial in what is really a national situation <e> <s> i accept that as time moves on if the policy remains the same the figures have to be reviewed because costs alter <e> <s> but being a north country man with quite a lot of big city experience strangely in both lancashire and yorkshire i have to say that the increase in house prices there is insignificant compared with that in london <e> <s> whatever the government decide to do about altering the figure of they must be very careful that they are not once again seen to be giving to people who reside in the south as against those who do not <e>", "<cs> having said that i am extremely grateful for the information which the minister has conveyed <e> <s> naturally when it appears we shall look at it carefully <e>", "<cs> when moving this amendment the minister commended it by saying that his explanation of its effects would be extremely complicated <e> <s> i and my colleagues on the front bench agree wholeheartedly with him but that does not help us <e> <s> i should have thought that it might have been possible for the government to let us have something in writing explaining the effects of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i commented on the fact that the minister said that this was a complicated amendment and that the explanation would be complicated <e> <s> i find it even more complicated because the minister said that he has some doubts about the effects that his amendment will bring about <e>", "<cs> the minister has not assuaged my fears and he certainly will not have assuaged the fears of the local authorities <e> <s> they say that the amendment will tip the situation in favour of the purchasing tenant as against the local authority <e> <s> i must remind the minister that the people about whom we are talking are the council tenants who will remain in the block of flats <e> <s> when the bill has to be paid it will mean that people who have bought a council flat will have their structural defects i am speaking in the jargon remedied at the expense of existing tenants <e> <s> that is the point that i am trying to get across <e>", "<cs> this also includes improvements <e> <s> is not one of the factors at the heart of the matter that people are being encouraged by substantial and generous discounts to buy property in a rather unprotected manner <e> <s> no other section of the community buying a house would be advised that the person selling the house should also act as surveyor of the property <e> <s> that is an absolute nonsense <e> <s> i happen to be an owner-occupier <e> <s> i believe in owner-occupation where people can afford it and desire to be an owner-occupier <e> <s> i would absolutely quake at the thought of the person selling me the house surveying it and saying that it would remain in the same condition for five years <e>", "<cs> it is the same principle <e>", "<cs> bearing in mind that the amendment is linked to some degree with the governments own previous amendment and also taking account of the ministers assurance that the points i have made will be looked into i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there has been some misunderstanding <e> <s> i was not aware that amendment no <e> <s> had been grouped with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> that is a misunderstanding on my part <e>", "<cs> i do not think that alters one iota the principle of the argument <e> <s> we are opposed to almost all that has been said in this clause and what the government are trying to do <e> <s> we think that at the end of the day if there is going to be any fall guy it will be the local authority housing tenant <e> <s> the minister says that there could be a substantial upgrading <e> <s> he cannot have been listening in this chamber for the past two or three years when we have been pressing ministers and their predecessors about the cuts in housing investment programmes <e> <s> i should like to <e>", "<cs> the noble lord on the government back bench dealt with the question of housing associations <e> <s> it became clear from the ministers answer to him earlier that we are not talking about new money <e> <s> i think the minister said that it would come from the housing corporations global money <e> <s> if you apply that to the public sector i cannot see the government not finding new money for the voluntary housing sector and yet finding it for the local authority sector <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for explaining these amendments so far <e> <s> he is right in saying that the reasons for these amendments are the fears of tenants regarding the question of security of tenancy that in a way they have enjoyed historically <e> <s> but i do not see where there are enough guarantees although i accept the ministers sincerity that will suffice for the people i have met <e>", "<cs> does not paragraph mean that it removes from the tenant the normal right to have recourse to law if by accident or design the local authority and the secretary of state allow the proposal to go out of time <e> <s> i see that the minister shakes his head but i should like to see how it would actually work <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord takes that view <e> <s> i have been here since three oclock <e> <s> i have not moved out of the chamber other than to have a meal <e> <s> those members of the committee who know me know that i am not noted for filibustering either here or in the other place <e> <s> that was a little naughty because the opposition take the view that this is the most important part of the bill <e>", "<cs> in this particular part of the clause i found rather odd the explanation the minister has given as to why the amendment is not needed <e> <s> one assumes from his answer that some new ground is going to be broken in the improvement of council houses <e> <s> i have to tell the minister that to years ago some local authorities started to improve their pre-war estates on a massive scale <e> <s> i was the chairman of housing in manchester when we embarked on a programme for improving pre-war houses a year <e> <s> that was done with four different contractors <e> <s> you do not get the same results from every area <e> <s> those improvements were not carried out in pockets in a small number of houses <e> <s> i think the average number of houses in the first contracts was about <e>", "<cs> before the minister leaves that aspect and i am sorry to come back at this late stage can he answer the point <e> <s> i think that it is a realistic one <e> <s> the minister has on more than one occasion talked about the demolition of properties within an area leaving other properties standing <e> <s> if there is an estate with say or houses and that was a common number of houses to form a council estate and if it is said we will demolish some of these houses we will give it a better density and demolish houses who is going to be the arbiter as to which houses shall be demolished <e> <s> some of the tenants will say why are you knocking my home down when there are other tenants at the other end of the estate who have not been here as long as i have <e> <s> who is the arbiter who will decide <e> <s> surely in those circumstances one tenant has the same rights as another <e>", "<cs> but the whole process of the bill is supposed to be about people <e> <s> the minister has kept saying that but now he has switched tracks <e> <s> he is saying that it is a management function never mind the people the management will make the decision <e> <s> we are saying that the decision is so important to the people who live in those houses that they should have a very high input into what decision is made and they should not be treated in such a manner <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and i believe he will not be surprised if i still insist that the amendment would be beneficial to all concerned <e> <s> i would correct the minister on one thing <e> <s> when he speaks of old houses and old estates being difficult to let i must say to him that in my experience it is some of the more modern estates that are difficult to let <e> <s> at the outbreak of war some of the big cities in the country built about houses <e> <s> cities like manchester liverpool leeds and sheffield were all on the mark for pre-war houses with very few flats <e> <s> once those houses were upgraded and the programme was under way and once serious inroads had been made into bringing them up to standard they were in no way difficult to let <e>", "<cs> at this stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have heard what the minister has said and in view of the time of evening i should like to study later what he has said on this particular occasion <e> <s> i am not by any means convinced on this question of another person <e> <s> i am getting a little repetitive but as i have said we are supposed to be talking about people <e> <s> it may well be as the minister has said that the tenants themselves may be involved in making the decision but i remain to be convinced that people will become private landlords on behalf of local authority tenants for the good of the tenants themselves <e> <s> i fail to see that there are such animals roaming abroad wanting such work <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister has said that the inquiry would be only at the behest of local authorities and that they would have to be involved <e> <s> i should like to see what the local authorities have to say about what the minister said about them before committing myself <e> <s> on that note i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that anybody should welcome an increase in the number of properties to be let in the rented sector provided they are let at rents that people can afford <e> <s> the minister will also be aware of a statement that was made by mr john patten at the party conference yesterday about a policy regarding this matter <e> <s> he indicated that forthcoming legislation would however carry a degree of protection for the potential tenants who will occupy those houses <e> <s> can the minister give an undertaking that any such future measures as are introduced will give an absolute guarantee and undertaking to protect the existing tenants in the private sector and will not reintroduce exploitation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i fully concur with what my noble friend on the front bench said regarding the withdrawal since of financial resources from the trafford area <e> <s> having worked in trafford park till becoming a member of another place i have to say that any new input of finance in order to re-invigorate the industrial activity there must be welcome <e> <s> but may i also urge the minister as other noble lords have done not on this occasion to bypass the local authority as to do so may well set up an obstruction which would be counter-productive to anybody <e> <s> may i urge him to involve them as much as he can in all the proceedings <e>", "<cs> the person involved in that exercise was obviously someone who knew of the right and was literate and articulate enough to take that course <e> <s> in the main we are talking about people who would not pursue that course and that is why i am pursuing this matter <e>", "<cs> first let me disabuse the minister of a point he made in his first intervention in this debate <e> <s> he said that the proposal would not solve the housing problem implying that i was the one who said it would <e> <s> i never said that at all <e> <s> i said that it would more clearly identify the national housing problem <e> <s> i did not say it would go any way to solve it <e> <s> however i find it strange that people would support a continuation of the present situation where for example in some areas people over years of age <e>", "<cs> i am aware of everything that the noble lord has said <e> <s> we have been through it before <e> <s> but is he also saying that if such an operation occurs and the sale takes place by a majority vote of the tenants the minority would give up their statutory rights within the terms of the sale <e>", "<cs> the minister is saying then that if it was a per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> verdict in favour of selling the tenancies the per cent <e> <s> will lose all their statutory rights <e> <s> that is what this is about <e>", "<cs> i totally disagree with what the minister is saying in his analysis of this matter <e> <s> he knows that we extensively discussed what the format would be in the organisation of these ballots and how the verdict would be conveyed to the minister as to the tenants wishes <e> <s> but is it not true that a lot of ballots of this type are affected by what is put on the ballot paper <e>", "<cs> succession of tenancy <e>", "<cs> i shall not say that the minister becomes more glib because it is not a very nice word but he becomes more misunderstanding of the facts of what take place in council houses <e> <s> he said one of the prime things the tenants would retain was the right to buy the house <e> <s> is it not obvious that anybody who was going to buy his house would have bought it already <e> <s> most of the people we are talking about have chosen to remain as tenants of municipal housing <e> <s> they are not prospective buyers or they would already have bought under the generous scheme that the government have offered unless of course the government amendment that was tabled to give the secretary of state the right to move the points of discount upwards means that eventually the government have in mind giving them away <e> <s> i cannot see any reason to make it a point in an issue of this kind that the tenants of the properties involved will retain the right to buy because in my opinion they are not potential buyers to start with <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make the briefest of comments <e> <s> the minister made quite a lot of play about the fact that the tenants would be protected under the rent acts as they remain <e> <s> i think that is what he said <e> <s> but is it not now the governments policy eventually to phase out the rent acts <e> <s> would that mean that the total number involved would then not have historic protection and statutory rights <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not think that the undertakings the minister has highlighted again as he did on tuesday give to the tenants if they are transferred to the private sector anything like the protection that we would desire to see <e> <s> however there has been so much said today about the subject including the legal interpretations that i should like to look at what has been said and perhaps come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the minister is trying a very hard sell here but he is not succeeding with anyone on this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> may i put a very brief point <e> <s> i was interested to hear the minister say that the department was monitoring the situation on homelessness at present <e> <s> bearing in mind that the number of people under the present act is increasing significantly can the minister indicate when such <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for what the minister has said so far <e> <s> however can he indicate when the monitoring will take place so that it can be analysed and the government can take the necessary action <e> <s> what is the time factor for the ending of the monitoring and the analysis resulting from it <e>", "<cs> i think that it is a logical solution <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and deal with the question of the physical standard of accommodation provided under assured tenancies <e> <s> we consider the governments approach on this is unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> can the minister give us the number of assured tenancies in being at present and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the intervention of my noble friend lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> i was not aware of the figures that the minister gave <e> <s> we were not bowling a fast ball at him or a bumper when i asked him how many assured tenancies there were <e> <s> it seems to me pretty obvious and i think the government will have to admit it that on the basis of those numbers over the year and of the number of people involved in providing those -odd assured tenancies the thing has been a flop in terms of dimension <e> <s> with my natural political non-coyness something from which we all suffer in this building i assume that the new scheme is designed to do something similar to that which the government are hoping to do by raising discounts so as to make the scheme more widespread and encourage a bigger take-up <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers helpful answer <e> <s> of course i shall withdraw the amendment and look forward to what the minister may be able to come back with at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i think most people know that the original scheme was for new properties only and the bill would extend this to older property <e> <s> did the minister use the words substantial improvement in answer to my noble friend lord graham <e> <s> that raises a query as to what the government mean by substantial <e> <s> if i am any judge of work that is done in property now in the way of repair rehabilitation and improvement will not go far towards such work in london or the south-east <e> <s> this is where we must come back once again to the fact that that may well even double and that may be an underestimate <e> <s> this may be one of the cases where the scheme may founder due to the money made available being totally insufficient <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has put her finger on the button and i shall put it another way <e> <s> if one has this type of property where part is rented and part purchased are we not seeing two different sets of standards <e> <s> my colleague indicated that the rent may go up but is it not also a fact that at the same time persons in the other part of the building who are purchasing their part of the property could be receiving an increasing amount of money from mortgage rate relief <e> <s> i have in mind that our responsible press recently have been preparing us for an increase in mortgage rates <e> <s> the whole thing therefore becomes a hotch-potch <e>", "<cs> is it the governments intention to dispose of all new town housing in one way or another as quickly as they possibly can <e> <s> if so what will happen to the runcorns of this country which no local authority wants <e> <s> how long will they remain as new town houses <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> without naming any new towns the point i am trying to make is that all the new towns have not been a success sociologically <e> <s> as the minister said some of them are new towns but in certain parts of the country they are very high problem areas <e> <s> on that basis does anybody expect a local authority with all the troubles and the shortage of finance they have to want a new town unloaded on it <e> <s> i think the minister knows which new towns i am talking about <e>", "<cs> i do not want to continue this discourse much longer but when we are talking about financing some of these new towns and about housing i suspect that these could be per cent <e> <s> or more of the tenants in new town houses on social security and some either fully or in part will not be able to pay the debt <e> <s> what is the answer to that in the terms of who will want to take those over or who will bear the bill for that <e>", "<cs> i think the fact that nacro and other such bodies are vitally interested in this indicates that a lot of the areas we are speaking about where tenants associations are required and need to be funded by the local authority are the problem areas <e> <s> i accept the premise on which the noble lord lord mottistone has made his contribution but i think there is a slight difference between dolphin square and its tenants association and the type of area we are speaking about here <e> <s> the areas are quite dissimilar <e>", "<cs> it is late in the evening and although i am not satisfied or happy with the reply i have received i intend to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> but at the end of the day we shall have to move towards the type of proposals contained in the amendment <e> <s> while the spin-off benefits that would be achieved in the community as a whole if the amendment were accepted could not be identified or quantified at this point of time they would be more substantial than what would be paid out by the local authority in financing tenants associations <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am sorry that he cannot agree with the amendment but i am delighted to hear what he says about the cross grouping of ministers who are dealing with the problem <e> <s> before taking this further i shall have a look at what he said analyse it and perhaps refer to it in the later stages of this bill in this chamber <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however bearing in mind information issued from government sources some weeks ago to the effect that coal still has a part to play in our future energy resources and that there will be new coal-fired stations in the ordering programme does it not make sense now to pre-empt the sizewell decision and because of the employment situation in the turbine manufacturing industry to bring forward a programme of ordering two coal-fired power stations as i understand that they have an extremely high export potential <e>", "<cs> my lords may i finally ask the minister whether he is aware that the areas of the country where the turbines for these power stations will be manufactured which include trafford park manchester and the north-east are among the areas of highest unemployment and that recently there have been further redundancies in the turbine manufacturing industry in the north-east <e> <s> may i therefore ask the government to use what endeavours they can to speed up this ordering programme and avoid what could be further disastrous redundancies in one of our best industries <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that a large part of the case that the minister has put forward for the withholding or freezing of these sums of money that belong to the local authorities is very spurious indeed <e> <s> only two years ago the present chancellor halved the amounts of money that were made available during a year when council house activity in general building repairs and so on was reduced to its lowest level since the first world war <e> <s> where is the ministers proof that the release of increased and absorbable amounts of money and putting that figure back to the amount the local authorities were asking for two years ago would overheat the building industry when it is stagnant and people are still being laid off in increasing numbers in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way on this point but is it not a fact that since this government came into office in they have cut far in excess of that from the amount being funded by the chancellor of the exchequer to the building programme <e> <s> why is the minister saying that such action would be inflationary <e> <s> it would only be inflationary relatively because the government have savaged the building programme <e> <s> all that the local authorities are asking for is the money that belongs to them <e> <s> they should be allowed to use it in place of the money that the government have withdrawn from supporting them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my colleague for that intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that we gave that point some mileage in committee <e> <s> i do not for one moment wish to take part in a jousting contest with legal giants such as the noble lords lord broxbourne and lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter sometimes has a habit of firing bullets that turn into boomerangs <e> <s> he challenged me and my colleagues about our position on trade union ballots <e> <s> in committee he introduced the subject of subsidies to the mining industry <e> <s> what the two things have to do with housing legislation i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister dealt with financial matters in the way that he calculated his percentages in that answer he would be a financial wizard <e> <s> he has just made per cent <e> <s> of the minority on a council estate <e> <s> what he said was that if only a minority on a council estate which could be as low as per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> bother to reply it will be taken that the silent per cent <e> <s> or so are deemed to be in favour <e> <s> i do not believe it works like that <e> <s> that is why a short time ago my noble friend lord stallard and i were asking for a specific form of approach by letter from the local authority when the final decision was to be taken <e> <s> i still do not believe that you will ever get a true picture of what the majority of tenants want by the procedures that the minister is explaining hard though he is trying <e> <s> but having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister will recall that i dealt with this part of the bill in committee <e> <s> i am firmly of the opinion that when he answered the minister gave the impression to the committee either intentionally or unintentionally that the figure of was being reconsidered <e> <s> most noble lords who were present took that to mean that it was being reconsidered in order to be moved upwards as the point had been raised in another place <e> <s> the figure of was the one bandied about in another place <e> <s> the minister for housing in another place indicated that he would look into the point being raised by the opposition that probably twice that amount would be required for london and a scaled down figure for other areas in the country <e> <s> can the minister say why there has been a change of heart or did we misunderstand him at the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he deal with the point i made as to why it is now and <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships house understood that the figure of which was being tentatively used in another place was to be reviewed to take into account the overtures made by the opposition in another place that the would be inadequate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the assistance of my colleague on the front bench for pulling that part of the matter together <e> <s> i was sorry to hear the minister in his opening remarks say that he was not a sluggard in his dealings with race relations <e> <s> i hope that i did not convey the impression that i thought that he was <e>", "<cs> my lords i had no intention of speaking to this amendment <e> <s> however the ministers case related solely to the protection given to tenants by the consultation procedure as found in the provisions in schedule <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> which has been put down in the names of the noble baroness lady david the noble countess lady mar and myself relates to schedule <e> <s> i shall not speak for very long because i shall make the majority of my remarks on that amendment but the fact of the matter is that once again the minister read out the same reasons that he gave in committee and at report stage and repeated almost verbatim the protection that the tenant has in the consultation procedure <e> <s> however the actual kick in schedule is contained in the last paragraph which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> the overwhelming part of the ministers case when he was trying to convince your lordships that there was no necessity for a public inquiry consisted of trying to hide behind or use the provisions of schedule <e> <s> that is why i intervened <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to detain the house much longer on this amendment <e> <s> we all know that the principle involved has had quite lengthy discussion during the proceedings of this bill at all stages <e> <s> i think the minister put the case in a nutshell when he said that the tenants have the fullest protection or words to that effect of the secretary of state if they do not follow the consultations as contained in the clause and in the schedule <e> <s> that i think i accepted earlier on <e> <s> what i am asking is this who protects the tenant if the secretary of sate defaults either by accident or by design though i would not for one moment put that as a possibility <e> <s> but on a mistake being made the tenant has no protection and if it is either the secretary of state or his department that falls down then it is hard luck on the tenant but the purchaser retains the fullest protection all along the line <e> <s> on the basis of that i do not think i can withdraw the amendment and i should like to test the views of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister once again appears to have defended the financial situation that the government have imposed on local authorities since they took office that of increasing resources <e> <s> however anyone involved with the situation will know that the housing investment programmes in areas that badly need high housing investment programmes have been cut severely once again this year <e> <s> when the minister speaks of government finance on housing he seems to have invented his own form of political abacus in which he moves the beads to where they suit his own political purposes <e> <s> having said that i do not think we are going to get any sympathy from the government <e> <s> in fact the sums of money required are far in excess of what this particular new clause would achieve though i think it would benefit some areas <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before we finally commit the bill out of this house perhaps i may briefly indicate my support for the sentiments expressed by my colleagues behind me my noble friends lady david and lord davies <e> <s> i am not too sure and never have been convinced that the bill will achieve what the government think it will achieve in increasing the sale of council property and that type of thing <e> <s> i still have one area of deep concern that is the question of the rights of tenants in the consultative process <e> <s> although the government carried the day i think that the size of your lordships vote against the proposal is indicative of a great deal of concern still in that area <e> <s> only time will tell how it will work out <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact despite the progress that the minister indicated in answer to a previous supplementary question that we still have the reputation of being the biggest polluter in europe in our production of acid rain <e> <s> can the minister tell us when we can expect substantial progress towards eliminating acid rain entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that the noble lord lord paget makes a valid point when he says that if and i use the word it deliberately a policy of phasing out nuclear energy is carried out it follows as sure as night follows day that a substitute has to be brought in <e> <s> that substitute may be more labour-intensive than the nuclear energy industry <e> <s> are we not listening to only one side of the equation and is that fair at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware of a report published last week in the city of leeds indicating that in the first nine months of this year children suffered sexual abuse within the family and that it is believed that such incidents in the city of leeds average a year <e> <s> is she also aware that the officer in charge of the investigation said that leeds is only mirroring what is happening in every city <e> <s> if that is correct is it not appalling that children suffer sexual abuse within the family on such a scale <e> <s> if there are no provisions in the announcement that the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that detailed and technical reply <e> <s> i am also grateful because it indicates that the government are taking definitive action on this problem <e> <s> of course i do not accept that coal-fired power stations are the sole villains of the piece on this matter of acid rain <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the details that the noble viscount gave regarding progress since but will he please understand that all of those who are interested in this problem and the discussions which are taking place with a variety of people across the board hope that once a decision has been reached it will be implemented as speedily as possible <e> <s> obviously even a small emission will still be a contribution to poisoning the atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first compliment and express my appreciation to the noble lord <e> <s> lord ezra on introducing this particular subject for debate as we start to move into the winter months <e> <s> those of us who are as it is termed well shod and well housed and able to provide ourselves with warm homes do not welcome winter but we do not particularly fear it because we have the capacity to cope with it <e> <s> the noble lord lord ezra gave some figures which i believe have been revealed before <e> <s> he spoke of million people who are not in that position <e> <s> i think he said that some million of them were elderly people <e> <s> one would assume therefore that as to the other million we are talking in the main about people who are unemployed or who have to be supported by social benefits of various kinds <e> <s> i would suspect that a high percentage of those particular families include small children who are also at risk <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that some chairmen of residuary bodies in other parts of the country where districts wish to purchase or take over public assets left by the counties are acting like little dictators <e> <s> was that also the intention of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly do so with regard to wakefield and what was west yorkshires county hall <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the taking and selling of hard drugs and the new phenomenon of aids are perhaps the two most damaging facets against life as we know it at present <e> <s> will the noble baroness plead with the government to keep the situation consistently under observation bearing in mind that the situation as we know it may unfortunately deteriorate further <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join with peers speaking before me in congratulating the noble lord lord derwent on an excellent maiden speech <e> <s> along with other peers i look forward to listening to further contributions from him <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand to be corrected by my colleague on the front bench but my figures were supplied in a written answer by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all perhaps i too may congratulate the noble viscount lord torrington and the members of his select committee on the excellent report that we are debating today <e> <s> it comes at an ideal time because of the problems that have emerged lately in the nuclear industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that if we introduce this factor only into new construction the energy saving on our total housing stock will be very small indeed <e> <s> because finite resources of energy are running out at an alarming rate will the minister ask her appropriate colleagues in the government to consider as a matter of urgency trying to introduce the application of these measures into our existing housing stock where a tremendous saving could be made <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that during that debate and in previous recent answers to the same question it has been said that the government have a policy that any new coal-fired stations will be acid rain free and that the necessary equipment will be built into any new coal-fired stations <e> <s> it is a fact that the phasing out of these magnox stations requires urgent ordering of power stations <e> <s> bearing in mind that the turbine manufacturing industry is at present in danger of further redundancies with the loss of skilled men who cannot be replaced when we need them may i ask the minister whether he will use his best endeavours to try to being forward the building of coal-fired stations pending a decision on a nuclear energy programme <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister when differentials in london weighting were last reviewed and whether there is any intention to institute such a review in the near future bearing in mind the phenomenal increase in the price of housing in london and the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful for the answer <e> <s> however is not the minister aware that this is only one of many reports indicating the situation in the building industry <e> <s> builders termed cowboys are totally abrogating their responsibilities responsibilities which have to be legally carried by registered builders <e> <s> is the minister aware that in the report which is the subject of this question it is calculated that the treasury is losing billion a year by that type of builder evading all forms of tax corporation tax income tax and any other form of payment to the government <e> <s> bearing in mind that both the building industry in total including private builders and trade unions are wholly opposed to that there must be some urgency in dealing with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other speakers in expressing my thanks and appreciation to the noble lord lord winstanley for giving us an opportunity to discuss what in a social sense is probably the most difficult problem that is facing us at present <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the housing and planning bill which we completed a few weeks ago <e> <s> is it not a fact that people from this side of the chamber not just from my party but others warned the government that activities such as those about which the noble earl lord halsbury has been speaking would take place <e> <s> that is why we thought there should be a mandatory ballot paid for by the local authority <e> <s> it would appear that the tenants do not have the protection under that bill that the government thought that they would have <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that of the aggregate arrears he has quoted quite a considerable sum may well be money which is owed by people at the very bottom end of the wage-scale who receive no support whatever but who have difficulty in meeting their rent <e> <s> how does he expect a local authority to deal with that when the only final sanction it has is eviction <e> <s> if local authorities evict <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not recall when his predecessor the noble lord lord elton earlier this year made a statement on the rates <e> <s> members of your lordships house from every quarter even from the governments own benches were critical of the chopping and changing of the rate system in which the government were indulging <e> <s> quite a lot of us wondered how local government managed to cope with these changes when they had to make financial predictions and charge accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords i too join with previous speakers in giving a welcome to this bill in principle since i was one of the members of your lordships house who spoke quite extensively on the bill dealing with sports grounds mainly football grounds that went through some months ago <e> <s> some of us thought at that time that the government were going a little too far in some of the measures they were introducing <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that even in a place where there are a number of fire exits which are clearly marked if some of those exits are locked there is danger of people being trapped and without any hope of means of escape <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for giving way <e> <s> bearing in mind that this bill stands the normal law procedures on their head in that when a prohibition is placed and an appeal is lodged the prohibition nevertheless continues to apply can the minister look very seriously at the question i put during my speech in this second reading debate as regards writing into the bill the time factors of an appeal <e> <s> this will ensure that appellants can in all justice have time to prepare a case in advance of the event rather than make an eleventh hour appeal which does not have much chance of succeeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> in simple terms does that not mean that for every four persons who applied only one applicant was accepted for her majestys forces and that three out of four applicants were refused or not required <e> <s> can the minister explain what the secretary of state for defence meant when he said some weeks ago that the implementation of a non-nuclear defence policy may well involve reintroducing conscription <e> <s> was he speaking broadly or selectively <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the figure would be in excess of the three out of four people who have been rejected as some who were of a quite high calibre were simply in excess of requirements <e> <s> would the noble lord like to put a figure on what he is saying or is he just generalising <e>", "<cs> my lords may i raise one brief point with the minister <e> <s> it is not a criticism of what he has said so far <e> <s> is it not a fact that the present prolonged severely inclement weather that we are suffering can blow sky-high the financial predictions of local authorities expenditure in the current financial year and in the preparations for their budget next year <e> <s> while i know that there at present are some statutory provisions for them to raise funds to deal with this problem bearing in mind that the predictions from the weather people are that this will be a very <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first express my appreciation to the noble lord lord lucas for the clear explanations and the objective way in which he moved this industrial training order <e>", "<cs> my lords i may be slightly wrong but it is something like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but in my question i deliberately did not refer to sizewell b because there are other problems to be dealt with <e> <s> is the noble viscount aware that the electricity council recently published a report showing that by the year there will be a necessity for megawatts of new power capacity <e> <s> this will mean building between and brand new power stations <e> <s> as it takes seven years from the ordering to the commissioning of a power station does it not make sense immediately to order two coal-fired power stations because irrespective of the public inquiry on sizewell coal will still play a major part in our energy requirements <e> <s> in view of the unemployment problems that the industry is continuing to suffer does it not make sense to place the order now <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is accepted that the cegb trigger off the mechanism for ordering power stations will the noble viscount agree that the government have some influence in this situation <e> <s> is he aware that the firms of gec and nei which was referred to by my noble friend lord glenamara as well as the firm of babcock those being the major firms that are concerned with power stations over the past years have invested nearly a quarter of a billion pounds in modernising their plants to deal with this situations <e> <s> they are not asking for government hand-outs <e> <s> they are asking for <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers answer <e> <s> i understand that financial resources have been made available <e> <s> is not the minister aware that our record as regards the care of the homeless over the past few years has been very bad <e> <s> is he aware for instance that since the number of homeless families excluding single people who are not allowed to register has risen from to last year <e> <s> the annual increase in homeless families is now per cent <e> <s> if that continues we face the possibility in the early s of having to families homeless and at the mercy of the kind of weather which we experienced last week <e> <s> are the government satisfied with that <e> <s> if they are not satisfied when will they do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister says that the financial provisions are not the reason for this situation is he not aware that successive reports that have been debated in your lordships house and one which will be debated in the near future all call for a substantial increase in government funding to deal with the housing crisis <e> <s> is the minister not aware that calculations show that cuts made by the present government since have lost over half a million new housing units to the public sector <e> <s> bearing this in mind do the government not realise that they are responsible for some of the conditions which now appertain <e>", "<cs> my lords let me commence by thanking the noble lord for the statement he has just made <e> <s> i should like to take up two or three points with him because i think he will agree that it is a rather long statement and half an hour does not allow very much time to absorb it <e> <s> of course i welcome his statement that since there have been a million new jobs created <e> <s> it would be extremely churlish of me not to do so <e> <s> but is it not a fact that recent answers in your lordships house have shown quite clearly that the overwhelming number of these jobs i think the last quotation was over but fewer than were in the service sector and the public sector <e> <s> desirable though that is such jobs are not as important to the economy as manufacturing jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister guaranteeing everybody a job for life on the basis of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i first join with previous speakers in congratulating the noble lord lord harris on bringing this very topical subject before your lordships to debate today and thanking him <e> <s> but there i am afraid we part company because he opened his remarks by saying he was speaking strictly as an individual <e> <s> however the points he made stood well to the right of any pronouncements or of anything i have read or heard from ministers in the government today <e> <s> nobody has said anything approaching what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state agree that the press release from his department on th january showed i think that a further people in the manufacturing sector had been made unemployed <e> <s> does he accept that the most disturbing continuing trend in all the unemployment figures is that employment in manufacturing industry continues to fall <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to commence by expressing my appreciation to the noble and learned lord lord scarman for moving this motion and to the lucid and compassionate way in which he brought his talents and his attention to what i am sure many noble lords will agree is one of the most difficult social problems facing us as a nation <e> <s> i should also like to express my appreciation to the right reverend primate the archbishop of canterbury for initiating his report and for the tremendous amount of research that has gone into it in order to make people aware of the damage being done on an increasing scale in our big cities and large conurbations <e>", "<cs> i accept what the minister says <e> <s> however my lords what is the answer <e> <s> it is not only housing that is the problem <e> <s> when my original factory closed down i was able by virtue of the fact that i was a skilled engineer to travel across manchester and find another job <e> <s> i doubt whether i could do that now i doubt whether the opportunity would be present if i was still in that area <e> <s> however that was the situation at the time <e> <s> there is no possibility of people switching employment because there is no employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is the minister saying that a cut of billion since has had no effect on the inner cities <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement made by the minister in another place <e> <s> i welcome the fact that the minister has mentioned in the statement that there will be full consultation with the people involved before the bill comes before the other place and your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way in which the minister has dealt with the questions <e> <s> however i must correct him historically <e> <s> he referred to the fact that this side of the house is always concerned and annoyed as regards housing acts passed by the last labour government <e> <s> perhaps i ought to say that the biggest villain of the piece is in fact the housing act which i think was passed when mr powell was the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house accept the order but i should like the minister to clear up one or two points <e> <s> i was going to ask whether the local authority will be represented on the corporation <e> <s> i think he has indicated that that will be so <e> <s> i understand that the body will consist of a chairman and members <e> <s> the local authority is to be given places and that is sensible and obviously people from commerce and industry will be appointed <e> <s> would it not be proper to consider the appointment of a recognised local trade unionist bearing in mind that this is still a heavily industrialised area and will continue to be so if the urban development corporation succeeds <e> <s> would it not be better to carry the trade unions with us and to let them know from the commencement what is going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of the inner cities or major cities that were debated in your lordships house last week have strangely enough within their wider boundaries some of the small farms which if these measures are carried to their ultimate conclusion will be the type that will probably have to be phased out on economic grounds alone <e> <s> some of these farms form the very few green areas within these cities where people can look at expanses of grassland and perhaps enjoy them with the permission of the people involved <e> <s> is it not true that the proposals include a relaxation which may put such areas in peril bearing in mind that for a long time the private sector housebuilding lobby has been casting envious eyes on them <e> <s> will the minister take a few moments to answer the question put to him earlier by my noble friend lady nicol who referred to the fact that the secretary of state had acted rather differently in the past months over some areas of birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> but does it not mean that many people who are now able to apply for the grant will be barred under the new ruling and that that will be a disincentive for them to have their houses insulated <e> <s> at a time when our non-renewable energy resources are fast depleting could not that have an adverse effect on our energy resources and further exacerbate a deteriorating situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that people in the building industry involved in insulation say that per cent <e> <s> of the people who were able to obtain a grant before the announcement was made will not be able to obtain it under the new arrangements <e> <s> they are expecting a serious reduction in their own work load and further unemployment <e> <s> is that what the government want <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join previous speakers in congratulating my noble friend and colleague lord stallard on introducing this debate and giving us the opportunity to speak on a subject which is very important and topical bearing in mind the inclement weather that we had only some few days ago <e> <s> i think that the debate has wider connotations than the title we are debating <e> <s> we are in effect talking about the best use of energy resources in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister is dealing with the new scheme may i recall that i raised two very important points which it would appear that the minister does not desire to touch upon <e> <s> one was that people involved in the building industry say that the new scheme will result in a substantial shortfall in their workload compared with last year <e> <s> i also asked specifically about people who had already made an application under the old scheme during the recent cold spell <e> <s> will they qualify under the old scheme for the grant that at the time they were led to believe would be available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to be having a surfeit of debates on this type of rent legislation in your lordships house <e> <s> i am sorry that there is no representative present on the alliance benches to speak on such an important issue <e> <s> i should have thought that it is important enough to attract them to this chamber even at this time of the evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving those details <e> <s> is it not quite dangerous for any minister especially a minister in an important position like the secretary of state to assume any such thing <e> <s> is the minister aware that since the date when those figures were collated unemployment in the york travel-to-work area has risen by nearly <e> <s> bearing in mind that over the past months jobs have been lost in manufacturing industry and to of those in the past month will the secretary of state say how many of those jobs were manufacturing jobs and is it not a fact that the situation is not as he has tried to describe it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that he has not produced one shred of hard factual evidence to back up that statement <e> <s> when the minister introduced the fact that there may be political undertones in this question can it be that the statement was made on the basis of the forthcoming general election in one of the most highly marginal constituencies in the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> does he recall that just after the war there was possibly one of the biggest train <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend forgive me <e> <s> i am grateful to him for giving way and i will be very brief <e> <s> i have made this point before and i make it again <e> <s> it does not matter what one does with the figures <e> <s> is it not a fact that it does not create one extra job <e> <s> that is what the argument is about creating jobs and not making it appear that there are more people in work that out of work and so on <e> <s> is it not a fact that the alteration of the figures has no bearing at all on the creation of even one job <e>", "<cs> i should like to take up a point that the minister has made <e> <s> he said that the last labour government had validated the action of clay cross <e> <s> what did he mean by that <e> <s> my recollection is that there was very little if any validating <e> <s> in fact the councillors involved paid the full penalty under the law as prescribed and some of them are still disqualified from holding public office <e>", "<cs> the opposition are entitled to a fuller explanation than that <e> <s> my information and like the noble lord the minister i am speaking off the top of my head is that there was no retrospective legislation passed to protect the clay cross people <e> <s> as i said some of them are still paying the penalty for what they did <e>", "<cs> i rise to join with my noble friend and colleague in support of this amendment <e> <s> she has ranged fully through the purposes of the amendment <e> <s> however i was somewhat surprised when i heard the minister say that my noble friend and colleague lady david who is leading for this side of the chamber had almost made a second reading speech <e> <s> at least reference was made to a second reading speech on a previous amendment <e>", "<cs> that is no excuse <e>", "<cs> i think that i should respond <e> <s> i think the contribution of the noble lord lord bellwin goes a little wide of the amendment <e> <s> i was not suggesting that i wanted to hold up the eight inner london boroughs as an example of those fighting to protect ratepayers interests <e> <s> the noble lord fully belaboured that point for about minutes a couple of weeks ago <e> <s> in contrast to those eight london boroughs there are a mass of other authorities including some of those i have read out which are conservative-controlled which have acted with discipline and reasonableness <e> <s> but they find themselves on the receiving end <e> <s> those are the authorities which i was talking about <e> <s> we should not let the way that the leaders of eight london boroughs have behaved blight the whole of local government <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord had been in his place during our last local government debate he would have heard my criticism of my local authority in manchester <e>", "<cs> it is with some regret that we hear through the minister that the government are almost totally unsympathetic to what these amendments are trying to achieve <e> <s> we fully accept that the government understand the purpose but we fail to understand the total non-acceptance of what we are trying to do <e> <s> the rejection of these amendments as we see it means that once the act becomes law the secretary of state will have almost <e>", "<cs> is one to assume from that that the government think that only greenwich and the other local authority in question have that financial problem <e> <s> i suspect that there are others in a somewhat similar position <e> <s> i do not know that one can pick out one-offs in terms of local authorities when dealing with rate support grant rate capping and the conglomerate of conditions that are imposed on local authorities in arriving at the final support grant figures <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that there are circumstances in which some of the other local authorities will be allowed the same freedom to act as greenwich and the other authority that has been mentioned <e> <s> is he saying that now <e>", "<cs> so what the minister is now saying is that the other authorities are out of time <e> <s> is the minister saying that they have missed the bus <e>", "<cs> it seems odd that the government are saying that it would be unreasonable to allow them to do otherwise when a number of other local authorities could say our financial position and our latest appraisal are the same as greenwich and we are in an identical position <e> <s> if we are now making law i do not see why the government cannot say that if an authority is in the same position as greenwich and that other local authority it can have the same consideration <e> <s> this bill is trying to rewrite the law on the rate support grant and i see no reason why this amendment cannot be accepted on that basis <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for the way in which she replied to the point that i made <e> <s> however perhaps she misunderstood what i meant by <e>", "<cs> that means that the secretary of state can deal with such matters as he wishes <e> <s> the decision is unchallengeable that is the point i am making <e> <s> it is a retrospective <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the list he read out and for his indication of the growth in this programme <e> <s> but are the criteria wide enough to encompass council estates built in the last years by industrial systems which are in need of urgent repair and which are deteriorating quickly <e> <s> they represent one of our worst housing problems and so far little or no additional funding has been received by local authorities to deal with the problem <e> <s> if they are not being considered by estate action will the minister take back to the secretary of state a request that they should be as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as a life-long trade unionist i have had the right to ballot since pre-war and have always exercised it albeit at a much lower level than is envisaged in this green paper <e> <s> will the secretary of state kindly tell the house bearing in mind that the government will now <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one conclusion that can be drawn from the statistics is that it is almost impossible for anyone from the north to move south to take up a fresh job unless the job has a very high salary indeed <e> <s> that takes into account the fact that over the last two years house prices in the north have risen by per cent compared to a rise in the south-east of per cent <e> <s> the wages earned in the south when set against the low sale price of houses in the north would probably not qualify such people for a mortgage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise again <e> <s> is the minister aware that his colleague behind him the noble lord lord mottistone is quite wrong <e> <s> as late as increases in house prices in the north and in the south-east were almost the same <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating and complimenting my noble friend and colleague lord jacques on introducing this short but important bill <e> <s> i have known of his special interest in the unemployed of the united kingdom ever since i began to cover employment and unemployment problems from the front bench of my party <e> <s> i do not remember any occasion on which the subject was raised by question or by any other means when the noble lord lord jacques was not involved

controversial views on some subjects one would expect that and no doubt we shall hear more from him in the future <e>", "<cs> my colleagues on the front bench may be saying hear hear but i am not satisfied with what the noble lord lord ezra said <e> <s> i think he was using a very cloudy crystal ball in his predictions of what may happen in the future because nobody knows what the costs will

power stations as i have been employed in the past in the industry <e> <s> i was always told though i have no figures to prove it that it was not viable economically as against the life of a new power station phased over the defrayment period <e> <s> i have no figures to challenge that but those were the reasons given <e>", "<cs> no i did not <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise fairly briefly in support of what has been so eloquently said by my friend and collegue on the front bench lord mishcon <e> <s> i did touch on this particular aspect of the subject during the passage of the wages bill last year <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that three or four weeks ago one of the more responsible newspapers carried a story to the effect that he in his position of secretary of state was trying to persuade the cabinet to reduce unemployment benefits generally in order to try to force people back to work in low paid jobs <e> <s> can i take it from him that the story is a total fabrication <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful and unreservedly accept what the secretary of state said about the newspaper report <e> <s> however is there not some contradiction in the answer that he has just given in respect of the job at <e> <s> has not the minister in another place recently been urging people to accept lower wages and smaller increases in wages <e> <s> when shall we reach a position in which the difference between unemployment benefit and wages which seems to be a disincentive now is attractive enough to get people back into jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords all members of your lordships house fully support what has been said by previous speakers about the people who took part in this terrible tragedy as rescuers <e> <s> if we can say <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the city of leeds sheltered housing units and houses are now subject to a moratorium because of the new provisions and that the scheme can no longer proceed <e> <s> these houses were needed for people whose homes were being demolished <e> <s> unless the city of leeds can find per cent <e> <s> of the money required as i understand it this scheme cannot go ahead <e> <s> there are many in extreme difficulty because of the cuts in the housing investment programme <e> <s> does the minister expect members of your lordships house to take seriously the governments concern regarding building and adapting houses for people to occupy when this type of action results in much-needed houses being taken out of commission in leeds <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i found his answer rather contradictory <e> <s> he gives the impression that the measure was brought <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin as other noble lords have done by complimenting my noble friend on the front bench on moving this very important motion and on the way in which he did it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that there has been a reduction in the number of disturbances at football matches and disturbances related to football matches <e> <s> does not that augur well for the eight-point plan that the minister has mentioned which we hope will be put into effect as quickly as possible <e> <s> is it not a fact that the football league the football association and the clubs are giving the government their fullest co-operation in attempting to deal with this difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to voice as forcibly as i can my objections to this type of business being dealt with in this way <e> <s> here we have an order containing articles and four schedules <e> <s> in another place and in your lordships house there have been a number of bills of less complexity than this order <e> <s> yet we are asked to let it go through almost on the nod <e> <s> that is the first complaint i wish to make <e> <s> the minister will know that i normally support almost totally what the government have to do in northern ireland <e> <s> they have a rotten job in that respect and i believe they are entitled to the fullest support where necessary <e> <s> however i have this objection to make <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> everyone else has been held up <e>", "<cs> and we do not want any <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the minister will know that moves are being made to carry out this exercise bearing in mind that on the result of that battle depended our future as a free and sovereign people <e> <s> i ask him to urge the government if a request comes forward to view it sympathetically in order to honour the name of the person who was the architect of that victory <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am grateful for his somewhat encouraging reply <e> <s> but does he not understand that the battle of britain was the first time that the nazi war machine had been stopped and blunted and it proved that it could be finally beaten <e> <s> does he not also understand that the winning of that battle ranks to us as a nation with waterloo and trafalgar in determining our future as a free and sovereign nation <e> <s> that is why i am pressing the point as strongly as i possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords my party of course welcomes these proposals although they underwrite some existing proposals and alter them slightly <e> <s> we welcome these training proposals because they are fundamental and necessary to our survival as a manufacturing nation <e> <s> as the minister said engineering is by far the largest section of our manufacturing industry <e> <s> the sad fact of course is that over the past decade the number of people employed in the industry has reduced from million to million <e> <s> there is no sign of that employment picking up <e>", "<cs> my lords along with previous speakers in your lordships house i wish to express my appreciation to my noble friend lord ennals for giving us the opportunity to debate what is probably the most important personal service that we as a nation provide <e> <s> i also congratulate my new colleague my noble friend lord peston on his maiden speech <e> <s> knowing his reputation we expected a high standard and i think that that was achieved <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall hear from him on numerous occasions in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give way for a moment <e> <s> as regards the chairman of the new authority being allowed a place at the table with the chairmen of the regional health authorities the minister must be aware that the overwhelming number of members of regional health authorities are now either members of the government party or active supporters <e> <s> therefore where will this independence come from <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that bus users in the metropolitan areas are of the opinion that there has been a deterioration in services since deregulation <e> <s> while it does well for him to quote additional buses and companies will he tell your lordships house of any material gain to the consumer and the traveller as opposed to the bus operator <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the figures issued by the department of employment in february show that jobs were lost in manufacturing industry in the month of january alone <e> <s> taking november december and january as a quarter the average was jobs lost in the manufacturing sector each month which is an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the preceding quarter <e> <s> whichever way we look at the situation does it not show that the bedrock of our future and of the economic survival of manufacturing industry is still being eroded at an alarming rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> but would he not agree that though the majority of offences are committed as i understand it by young people below working age nevertheless sir kenneth newman in his report indicated that unemployment is a major factor in the steady and substantial increase in the crime rate in the metropolitan area <e> <s> does it not seem strange therefore that the ministers right honourable friend the home secretary in another place claimed that the governments strategy regarding crime was actually succeeding <e> <s> does it not seem odd that something that is against the public interest and increasing is described <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the purpose of my question was not in any way to criticise the police because they have my total support <e> <s> i like the rest of your lordships have no time at all for people in local authorities who seem to find some pleasure in obstructing the police in their duties <e> <s> but the fact is that sir kenneth newman is not the first police chief a specialist in his job who has drawn attention to the fact that he believes unemployment to be a contributory factor in the deteriorating situation <e> <s> is it not about time that the government stopped saying that it is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however the noble earl must be aware of the grave concern which has been shown by a series of questions from all corners of another place which expressed deep concern at the formation of satellite information services which have been set up by the four largest bookmaking companies in the country <e> <s> this has been almost to the exclusion of the independent and longstanding information services <e> <s> is the minister aware that this can eventually develop into a monopoly situation with very grave detrimental effects on the independence of the betting industry and the punters certainly in the greyhound sector <e>", "<cs> my lords as the problem has been with the office of fair trading for some time a decision should be reached rather hurriedly in order to deal with the situation <e> <s> can the minister say how far the office of fair trading have progressed in dealing with this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree bearing in mind that our future energy resources will consist for the foreseeable future of well over per cent <e> <s> from finite resources that it makes sense to preserve and harness those resources on an ever-increasing scale <e> <s> taking that into account will the minister plead with the secretary of state to reverse the present policy of making grants available to a diminishing number of people not classes but numbers and implement a substantially expanding programme which will be to the benefit of the nation and to all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that this question is only a rehash of a similar question which i tabled some weeks ago <e> <s> the figures that the government give of grants to an increasing number of people is strongly challenged and resisted by people involved in the industry <e> <s> they say that when the governments present proposals are implemented there will be a considerable reduction in the number of households that can apply for the grant <e> <s> i do not believe that the people involved in the industry are wrong <e> <s> the government would do well to look once again at the policies they intend to pursue <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does the secretary of state recall that during the last general election campaign the chancellor of the exchequer made the specific statement that if a conservative government were re-elected there would be a reduction in unemployment <e> <s> is it not a fact that had the criteria for assessing the figures not been altered on innumerable occasions since the last general election there would be an increase in the figures <e> <s> is that not an outstanding example of the government indulging in something which they often accuse local authorities of doing these days creative accountancy to produce the figures that they want which are not the real figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that even with his own figures which he is claiming are a success over the past months there has been an average loss of jobs a month in the manufacturing sectors of our industries <e> <s> that loss is continuing with no sign of abatement <e> <s> is not that a dangerous trend <e> <s> can he indicate when we can expect those losses to stop <e> <s> if they do not stop the future of this country as an industrial nation will be absolutely devastated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i have in my possession a letter from the prime minister on this subject which indicates in principle support but states that the government are bound by a decision taken in not to have any more monuments placed <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak on the basis that my party supports the bill and agrees with the provisions contained in it <e> <s> moreover my partys policy goes somewhat further than the governments proposals <e> <s> however i have a great deal of sympathy for noble lords who spoke earlier and complained about the shortness of time <e> <s> i remind your lordships without trying to score political points that the shortness of time is not the fault of the opposition <e> <s> i do not know how we are supposed to organise your lordships house or whether the government consider what they do to us <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that despite the positive arrangement made by the government to deal with the harrogate situation both her majestys leader of the opposition the leader of the labour party mr neil kinnock and the shadow secretary of state for the environment mr john cunningham have for some time made clear in quite definitive statements that under no circumstances will a future labour government bail out any local authorities whatever their political colour which indulge in creative accountancy <e>", "<cs> my lords first let me say that it becomes almost a regular confrontation perhaps not a confrontation with the noble baroness lady hooper and myself facing each other across the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in congratulating the minister on his rather speedy promotion to the front bench <e> <s> is he not aware of the grave reservations expressed about this form of tax by a former secretary of state for the environment his right honourable friend mr michael heseltine and by a former minister of that department sir george young <e> <s> bearing in mind that two such prominent members of the conservative party are expressing grave reservations and that they will have the support of a substantial number of their own people is it not illogical and inconsistent that a bill brought before another place and your lordships house and which will be substantially amended will leave scotland completely at a disadvantage <e> <s> is this not the height of folly and the worst case of hybridity that we have had in this house within living memory <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to commence by offering my congratulations to the noble lord lord belstead on his transfer promotion or whatever it may be to the department of the environment <e> <s> i know that according to the queens speech and the governments intentions he will carry a heavy load over the next two sessions <e> <s> though i and my colleagues on this side of the house will probably disagree with quite a lot of what he will be dealing with we nevertheless have the utmost regard for him and for his integrity as a minister at the dispatch box <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i have to intrude at this late stage <e> <s> i was not suggesting that there was anything wrong other than the political philosophy of the government in privatising water <e> <s> i said that there was deliberate or accidental misinformation being produced during the general election campaign as to who originally owned all the water undertakings <e> <s> it has been perpetrated in the other place and it was perpetrated in this place yesterday by a minister when he said that the water holdings would go back to private people where they belonged <e> <s> the point i made was that the overwhelming number of water authorities in this country before the act were not in any way in private ownership <e> <s> they were in the main owned by local authorities or various committees composed of them <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that this report is the latest in a series of reports relating to this <e>", "<cs> my lords may i impress on the government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister whether the government will take on board the fact that the employees involved are deeply concerned as to whether there will be any guarantees regarding their pension rights in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am reluctant to come back to the minister but is he aware that these reports date back three years and that three years is a long while to hold loyal employees in suspense as to their future <e> <s> that is why i am asking whether the minister will impress on his colleague in another <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for that long and detailed reply <e> <s> however would he not agree that lay people reading the facts of the case about what took place some years ago might find it difficult to understand that there was obviously evidence against the father substantiated by three sons and yet it now appears that the noble and learned lord is saying that no action is to be taken simply on the basis that it is out of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to have to come back <e> <s> but surely when a matter like this is made public it is the duty of people holding public office to question whether the right procedures have been followed <e> <s> mistakes have been made in the past and can be made in the future <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor if he would cast his mind towards the part of the report stating that it had been suggested that the three sons could bring a private prosecution against their own father <e> <s> if something is tragically wrong surely this is a last resort and it ought to be done by the dpp <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that the main objective in privatising british telecom was to give the customers a better all round service <e> <s> can he tell me bearing in mind the recent very adverse report issued by oftel when the government expect british telecom to reach the objective set in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however would not the noble lord agree with this view <e> <s> although some of the trends show a favourable movement there is the continuing erosion in the numbers of people employed in our manufacturing industries <e> <s> this is allied to the fact that over the past months in terms of balance of payments in our manufacturing industries we show an adverse balance of upwards of billion <e> <s> those are very dangerous continuing trends <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister whether the government have any new proposals in mind which may attempt to deal with this situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the right reverend prelate aware that that train of thought is strongly reinforced by the success of the phoenix initiative in salford greater manchester in participation with local authorities <e>", "<cs> may i just <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> as one who uses the m and the m regularly i have observed that the m in particular seems to have long stretches of contraflow systems <e> <s> does the extensive use of the contraflow systems make a contribution to the horrendous fatal accident figures which we have seen lately <e> <s> if that is so will the government consider reviewing the situation to see whether it can be improved <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may finally ask the minister on the subject raised by my noble friend lord mellish and the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter whether he is aware of the distress caused by the fact that a number of people who pull onto the hard shoulder because of mechanical failure are subsequently killed or maimed <e> <s> great distress is caused to the relatives of such people <e> <s> it appears that the number of such cases is increasing as people who pull off the road in an emergency are often smashed into by juggernauts <e> <s> such accidents are totally avoidable <e> <s> i hope the minister will say that the government will keep this kind of accident under review to see whether any improvement can be made in the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister cast his mind back to previous questions on this subject late in the last parliamentary session <e> <s> does he not agree that we have still a long way to go in achieving a sensible energy saving policy bearing in mind that among our contemporaries we come out very badly indeed <e> <s> is he aware that though we welcome the measures that he has highlighted the biggest area of concern is not new building but existing building <e> <s> as a matter of urgency will the government keep the matter under review <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that detailed reply from the minister <e> <s> is he aware that because i was formerly a locomotive engineer of years standing i am absolutely appalled to learn that the workforce of brel were not allowed to tender for that work which they should have done <e> <s> we shall not therefore even know whether the price from abroad is really competitive compared with that from our own people <e> <s> will the minister use his best endeavours to place a moratorium on the letting of this contract in order to give the british workforce an opportunity to tender and not once again appear to be making it easier for our competitors both on the continent and in america to take work that is sorely needed from this country <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the workforce in brel are of the opinion that they could be a successful main contractor <e> <s> bearing in mind that the french the germans the americans and other people involved in the tendering never appear to make it easy for us to obtain work in those countries and also bearing in mind the terribly adverse balance of payments on manufacturing industry in this country with special emphasis on engineering may i ask the minister whether this policy will he looked at again <e> <s> i am sure that if this work were done over here it would have a beneficial effect on our balance of payments in manufacturing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware of the disappointment that that will create among sixth form students <e> <s> does she agree that the government are missing an excellent chance by not giving them the right to places on the governing bodies in a day and age where we are constantly telling young people to take more responsibility and be better citizens for it <e> <s> will it not be a tragedy if the government miss this chance to show that they have faith in the younger people of this generation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply but he must be aware that most of the authorities and associations interested in <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that the institute of housing which is a totally independent body has issued its response and it is completely convinced that even the governments objectives will not be reached by the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some of the hospitals in the centres of our larger cities to which people are brought from the outer areas for specialised treatment continually claim that they are underfunded and cannot carry out such a function <e> <s> my colleague the noble lord lord stallard referred last week to the manchester eye hospital <e> <s> will the minister look into this situation <e> <s> we believe that such underfunding is grossly unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement and for the information he has given <e> <s> is he not aware however that some of us believe that such a major decision requires a debate <e> <s> there are more issues involved than can be fairly dealt with during a statement <e> <s> however i wish the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would read some copies of <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first do something that i have not done before in your lordships house <e> <s> i wish to apologise for the fact that unfortunately this is one occasion when i cannot stay for the reply <e> <s> there is an important meeting that requires my presence <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those of us who raised this matter in your lordships house on a previous occasion are extremely grateful that the project is now bearing fruit <e> <s> will the minister comment on a recent press report to the effect that her majesty the queen mother has been invited to officiate at the unveiling ceremony <e> <s> if that is so is the minister aware that the fact that this great man is at last being accorded his place in history will give the greatest of pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> he must be aware that the people involved including the staff are deeply disturbed at the way this issue is being dragged out <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the reports that there is now a serious difference of opinion between the treasury and the department of the environment <e> <s> i understand that the treasury through mr major has indicated that it desires to keep this operation public bearing in mind the collapse of share prices and that it might not realise its true value if sold off now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware of the department of the environments announcement of an extra million approximately being targeted towards homelessness <e> <s> this amount has been made available only because housing expenditure receipts are million in excess of the amount predicted in the white paper on housing expenditure <e> <s> is it not the fact that local authorities are being allowed access to money that they have already collected and that these are not new resources <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that bed and breakfast accommodation in london is calculated to cost million in the present financial year per cent <e> <s> of which is met from the public purse either from the taxpayer or the ratepayer <e> <s> would it not make sense to make these resources available to local authorities to build houses bearing in mind that that indicates a per cent <e> <s> increase on the financial burden since <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am a little surprised at that reply as i understand that the institute of maintenance and building management submitted proposals to the department of employment some weeks ago indicating its concern about the small number of people who were emerging as craftsmen in the building industry <e> <s> will he take up the matter with the secretary of state to see whether such a report has been received <e> <s> will he give serious consideration to the four points raised in the report which are designed to improve the present situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in addition to the organisation i mentioned in my supplementary question other reputable and established organisations such as the institute of clerks of works of great britain the institute of building the building employers confederation and the trade unions are all expressing the view that apprentices are not coming through in sufficient quantities <e> <s> desirable though the two-year period is they are asking that it be extended to three years in order to produce a more finished product <e> <s> is it not a fact that the citb is holding in reserve something in excess of million <e> <s> would it not be logical to plough some of this money into extending training schemes to try to correct the present imbalance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first apologise to your lordships for not being present to hear the earlier speakers but i was at a meeting in the palace where my presence was required <e> <s> also i should like to say how deeply i appreciate the title of the motion introduced by my old friend and colleague lord sefton which is on a subject which is very germane to all of us today <e> <s> i know that the report covers a national perspective but i hope your lordships will bear with me as an indigenous northerner if i retain my cloth cap and speak from that angle <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister whether he considers to be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may also join in giving my contratulations to the noble lord lord belstead on his appointment as leader of your lordships house <e> <s> most of the noble lords present will be aware that occasionally lord belstead and i face each other across the chamber on issues <e> <s> however i have always been mindful of and noticed the courteous way in which he deals with matters <e> <s> i wish him all the best

circumstances <e> <s> tenders are submitted for a large contract say a building contract <e> <s> a direct labour department is involved but its tender is not the lowest <e> <s> however when the actual specification goes to the department of the environment i know that all major contracts have to be approved by the doe it is found not to be in order <e> <s> would the government intervene and award the contract to the direct labour department <e> <s> in the past they have done the reverse <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answer the noble earl referred to community health services <e> <s> is he aware that the majority of those services were administered by local authorities prior to the last local government reorganisation <e> <s> will be comment on views now being openly expressed that the customers are now receiving a worse service under the national health service than they did when these services were controlled by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that some time ago i raised the question of a rapist who was paroled and who then returned to rape and murder the person for attacking whom he had originally been convicted <e> <s> deep concern was expressed in your lordships house and also wide and deep concern was expressed in the area of yorkshire where i live and where that crime took <e>", "<cs> my lords it remains for me to express my appreciation to the minister for his very courteous reply to the debate <e> <s> however i have to say that if the ministers reply is the governments answer to the size of the homeless problem we are facing in this country it is a complete and utter nonsense <e> <s> it will cause nothing but despair among the people who have to deal with it <e> <s> i can give the minister an undertaking that we shall come back on this matter to make him aware of the deteriorating position that will continue if that is all that the government are to do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first say to the noble baroness lady blatch that speaking for this side of the committee and i am sure for the whole of the committee there is no suggestion in any of the amendments or in our minds that there is to be found less integrity honesty and diligence in those who work in the private sector than in those who work in the public sector <e> <s> if that has been said we totally disown it <e>", "<cs> if the minister is right in interpreting the bill in that way although it is not spelt out in the bill that is a very funny method <e> <s> if you are at the back end of the queue alphabetically you have a longer time to get your house in order <e> <s> i do not believe that that is a good way of doing things <e>", "<cs> i thought i was giving way but before the minister sits down would he care to deal with the point that i made as to whether the provisions are to be introduced alphabetically <e> <s> i think that is very important <e>", "<cs> i have raised the question of the alphabetical introduction of the provisions of the bill <e> <s> however the answer that the noble earl gave me was not in accord with the information that i have received from various sources <e> <s> am i therefore to understand that no decision has been made <e> <s> is it correct to assume that if ones local authority is <e>", "<cs> later <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his comments about handicapped and disabled people <e> <s> however i think that the issue goes a little wider than the narrow confines to which he has chosen to keep <e> <s> as one who was heavily involved in local government and in the employment of the disabled and handicapped i know that it is a sad fact that society as a whole we are all to blame has never reached anywhere near even in government and local authority establishments gainfully employing the number of people we should like to see taken from the disabled list <e>", "<cs> what is worrying many people who are involved in sport and like to watch <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly reply to the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i think we see here a clear indication of the dangers of treating particular areas of the country as one and saying that they are all the same <e> <s> they are not the same <e> <s> i spent my childhood in an area of manchester where i paid a penny a week at a working mens club <e> <s> facilities in those days were hard to come by <e> <s> however we produced the champion gymnast of this country who captained our team in berlin at the first olympic games after the war <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am saddened by his reference to driving a horse and cart through the bill <e> <s> that is not our intention <e>", "<cs> given that we have been considering the bill for only part of today i think that the discussions have taken place in a reasonable convivial and constructive manner <e> <s> this will be soured a little if it is asserted that we represent people <e>", "<cs> what disturbs me is the feeling from the government back-benches which has been running through this debate of a criticism i hate to use the word attack solely of direct labour <e> <s> the noble baroness lady blatch asked what would happen if direct labour went on strike and they did not open doors and lifts did not work <e> <s> i can bounce the question the other way what happens if the private sector goes on strike <e> <s> they do go on strike and in some cases far more often than direct labour <e>", "<cs> i have not said that <e>", "<cs> first if i misheard or misread the intention of the noble lord opposite in his first remarks in committee i apologise <e> <s> but the fact is that he used the words direct labour direct works and strikes <e> <s> even the noble baroness in her reply to me fell into the trap and when talking about a strike she only used the words direct labour <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for that reply <e> <s> what comes across more ominously than ever is the tremendous amount of consultation that is taking place to which people such as myself and other noble lords interested in the bill are not privy <e> <s> we have to be a little careful that there is not so much consultation that it will end in legislative constipation because so much is being pumped through at once quite blindly <e>", "<cs> will the minister bear in mind during his considerations that when a fire engine goes out it is not just a simple engine it is a complicated piece of self-propelled machinery mounted on wheels it is very different from the original concept of a fire engine a few years ago <e> <s> in an overwhelming number of cases when fire engines go out it is in order to save life which may depend upon the speed with which they can get to a fire <e> <s> this was drawn to our attention when the amendment was moved <e> <s> think of the horrendous loss of life there would have been in the fire at kings cross if the engine had arrived three or four minutes later because of some lack of delivery <e> <s> when the fire chief of a particular station knows that an engine is going out it is essential that his men have confidence that it will perform at the maximum per cent <e> <s> and not just at per cent <e> <s> it has to be a per cent <e> <s> performance <e> <s> i hope that that is a point which the minister will bear in mind during his considerations <e>", "<cs> i said that i would try to be brief but the noble baroness has once again elicited something that needs a reply <e> <s> i said that i would not speak at length tonight because though in principle it was the same as the argument for the fire brigade it was slightly different <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that rather helpful reply but in that case i do not believe that the national consumer council would have submitted this amendment expressing its somewhat tentative misgivings about the bill if it goes through as it is <e> <s> it may well be that it will want to look at what the minister has said <e> <s> but having heard what the minister has said which i should like to read to see what are the implications and on the basis that we may need to come back to try to get something more definitive written into the bill at a later stage i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am partially satisfied <e> <s> once again that provision bypasses the question of primary legislation <e> <s> i do not think that we can carry on in that vein <e> <s> i think that the whole bill implies that primary legislation can be dispensed with if the secretary of state so wishes <e> <s> on that basis i think that i should perhaps press the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> he did not use the word sympathetic but some aspects are still under review <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> if the financial return on capital of the crown suppliers is better than the government call for will that be a prime factor in deciding the future of this department <e> <s> if it is not a main feature ought it not to be <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the answers to a question i asked in the house in december showed that the return on capital was in excess of what even the government required does this not make it appear that the decision is being delayed so that the government can produce some squalid excuse for selling off a department that is a benefit both to the government and to the taxpayer generally <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather regret the remarks made by the noble and learned lord lord hailsham about a smear campaign <e> <s> i have been in your lordships house for four years and that is not a tactic to which i would stoop <e>", "<cs> my lords could the minister translate for us the global figure which he gave into the number of jobs and the cost per job <e> <s> could he also indicate whether it is the governments intention to carry on with the existing scheme <e>", "<cs> not for one moment would i disagree with the minister in that last comment and his quotation from margaret hodge <e> <s> that was always my view when i was engaged in local government <e> <s> governments are not elected to serve sectional elements they are elected to serve the community as a whole <e> <s> they look after the interests of the community too not the interests of any particular group as i have said <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may very briefly give a hypothetical example that i believe could happen if the bill is passed as it stands <e> <s> a local authority puts out a contract for a building containing highly sophisticated equipment <e> <s> it is a contract requiring large capital <e> <s> then the city architect or engineer in charge of the contract says one of these contractors here carried out a contract similar to this two or three years ago for city b we in city a in the interests of the local authority and the ratepayers ought to make inquiries as to what happened there <e>", "<cs> i must press that last point <e> <s> the nub of the argument is whether people ought to be investigated when they have carried out similar work for someone else shortly before <e> <s> the minister indicates to me that that is not on <e> <s> he may not be familiar with present ordering patterns in this country <e> <s> we are always told if we wish to sell nuclear or coal-fired stations that before anyone will buy one they have to come over here to see one of ours working to make sure that we can carry out the specification <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> my name does not appear on the marshalled list as regards the amendment only because the method that <e>", "<cs> address the amendment seriously <e>", "<cs> we are concerned with standards in complying with building regulations <e> <s> perhaps as a layman i assessed wrongly what the noble earl said but i understood him to say that with the work that goes into it a building in scotland has a per cent <e> <s> higher value than its counterpart in england <e> <s> i do not know whether or not i heard him correctly <e>", "<cs> i am a little sorry that the minister was not somewhat more sympathetic towards what we were saying and did not give some gleam of hope that he may look at the situation <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could answer that for the minister <e> <s> i know that most of the officers who work for local authorities whether they are city architects planners building managers or clerks of works all belong to their respective professional associations <e> <s> it is a condition of their employment <e>", "<cs> with all due respect i think that the noble baroness has got completely the wrong end of the stick <e> <s> in this amendment we are talking about companies that are contractors <e> <s> the local authorities in some respect do contract work for themselves but these trade associations are specifically for people in the private sector who are involved in a particular trade <e> <s> i was referring to officers in local government who are members of their own professional classes <e> <s> but it does not follow necessarily if one is talking about individuals in any organisation or with any professional expertise that they automatically join their professional association <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble baroness she is not saying why she criticises local authority practice <e> <s> i know this about local authorities <e> <s> as regards the standards of the lower level of staff it is an established and historical fact that local authorities offer the finest training ground for building employees at a young age <e> <s> they then move into the private sector and progress upwards into the technical and managerial grades <e> <s> that is an undisputed fact and everyone admits it <e>", "<cs> it is quite commonplace for people to stand up in this committee and in another place and abuse local authorities <e> <s> it may well be that some authorities have behaved badly <e> <s> however the government must have some specific cases in mind <e> <s> if the minister cannot mention them i have to believe that he is on very doubtful ground indeed <e> <s> if he says that such cases are the reason for the provision we must have the evidence <e> <s> we are arranging a hanging before we have had a trial <e>", "<cs> this is a different argument <e>", "<cs> does the minister have any evidence as to why they have done that <e> <s> it may well he that they have had some unhappy experiences with the private sector such as those we had in manchester <e> <s> they have done nothing wrong <e> <s> they have kept to particular standards and they thought that that was the best way of proceeding <e> <s> the minister has told the committee that he is a surveyor <e> <s> i ask him whether if he was putting out some surveying work he would go to a member of a reputable surveyors association or to a cowboy if he wanted value for money <e> <s> however i know what he would do with his professional expertise the cowboy would get the job <e>", "<cs> i am reluctant to divide the house at this hour <e> <s> however i think the ministers case is very flimsy indeed when he says he hopes that the provision will improve the situation <e> <s> i will come back to this at a later stage because i do not think that the minister has produced any concrete evidence to support the case he puts <e> <s> if he wishes to divide the house now we can have divisions all night <e> <s> it is up to him <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw the amendment and come back to it later <e> <s> i am not satisfied <e>", "<cs> in rising to support this amendment with which i am sure all members of the committee will be in sympathy in spirit i should like to mention why i think this particular amendment is so important to disabled people <e> <s> i spent quite a lot of time in the private sector of manufacturing engineering in a very big factory in trafford park manchester <e> <s> in that factory there were quite a number of blind people <e> <s> they worked machines very well indeed <e> <s> they did not ask for very many concessions other than to leave five minutes early in order to get their transport home because it was a big factory and they did not want to get knocked about by people running for buses <e> <s> however they competed very well on the machines and gainfully earned a living <e>", "<cs> on the same point i am surprised that the minister is saying that local authorities cannot handle this <e> <s> most local authorities of any size have personnel departments of their own that are perfectly aware of this type of problem and are capable of dealing with it <e> <s> many services in local government such as housing direct labour and education are departmental but personnel departments what used to be known as establishment departments have great expertise on the availability and placing of people <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e> <s> i hope the minister does not put words into my mouth <e> <s> i did not mention extra manpower <e> <s> i said that there was expertise there now that i believe could do the work <e> <s> i do not know of any legislation unfortunately that this government have passed over the last few years to help me <e> <s> an ex-secretary of state who brought some of it in has just left the chamber <e> <s> one of the complaints of local government has been the additional responsibilities the government have been giving it over the years coupled with savage cuts in manpower <e> <s> if personnel departments were able to consider this problem with the right guidelines and the right people from the other agencies they could probably achieve a solution without increases in manpower <e> <s> i am not basing my argument on substantial increases in manpower and i hope the minister does not think so <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has it wrong <e> <s> the bill will deprive local authorities of doing something that they are already doing <e> <s> we are not talking about a new raft of jobs upon which some disabled people can jump <e> <s> we are talking about the raft that already exists but which will be removed <e> <s> no other interpretation can be put on the matter <e>", "<cs> my colleague who is now leading on this side in the committee stage indicated that we consider that the power sought in this clause would have been better included in the housing bill now in another place <e> <s> i think that all the reasons put forward by the minister indicate that my colleague is correct <e> <s> when there is a housing bill going through another place i think it odd that this section is hived off to be dealt with in a local government bill <e> <s> occasionally consolidation bills go through the house and it is strange that the government should now deviate by putting this clause in a local government bill <e> <s> i think that the minister has given reasons as to why this matter should he included in a housing bill and not in this bill <e>", "<cs> i rise at this stage to support the amendment moved by my noble friend lord jenkins of putney <e> <s> as i said i wish to be very brief but this matter is a worry that has developed from the previous exchanges regarding the possibility of prosecution of a local authority <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord jenkins in his brief remarks referred to the way that theatre these days is financed in some cases from a local authority and donations from businesses <e> <s> that is how it works <e>", "<cs> i think the noble baroness is wrong in assuming that because the minister has given the governments view on the intention of the bill it becomes the law <e> <s> in another place i sat on <e>", "<cs> i shall be very brief because i am sure we shall all benefit from an earlier night than we have been having recently <e> <s> i do not think that the answer is satisfactory <e> <s> if i cast my mind back local authorities that had new towns within their areas were always led to believe and it has never been denied that they would eventually assume the powers of the new town authorities <e>", "<cs> on that basis i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> however i give notice that if the answer is not satisfactory to the areas involved i shall probably come back at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to speak briefly to this amendment because i was responsible for raising this matter at the earlier stages of the bill <e> <s> the original amendment referred to schools as a whole <e> <s> as the noble lord lord foot said this amendment narrows it down to primary schools <e> <s> in the earlier proceedings on this bill in your lordships house i was talking of primary schools when i referred to the fact that the caretaker was an indentifiable figure within those establishments whom children came to recognise as part of the establishment where they were beginning their education <e> <s> they were very often on friendly terms with their caretaker <e> <s> i have taken the trouble to read what the minister said on that occasion <e> <s> although very often the issues that divide us are not profound i have to disagree quite forcefully with what he said then and with the reasons he gave for the government wishing to pursue the course that they are pursuing <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry to come back <e> <s> i was actually reading verbatim not giving my views what the minister had said <e> <s> he referrerd to the security of primary schools being privatised <e> <s> if that means anything other than security forces being employed to guard primary schools i do not know what it means <e> <s> it may mean something different in <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that although the minister has indicated some movement i believe i am drawing the right conclusion from what he has said when the bill becomes an act it will still have reserve powers to enforce this particular function on a reassessment <e> <s> in other words the secretary of state is still keeping the bullet in the gun and if he chooses to pull the trigger <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble earl could not be a little more sympathetic and have regard to the arguments that were made by <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for that reply but i do not think the government quite understand what would happen if such a policy were implemented <e> <s> i think the minister is saying that with any contract where disabled or handicapped people would be or might be deemed to be involved they would have the right to submit the contract to the secretary of state on the basis of what he said within the governments present proposals <e> <s> am i correct in assuming that <e> <s> perhaps the minister could answer that before i go any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i understood what the minister said to be that with the employment or the expense or the additional expenditure on a contract above what one would consider the norm for the employment of disabled or handicapped people the local authority concerned could apply to the secretary of state for that to be taken into consideration <e> <s> am i correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that <e> <s> i thought i had heard it correctly but i could only see that as a recipe for clogging the sausage machine <e> <s> i do not know the number of local authorities involved in this but suppose there were or applications by local authorities which are already employing handicapped and disabled people <e> <s> if they wanted that taken into account are we really saying that the secretary of state has the resources the facilities to study each one in depth or will he give <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to say very briefly that i think we must look more closely at what the minister has said in relation to my comments <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords that is somewhat belated good news but on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that your lordships will be surprised if i question the appearance of this clause at such a late stage in the bill <e> <s> i respect and am grateful for the way that the minister moved it <e> <s> i think that he was in a trap that was not of his own making in having to do it this way <e> <s> the government in the main i am talking about the secretary of state appear to be in some respect chasing shadows which have not really appeared <e>", "<cs> my lords what evidence has the minister given us that a small number of local authorities saw a loophole <e> <s> does he say that the secretary of state by some poltergeist exercise implanted himself in certain local authorities and predicted what people there were thinking <e> <s> he has been very clever if that is the case <e> <s> i remind the minister that on three occasions the present secretary of state has had to go before a court and on one occasion introduce retrospective legislation in order to put himself right with the laws that he thought had been passed <e> <s> that is why i say that we view the proposal with very great care <e> <s> i think that i am entitled to ask the minister once again when the written question was put down and when it was answered <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the number of views and opinions expressed by various components of the community who will be affected in one way or another by these proposals does the minister not think they would be better received if a green paper were issued to give people a chance to express their views in a constructive manner <e> <s> a decision taken on a purely politically philosophical basis may be the wrong way of doing it and may result in very adverse effects on the supply to the community as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the general figures that have been given <e> <s> i am sure that everyone is pleased to hear that there has been an increase <e> <s> is the minister aware that the latest quarterly report of the building employers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i have to come back on that reply but the figures that the minister has given me are from the report that i quoted <e> <s> i think that it is relevant that the public sector contains the biggest building sector in the country and not the smallest <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that answer is in conflict with information that i have had from the chairman of that authority <e> <s> is he also aware that that authority has had to reduce from to the number of beds provided for <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that in my first supplementary question i made the point quite forcefully that because of the reduction of beds in manchester efforts have to be made to find placements for children in liverpool and leeds <e> <s> i understand that there has been more than one death while children were awaiting placements in some of these other hospitals <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the secretary of state for that answer <e> <s> is it not a fact that there is still serious deterioration in numbers of people employed in manufacturing industries over the past months taken on an average monthly basis <e> <s> taking into account that our balance of payments for the manufacturing industries shows a deficit for the past months of over million each week is that not a dangerous trend which we ought to be doing more to arrest in the interests of the economy as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept and welcome the improvement as stated by the secretary of state <e> <s> but is it not a fact that if the present trend continues our manufacturing base will steadily diminish and a very adverse balance of payments will be shown for our manufacturing industry <e> <s> can the secretary of state indicate the options available when the very lucrative revenues from north sea oil run out in the foreseeable future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the detailed and courteous reply which we have come to expect from him <e> <s> i am sorry however that he could not go a little further as we had requested <e> <s> it is my belief that the worries which have been highlighted on behalf of these authorities during the various proceedings in your lordships house both in committee and on report will manifest themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am terribly disappointed with that reply <e> <s> is he aware that there are now more people than ever living in temporary accommodation and the numbers are still growing <e> <s> is he aware that there are now more than families in bed-and-breakfast accommodation and that figure is still growing <e> <s> when can the minister inform this house that the government will be taking measures so that figures such as that which are a terrible stain on our character as a nation will start to move downwards <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to that answer perhaps i may ask this question <e> <s> is the minister aware that every housing agency that deals with people who are affected by that bill is of the opinion that there is nothing at all in the present housing bill which will do one whit whatsoever to alleviate the homeless in this country and that the bill is not about homeless people and it does nothing at all for them <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that in two replies the minister has indicated that local authorities have the salvation in their own hands if they use more of their capital resources to deal with the problem will the noble lord go straight from this chamber and endeavour to persuade the chancellor of the exchequer to release more of the huge sums of the authorities own money which is still withheld from them and which they want to use for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if we were to lose our own domestic capacity to produce tanks of high quality by ordering them from overseas our own capacity may well disappear never to come hack <e> <s> surely that would be to our peril as a nation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer is not correct <e> <s> is it not the case that the number of properties built for this purpose has diminished despite an increasing demand for them <e> <s> is this not due to the fact that the housing investment programme has been seriously cut this year once again <e> <s> why is the minister so optimistic that there will be an increased building programme when it is smaller and that includes sheltered housing accommodation than last year <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that a short time ago in a debate in this house i drew the governments attention to the concern being expressed by private investors about the slowness in processing the scheme <e> <s> at the time my information was that no additional staff had been recruited to process those schemes in a general sense they were in fact progressing at an unbelievably slow pace <e> <s> can the mininster give us any information as to whether additional staff have now been recruited to deal with the schemes thus making the progress more meaningful than it has been up until now <e>", "<cs> but is that not the tenor of all the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> i was present earlier when the noble lord lord campbell of alloway who unfortunately is not present condemned an opposition amendment out of hand <e> <s> he said that if it were accepted it would be fraught with difficulty and that he could see the unions abusing it <e> <s> but he did not give one single example of how it could be abused <e> <s> we are almost in the game which we were in with the local government bill of people being condemned when the case was in no way proven <e> <s> as a basic trade unionist not an ex-trade union official but as somebody who joined a trade union at the age of and is still in one years later i have always believed in the openness of the books and making available the fullest information possible <e> <s> i say that as a former secretary for years of a very large labour club <e> <s> everything was available to be shown within a reasonable period <e>", "<cs> that is not <e>", "<cs> i do not think that ministers are aware of the percentage of trade union subscriptions which are collected voluntarily at factory level <e> <s> they represent quite immense sums of <e>", "<cs> once again i ask why the government insist on double standards <e> <s> is it not a fact that in claims for certain benefits across the whole spectrum the previous months are always indicated as the norm for what will be claimed and what will be paid on the basis that it is impossible to keep up-to-date records for such a large volume of people which bearing in mind the number of trade unionists involved is possibly still in the region of million <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has encapsulated the matter in a nutshell <e> <s> the arguments put by the other side are that it is to catch the few who are not behaving <e> <s> the same arguments were put during discussion on the local government bill some are behaving naughtily we shall punish them all <e> <s> the situation is like that of the schoolteacher who has one or two naughty pupils but who decides to punish the class in order to catch the guilty ones <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend give way briefly <e> <s> as a member of the second largest trade union in the country the aeu is he not aware that every branch of that union annually elects its auditors and trustees to examine the books on behalf of its members <e> <s> is he further aware that very few if any branches of the aeu are property owners <e> <s> of course the national union is by virtue of its district offices <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish briefly to make one or two comments <e> <s> i wonder who the linguistic sadist was who coined the words voluntary unemployment <e> <s> i wonder whether the million people who are long-term unemployed consider that they are voluntarily unemployed <e> <s> most of them or a large proportion of them were forced on to the dole queue and on to the supplementary benefit by the policies of the existing government <e> <s> to use the term voluntary unemployed is a complete butchery of language <e> <s> it is a complete nonsense <e> <s> people do not volunteer to go on to the dole queue <e> <s> i think that the government coined those words to suit their particular situation or to fit the bill on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the government persisting in the use of that phrase when there is no such thing as voluntary unemployment <e> <s> people do not volunteer for unemployment <e> <s> the overwhelming number of people who are unemployed in this country do not have any say or any choice in the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister suggesting as a substitute the word malingering <e> <s> if he is why does he not have the courage to say so instead of masking that word with voluntary unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister in explaining his position has stood on his head <e> <s> perhaps he would like to correct that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the most frequent crime on the london underground is robbery with violence and that victims are often physically injured <e> <s> is he also aware that those of us who travel on the tube late at night can clearly observe that the number of people using the tube trains is diminishing because it has become a risky way to travel about london <e> <s> perhaps i may urge all members of your lordships house to do everything they can to restore the good name of the london public transport system <e>", "<cs> i was not going to speak to this amendment but perhaps i may correct one point put forward by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i do not think that i am putting his words perfectly accurately but he inferred that the final total responsibility for training rests with the employer <e> <s> to anyone who has spent a lifetime in a skilled industry training apprentices nothing could be further from the truth <e> <s> if one is training youths and girls in skills and i am talking about skills not semi-skills and much of this will be skilled techniques in the new industries they can be trained only by people who have those skills <e> <s> they can be trained only on a widening basis <e>", "<cs> i accept fully what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has said but i do not think that the two facets of his argument alter the basis of the argument one iota <e> <s> though the employers representatives might have a crystal ball to see what future requirements are when they have decided how many apprentices a trade will require for the next few years everything comes back to square one where the men on the shop floor at various levels will be mostly in charge of training these lads <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble baroness has given way and i appreciate that <e> <s> but is she and is the committee aware that the biggest crash training programme ever in the history of this country took place when the nation was in peril in <e> <s> does the committee recall that winston churchill sent for the trade union leaders and asked them to accept dilution and train quickly hundreds of thousands of engineers to produce on behalf of the country <e> <s> we are now within an economic war whether we want it or not <e> <s> does not the noble baroness think that it might be better to proceed with goodwill rather than to introduce a measure such as this which may have the opposite effect <e>", "<cs> perhaps my noble friend would give way <e> <s> is it not a fact that some of the most successful schemes have only proceeded on a substantial basis where trade union leaders have consulted with their members and have been able to ensure that their members accept a reduction in the agreed training periods from five to three years in some industries which has increased the employment of youngsters in those industries fairly dramatically <e> <s> indeed the electricity industry is a prime example <e> <s> is it not a fact that the kind of action on which the government are insisting may jeopardise the situation in other industries <e>", "<cs> i listened to the minister giving his reasons for moving the amendment <e> <s> i have listened to other proceedings in this place and in another place on trade union and employment legislation <e> <s> people have talked about legislating for strikes and industrial action <e> <s> i wonder how many of the people who have legislated on those matters have first-hand knowledge of the subject <e> <s> i am not talking about trade union leaders or employers i am talking about the people who have been on strike or taken some form of industrial action at various times during their working lives <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i should like him to explain certain matters to me <e> <s> suppose that there is the scenario in which an employer behaves rather stupidly towards a representative of organised labour in the factory <e> <s> that does not happen very often but it does occur if infrequently <e> <s> suppose further that the shop floor representative of the workforce is summarily dismissed it may be the shop steward chairman of the works committee or the secretary and that very quickly he is put outside the factory <e> <s> if the workers in that factory have confidence in the person whom they consider is being victimised does the minister think that they would bother about waiting for the official union machinery to move <e> <s> it would be no use to them whatever <e> <s> that type of action almost inevitably results in a lightning strike which can be of serious dimensions as i have just explained <e>", "<cs> the more i listen to the answers to some of the amendments the more puzzled i become <e> <s> i am completely convinced that the government are in a minefield without any of the flails or tanks to get through <e> <s> how would the government cope with the situation of a large employee such as gec which has four large plants on different sites in the united kingdom <e> <s> while the main union catering for the workers in the factories would be the aeu a large percentage of workers belong to other trade unions and the four factories negotiate independently with their employer <e> <s> their employer opted out of the engineering employers federation some time ago so negotiations are on a factory basis with substantial workforces of thousands in each <e> <s> what scenario would the government draw up bearing in mind that the employer may have made an offer which two factories would be obliged to accept but about which for legitimate reasons the other two factories will say we are not buying that <e> <s> in our particular situation it would adversely affect us <e> <s> in those circumstances how do the government expect this legislation to help in such a situation or will it be completely useless <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and i do not want to speak at length on this amendment because i shall speak to my own amendment does he not agree in regard to the intervention by the noble lord lord renton that while one may not be able to distinguish whether there is a minority or a majority of people who go out to eat on christmas day good friday and sundays there is no question at all but that it is being done by increasing numbers <e> <s> if one wants to go out for a meal with the family on such days one must book well in advance to get a table <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes a very strong point which i accept <e> <s> i think that it would be wrong not to admit that the control in some supermarkets is not as firm as it should be any more than it is in some corner shops <e> <s> but i believe that if the government were to look kindly at this particular relaxation it would do no harm whatsoever <e> <s> it would bring us into line with other airports <e> <s> on that basis i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> he has given an indication that the government are only interested in the <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i have to disagree with the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> we are only talking about five hours on a sunday <e> <s> the fact is that sunday is one of the busiest travelling days of the week <e> <s> many people who are flying out or flying in <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind previous questions in your lordships house can the minister give any indication as to the commencement date of the next nuclear power station <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that anybody who is as fortunate as i was some years ago to visit the hermitage museum in leningrad will see there a substantial collection of very valuable paintings by artists such as rembrandt that were sold to russia in the late th and early th centuries <e> <s> is it not a tragedy that on that occasion those paintings were sold <e> <s> should we not be talking about preserving all of our heritage and not disposing of any of it on a commercial basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not referring to rembrandt as being an english artist <e>", "<cs> my lords the case against the governments intention has been put very eloquently by my colleagues my noble friends lord basnett and lord murray <e> <s> they speak as former trade union officials <e> <s> as a former shop steward i speak from a more humble position in the trade union movement <e> <s> shop stewards are at the sharp end of any industrial action <e>", "<cs> my lords is it normal for your lordships house to be discussing a bill that is not yet on the statute book <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the restoration of two beds <e> <s> however is the minister aware that on the figures which i gave when i last put the question the average number of deaths before months of age in manchester was per cent <e> <s> higher than the national average <e> <s> those figures were obtained when beds were still available <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i accept his answer to my previous question that there has to be a regional perspective to the problem <e> <s> however would he not agree in principle that premature babies born in the centre of manchester have as much right to survival as babies born outside manchester <e> <s> if he concedes that principle will he keep the matter under review in an urgent sense in order to prevent the tragedies which are occurring and which may well be preventable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that any reduction in the very high figures that he has announced is welcome <e> <s> however can he <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret having to ask the minister to give way for a moment but are we debating this report or a report on the residuary bodies <e> <s> there are a lot of other things that i should like to say about the activities of the residuary bodies <e> <s> they are supposed to be accountable to somebody but nobody can find out who they are accountable to <e> <s> some of them are doing some very strange things which i could have introduced into the debate <e> <s> however i restricted myself to the report named on the order paper <e> <s> i am sorry to say that the minister does not appear to be doing that <e> <s> this question of the residuary bodies is an extraneous matter <e>", "<cs> my lords when i opened this debate i explained that i had brought this subject before your lordships house in order to bring this issue before the nation as a whole <e> <s> the exercise has been very worth while <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however does he not agree that the measures outlined in the budget will make the application of the governments policies more difficult <e> <s> although the tax rebates or tax deductions for some individuals will be in excess of a week at the same time according to the ministers answer the government intend to continue to exhort people at the lowest end of the wage scale those who are on very minimal and low rates to keep their wage claims as low as possible <e> <s> is that not a contradiction <e> <s> will it not exacerbate still further the divide between the two groups of people <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the question relates to wage settlements does the minister recall that following negotiations a few weeks ago between ford management and workers in which the full-time officers of the trade unions agreed to a settlement that settlement was then overwhelmingly rejected by the workforce and further negotiations had to take place <e> <s> is the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord kaberry <e> <s> for some years i was the secretary of a club in manchester <e> <s> although it carried a political name and was politically active it was owned by each individual member <e> <s> the noble lord is correct in saying that under the old licensing law within the global figure of opening hours there was a variation in the hours of sunday opening <e> <s> clubs were able to make application dependent on the local licensing magistrate in their area <e> <s> for instance my club did not open from noon until pm on sunday as did most of the other working mens clubs in manchester it varied the hours from pm to pm <e> <s> therefore there was a certain amount of relaxation and the hours were applied differently <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not what democracy is about that a group of people who know something about a subject may know more about it than the government <e> <s> are they not entitled to express their contrary opinion <e> <s> if the government are right all the time what is the point in having general elections <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i wish him to be factually correct <e> <s> he said quite clearly that clubs can now open until pm on a sunday <e> <s> am i not right in saying that that is only with the permission of the local licensing magistrates <e> <s> very often in more cases than not the magistrates do not grant such a licence <e> <s> the overwhelming number of working mens clubs in this country open from noon to pm <e> <s> i said that the club of which i was the secretary for a great number of years had a variation from pm to pm but it was the only working club in manchester that had such a concession <e> <s> can the minister confirm that permission has to be granted by the local magistrates when the club is reregistered which i believe is now after every three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i challenge the information which the minister has because i had the job of reregistering the club <e> <s> when the licensing laws of were invoked the local magistrates could give a licence for months three years or five years and that depended upon their judgment <e> <s> together with other club secretaries i had the job of going down to register the club <e> <s> i am perfectly convinced that i am right unless the law has been altered meanwhile and no one has taken much notice <e>", "<cs> my lords if a single market is achieved by will there be a levelling upwards for the workers in this country who in many instances have poorer wage rates and poorer working conditions than their compatriots in the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that my noble friend lord mellish makes a most important point regarding the problem <e> <s> this problem is severe in certain areas <e> <s> is the minister further aware that in those areas the latest figures show that the situation continues to deteriorate despite the increased funds welcome funds that the minister announced the secretary of state had made available a short time ago <e> <s> is the minister also aware <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister also aware that the housing bill he referred to is not greeted with any acclamation whatever by people who are dealing with the problem because they think it is completely inconsequential on the subject of homelessness <e>", "<cs> my lords i join previous speakers in expressing my appreciation to my colleague on the front bench lord underhill for introducing a debate on this subject <e> <s> it is an extremely important one which concerns the present and future wellbeing of ourselves as a nation in terms of communications <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that until a short time ago there was concern over the slowness of assessment by the department of the environment and the department of trade and industry of various schemes submitted for both urban and rural areas <e> <s> can he say whether any additional staff are being engaged in order to speed up the disposition which is causing serious concern because of the sources of private capital which are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords like previous speakers i should like to express my appreciation to the noble lord lord joseph for introducing this subject for debate <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> however i must say that whatever the system which governs a country may be i have never found any shortage among what he termed the ruling class <e> <s> the ruling class in any system do not walk about in sackcloth and ashes they are usually at the top of the tree whatever the system <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that in some respects america is very good <e> <s> however in others its patchwork quilt is not a good example and does not provide the answers <e> <s> in fact the country would like to find them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the way in which he has dealt with the point i raised <e> <s> i used the term boston <e> <s> boston is the heartbeat of massachusetts and its recovery has been phenomenal <e> <s> however perhaps he will agree that there are parts of the united states in virginia and parts of the old mining belt that are still as bad in almost every aspect as the worst places here <e> <s> that is the point that i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the projects that the minister has mentioned <e> <s> is he aware that with many of them the return is as high as six or eight times per of private money as against public input <e> <s> however is he also aware that there are areas of the uk where because of geographical and demographic differences such a high return cannot be expected <e> <s> will the government look sympathetically on a higher input in areas where it is needed in order to get these schemes off the ground and moving <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am grateful for that reply as are other people involved in the building industry both in the public and private sectors <e> <s> however he must be aware of the number of bodies involved in the building industry which have expressed deep concern about the future provision of skilled men in the industry and that there may not be sufficient to carry out the necessary redevelopment programmes in our cities <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether the government will keep the matter under review to prevent any slip backwards in what looks like a very welcome progression towards the objectives which we so desire <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister must be aware that doubts have been expressed about the training schemes under the citb and yts which are of only two years duration <e> <s> those involved in the industry have expressed the view that in order to produce a finished product that period is on the short side <e> <s> they feel that three years would be more in keeping with producing a skilled operative <e> <s> will the minister keep that situation under review and if necessary make a change when time and resources allow <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if the remainder of the capital receipts was made available for local authorities to get on with the job of building more houses and renovating those that have deteriorated because of lack of financial resources that may well prevent the government having to set up the housing action trust which they intend to do <e> <s> it may be very expensive to run and it is merely replacing the local authority function with something else which will be an unelected body <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said that he thought in this particular matter that the government had been high-handed and that there had not been sufficient consultation <e> <s> surely the noble lord must be aware that since the time of his distinguished tenure as secretary of state for the environment when i was part of a local government delegation that met him on the housing finance act successive secretaries of state of his own party including his colleague the noble lord lord jenkin have almost completely denied and denuded local government of some of its major responsibilities <e> <s> without any consultation whatsoever local government has been butchered year after year by his successors <e>", "<cs> the minister in his reply referred to people who are accommodated substantially in hostels <e> <s> what does substantial mean <e> <s> many of the people concerned go to a hostel for one night only and then go back on to the street <e>", "<cs> i rise on behalf of members on these benches to support the amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord hayter and supported by the noble lord lord shaughnessy <e> <s> it seeks to exempt any person whose sole or main residence is not a building caravan or houseboat <e> <s> we believe that to be an obvious and important solution to the difficulties posed by the community charge for a particularly impoverished and deprived section of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that very informative reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether the advisory standards which are to be issued later this year will be mandatory or optional <e> <s> if they are optional is he aware that because of lack of resources many local authorities will certainly not implement them and the carnage suggested in the figures he has given today will continue <e> <s> i do not think that that is what any of us in your lordships house or elsewhere wishes to see happen <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that i am somewhat disappointed at his answer to my supplementary question that there will still be a large number of properties for which the necessity to provide that type of accommodation without fire risk will be left to the mercies of individual local authorities <e> <s> as he said considerable resources will be necessary to bring those buildings up to standard <e>", "<cs> is it not a fact that these registers are being compiled for one single purpose only for the collection and payment of poll tax <e> <s> the minister has gone part of the way by agreeing to consider the matter to see whether he can come forward with a suggestion <e> <s> does the minister understand that some of us feel even at the final stages that he ought to go further and make it an offence for the register to be made available for any other purpose in order to give people adequate protection rather than the half-way measure that is proposed at present <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> a i suggest that we deal also with amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the two amendments introduce safeguards as to the inclusion in the register of persons not liable to the community charge <e> <s> the first amendment provides that no person should be entered on the register before the beginning of the financial year before that in which they become liable <e> <s> in practice the most likely application of that provision would be to limit the registration of teenagers until the financial year in which they become <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to illustrate both the principle and the practical considerations <e> <s> the principle is that information should not be held about individuals where it is not strictly necessary for the administration of government <e>", "<cs> i am extremely grateful for the ministers very detailed and in some respects helpful reply <e> <s> however i must latch on to the remark which he made about the individual registration officer <e> <s> are we to assume that there could be a different interpretation or different time factor depending upon the particular registration officer in a particular area <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister but i still have some reservations <e> <s> i should have asked him whether the bill as at present drafted would allow for retrospective claims in respect of death <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to welcome the ministers undertaking to consult local authorities before i hope he means before and not after the event <e> <s> i believe that the minister will recall that a few days before our recess when we were discussing the bill in committee not i but another member stated that unfortunately over the past few years the government have dealt rather shabbily with local government and its proceedings <e> <s> in doing so a tremendous amount of historical goodwill towards the government whether conservative or labour i am not trying to politicise it has been dissipated <e>", "<cs> i may have made the point rather badly but i was trying to explain that it was not i who raised the point in previous proceedings in this house <e> <s> it was raised by a distinguished ex-secretary of state who is now a member of your lordships house on the government benches <e> <s> i joined in only as a party to what has taken place with local government <e>", "<cs> before the minister rises i suggest that this is an extremely difficult point to cover and on which to try to legislate <e> <s> for example as my noble friend said regarding the question of day and night the people who use the beds are not allowed to stay in the day centres during the day <e> <s> are we not reaching a situation unless the government look again and reconsider in which the authority which is trying to do a particular job for people at the bottom end of the social scale may well be charged for doing that particular job when the people whom they are helping have flown <e>", "<cs> the minister when justifying the course that the government are adopting started to quote figures comparing student nurses with full-time students <e> <s> i have a list of figures which i do not intend to read out at this time of night which shows that the balance in favour if that is the right term of student nurses is nothing like as substantial as the minister said <e> <s> full-time students have access to other opportunities which student nurses will not have <e>", "<cs> in his reply the minister gave some details regarding the various categories of people who would be included under the terms of this amendment <e> <s> but he did not quote the terms in sums of money and that is what the people whom this amendment is about are concerned with <e> <s> they are not concerned with the percentages of relief that they will get <e> <s> they are concerned with what they will actually have to pay <e>", "<cs> i am rather sorry that the minister has not been able to give more information in his reply <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment is mainly concerned with people on manpower services commission schemes <e> <s> they are not very well rewarded <e> <s> there has been a lot of friction even on the msc itself about this and indeed only recently the trade union representatives were talking about withdrawing because of what is considered to be a poor rate of remuneration for people attending those particular schemes <e> <s> it seems odd that if people are being encouraged and quite rightly because i believe in training schemes as an alternative to <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble baroness has put it in that way because there are people involved in all these schemes who could be affected in some way by the proposals in the bill <e> <s> the point i am making is that where the government encourage people to participate in these schemes whatever they may be to start to load on to that substantial payments of the poll tax or the community charge whatever it is termed could well be a disincentive <e> <s> that is the only point i am making <e> <s> the present secretary of state who is now responsible for industry but who used to be responsible for employment has made great play of indeed a career out of promoting these kinds of schemes on the basis of attracting people to a wide variety of schemes <e> <s> i am asking the government to look at this on the basis of where people are in training and where there is no other option <e> <s> i have to say that if the training schemes were withdrawn in certain areas the unemployment figures would rocket once again because there are no alternative jobs other than the training <e> <s> that is why i make this serious point <e> <s> i ask the minister if the government would look at the situation because once again i think we may well be hitting people who ought to be given every assistance to continue with what they have been encouraged to do <e>", "<cs> i do not totally disagree with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> she doubts the premise on which i had questioned the minister <e> <s> i shall certainly look at what he has said and try to translate it into terms of pounds <e> <s> i do not want to go down that particular road now <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the point was well publicised in the press that the higher academics in scotland have shown deep concern about the way students there are being affected despite what the minister has said and assurances that he has given <e>", "<cs> the minister is trying to convey that there is no need for disquiet <e> <s> i am trying to make the point in the amendments that there is deep concern about how the students will be affected <e> <s> i quoted the body concerned <e> <s> the higher academics in scotland support the students case that they have been harshly dealt with <e> <s> if that is not so i am asking the minister to prove that that case is wrong <e> <s> what is happening in scotland now will occur in england if the bill is passed as it stands <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i must return to the minister <e> <s> i referred to the fact that the distinguished professor in scotland indicated support for the students in scotland <e> <s> professor sir mark richmond said <e>", "<cs> i have to come back reluctantly once again <e> <s> who is right <e> <s> are the government misinterpreting the matter <e> <s> if they are then i do not believe there is anything sinister about that <e> <s> governments of all colours have made mistakes before <e> <s> however we have a very distinguished educationist in scotland who i believe would be totally aware of what these measures mean and what is going to happen <e> <s> what he says is in contradiction with what the minister says <e> <s> are the government saying that professor sir mark richmond is wrong in what he said in the statement which i believe was in the press at the weekend <e> <s> someone has it wrong <e> <s> i suggest that we should go away in order to see who does have it wrong because i cannot see a distinguished academic with all his knowledge of mathematics and so on being so wrong in this particular situation <e>", "<cs> we shall obviously have to wait and see <e> <s> the noble lord lord beloff scores a point <e> <s> i do not know the particular gentleman concerned and possibly the noble lord lord beloff does <e> <s> i understand that although the gentleman may have left scotland some time ago he is the chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals and that he is at present the vice-chancellor of the manchester university <e> <s> i believe that that indicates that he has a strong claim although perhaps not domiciled in scotland to speak from a very powerful position <e> <s> that reinforces my argument <e> <s> we are not only talking about scotsmen north of the border <e> <s> we are talking about somebody who is chairman of the committee of vice-chancellors and principals and who has a much wider national perception of what is about to take place <e> <s> i would be prepared to look at what the minister said and i hope that the government will look at the matter again and <e>", "<cs> is the minister aware that although he is trying to compare members of the labour party in your lordships house with members of the labour party in another place we are not always in tandem <e> <s> i think that events on the television last night prove that at this time the brains appear to rest at this end of the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> is the minister not aware that the objective of the house and the committee tonight is for the opposition to try to persuade the minister to change the mind of his colleague in another place <e> <s> that is what we are about <e> <s> it is not about an election and what certain of our colleagues think in another place <e> <s> the objective of these amendments is to persuade the minister sympathetic as he is to get the secretary of state in another place to yield a little more in the direction in which we are trying to push him <e> <s> it has nothing whatever to do with what people in another place think about the issue at all <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way on this matter of secession <e> <s> does he not understand that in the metropolitan county areas the hard core of the population is served by the biggest authority <e> <s> for instance west yorkshire has a population of million people of whom live in the city of leeds <e> <s> the west midlands has a population of about million of whom million live in the city of birmingham <e> <s> in greater manchester nearly half a million of its million population live in the centre of manchester <e> <s> those are the spokes and the heartbeat of the transport authorities <e> <s> if they opt for secession what is left for the small authorities outside those areas <e> <s> quite sincerely i predict that there will be a terrible disintegration of the whole of the service <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister break down the nearly million between your lordships house and another place <e> <s> which portion is being used by which house <e>", "<cs> my lords do not those figures convey that members of your lordships house are behaving with admirable restraint <e>", "<cs> i wanted to follow the noble lord lord jenkin <e> <s> i listened to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> if one considers this matter in areas over per cent <e> <s> of the population are in the urban areas <e> <s> in my opinion they would not be affected as the noble lord predicts <e> <s> from the way in which he put his case the only conclusion that can be drawn is that revaluation would automatically explode rates upwards <e> <s> that is nonsense it would not <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to support this amendment because my colleague and noble friend lord stallard as he has done throughout his political career has again chosen to champion people at the lower end of the social scale <e> <s> the committee may recall earlier in our proceedings on this bill that i referred to what happened in tramp wards in the old days <e> <s> they were given a nights lodgings even if in a low standard bed and a frugal breakfast in the morning of perhaps a slice of toast and cocoa on which they were expected to do a days work but they rapidly disappeared <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> perhaps she remembers that only a few years ago the police forces received from the government or at least by government negotiation a very substantial increase in salary to which the local authorities objected because of the proportion of that increase that they would have to meet <e> <s> nevertheless they were completely ignored <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down perhaps he will take it from me that some people on this side of the committee would not be too disappointed at not having to be here on thursday <e> <s> having toiled through this bill for a long time unfortunately not too successfully we wish the noble earl all the best in his endeavours <e> <s> i have no doubt that his colleagues on the front bench will he adequate replacements or loca while he is away <e> <s> we wish him a safe return <e>", "<cs> the point that my noble friend made regarding other major cities is relevant <e> <s> although it is late in the evening i think some of us would like to know what is happening in that regard <e> <s> there are a variety of schemes and methods of carrying out schemes which are being altered and pot-pourried all the time by the government <e> <s> a few months ago perhaps before the general election the main thrust was on inner city development schemes <e> <s> a large number were being programmed by the phoenix development corporation which had government blessing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that people dealing with the problem of homelessness recently issued information which shows that in london alone over the past four years homelessness and the number of people sleeping rough have doubled <e> <s> is he also aware that it is now calculated that people sleep out rough each night in london alone <e> <s> is he further aware that the numbers and percentage of people suffering from mental health disorders of various kinds are increasing substantially <e> <s> ought we not to be looking for drastic action in order to stop the escalation in the number of those very tragic cases <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the report from which i quoted in my first supplementary question showed that in the foreseeable future the number of people sleeping rough in london could be of the same order as in new york where it is estimated that at present people sleep rough an ever-increasing number of those people being found to be mentally ill in some way <e> <s> i and those people involved with this problem welcome the recent announcement of increased financial resources from government to deal with it <e> <s> but the minister must be aware of the size of the problem with which we are dealing and realise that even those increased measures are only tilting at windmills in an attempt to fight a major war <e> <s> will he ask the secretary of state as quickly as possible substantially further to increase resources and i am speaking about providing housing for those people in order to enable the people who are dealing with the problem to produce some improvement before it becomes too bad to deal with at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down as i understood it the minister said clearly that the government would seek the advice of the local education officer on the question of redundancy <e> <s> i notice that the noble lord lord trefgarne who i think has not been present during <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry <e> <s> i am putting a question to the minister and i disregard what the noble lord lord trefgarne has said <e> <s> i think that i am making a very fundamental and important point before the minister sits down <e>", "<cs> my lords i have now had a chance to look at standing orders <e> <s> i was totally right in what i said <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the noble lord lord grimond should not be so smug in heaping praise upon scottish football supporters <e> <s> as i recall it was only a few years ago that wembley for the first and only time was wrecked after an international match and it was the scottish supporters and not the english supporters who did it <e> <s> so this matter is rather more national than the noble lord lord grimond tries to make out <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for the very detailed figures that he has given us <e> <s> is he aware that local authorities calculate that since in global terms they have lost billion through government withdrawal and change of subsidy <e> <s> is he further aware that if that money had been left where it was and made available to them that sum could have gone towards refurbishing to a much higher and more acceptable standard percent <e> <s> of the more than council houses which the minister keeps telling us are empty in the local authority sector <e> <s> is it not time that the government stopped blaming local authorities for some of their own misdoings <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that i be allowed to smile at the intervention of the noble lord lord jenkin as he was one of the culprits who indulged in that exercise of massive cuts in subsidies <e> <s> in fact cannot he be accused of behaving like the surgeon who kept his foot on the oxygen tube until the patient expired and then blamed the nursing staff for neglect <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and with the leave of the house not all married women who are abused find their way to hostels which are designated to provide special facilities for that type of person <e> <s> i recall from my experiences in manchester that there was a large womens hostel near the city centre which catered for a wide variety of ladies who were on their own <e> <s> i am sure this experience is repeated in other cities certainly in london <e> <s> some of these ladies were working and able to earn a living and support themselves entirely but because the hostel was in the city centre people who had nowhere to go and were in distress perhaps because of problems of violence at home used to find their way there to live as a temporary relief <e> <s> can the minister indicate whether such individuals will receive sympathetic consideration on the lines enunciated by my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i think there are a number of hostels throughout the country which have a percentage of that type of person in them though they are not specifically for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen with great interest to what the noble lord lord renton says but i think that on this occasion he might himself be introducing a little levity <e> <s> having spoken at quite some length on this particular problem in the early stages of the bill i join with my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey in the appreciation he has expressed for this concession which shows recognition of the problems of homeless people <e> <s> i think it would be extremely difficult to find anybody whom we would term homeless who would be in the ownership of even four wheels and chassis let alone a car capable of passing the necessary test to put it on the road <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> i know that he is a very busy man as most of us are <e> <s> if the minister could take time off from his very busy life to travel around inner london with those of us who have already been there to where these people have to

minister sits down does he recall during the earlier stages of this bill that we had an extensive discussion on even-handed treatment across the different local authority areas concerned with this bill <e> <s> is it not a fact i believe it to be a fact that if the bill goes through as the minister suggests there may be different behaviour and different applications by various registration officers in their interpretation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> does the noble baroness not understand that very often even ministers of the crown misinterpret what an act means and are taken to court <e> <s> i am not specifically referring to ministers of any political party but they have sometimes misread and misunderstood legislation and have been taken to court and told that they have been out of order <e> <s> this type of legislation will create a minefield in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords in moving this amendment i believe that the minister referred to it as being a clarifying amendment <e> <s> perhaps i am trying to over-simplify it <e> <s> paragraph a reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened earlier today to the debates on some of the amendments that related to this problem <e> <s> one of the faults in the bill is that it is so all-embracing <e> <s> it does not have detailed regard for areas of special need <e> <s> there are areas in london and most of our major cities certainly in my home town of manchester where a substantial number of people in the city centre have to receive maximum financial support from public funding <e> <s> there is very little possibility in the foreseeable future for any change in the financial situation for that group of families <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i should like to say that magistrates are not necessarily rubber stamps for any government irrespective of their political colour <e> <s> are we not in a situation where some magistrates benches could have more enlightened views than those in other areas <e> <s> are we also not in a situation where the act could be enforced but if it is not obligatory the magistrates could refuse to do what the government want if they take that view and if there are any options left open <e> <s> that situation happens now and it happened in the past in respect of the seizure of property under the old tenancies act <e> <s> that act was scrapped because the magistrates had the right only to issue an eviction order and therefore dispossessions and so forth had to be processed through the county courts which took a longer time <e> <s> the minister may believe that this will be carried out in an even pattern <e> <s> i believe that unless this is provided for in tramlines the situation could be very pepper-potted <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not make sense if the government were now to assist manchester in its efforts to attract a larger increase in international flights especially from the american continent which would relieve heathrow and gatwick of some of the tremendous pressures they are experiencing <e> <s> can the minister give any indication of whether the government will consider manchesters case sympathetically as there does not appear to be much progress in that direction at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i realise that in this case there is certain commercial sensitivity <e> <s> the minister will know that nearly three years ago i met the previous secretary of state for the environment with his ministerial team including two members of your lordships house <e> <s> in complete confidence i expressed to them my fears as regards what might happen <e> <s> in view of the answer that the minister gave can he tell me whether it is in order for the chairman of a residuary body to become the chairman of a commercial trading company <e> <s> can the minister tell me whether the appointment as chairman ceases when the residuary body itself ceases to exist bearing in mind that as yet the districts have no input into the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the enormous debt that has been run up under the previous chairman in his dual role as chief executive i do not wish to quote the figure because it has already been quoted in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendments moved and fully explained by the noble lord lord middleton and supported by the noble lord lord peyton <e> <s> as the noble lord lord peyton said in the past we have seen governments of various political colours indulge in retrospective legislation <e> <s> it is not a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the minister when giving part of his reasons for moving this amendment used the word consult <e> <s> can be explain what he means by that consult in what terms with whom and when <e> <s> it is simply a request for information <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i have misunderstood the minister but i conclude from what he was saying was that if there are surpluses they would be made available in rebate form to the business sector but that no such rebate would be available for the domestic sector <e> <s> have i understood the minister correctly to say that rebates would be available <e> <s> if he is saying that it will appear overwhelmingly to the domestic poll tax payer and ratepayer that there is a privileged sector within the local community that is the commercial sector <e> <s> if rebates are available to only one sector that is a biased way in the extreme of looking at it <e> <s> the minister may shake his head and may think that i have misrepresented him but i am putting myself in the position of the ratepayer who finds that somebody in commerce close to him receives a rebate because that sector has done rather well but no rebates would be available to him as a domestic ratepayer <e> <s> it may be good for the commercial sector and no doubt it would be welcomed <e> <s> but i should have thought that a ratepayer in a local authority with a healthy bank balance at the end of the year is as much entitled to benefit as the commercial sector from that healthy balance <e> <s> if i have misunderstood the minister perhaps he will correct me <e>", "<cs> my lords it still shows an element of more favourable treatment to one sector <e> <s> however i have no desire to test the will of the house and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that concern about the conditions in prisons used as remand centres goes far wider than that covered by the appalling report on risley <e> <s> is he further aware that conditons in the old gaols such as <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if he had had the figures available for which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter asked they would show that over the years a considerable subsidy has been provided by the taxpayer in order to help harland and wolff stay open <e> <s> indeed in view of the social consequences most of us would support that action <e> <s> however is it not a fact that that subsidy is far in excess of any subsidy that has ever been given to any shipyard on the mainland <e> <s> is the minister also aware that bearing in mind the present situation of the shipbuilding industry nationally if financial assistance is not continued indefinitely it could spell very serious consequences for harland and wolff its workforce and northern ireland as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the minister said in moving the second reading of this bill <e> <s> my mind goes back over the past three or four years since i was privileged to enter your lordships house and i recall the number of debates that have taken place <e> <s> we have had debates on reports on housing published by totally independent bodies <e> <s> i believe that the first one was a report by the duke of edinburghs commission on housing <e> <s> the debate was opened by the noble lord lord seebohm who i believe is present <e> <s> that was subsequently followed by the debate on <e>", "<cs> my lords it was the cost yardstick <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> his understanding of the present situation in that he believes that houses adapted for special need are being easily sold is not in accordance with the facts <e> <s> if one reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> the question of the designation of hats was only sprung on us <e>", "<cs> my lords this helpful amendment carries out the decision which we reached at report stage <e> <s> we welcome it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to stand in the way of redevelopment either in london docklands or in other urban development areas <e> <s> however i noted that the minister referred to consultations with the local authority in the final part of his answer <e> <s> the local authority does not necessarily represent the views of the tenants who are being moved <e> <s> will the minister ensure in order that good will remains that wherever large groups of families are being moved in this way the utmost consultation will take place with the tenants and not just with the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords in one of his responses the minister said that a minority of the tenants were strongly against the move <e> <s> therefore he must be aware that if those tenants stand by their ultimate rights it would take court action to evict them which would mean a most expensive delay in terms of money for the redevelopers and everyone else <e> <s> can the minister use his best endeavours to ensure wherever he can that the fullest consultation takes place beforehand in order to avoid such a situation which would benefit no one involved in the exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for those figures but do they not indicate that government policy is very largely responsible for the present housing crisis in the country <e> <s> is it not a fact taking the global figures since the government took office that if we had been building houses for the public sector at the same rate as in we should have had more than half a million houses extra in the public sector today <e> <s> does it not seem madness that the government continue to withhold from local authorities the money that they have raised from the sale of capital assets which had it been made available in full could have made a tremendous impact and dent in these appalling figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am once again surprised at the intervention of the noble lord lord jenkins whom i and many other people consider was the architect of the appalling housing situation that we find ourselves in today by the measures that he helped to introduce against local authorities <e> <s> having in mind that it is established that we would have had half a million extra houses in the public sector to let is it not a fact that the shortage and unavailability of those houses must have had a tremendous effect on house prices and the upward explosion of homeless people in the areas of greatest need <e> <s> will the minister comment on what he thinks might have happened to house prices had those half a million houses been available to let <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows to whom i am referring <e> <s> i am of course referring to the former secretary of state the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e>", "<cs> obviously i am not going to move forward and begin speaking about amendment no <e> <s> because no doubt that will be given a proper airing in its rightful place <e> <s> on the ministers reply to this amendment one matter strikes me <e> <s> he keeps referring to market rents but never once has anyone representing the government used the term a fair rent <e> <s> if some of the protection contained within this amendment is not given serious consideration and is dismissed out of hand it will result in a fair rent but only to the landlord <e> <s> it will not be fair to the tenant <e> <s> if one were in a situation where supply almost equates with demand one could achieve some kind of negotiation on a rational and reasonable basis <e> <s> however in an area such as inner london which will probably be the biggest minefield of the lot there will be no basis for setting reasonable and fair negotiations <e>", "<cs> i should like to believe the noble baroness that these will be completely new lettings and that they are not already on the market <e> <s> each year there is a considerable changeover of lettings of any kind whether in the private or public sector <e> <s> once a tenancy ceases it becomes a new one <e> <s> i take a completely opposite view to that of the noble baroness when she speaks about negotiations and the protection that they will give to tenants <e> <s> i believe that tenants will get about as much protection from these measures as giving someone who has just been to the guillotine an aspirin to cure the headache <e> <s> these provisions are loaded mainly in favour of landlords otherwise the bill would not be before us <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reply first to the minister <e> <s> while i do not see it happening if as the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i appear to be concentrating on london <e> <s> i was a member of parliament and at one time the leader of manchester council with housing as my special responsibility <e> <s> i am quite aware that not only london manchester and leeds have housing problems <e> <s> i understand that <e> <s> the government have been asked about homelessness on a number of occasions <e> <s> it was raised during the second reading debate and in a series of questions <e> <s> the government keep telling us that they are convinced that the bill will help to solve the problem <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend and colleague lord stallard put a most pertinent question on the issue of assured tenancies <e> <s> he asked how many assured tenancies there are now <e> <s> i do not have the latest figure but i do know that when the question was last answered from the dispatch box by the noble lord lord skelmersdale the number given at that time which was not so long ago was appallingly low <e> <s> in fact i think it was in the region of just over <e> <s> unless there has been a dramatic acceleration since then are we to assume that the assured tenancies scheme has been a failure <e>", "<cs> the ministers theories are not justified by the figures because the figures i have are that since assured tenancies have appeared of which are sheltered accommodation <e> <s> therefore in fact there have been assured tenancies since <e> <s> if that is success show me a failure <e> <s> however bearing in mind what the minister said i should like to look at the implications of what he said and because we have had a good debate on the matter i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am obviously grateful for the fact that the minister has undertaken to take the matter away and consider it <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way to one of those three very eminent persons as he described them <e> <s> is he not aware that this particular provision concerning the mandatory action of the court is nothing new <e> <s> if one goes not too far back in history one will find that there used to be an act called i believe the small tenancies act under which landlords could apply to the magistrates court <e> <s> the only thing that the magistrates court could do was order an eviction it had no discretion in the matter whatever <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the noble lord lord harris of greenwich is correct in that the last legislation which was bulldozed through another place and then bulldozed through this house towards the extreme end of the parliamentary session was ill-conceived <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to join in a second reading debate <e> <s> however the government have been questioned about homelessness week after week and month after month and we are always being told to wait for the forthcoming housing bill <e> <s> we have been told that it will make a tremendous impact on the situation <e> <s> i have heard nothing to date which will do that <e>", "<cs> the flood of tenanted houses that according to the ministers reply was to become available has already been reduced to a trickle <e> <s> he said in one breath that there was no evidence of key money or of this practice taking place in the next breath he said that there was evidence of down payments and it seemed to work <e>", "<cs> the point has been made before that there will not be any complaints <e> <s> in my view the minister has let the cat out of the bag <e> <s> it will have little or no effect at all on the homeless people the government have been talking about all the time <e> <s> on the basis of that fact and the way the argument has developed in the committee i see no alternative to testing the views of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the sympathy which the minister expressed for the position of carers in his opening remarks <e> <s> however it saddens me that the government are not now to be convinced that there is a case to go forward <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the committee any longer than is necessary but i tried to point out the fact that because of the responsibility and onus they place upon themselves the carers are saving the community which means the taxpayer and the government a considerable sum of money by the job that they are undertaking which is very often unpaid <e> <s> they are skimping and even denying themselves any form of social life in order to care for <e>", "<cs> i should like to refer briefly to the homeless people in relation to what the noble baroness said in moving the amendment <e> <s> the stage is being reached where accommodation for them is costing local authorities so much certainly in the centre of london that it may well pay the government to take on board the initial payments referred to as key money <e> <s> it may well be in the interests both of the chancellor of the exchequer and <e>", "<cs> i wish that i could receive what the minister said with some gratitude <e> <s> i wish that what he said would help reach the governments objective <e> <s> i am certain that it will not do so <e> <s> this part of the bill is based upon attracting private funding <e> <s> it may have gone over the ministers head although it did not go over mine because i have been involved in large and medium scale housing development in the past but what one can build and fund often depends on the interest that one pays <e> <s> i do not know how <e>", "<cs> i hate to intrude on an amendment moved by my noble friend and colleague lord mcintosh but i am sure that he will understand <e> <s> this section of the bill and the question of hats was introduced into this chamber and another place at a very late stage <e> <s> the minister will recall that only a couple of weeks ago i questioned him on the procedure that had been adopted in the proposed removal of families in tower hamlets in order to make way for a roadway into canary wharf <e> <s> i made the point then to the noble earl lord caithness that when conducting negotiations finding out the views of the local authority is not necessarily commensurate with finding out the views of the tenants <e> <s> the noble lord said that the world was not perfect and he hoped that i would remember that at the committee stage of the forthcoming housing bill <e> <s> that is the point we have now reached <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes the mistake of saying local housing authority <e> <s> we have tried to differentiate between the local housing authority and the tenants <e> <s> our main priority is the tenant not the local authority <e> <s> very often the differences between the tenants and their local authority are quite profound <e> <s> i submit that that factor is not covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for giving way <e> <s> is the minister aware that the tenants representatives who met the secretary of state yesterday indicated quite clearly that they wanted nothing whatever to do with the exercise <e> <s> what is the alternative if that is the outcome <e>", "<cs> i did not say <e> <s> i said families in four blocks of flats <e>", "<cs> i want to correct that <e> <s> i am talking about families in four blocks <e> <s> i want to get the record right <e>", "<cs> the figures i gave were families in four blocks of flats <e> <s> we should get the record right <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the very detailed reply that the minister has given on the basis that he thinks that the government have gone far enough <e> <s> i and my colleagues on this side of the chamber do not think that he has gone far enough <e> <s> the minister seemed to be making great play of the fact that there was a reservoir of empty houses in the local authority pools in the area that could cater for homeless people <e> <s> if those houses are unlettable now i do not see why people who have had the misfortune to be made homeless should be expected to populate these houses without improvements taking place <e> <s> on that basis i think i ought to test the opinion of the committee <e>", "<cs> i believe that the amendment moved by my noble friend lord cocks of hartcliffe is certainly deserving of examination <e> <s> i recall some years ago paying a visit to denmark on a -day housing trust study <e> <s> we were based at the university of copenhagen during the vacation <e> <s> the buildings were put into use during that period to house a variety of people and their scheme was successful <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that correction although politically what i said may be the case <e> <s> i am afraid that i have lost my place <e> <s> it is late in the session and i hope that the committee will sympathise with my predicament <e>", "<cs> yes we may do that <e> <s> mrs roe agreed that section a should apply and agreed to consider how best to apply it <e> <s> however no amendment was brought forward on report in another place <e> <s> it is hoped that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> perhaps he can deal with what i have said <e> <s> to my knowledge over the past four or five years the bids that local authorities have put in for local authority housing stock have been less than per cent <e> <s> net in the broadest sense <e> <s> i believe that we are also entitled to ask whether the million will have any effect on the global amount of housing investment that is made available within the same financial years <e> <s> alternatively will it come from the housing investment programme itself <e> <s> is it an addition <e>", "<cs> i welcome the first part of the ministers reply and his sympathy towards the objectives of the amendment <e> <s> his sympathy ends there <e> <s> the minister referred to the fact that the secretary of state will do this and that will issue edicts and will provide guidelines <e> <s> when i first arrived in another place i was taught that unless a provision is enshrined in an act it is subject to the whim of the secretary of state <e> <s> a future secretary of state may take a much harsher view than our present very tenderly disposed secretary of state for the environment who seems to go out of his way to consider everyones views <e> <s> depending on the whim of the present prime minister he may not be secretary of state at the end of this year and we may get a replacement who is cast in a harsher mould <e> <s> i take the suggestion with a pinch of salt <e>", "<cs> as we are in committee perhaps i may deal with one point raised by the noble lord <e> <s> he implied that no local authority certainly with the intervention of the district valuer would dispose of properties at a loss <e> <s> however he should know that over the past few years there has been protection for local authorities which mainly applied in london where because the cost of building was so high the actual cost had to be reflected in the selling price <e> <s> however the government legislated some time ago to remove that protection <e> <s> there are now local authorities in london who have had to dispose of substantially good houses fairly recently built at less than replacement value <e> <s> it is not entirely true to say that a local authority will always come out on the right side <e> <s> in some areas of london a substantial deficit has been incurred where newly-constructed houses have been sold <e>", "<cs> i shall deal with the point raised by the noble lord lord swinfen regarding the forced disposal of a house by the local authority at less than the replacement cost <e> <s> i may have omitted to make the case but there may be some argument there that the local authority need not build a replacement house <e> <s> there are numerous cases of local authorities in london where they have been forced to sell houses at less than the construction costs to sitting tenants who are not long term tenants <e> <s> the burden of the debt charges on those particular houses has had to be carried by the remaining tenants in the london area <e> <s> i do not know the particular areas in london but a peculiar situation has arisen in the london area because of deliberate legislation by the government <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply and although it was disappointing i received the answer i expected <e> <s> i do not honestly believe that the situation regarding municipal rent debts has even been looked at by the government in the context of the bill <e> <s> as i pointed out during discussions on earlier amendments some of the rent arrears and it is not a question of the local authorities are completely geographical because there are areas of great deprivation with enormous housing revenue account rent arrears <e>", "<cs> obviously i am disappointed in the reply although i received the <e>", "<cs> does the minister recall that just before the annual recess i had a question on the order paper concerning tenants in an area of the london dockland <e> <s> i said words to the effect that i was not deeply concerned about the views of the council which the minister was quoting but was more concerned with the question of the individual tenants <e> <s> had the tenants been asked not the council or the local authority but the tenants <e> <s> the minister said he would remind me during the passage of this bill that the tenant was the prime concern of the government <e> <s> i put that to him now <e>", "<cs> we are in politics because we dare to disagree with one another <e> <s> although i have a great deal of respect for the noble lord i think that he has just talked a load of poppycock <e> <s> i am talking about the rights of individuals <e> <s> i believe that members of the committee are above anything concerned with the rights of individuals <e> <s> it matters not that a vote was taken earlier this evening with a substantial majority for the government <e> <s> that registers in here and it will become law but that vote does not alter the fact that the overwhelming number <e>", "<cs> i believe that we have been in two different debating chambers <e> <s> if the minister cares to read <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister would care to reflect for one moment <e> <s> he believes as he said earlier that this bill will make a massive contribution towards solving the homeless problem and that type of problem and that is really what we are talking about <e> <s> is he saying that the government have doubled homelessness by their policies or by accident <e> <s> is he saying that by accident or by policy we have the smallest public sector building target since the war <e> <s> are all those accidents or government policy <e> <s> if he classes those as successes he is way off the mark <e> <s> if the government had been building at the rate at which the local authorities were in when the government took office there would have been more council house to let <e> <s> therefore he would not be indulging in this exercise <e> <s> the minister is tending to widen the debate <e> <s> i may be sorry that i responded but there will be a lot more to say on this matter before this bill has gone through all its stages <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord campbell of alloway says that we are opposing this because it is a political opposition i should like to meet him in the morning and show him some of the petitions that have been sent to me by tenants of the authority of which i was the former chairman in manchester <e> <s> they have not been solicited but have been sent quite voluntarily <e> <s> those people are not interested in the politics of the matter <e> <s> however having said all that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is late and i do not want to go into detail but after a division earlier i was disturbed when i met a group of tenants from a small authority in essex which has just over houses <e> <s> they have been subjected to some form of consultation organised by the electoral reform society on behalf of the local authority <e> <s> i find it strange that the electoral reform society is being used by a local authority which because of other privatisations wants to unload its housing <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go into further details <e> <s> the authority is small <e> <s> it has only houses <e> <s> those people are being dealt with almost as the bill says they will be dealt with in future <e> <s> that causes me concern <e> <s> i was asked to meet the tenants and i asked them to send me all the relevant details <e> <s> i do not know whether the local authority was acting in accordance with existing statutes <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the ministers somewhat sympathetic reply <e> <s> he has assured the committee that the matter is under review by the government and i know that they are concerned about the situation <e> <s> on that basis i look forward to seeing what eventually emerges and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however does he not agree that one of the most serious aspects of this substantial increase is that it will seriously retard the house-building programme in general both in the public sector which was pretty stagnant anyway and in the private sector which was showing considerable improvement in the numbers of houses started and completed <e> <s> what advice can he or the government give to people who a few months ago borrowed money at around per cent <e> <s> and now find that they have to pay a per cent <e> <s> increase in their mortgage interest repayments and who through no fault of their own find themselves in serious financial difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> the house will welcome his statement that the building societies are taking measures to ameliorate the situation <e> <s> however is he aware that there seems to be a consensus among housing associations and other such organisations that the number of lapses on mortgage repayments and hence the number of repossessions are bound to increase <e>", "<cs> i did not want to intervene in the debate but i shall do so very briefly because as a former chairman of housing in manchester in i must point out that we were one of the first authorities which started to observe in full the provisions of the alf morris act <e> <s> we started to adapt housing for disabled or handicapped people and built houses at what we considered a reasonable level <e>", "<cs> with respect that is not what the noble lord said <e> <s> he said that local authorities were sitting on the money <e> <s> however i see an aspect of the matter which is worthy of consideration by those who have proposed the amendment <e> <s> i do not oppose the amendment in principle but in order not to diminish the stock of houses that have been adapted and built would it not be worth considering at a later stage of the bills proceedings the introduction of a further amendment in respect of such public buildings which have been bought with the privilege of a discount <e> <s> would it not be possible to consider a further amendment which provides that on the death of the person who bought the house which has been built or adapted for the handicapped the local authority should be given first option to buy it back <e> <s> therefore it would be kept in that pool of properties and would be available for the purpose for which it was built and adapted instead of being lost for ever in the general pool of housing <e> <s> in my view that is an objective observation and one worthy of consideration <e> <s> on that basis you would not diminish the housing in the public sector which has been built for handicapped and disabled people <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply and in some respects for the sympathetic points that he made in reply to this clutch of amendments <e> <s> one of the main worries with which we are all faced and i am sure that the minister is as aware of it as anyone is what appears to be the present unstoppable increase in homelessness <e> <s> it is manifesting itself in inner london more than anywhere else <e> <s> reports have been submitted from independent bodies based in london which have the question of homeless people at heart <e> <s> they state that unless there is an arresting of the figure and positive attempts are made to use every means possible to try to ameliorate the situation by the turn of the century london may be in the same situation as new york with people sleeping on the streets <e> <s> they do not all flood in on trains <e> <s> many do so but some are indigenous to london <e> <s> some have lost their homes for a variety of reasons an inability to pay and so forth <e>", "<cs> i said that i would speak briefly to the amendment <e> <s> the ministers response gives an indication of the governments views on these matters <e> <s> i think that he will understand if i say that i should like to read more closely what he has said in conjunction with the information which my colleagues and i have at hand <e> <s> we may wish to come back at a later stage <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> and amendment no <e> <s> h i am sorry <e> <s> i hope that the committee will understand if i deal with these amendments in a similar manner to the previous group of amendments because of the time factor <e> <s> that is not in an attempt to skim these matters but the opposition wish to see what the government intend <e>", "<cs> i am a little disappointed by the ministers reply <e> <s> we have heard this week from various parts of the chamber criticisms of the activities of local authorities <e> <s> such criticisms may have been rather more general than is the reality <e> <s> the alleged behaviour of some local authorities has been given as the reason for some of the conditions that are <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply but can he confirm that some weeks ago mr clarke gave regional health authorities the right to offer increased inducements in some areas in order to remedy staff shortages <e> <s> from past experience is he not aware that such a practice is very dangerous indeed and could tempt one regional authority to poach staff from another <e> <s> is he further aware that some years ago benefiting from earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask a question regarding the answer to my supplementary question <e> <s> while i accept what the minister has said about attracting people into the health service by giving regional authorities the right to offer enhanced salaries in certain areas is he aware that that is a very dangerous practice in a national health service <e> <s> it may well result in different standards in two health services which are almost next to each other <e> <s> those are the dangers that i am highlighting <e> <s> will the government note that these are the same objections that have been raised by the nursing profession <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government give very deep consideration to those parts of the report which suggest that some of the community services which were taken away from local authorities during the last reorganisation of the national health service could be returned to those local authorities which in the main carried them out exceedingly well and were closer to the needs of people than the national health service could ever he no matter how good it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have come to regard the minister favourably over the months and when i have faced him with my colleagues across the dispatch box i have always believed him to be receptive to something which had a great deal of justification <e> <s> i am disappointed at the ministers response to this group of amendments <e> <s> he said quite clearly and i respect him for this that one of the major dividing issues on the bill between her majestys government and the opposition in general is the question of totally free market rents <e> <s> that is what he says the government believe in and are sticking to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised that the minister is coming back on that point because that was the main point that i was making <e> <s> that will be the rent that the tenant can recover <e> <s> if the tenant to any degree is existing on housing benefit that will be what he will be allowed to recover <e> <s> the x factor that i was talking about was the amount that he cannot recover if he has no means of increasing the money for his housing <e> <s> i do not see thousands of people queueing up to tenant houses in london other than those who are really in need <e> <s> in some cases the rents will equate with the right to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that in all cases where a rent is agreed by the rent assessment committee and accepted by the tenant if the landlord does not accept it and is prepared to act outside it he cannot act outside it <e> <s> what happens in such a case <e> <s> are the government going to underpin any agreement that has been made by tenants where the rent assessment committee has indicated that it considers it a reasonable settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister cannot go all the way with this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that brief reply to the amendment <e> <s> i was somewhat amused to hear him in effect suggest that i was seeking to protect au pair girls <e> <s> i was not aware that they needed much protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not speaking for myself but for other people <e> <s> i listened carefully to the minister <e> <s> the amendment needed a government response <e> <s> i am of course aware of the difficulties where people share accommodation with their employer but it is right to point out that the evidence produced for me is that this type of employment is on the increase and will continue to increase <e> <s> it may be that at some stage in the future the government will have to come back to consider a situation that is becoming increasingly difficult <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount impress upon the minister involved that he should give consideration to a more extensive use of some of the regional airports which have an international capacity such as say manchester in order to take some of the load off the two major airports in the south east <e> <s> is this not a matter which could be carefully looked at with a view to bringing some alleviation to the present difficult situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that in his opening remarks the minister gave such a nonsensical reply <e> <s> he said that to appoint people to man this board on a staggered basis would create difficulty <e> <s> it would create no difficulty because if certain places on the board were occupied by nominees of certain parties whose term was being ended those parties would ask to be nominated <e> <s> membership would be on a rolling basis similar to the present system in the regional and area health authorities where composition is on a staggered basis <e> <s> i think that argument is spurious and the worst possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with care to the rather involved reply of the minister <e> <s> he has not convinced me that the agency proposed in the amendment would have no worthwhile role <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful and i am sure that a number of noble lords present in all parts of the house are grateful for the detailed reply to the amendment because it is an important one <e> <s> i do not want to go into a lengthy debate on the subject but in opening his reply the minister broadened the debate wider than the amendment <e> <s> he talked about hats in general <e> <s> i do not share the optimism that he and his ministerial colleagues share regarding hats because during the last week or two mr trippier visited the city of leeds where houses have been designated a hat area <e> <s> he received a very difficult reception a very warm reception indeed <e> <s> the point was made by my noble friend lord mcintosh on a previous amendment that where there is a lack of goodwill and this seems to he the initial kick-off to this type of exercise it has little chance of succeeding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister cannot go a little further <e> <s> however in his lengthy reply he gave an undertaking for which i expressed appreciation and he said that discussions and consultations are continuing <e> <s> i hope that they are going down the road i have tried to pinpoint in the amendment <e> <s> if he can find the way to the end of that road i am sure that he will receive wholehearted support from all sides of the house <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no desire to oppose the amendment <e> <s> however i should like to ask the minister two questions <e> <s> first why is it considered necessary to specify this procedure in respect of arrears when clause gives the secretary of state unlimited discretion to set any financial terms that he thinks fit <e> <s> the government throughout our consideration of the bill have argued consistently against placing details on the face of the legislation and unnecessarily tying the hands of the hats and of the secretary of state in exercising his powers of discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am terrified of the word dowry <e> <s> does the minister mean that the local authority will have to meet the dowry when the property is transferred <e> <s> it could be that a considerable dowry will have to be met by the remaining council house tenants <e> <s> i have expressed my total opposition to such a dowry having to be met by those long-suffering people <e> <s> it is grossly unfair on them <e> <s> however those are just comments <e> <s> i do not oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather surprised at the obvious abysmal ignorance of the noble baroness lady blatch as to what i was really talking about <e> <s> i am not talking about buttering up local authorities <e> <s> the noble baroness makes the mistake of equating council house tenants with local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords we were brought to order earlier in the day by the leader of the house who told us the rules of debate on report and therefore i have no need to reply to the noble baroness <e> <s> if the local authorities have to find the money then the government are trying to ensure that they can only find it in one way namely by increasing the rents of the remaining tenants as the bill stands <e> <s> that is the argument <e> <s> i simply ask the minister to give the most serious consideration to <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall withdraw the amendment but i do not believe that the minister could have given me a more unhelpful and negative answer <e>", "<cs> what will happen when one joint tenant is abroad and cannot be contacted by the other joint tenant <e> <s> he may have left the incumbent with the responsibility for paying the rent <e> <s> a woman suffering domestic violence may temporarily have left the matrimonial home <e> <s> the husband could be suffering domestic violence <e> <s> a woman may have gone home to mother or be living temporarily in a hostel for battered wives <e> <s> what will happen in the case of joint tenants who share facilities but do not live as one family <e> <s> these are everyday happenings and must be taken into account <e> <s> we should like to hear the governments thinking on these matters <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> obviously there is some difficulty in the matter but i do not wish to delay the proceedings any longer <e> <s> it is almost like opening up a can of worms <e> <s> i ask the government what would happen for instance where the husband is the tenant and votes for moving but the wife says no <e> <s> does the wife then register as homeless on the transfer of the property <e> <s> does the local authority the potential buyer or the potential person who will take control of the property then have to go through a court procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for what he has said <e> <s> i have some sympathy with his point of view <e> <s> unfortunately it will not work out as he thinks it will <e> <s> if the local authority is left with the debt it has three ways of raising or obtaining the money <e> <s> one is by grant from the government in the rate support grant which it will not get <e> <s> the only two remaining possibilities are to load it on to the authoritys own rates which will shortly i understand be made illegal <e> <s> once again we fall back on the existing council house tenant who will have to meet the debt <e> <s> the minister talked of local authorities going to court and evicting tenants <e> <s> local authorities are very reluctant to do that as they are only loading themselves with another problem of creating homeless tenants <e> <s> i do not say this with my tongue in my cheek but the overwhelming number of families who hold debts in local authority housing will never meet them <e> <s> a large percentage of the debt is i believe irrecoverable <e> <s> i do not know how it would be possible to create a system to collect the money <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will recall that during committee stage i raised this very point <e> <s> i see no reason why machinery could not be brought in to give the local authority the right to pre-emption <e> <s> if that were the case i would support these amendments <e> <s> however if it is not even to receive consideration i have heard no arguments to change my mind about the act <e> <s> there is no doubt that the next generation of disabled people will find there are no houses available for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> however will she not agree that this appalling disaster has all the features of one of the all-too-frequent mining disasters of yesteryear with bodies still entombed in a steel housing <e> <s> in the light of what the noble baroness has said regarding the inquiry being carried out by lord cullen will she ask the secretary of state to consider making some of the information being gathered by lord cullen available on an interim basis so as to reduce at least to some extent the harrowing time being experienced by the relatives of the people killed in the disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the minister is aware that my purpose in asking the question was not to introduce the issue of financial settlements that is not the purpose of the question <e> <s> indeed i am glad that no one has touched upon it <e> <s> however the minister will be aware that the energy industry in the broadest sense has always been a dangerous industry in which to work and this is not the first serious accident where many people have been killed <e> <s> the purpose behind the question as i am sure the minister is aware is to prevent a disaster of this kind ever happening again <e> <s> can the minister therefore ensure that the fullest information is available at all times to those representing the people involved in the disaster <e> <s> nothing less will satisfy <e>", "<cs> my lords i placed my name against this unstarred question in the hope of making a useful contribution <e> <s> i wish to express my appreciation to my noble friend lady turner for giving us the opportunity to do so but i wish to speak more globally than just on northern ireland though i do not understand the emptiness of the government benches when i believe that political manoeuvres are taking place to try to form some kind of political association in northern ireland that will give the government uncommitted force <e> <s> the total absence of members on the government back-benches indicates that that is rather an empty prospect <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm or deny whether this deal has been brought to the attention of the auditor general by the public accounts committee of another place <e> <s> if that is the case is there not considerable reason for disquiet about that procedure having been adopted <e>", "<cs> my lords with that correction from the minister i think we may now proceed <e> <s> this issue was debated at great length at the report and committee stages of this bill <e> <s> i have to say that i believe the minister was completely wrong about the effect of the act and these amendments are designed to bring into effect what the minister said the act would in fact mean <e>", "<cs> my lords we now have a clearer picture of what the minister stated last time <e> <s> on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the house i am delighted to know that the recommendation of a rent assessment committee is binding on both parties <e> <s> we are not disagreeing with the fact that there may be some argument for two parties to negotiate a settlement or agreement for rent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for explaining in detail what the order means <e> <s> as i see it this is an extension of an existing development corporation area and it makes sense to expand it rather than create a new one <e> <s> the minister has said that the proposal has received general support and we have no desire to oppose it in any way <e> <s> however we believe that it would be carried out far better by a more democratic procedure <e> <s> as i understand it the public accounts committee in another place is showing concern about some of the areas involved and some of the activities which it thinks should not be pursued in those areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> he must be aware that the numbers are still rapidly increasing and that among those who are homeless there is an increasing percentage of people who are disabled in one form or another <e> <s> bearing in mind the recent statements made by a series of ministers that the governments policy is to target aid in the areas of greatest need will the minister consider doing something urgently prior to publication of the findings of the report in order to try to alleviate some of the suffering that will be endured by those underprivileged people during the forthcoming winter <e>", "<cs> my lords my final question relates to london although the problem does not apply to london alone it is showing up in rural areas <e> <s> is the minister aware of the report published last week by the organisation crisis at christmas which calculates that the number of people sleeping on the streets in london at present to will double over christmas <e> <s> the objective of my question is to ask the minister whom i know to be a compassionate humane man to appeal to the chancellor to make some funding available now for the organisations charitable associations and local authorities who are grappling with this terrible problem <e> <s> otherwise the problem will be seen quite correctly only as a national scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that large slices of the land about which he is talking were taken from local authorities against their will without one penny of compensation being paid to them <e> <s> in all fairness if there is any surplus land should it not be handed back to them to market for the benefit of their ratepayers and not flogged off to private speculators <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn is correct in that there is already spare capacity at manchester international airport and speke does it not make sense to use that now and relieve some of the pressure in the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords i first express my appreciation to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating this debate on a public service which i believe sometimes receives far too low a profile because in the general sense it is not looked at sympathetically by the public at large <e> <s> it is an extremely timely opportunity to debate the prison service because it has such wideranging facets to it and this house is the best place to give it an airing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that under the existing legislation the amount of common land is diminishing quite considerably <e> <s> will he ask his colleagues in government whether under existing legislation there can be some form of moratorium until the discussions to which he referred and the subsequent legislation are brought before both another place and your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> naturally we welcome the slightly improved situation and hope that the rate of improvement continues to accelerate <e> <s> however the minister must be aware that the national home improvement council and the ama after reading the report have reached the conclusion that in order to deal with the housing stock on a national basis both in the public sector and the private sector over the next ten years between billion and billion will need to be spent <e> <s> have the government any plans to pump more money into housing in order to correct those deficiencies <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that a few weeks ago i asked him a question regarding the effect of the increase in the bank rate on the house building programme <e> <s> is the minister aware that the house building figures are now taking a downward turn and in some areas remaining static and the bank rate is having its effect <e> <s> will the minister plead with the chancellor of the exchequer and dissuade him from eliminating tax relief on improvement loans and from means testing of those who apply for improvement loans <e> <s> does he not consider that that would have an extremely adverse effect on the improvement programme which i agree for a time was running extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply but is the minister aware that following the issue of the recent government white paper on training views have been forcefully expressed by some of the major builders and the major trade union in the building industry ucatt that the present arrangements ought to be continued <e> <s> they have served the industry well <e> <s> if there is any desire to consider a change i ask the minister to give an undertaking that there will be full consultation with everyone concerned in the building industry in order to arrive at the right conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that under directives of the ec due to come into force in there may be a massive penetration in our building industry by our partners in the ec <e> <s> if that takes place will the government ensure that it does not happen at the expense of training our own young people in skills in the industry which they will need to rely on in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the present negotiations are at an end <e> <s> in global terms the settlement appears to be quite generous by any standards <e> <s> in those circumstances can the minister tell us how the government got themselves into such a mess in the negotiations <e> <s> is it not a fact that although the present negotiations may be at an end in january or february or when next years award is made the whole procedure will start again <e> <s> is it not a fact that my noble friend lord molloy has a point in trying to achieve some rationale in the negotiations that will prevent what happened this year happening next year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join with the noble earl lord arran in thanking the members of the committee that dealt with these matters <e> <s> i am fully aware of the time that was taken and the amount of evidence that it had to hear in order to make a recommendation to your lordships house <e> <s> while we on this side of the chamber have no desire to oppose the orders before us i do not believe the situation is as the minister indicates <e> <s> in fact i believe he is looking at the matters through rose-coloured glasses <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble earl will give way for a moment <e> <s> is not the minister aware that in the case of the manchester one the two members of the manchester city council who were appointed to the board namely the leader of the council and councillor flanagan did not attend the initial opening to express their disapproval of what was taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i hope your lordships will not think that i am labouring the point but i should like to express my gratitude for the tremendous amount of work done by the committee under the chairmanship of the noble and learned lord lord brightman in a difficult situation <e> <s> bearing in mind the need to create the maximum goodwill in the area will the minister tell the house whether any members of bristol city council have been appointed to or been offered and refused places on the udc <e> <s> that is an important point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to pursue the point but i asked a question <e> <s> have any bristol city councillors been appointed or have any places been offered to them <e>", "<cs> my lords have the councillors been offered places <e> <s> the noble earl must surely know that <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the first supplementary question asked by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the minister referred to last weeks debate concerning the kings cross disaster <e> <s> is he aware that on that very morning when making my way to the house of the six escalators that i tried to use three were out of commission and this was not in one of the older stations <e> <s> is it not a fact that if this situation were widespread on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise for not being in my place for the opening speeches <e> <s> i have been engaged in meetings with a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> he mentioned that the public interest would be taken into account <e> <s> i and other members of the house spoke earlier today specifically about the workforces involved <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him whether those people are included in that public interest or are they once again to be completely denied any input into their own future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am once again grateful to the minister for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> he is standing the facts on their head <e> <s> he talks about matters balancing out and being put right in the long term <e> <s> i spoke about a factory where people worked <e> <s> they are now down to about <e> <s> that has been going on for years <e> <s> is that short term <e> <s> does he think that the people who have been made redundant think that it is short term and that they have been well looked after by the shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his first answer will cause some dismay to those people who are concerned with local conditions for development and that it could almost be taken to mean a licence for developers to go their own way and do what they want <e> <s> is he also aware of the increasing concern felt in certain areas about the use of private parliamentary bills by developers in order to bypass the normal planning procedures <e> <s> finally what is the situation in some city centres where such buildings have been taken out of the control of the local authority and placed under the control of the urban development corporation which also becomes the planning authority <e> <s> what procedural vehicle is left open for someone who wants to object to that type of development by an urban development corporation other than to go cap in hand to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that since this report there has also been a report issued by the organisation shelter which shows a similar trend <e> <s> is the minister aware that it is calculated that there are now over households homeless <e> <s> in terms of numbers of people this is over <e> <s> it should be borne in mind that the legislation came into force only recently since when a representative of small landlords has said that they expect rents to double in the near future <e> <s> that means that wherever they have the opportunity they will double rents <e> <s> how does the minister expect the homeless to be able to obtain rented property in order to leave the homeless queue <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that during the passage of the bill when the minister was questioned he placed great emphasis on the fact that when the bill became an act it would help with the rehousing of homeless people <e> <s> if rents double as the representatives of the landlords predict will the minister give an undertaking that if people who are registered as homeless are able to negotiate a tenancy with one of these private landlords irrespective of the doubling of the rent the prospective tenant will be funded by housing benefit <e> <s> or is the whole thing kidology and a hoax <e> <s> if so it is most unfair on the people concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that answer but i am not surprised that the minister made no reference to mortgage payments <e> <s> is he aware when talking of mortgage payments that a person receiving a discount on purchasing his council house there are now quite a large number of such people receives the equivalent of a payment per week towards his mortgage <e> <s> at the same time people in the same income group who happen to be unfortunate enough to be owner occupiers have faced an increase of to a month <e> <s> when will the government have the same sympathy for owner occupiers as they appear to show readily to people receiving these discounts on council houses <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is usually most sympathetic in his answers towards <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if when applied the code makes it more difficult for a verdict on an official dispute to be reached by the members of the union and also extends the period before it can be reached unofficial action may result which no one wants and which is often to the disadvantage of everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that according to his answer we shall have to do much better than we are doing <e> <s> we have been almost static since in percentage terms <e> <s> does the minister not agree that we have to bear in mind that in the foreseeable future the government will lose or will suffer a very large diminution of the benefit arising from our oil revenues <e> <s> does he not agree that that is the time of reckoning and that we should be doing much better than we are in order to cushion the effects of that situation when it happens <e>", "<cs> union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for introducing these regulations <e> <s> his speech in explanation of what the regulations intend was long and compared with what was said in another place almost a marathon <e> <s> however the minister went to a great deal of trouble to explain what the regulations will do <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to urban development corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene at such a late stage <e> <s> if the minister bases his answer mainly on the fact that the government will not interfere in local government i shall remind him of it in the very near future when we come to debate what some of the residuary bodies do when they wind up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the numerous reports from non-political organisations expressing a strong view and supported by members of parliament for constituencies in the south <e> <s> those reports suggest that local authority houses which are sold should be replaced <e> <s> can the minister tell me why after a series of questions over a long period from members of your lordships house asking for the old capital receipts of local authorities to be made available for building new council houses under the new local government and housing bill the government have reneged on all their previous commitments given in another place by previous secretaries of state <e> <s> the government have decided to deduct billion from the billion assets of local authorities <e> <s> why have they behaved in such a disgraceful manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the minister will not answer <e> <s> i have to submit to the house that these questions are strongly related <e> <s> we are talking about the sale of council houses and one is entitled to draw the comparison with replacements <e> <s> i am making the point that the government have reneged on promises by successive secretaries of state some of whom are now members of your lordships house <e> <s> they have done the very opposite under the lastest local government bill in denying the local authorities billion of their own assets for building council houses <e> <s> will the minister answer <e> <s> does not he consider that relevant <e>", "<cs> my lords first i join the preceding speaker the noble lord lord orr-ewing in expressing appreciation to the noble viscount lord hanworth for introducing this subject for debate in your lordships house <e> <s> it is relevant to our survival as a manufacturing nation which is the historic basis for all our wealth <e> <s> if we fail in this facet we fail for all time <e>", "<cs> my lords i totally agree with that practice and also the training of apprentices to go into skilled trades in a factory <e> <s> there is no substitute for at least a considerable part of training being on site in the factory learning the skills and having them instilled into people <e> <s> people have to earn a living no one owes them one <e> <s> all my life i worked on piece work and i made a reasonable living because i made sure than i knew the job and could carry out the various functions <e> <s> it is essential in the interests of the operative even at factory level that he is trained in the best skills <e> <s> that should reflect itself in the wage packet otherwise the system will not work <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> he has talked about the highest structure of engineers the civil engineers and so on but i was mainly concerned with manufacturing engineers <e> <s> is he aware that in the past most engineers equipped their own toolbox and bought their own micrometers scribing blocks and so on <e> <s> is he aware that it would now be almost impossible for a youngster starting in the trade to produce those instruments because of the tremendous costs that a nought-to-one micrometer or scribing block have risen to <e> <s> he would be quite unable to finance it <e> <s> i hope that when the minister brings the debate to the notice of the minister in another place he will also include this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful as i am sure are many other noble lords for the answer that the minister has given indicating that progress has been made <e> <s> is she aware that i have with me the press release of the cegb regarding the letting of this contract <e> <s> it states that tendering for the new fgd plant has been extremely competitive <e> <s> if it were so competitive is it possible to let a further contract to the next lowest competitor based on this fact <e> <s> to put forward tenders for these very large contracts is very expensive <e> <s> time wasted in putting together estimates for the next contract could well result in a much higher price for that contract than if it were considered now <e>", "<cs> my lords finally and very briefly is the minister aware that according to the press notices that i have and i am sure that she has also the first part will be commissioned by and final completion will take place in <e> <s> this seems a rather long timescale although i knew that it is a huge project <e> <s> is there any possibility of the timescale being reduced so that we can see some benefits before that date <e>", "<cs> my lords i declare an interest in that i am a ratepayer in the city of westminster <e> <s> is the minister aware that i find the councils settlement to its retiring chief executive mr <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that i totally reject his answer to my first question <e> <s> will he bear in mind that i have spent a <e>", "<cs> the noble lords explanation of the amendment brought the committees attention to a serious aspect of the bill <e> <s> i believe that what he said is correct <e> <s> he said that the bill as it stands will allow someone from ireland who holds a british passport to enter this country and go to a designated football match without being covered by any of the strictures which apply to people living over here <e> <s> if that is correct how can we justify allowing people who may want to attend a large gathering with evil intent a privilege while those who live in the area are deemed to be potentially involved in a criminal activity <e> <s> it is complete and utter nonsense <e> <s> those people have never been involved in such activity but that is what the bill suggests <e>", "<cs> does the minister mean that it is not an offence unless the person doing it comes from the united kingdom <e> <s> the noble lord lord harris makes a very valid point when he talks about people from other parts of the ec not understanding our laws <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm that it is the governments policy to remove from health authorities the people appointed from the local authority in the area <e> <s> bearing in mind that such people are the only members of the health authorities who have to face the electorate does not the minister consider that such a policy is a terribly retrograde step <e> <s> will he consider the measure and perhaps withdraw it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first express my appreciation as other speakers have done to my noble friend and colleague on the front bench lady turner for giving us an opportunity to debate this important document <e> <s> i do not intend to use such a wide brush as the previous speaker and deal with the overall outlook but will restrict my remarks mainly to the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he tried to make the point that there appears to be no evidence that the reduction in the number of wages councils has adversely affected wage levels <e> <s> he should make himself aware of the report issued only a few weeks ago by the low pay unit which shows clearly that the abolition of wages councils and the restriction of their powers has had a dramatic effect on wage levels at the lowest end of the scale where people are already suffering low wages <e> <s> the minister should look into that report if he thinks otherwise <e>", "<cs> in his reply the minister indicated that there appeared to be some support from sponsors and clubs for the scheme <e> <s> for my sins i have been in close contact with the clubs of manchester city manchester united and leeds united and i find no such support <e>", "<cs> the minister has given sympathetic and cogent answers on previous amendments but i think he has failed to do so in respect of this one <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham referred to the season ticket holders at tottenham hotspur <e> <s> i have not checked the details but i think the noble lord will find that manchester united has far more season ticket holders <e> <s> some clubs have waiting lists <e> <s> it is not the easiest thing in the world to become a season ticket holder at a well supported football club <e> <s> people apply year after year and are turned away <e> <s> at some clubs people have to wait until others die in order to become season ticket holders <e> <s> i cannot conceive of someone queueing to pay to become a football hooligan <e> <s> the minister suggests that somebody will be waiting in the wings to sign a cheque for just to become a football hooligan on a saturday afternoon <e>", "<cs> rubbish <e>", "<cs> the prime minister thinks so too <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord winstanley has made a very positive point <e> <s> i take issue with the noble earl lord onslow on his views <e> <s> my noble friend who moved the amendment was right to say that family areas designated as that are a new feature of football <e>", "<cs> except millwall <e>", "<cs> i do not know who has briefed the minister but the noble earl appears to have misled the committee regarding the views of the police on the bill <e> <s> i have been at old trafford and at maine road when the attendance has been around <e> <s> the police superintendents at those games were absolutely emphatic that they had total control of the situation <e>", "<cs> the minister repeated in his answer to me what he said to my noble colleague who moved the amendment <e> <s> does he say that if the bill becomes an act the need for the police will be dramatically reduced <e> <s> as a mancunian a northerner who has also been a yorkshire member of parliament i have to tell the minister that the only time that i feel threatened during the later years of my life is travelling on the underground at night in london not watching football matches at leeds old trafford in manchester or even arsenal <e> <s> i have been to arsenal and i have never felt threatened there <e>", "<cs> the minister indicated in more than one reply that when the bill becomes an act it will result in a diminution of the police forces needed outside and inside football grounds <e> <s> how does the minister make such a deduction when new laws are coming into operation and the only people who can apply them or see that they are observed are the police forces in the areas concerned <e> <s> the minister must understand that he is standing experience on its head <e>", "<cs> in that case why did the minister introduce into the discussion of this amendment the inference that the government proposals had the total support of senior police officers <e> <s> from what he has just said it is obvious that that is not the case <e>", "<cs> does not the ministers reply indicate as was said on second reading although i did not speak in that debate that we are <e>", "<cs> as whose guest <e> <s> as far as i am aware wembley does not come within the ambit of the scheme <e> <s> we are talking about football league clubs <e>", "<cs> my lords on this occasion i had expected a very brief answer <e> <s> bearing in mind the statement that the prime minister made at that conference is the minister aware that it is not up to the opposition parties and the press to make the case for a government measure <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the measure is so bad in terms of what it will do to the service for the public in general that public opinion polls are running heavily against it <e> <s> have not the ministers involved presented a poor case because it is a poor case to start with <e> <s> will the minister ask the prime minister to stop acting like a petulant matriarch on this occasion and abandon the whole business in the interests of everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer and for doubling the donation towards this problem <e> <s> now that the problem of the damage to the ozone layer is more clearly identified does the minister agree that this sum of money looks paltry compared with the size of the problem with which we are dealing <e> <s> will this funding be kept under constant review because of the apparent urgency of the situation which is now developing <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my first supplementary question the minister referred to the international responsibility in this matter <e> <s> can the minister tell us why the government were not represented at the international conference that took place over the weekend to discuss this problem and other related subjects <e> <s> does it not appear that unless a certain prime minister is conducting the orchestra no tune will be played <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord harris mentioned citizens from the irish republic <e> <s> as far as i am aware they do not need a british passport to visit this country but can come whenever they wish <e> <s> four of the largest clubs in the country are situated in the north-west <e> <s> they are the two liverpool clubs and the two manchester clubs and they provide the largest catchment areas in which people from the irish republic can come and settle <e> <s> many supporters have lived in this country for many years and have become british citizens <e>", "<cs> the minister has put forward a complicated idea <e> <s> however if the person is a citizen of the irish republic is it not possible that under the bill as it now stands he would be <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will discount what his noble friend has just said because any scheme that is brought forward and we have to keep saying this has to have the rubber stamp of the secretary of state <e> <s> so it will be a centralised scheme <e> <s> i have to say as a former member in my local government days of a licensing committee that such committees are not allowed to give local interpretations of national schemes <e> <s> they have to work within the tramlines that are set within the orders <e>", "<cs> both my noble friend lord graham and the noble lord lord harris have made the point that under the bill people who are found guilty will be dealt with quite arbitrarily with no variations allowed <e> <s> on other points of law members of this chamber have asked the government to consider certain courses of action relating to certain crimes <e> <s> i have always been told by the ministers involved that all criminals have the same rights within the law <e>", "<cs> i welcome the intervention from the noble lord lord renton but he must be aware from the committee proceedings on this bill that the bill has so much support that he is the first to speak in support of it from either side other than speakers from the front bench <e>", "<cs> it was interesting to listen to the noble lord lord northfield indicate the difficulties that wembley will experience as a result of the bill <e> <s> he said that wembley does not control tickets for the cup final <e> <s> it does not <e> <s> the fa controls the sale of the tickets <e> <s> a large proportion goes to the participants in the final although never as many as they would like and the rest are distributed by various means <e> <s> even the smallest amateur club affiliated to the football association can apply for cup final tickets <e> <s> such clubs usually receive one or two tickets <e> <s> i know that because i was associated with a club just after the war <e> <s> people go in ones and twos from small clubs all over the country to attend the cup final <e> <s> they do not have the time to be registered supporters <e> <s> some of them are running amateur and <e>", "<cs> my lords the lessons of experience contradict the noble lords comments <e> <s> when people like myself raise questions about political affiliations being known with regard to appointments to district and regional health boards we are told that such affiliations are not listed <e> <s> who is right <e>", "<cs> what about compensation my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to be able to follow the noble lord lord rippon <e> <s> some years ago i was one of a delegation of junior councillors who on several occasions saw him when he was secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> although we differed politically we gained the impression that our comments were heeded <e> <s> they may not have been acted upon but there was some sympathy towards them <e>", "<cs> my lords it was not g-mex it was the residuary body and the way it is behaving <e> <s> i should like to know whether the body is exceeding the duties which it was supposed to be carrying out <e> <s> if that is so i should like to know what the government propose to do about it <e> <s> further what will happen concerning its future <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the announcement made by the minister concerning the introduction of a bill to deal with this problem can he say whether the time-scale in another place and in your lordships house rates the bill with a high priority <e> <s> to supplement the point raised by the noble lord who introduced the question surely we already produce enough of our own waste because of our industrial base <e> <s> we should limit ourselves to dealing with that and exclude waste from other people <e> <s> can the minister tell us whether the bill will have a high priority in the governments legislative programme <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether we can expect a bill in the next session of parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords have not some areas of the country had the benefit of the supply of good quality water in the world although some other parts are not so well served and are below that standard <e> <s> would it not be better for the government to strive for equalisation of the quality of water supply to the best that we have <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree or is he aware that the statements made by the minister for sport which were made during the passage of the bill through your lordships house regarding the attempt by english soccer clubs for re-admission to europe appear to carry a hallmark of a very crude attempt to blackmail the football authorities and followers in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that my noble and learned friend on the front bench should read the press reports concerning that particular match <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us what effect the importation of foreign coal has had on our awful balance of payments situation which exists at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that during the last full year of the previous labour government which was this country had a balance of over billion on its manufacturing industries a surplus of billion <e> <s> is he also aware that under this government the adverse balance of payments in manufacturing industry last year was billion <e> <s> will he tell us what has happened to show such appalling figures <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the noble lord chose to remind me that the last labour government was in office years ago <e> <s> would he take time out to remind the ministers of her majestys government of that <e> <s> they seem to be more intent than anybody on using that fact when it suits them <e> <s> what does he think of todays published figures to the effect that the annual increase in the cost of raw materials and fuel to manufacturing industry has risen to per cent <e> <s> what effect will that have on competition with our overseas competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the minister response in some respects but he does not make the right premise when arguing his case <e> <s> he said that if the body is working well it should be left alone <e> <s> however our experience of this government is that appointees to other boards health boards manpower commission boards and a variety of other boards who have been doing well have been removed for no apparent reason other than that their colour no longer matches the political colour of the government <e> <s> i wish to make that point on the basis that i cannot accept as valid the ministers reason for not viewing this amendment more favourably nor his view that we should leave things alone when they appear to be working well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not happy with what the minister has said <e> <s> we are not moving as fast as we should like and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to be brief in what i say <e> <s> however in his response the minister referred to the fa and the football league forming the top table <e> <s> i think he went on to say that they could consider whether they would want to co-opt people from other organisations and then the government would consider the matter <e> <s> i should have thought that the government having considered the matter could give a positive view upon it now <e>", "<cs> my lords it is interesting to see the ease with which the minister considers that one can pick an age which will be the arbitrary line of division and that that will be the barrier <e> <s> there has been trouble since time immemorial with those licensing laws that apply only to people of and above <e> <s> one of the biggest drawbacks in that area in the past has been that very often young people of years look older than some people of or <e> <s> this has been a running sore in the licensing trade <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear from what the minister has said that the only reason for the inclusion of old age pensioners is to make the scheme economically viable <e> <s> the minister has said repeatedly not only today but during previous stages of the bill that in order to make it safer for old age pensioners to attend football matches they must have an identity pass <e> <s> does the minister really believe that by making it harder for old age pensioners to go to a football match more of them will be attracted <e> <s> the truth is the opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however are not the figures somewhat disappointing bearing in mind the size of the problem that we are now facing <e> <s> is the minister aware that once again there has been a severe reduction in local authority house building and the availability of property in the private rented sector <e> <s> all the figures show that ominously the incidence of homelessness is still increasing <e> <s> according to a report by shelter the social security and housing legislation by the government last year has driven young homeless people in their thousands on to the streets in major cities <e> <s> did the government intend that <e> <s> if they did not will they do something to eliminate it <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to my supplementary question the minister referred to the last months of the last labour government <e> <s> if he was in the chamber on monday he will recall that i was gently chided by his noble friend lord strathclyde for referring back to the last labour government <e> <s> however i have to challenge what the minister has said <e> <s> is it not a fact that this governments record in the public building sector is the worst of any government since the war <e> <s> my noble friend and colleague lord graham has also referred to this fact <e> <s> one of the major premises of the housing bill before your lordships in the last session when i consistently challenged him on homelessness was that the government were pinning their hopes on the fact that the freeing of the private rented sector would diminish the number of homeless <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with previous speakers in expressing deep condolences to the bereaved in this terrible tragedy <e> <s> however the noble earl must be aware that during my short time in this house this is the third time that a minister has risen from the government front bench to make a statement on appalling tragedies in football that could have been avoided <e> <s> i am talking about the bradford disaster which took place near where i live and the heysel disaster involving heavy loss of life which resulted in extensive debates in your lordships house <e> <s> we have had the popplewell report <e>", "<cs> why <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that british car manufacturers are put at a distinct disadvantage by this form of taxation in comparison with their competitors <e> <s> they are put in a quite unfair position as regards competition for ordering cars <e> <s> is it not time that that was looked at because it puts them at a distinct disadvantage <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if one uses the normal multiplier of population in england compared with scotland and multiplies the figure of million plus for scotland we are speaking about nearly million for england <e> <s> is the minister aware that that is enormously in excess of the figures quoted during the passage of the bill through this house <e> <s> how have the government got the figure so wrong <e> <s> cannot they do their sums <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to the first supplementary question the noble lord quoted the various organisations which had indicated support for a large part of the governments proposals <e> <s> he quoted the area health authorities and family practitioner committees <e> <s> he must be aware that those organisations are manned overwhelmingly by government appointees whose political colour must be conservative before they are appointed so is there anything strange in the fact that they have come out in support of the proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recall that during the passage of the bill both in your lordships house and in another place ministers in both houses i understand the prime minister also replied to this point are on record as saying that the interests of the pilots involved in this exercise would receive the utmost consideration <e> <s> it would appear as the situation has developed that that is not the case <e> <s> will the minister therefore look into the situation to see whether assistance can be given towards resolving any disputes that may arise <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill is very lengthy and detailed and i shall not deal with its main thrust <e> <s> the amount of opposition has been expressed more than adequately by previous speakers not least from behind the minister <e> <s> it is a long time since i have known a bill which was supposed to epitomise the governments thinking receive such adverse comments from prominent back-benchers on the government side <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this issue was raised last july by my noble friend lord mishcon and myself <e> <s> is he also aware that i drew attention to the conditions obtaining in some of the older establishments such as armley and risley <e> <s> is he further aware that in the past nine months there have been five suicides among young people held on remand in armley gaol and that conditions are still pretty much the same <e> <s> does he not understand the necessity for urgent action and certainly faster action than the minister responsible for this matter indicated in a radio interview last week <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must understand that i was talking about armley gaol not risley <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down will he kindly answer the question that i put to him regarding armley gaol in leeds and the concern there <e> <s> that in fact is the prime question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government intend to put into operation a scheme to enable people in the armed forces to save towards the purchase of a house when they leave the armed forces will they make sure that the factor in house price rises is taken into account <e> <s> otherwise the savings may be completely swallowed up in inflation by the time they are ready to leave the service and may well be worthless <e>", "<cs> pipe dreaming <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> however does his answer not seem to be in conflict with what is happening in the national dock labour scheme dispute bearing in mind that one of the parties the union representing the workers has already offered to go to acas to settle the matter amicably <e> <s> the government have chosen to force through a bill which is totally one-sided and seen to be on behalf of the employers <e> <s> is that not in complete contradiction with the ministers answer <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not understand that during the passage of previous legislation through your lordships house reference was made to the observations of the master of the rolls who in his capacity as chairman of the industrial relations courts said even then that legislation was weighted in favour of the employers <e> <s> does he not understand that his answer to my question can only be interpreted by those involved as meaning that the government are not bent on giving trade unionists basic rights as they keep on saying but instead are bent on removing most of the basic rights <e> <s> is it not true that their stand has been shown to be a complete sham by the recent statement of the international labour organisation on the basis of what the government are doing to the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the objectives of this bill <e> <s> standing at the dispatch box on this occasion i almost get a feeling of <e>", "<cs> i am rather puzzled about what would happen if the members of the consumers committees wished to raise a complaint regarding the director himself being in default <e> <s> who would they go to <e> <s> i have had a great deal of experience of the health service before the last reorganisation as the deputy chairman of the manchester executive council of health <e> <s> i was also the chairman of the services committee which used to deal with complaints against general practitioners dentists opticians and pharmacists <e> <s> it was always a very difficult task when a complaint had been made against one of those individuals <e> <s> in the main general practitioners were involved in the largest percentage of the complaints <e> <s> it was always extremely difficult to get professional people to be critical of their colleagues <e>", "<cs> that frightens me still further <e> <s> i refer the noble lord to a particularly shocking case that occurred in leeds <e> <s> i am not criticising a conservative secretary of state <e> <s> i am talking about a tragic event in which a woman died due to negligence by a neuro-surgeon as a result of which the widower received substantial damages <e> <s> the lack of action on the part of the minister at the time who as i say was not a conservative minister was outrageous <e> <s> the only reason that the case was ever fully dealt with not to the satisfaction of the husband because he did not get his wife back and the neuro-surgeon was censured was the persistence of members of the local community health council <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to belabour the point but more recently about two years ago in yorkshire elderly people died of salmonella <e> <s> the secretary of state for health appointed a committee to investigate the matter <e> <s> in the committees report there was implied criticism of the chairman of the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give any further information regarding the particular categories in which the armed services are short of manpower <e> <s> not very long ago the noble lord answered a question of mine which showed that there had been three times the number of applications for posts in the armed forces compared with the number of people recruited <e> <s> i believe that about three-quarters of a million people had applied but only a quarter of a million had been recruited <e> <s> it seems that the matter is out of balance somewhere <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will give way at this point <e> <s> how would she respond to the point made by the noble viscount lord weir regarding the question of exports <e> <s> he is someone else who has worked in the past in the power plant industry <e> <s> are the government not aware that if they get it wrong they may mortally wound our capacity to export power plant abroad with all the appalling consequences that that will have on the balance of payments in our manufacturing industry which as the minister knows is already very adverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend and colleague lord mason has done all wine drinkers a very signal service tonight in raising this matter <e> <s> if there appears to be an element of frivolity in the debate i do not believe that it is called for <e> <s> i have been a secretary of a licensed club for years and i have seen the change in the volume of beer drinking and the move towards wine drinking <e> <s> it is obvious that when you have a glass of wine here or there there is no way that you can excuse the different prices and the different qualities <e> <s> when the drinker buys a glass of wine in a pub or an hotel he never really knows what the quality is <e>", "<cs> my lords i have news for the minister i will not be doing so <e>", "<cs> part of the debate seems to centre around the appointment of this almighty person with all the virtues to carry out a very difficult job <e> <s> i managed to read of the appointment myself last week but it was certainly not made in the form of a general announcement in a public sense <e> <s> even people over here may well have missed it <e> <s> however if the government are not careful there is a danger that they will be accused of being more than a little discourteous on the subject <e> <s> it was only the previous week that members of all sections of your lordships house even government supporters were asking who the person was <e> <s> it seems strange that the government waited until both houses were in recess before the announcement was made <e> <s> i should have thought that it might have been better for the government to have waited a few days for it to be announced in your lordships chamber so that people with a vital interest in the bill who have sat here through long hours and who will certainly sit through even more before the bill goes on the statute book would have been the first to know and would not have had to pick it up generally <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> the written question was made available almost as both houses went to sleep for the whit week break <e> <s> i know that that has happened in the past with successive governments of both colours <e> <s> however i do not believe that it is the best and most courteous way of conducting business when people have been pressing in your lordships house for an answer for that answer to arrive by what appears to to have been the sleight of hand which is over-used of a written question by a government supporter <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord peyton has referred once again to the appointment of professor littlechild and the fact that he will go through certain exercises in reading the pieces that the noble lord referred to before he makes any reference <e> <s> i too have a copy of <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make a brief contribution <e> <s> this is a reasonable amendment for the consumer <e> <s> demand for electricity can change pretty quickly <e> <s> for

has covered the main principles involved <e> <s> however those of us who have had a long experience of dealing with the public and the question of electricity and cut-offs know of the appalling tragedies which sometimes result <e> <s> in most cases it is families with children who are involved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that sympathetic reply <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> from the left my lords <e>", "<cs> from these benches i wish to express support for the amendment <e> <s> it is a tidying-up amendment which makes sense <e>

right reverend prelate but <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that there is a substantial increase in the number of mortgage foreclosures and that people are losing their homes because of their inability to meet the heavy interest payments <e> <s> is he also aware that the number is escalating dramatically <e> <s> are the government prepared to let the present situation continue and do nothing to help those who are the victims of their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the figure for the governments housebuilding programme this year shows a serious downward turn <e> <s> is that not because of the high interest rates <e> <s> bearing in mind that the minister sat and listened to yesterdays debate on the homeless does he not believe that it showed there is little prospect of helping people in that terrible situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answers clearly indicate that the nurses will have no input into this area <e> <s> is it not strange that the advice of three prominent industrialists seems to be more eagerly sought than the views of the nurses who are a tremendously vital component of the health service <e> <s> will the noble lord take this back to the government and ask them to reconsider the matter in the interests of the patients and all concerned <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down my noble friend lord hatch made specific reference to nuclear power and its effect on or it being the cause of leukaemia <e> <s> for my sins i happen to be a supporter of nuclear power <e> <s> unless it has been stated quite recently i am not aware that any definite link has been established between the use of nuclear power and leukaemia clusters <e> <s> the latest information that i have is that

to the matter if not on this amendment on succeeding amendments <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> as regards the remarks of the previous speaker the noble lord lord trafford what frightens me is that if we are not careful if we do not pass the amendment we may well hand a monopoly situation to france in the provision of electricity from nuclear power <e> <s> members of the committee will recall the debate which took place some time ago in your lordships house on nuclear energy <e> <s> i spoke in favour of it and i wish once again very briefly to put the three main points which i made then <e>", "<cs> i am not suggesting for one moment that we give the industry any special treatment other than to make sure that it is in a position to be able to compete on a fair and competitive basis <e> <s> i do not know what kind of system the french would operate <e> <s> however although the countries of the ec are to become more unified in the future some of those countries are not unknown to show more than a little bias towards their own national industries <e> <s> all i am saying is that we must be very careful what we do here because if we lose our capacity to produce or build our own nuclear stations based on a substantial part of our domiciliary market we could be doing ourselves incalculable damage <e> <s> once we fall behind we shall never be able to catch up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the high figure he gives of activity in the building sector as a whole is to be welcomed <e> <s> long may that activity continue despite the high bank rate <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the figures compare favourably with the first quarter of last year <e> <s> however there is a diminution in house building of approximately per cent <e> <s> in total affecting both the private and public sectors <e> <s> does the minister not think in view of the debate which took place in your lordships house last week that this is an undesirable trend <e> <s> will he seek to influence his colleagues in another place to reverse it <e>", "<cs> i was interested to hear the last point made forcefully and lucidly by the noble lord lord renton regarding the approval which on almost every occasion would need to be sought by the secretary of state from the treasury to allow financial dealings of this kind to take place <e> <s> in some respects i find that a little strange <e> <s> historically and at present i am not criticising any particular colour of government where sums of money are involved it has almost become copper bottomed

large displays of political hiccups that took place on thursday of last week will result in changes in secretaries of state <e> <s> it may well be that the secretary of state who started this controversial bill on its passage in another place may not be the secretary of slate by the time the bill returns there <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must be aware that we on this side of the house naturally support any initiative that the government may take to provide more houses both to rent and to buy <e> <s> however is he aware that the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back so quickly <e> <s> i referred to the governments figures from the noble earls own department <e> <s> these show a dangerous downward turn in the first quarter of this year <e> <s> will he

surprised by the terseness of that reply bearing in mind the serious erosion caused by the results of the european elections and the two by-elections on th june to the point of the government being almost obliterated in scotland and wales <e> <s> does that not indicate to the noble lord as has been reinforced by subsequent opinion polls that there is serious public concern about the stupid

no is not good enough <e> <s> government support has been reduced to three out of people in the united kingdom nearly an alltime low <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e> <s> i rise to intervene because in the very early stages i helped to manufacture some of the turbine parts for berkeley power station <e> <s> can the minister indicate in regard to the decommissioning and closure of a nuclear power station that the nuclear power is not the whole of the station <e> <s> is it not true that a large part of the station consists of conventional turbines and rotors and only the heat

decided to totally ignore the suggestions and requests from all corners of your lordships house on this subject <e> <s> the minister will also recall that in answer to me on the previous occasion he said that the nurses must not view this as a kick in the teeth his words <e> <s> is the minister aware that since the prime minister herself who normally pays fulsome tribute to the nurses and the

lords i am sorry to rise at this late stage but referring to his earlier reply is the minister aware that yesterday the royal college of nursing issued a press statement to the effect that the royal college general secretary trevor clay has expressed his disappointment at the prime ministers refusal to meet with the royal college of nursing council deputation on the genuine concerns of nurses in regard to the policy board <e> <s> how does that tie up with his earlier reply <e> <s> something is different somewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not understand that legislation which this government brought in is resulting in employers going to the courts much earlier than what one would term the normal timing in any industrial dispute <e> <s> does the minister not understand that the only people who can settle a strike are the two parties involved and that the willingness of the employers to run to the courts far too early prevents any early settlement from being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it will be generally agreed that we have had a full and extensive debate on the bill <e> <s> many of the technical points in both the local government part and the housing part of the bill have been widely covered by various members of your lordships house <e> <s> as this has been a rather long debate i do not intend to backtrack and go over points that have been raised during the speeches of other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister checks the records he will find that prior to the publication of the green paper an absolute copper-bottomed guarantee was given in another place by the then secretary of state that that was the purpose for which those capital assets would be made available to be returned to the local authority <e> <s> whether the minister likes it or not the government have reneged on an undertaking whether in a green paper or not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene <e> <s> when i referred to that i was quoting what many non-political organisations dealing with housing are saying in general <e> <s> i do not have the means to research that and to confirm whether or not that is the case <e> <s> however the overwhelming <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble and learned lord aware that designing each court building on a one-off basis is a very expensive exercise <e> <s> at a time when there are severe restrictions on spending on housing schools and hospitals is it not nonsense to allow costs to escalate severely in the building of crown courts <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to express my appreciation for the concession announced by the minister of an increase to days <e> <s> naturally i should have liked it to be longer but we are grateful for the concession <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady seear is right <e> <s> the amendment is worthy of serious consideration <e> <s> as the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes said she made the same point in committee <e> <s> i do not find that the logic she expressed can be transferred into human terms <e> <s> the main basis of her argument is that the threat of disconnection is better than the option of a meter <e> <s> giving people the option of a meter might well avoid people owing money <e> <s> that is the point of the exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer which is the type of answer that could have been reasonably expected <e> <s> is he aware of the figures that i quoted in tuesdays debate in the housing section of the local government and housing bill which show that rents paid in london from public funds range from a minimum of a week to a week <e> <s> is that not an appallingly bad use of public funds when for the debt charges on a new council house could be paid <e> <s> is it not the economics of the mad-house to carry on in that manner <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on tuesday i quoted the fact that two-thirds of the improverished families living in bed and breakfast accommodation live in the london area <e> <s> without trying to make political capital out of it would it not make more sense for the government to release some of the funds to local authorities or to give permission for them to use more of the capital assets which the government intend to diminish under the bill at present going through parliament <e> <s> that would allow local authorities to have a substantial increase in the house building programme in conjunction with housing associations <e> <s> these are only two areas of housing which could possibly cope with homelessness on the scale that we have <e> <s> the private sector has neither the will nor the ability to do such a job under the governments legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first offer my apologies to the minister for missing the first couple of minutes of his statement <e> <s> i believe that in answer to some of the questions put to him he said that the major objective of the government was to protect the consumer <e> <s> having said that let me refer to the question of tied houses <e> <s> is the minister speaking of landlords or tenants of public houses <e> <s> is he not aware that in this country the brewers have an appalling record of increasing overnight the rents of their public house tenants and in fact doubling those rents in some cases so that in order to survive tenants have to levy astronomical increases on all commodities that they sell <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state said that the statutory body that is to be disbanded failed <e> <s> however is he aware that when that body functioned under the chairmanship of my noble friend lord scanlon there were three times as many apprentices in training in the engineering industry as there are now and in industry in general <e> <s> how can he claim that to be a failure <e> <s> is he saying that there is a guarantee that the new body will achieve the figure that was achieved under the chairmanship of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that both the question and the answer may be dated in view of the announcement this morning that unexpected progress has been made in discussions between nato and the warsaw pact on cuts in this area <e> <s> if the reports in the responsible press that unexpected progress has been made are correct could not the question and the answer be harmful and hinder that process <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that this morning i received a westminster briefing from the engineering industry training board which states that the boards aim is to ensure that it is fully representative of all engineering employers and that trade unions and education interests are also represented <e> <s> can the minister tell the house whether any direct consultations have taken place with the unions involved to find out what they think about the scheme and how their representatives will be selected <e> <s> bearing in mind that my own trade union the amalgamated engineering union is by far the largest trade union involved in the manufacturing sector in this country has it been consulted <e> <s> have the other trade unions been consulted <e> <s> if not why not <e> <s> without their co-operation the board will fail <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to rise to my feet again <e> <s> however with reference to the construction industry training board is it not a fact that the government have already taken the decision quite recently to decentralise that boards activities and base them at local level against the declared wishes of the building employers confederation and the trades unions involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the detailed answer that the minister has given <e> <s> but am i correct in saying that the figures for the first quarter of this year which the minister has not quoted show an increase in the first quarter for last year of billion which is an enormous increase <e> <s> can the minister give us the figures for the second quarter of this year bearing in mind that the figures i gave for the first quarter are the worst for the first quarter of any year in our industrial history <e>", "<cs> why does the minister persistently keep referring to the civil service as an example of what ought to be done <e> <s> he must be aware of the frequent reports that have foundation that the present government have been indulging in the practice for some years of promoting civil service officers out of turn based solely in some cases on their total sympathy with the governments policy <e> <s> why does the minister keep persisting <e> <s> is he telling us that the civil service is now holier than thou when it is not <e>", "<cs> all through the debates on these amendments so far the minister has kept on referring to the fact that the government are trying to base this on the civil service practice <e> <s> if the minister is not aware that the charge that i have made can be sustained and that it has been made on more than one occasion by responsible people the charge being that there have been promotions within the civil service based mainly on the sympathy of those officers with government policy all i can say is that he has not been in politics long enough <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the minister was not more convincing in his reasons for rejecting this amendment <e> <s> i believe that the case has been made out and the minister has not answered the points that were made <e> <s> i believe that on the basis of the case that has been made for the exclusion of the persons concerned the amendment was worthy of consideration <e> <s> however in view of what the minister has said and bearing in mind the way in which some of the other amendments are interlocked i have no doubt that we shall come back to the matter at a later stage <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i naturally expected the government to resist the amendment but the way in which it was resisted and the reasons given indicate clearly that there are two sets of rules <e> <s> the minister will have to leave the brief which he has been given by his civil servants on instructions from ministers in another place and tell us the reasons because there is no comparison between the way local authority officers and civil servants are being dealt with <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear the tenor of the ministers reply because i think that the government have got this completely wrong <e> <s> it is nonsense to say that a chief officer charged with a specific duty of being in charge of a particular service or area can only report on the dimension of a problem and how to deal with it when requested by the local authority <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with this point <e> <s> i am not arguing the case that the officer should make the decision <e> <s> the officer has no right at all to make the decision <e> <s> what an officer should do and is charged with doing otherwise he should not be in post is to tell his political masters about the situation and how to deal with it or how not to deal with it <e> <s> it is for the political masters to make the decision <e> <s> the minister should not confuse the two issues <e> <s> i am saying that the officers should be fearless and independent in reporting but the decision on what to do about a report is obviously taken by the political masters <e> <s> it cannot be taken by anyone else <e>", "<cs> i hope the committee will allow me to give two quick examples of what i am talking about <e> <s> i am thinking about the halcyon days of local government when local government was highly regarded in this country <e> <s> the medical officer of health of manchester used to publish an annual <e>", "<cs> a short time ago i raised questions in your lordships house relating to the departure of the chief executive from the city of westminster and the golden handshake he was to receive when he left <e> <s> it was apparently over million <e> <s> he was under instruction that the deal would be carried out only on the basis that he would make no public statement about why he was leaving <e> <s> that is the kind of thing that ought to eliminated not what i have been talking about <e>", "<cs> i have little further to say <e> <s> in one authority officers left because as professionals they bitterly objected to their political masters overriding all their advice and treating them like office boys <e>", "<cs> once again i am not very happy with the ministers reply <e> <s> i should like to press him on one point <e> <s> very often when another specific duty is laid upon an authority i am not talking here about officers it is often decided in order to expedite the business to form a sub-committee and to give that committee powers of delegation to deal with a particular situation or a particular function <e> <s> what would be the governments view of an authority if it decided to do just that <e>", "<cs> can the noble baroness enlighten me on what she really meant by her remarks <e> <s> was she talking about my remarks as regards the city of westminster or did she misunderstand something i said as regards the officer <e> <s> did she think i said that the officer would have to carry out something which was legal or illegal <e> <s> i never attempted to convey that fact <e> <s> but if she was referring to the city of westminster i did not use the word illegal i said that in my view the severance pay was given on the basis that no statements were made <e> <s> i would not want to breach the <e>", "<cs> such an officer already exists <e> <s> it is the chief officer or the town clerk of the authority <e> <s> i have known cases where some members have tried to pressurise junior officers in regard to planning permissions <e> <s> junior officers in the planning department have gone to their chief who has then gone to the town clerk/chief executive who has sent for the leader of the group involved <e> <s> he warns the councillor involved to behave himself or else <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may put to him one further point <e> <s> for the purposes of an election the chief officer of the local authority be it the parish clerk the district clerk or the county clerk is also the returning officer in whom statutory duties are resposed <e> <s> i am not sure that we are not wasting too much time on this point about laying down guidelines under which the town clerk can say you do not qualify because you do not have a residential qualification <e> <s> we may have to return to this point <e> <s> if the minister is not going to rise again we shall have to debate a t a later stage what the amendment is trying to do <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that detailed reply <e> <s> his answer appears to go a long way towards allaying some local authorities fears about the bill <e> <s> there is one small point that i should like to raise with him although given the lateness of the hour he may not wish to answer it tonight <e> <s> he referred to the boundaries or periphery to which certain parts of the permission to spend may be restricted <e> <s> perhaps he will take this point on board and give us the governments view at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the amendment of the noble baroness <e> <s> she has covered all the points required <e> <s> it is a very worthy amendment because of the breadth of help that such advice centres give to different sections of the community <e> <s> we should like to think that the minister is sympathetic to the amendment so ably moved by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a long and detailed reply <e> <s> i intend to withdraw the amendment is tabled at a later stage which is what i believe he was saying will he give an undertaking <e>", "<cs> i believe that there is some misunderstanding on my part as to what the minister said <e> <s> when he refers to a controlled company and an influenced company am i over-simplifying it by thinking that the controlled company is one where the local authority has the controlling shares and an influenced company is where it is the minority shareholder <e>", "<cs> my noble friend and colleague lady lockwood expressed far better than i could our worry about the consultation document <e> <s> we shall look at what the noble lord said <e> <s> if action needs to be taken we shall take it <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord mcintosh of haringey because the amendment he has moved is one of the most important amendments in the bill <e> <s> we are talking about council housing and the effect the bill will have on council house tenants <e> <s> the ramifications of part iv are linked to those of part vi <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> will he explain when he replies why when we are continually told that the chancellor of the exchequer is awash with money we have had such a tremendous cut in the money available for housing in the public sector <e> <s> can the minister tell us the reason for that <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the proceedings any longer on these three amendments <e> <s> i disagree with the noble lord lord renton <e> <s> the word substantially is not a quantitive word and does not define anything <e> <s> very often substantially can be used in a relative sense <e> <s> what is one comparing it with <e> <s> the minister will obviously not alter the legislation <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for drawing our attention to the provisions of schedule <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal briefly with a couple of the points made by the noble <e>", "<cs> the minister is saying in effect that the government through the action of certain authorities can abrogate their responsibilities under present homelessness legislation <e> <s> perhaps i may draw the committees attention to what is happening in the london borough of westminster <e> <s> i have quoted figures for the number of people sleeping rough in london <e> <s> many of those people are sleeping rough in the borough of westminster <e> <s> if members of the committee want to see it they have only to walk through the side streets between dolphin square and the palace of westminster <e> <s> they will see people sleeping in doorways <e> <s> under its notorious lady leader westminster council has deliberately emptied and boarded up flats which it is preparing to sell <e> <s> they are being put on the market instead of being made available to the people sleeping in the doorways and in the nooks and crannies of the city of westminster <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to rise once again but it is already happening <e> <s> the conservative-controlled city of westminster is abandoning its responsibility <e> <s> it is putting homelessness so far down its list of priorities that it is disposing of accommodation which could be made available to the homeless <e> <s> in other words one can only draw the conclusion that its policy is to opt out of local authority housing <e> <s> it cannot be anything else <e> <s> what can the secretary of state do under the bill about an authority such as the city of westminster which is opting out of local authority housing <e>", "<cs> when i first came to the dispatch box to move the amendment i shortened the debate on the basis that i had made out the main part of the case <e> <s> if i had had the slightest of sympathetic responses from the minister i should have been prepared to withdraw it but having heard his totally inadequate reply and although there may not be enough of us to carry the day i have no alternative but to test the wishes of the committee and to record the fact that we are not in favour of the provision <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble earl <e> <s> i was called from the chamber and therefore missed the ministers first remarks <e> <s> however i am sure that the government are proceeding on a completely wrong premise <e>", "<cs> i briefly illustrated the situation that might be created in some of the larger authorities to which the minister has referred <e> <s> i have figures which i believe show quite clearly that if a local housing authority had not cleared its decks for action by the appropriate date in the bill even if only per cent <e> <s> of the tenants were not paying their rent that could mean a surcharge on each remaining tenant of <e>", "<cs> why <e> <s> perhaps the minister does not know that in the average large city million is a tremendous rate poundage increase even with the poll tax <e> <s> in my opinion there is no way in which such a commitment can be met while carrying out the functions across the board which the government expect <e>", "<cs> i accept that correction <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for offering some hope <e> <s> i should like to read more closely what he said and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i shall not move this amendment <e> <s> i shall read what the minister said and perhaps come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord harris for his intervention and to the minister for his reply <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> do i take it from the ministers answer to the noble lord lord harris that the decision will be made before the bill completes its passage through this house <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i shall be brief <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his detailed explanation of what this part of the bill does <e> <s> however i ask him to bear with me for a few moments and to tell the committee <e>", "<cs> i should like to give more detail <e> <s> during my travels i have noticed some authorities are in the process of extensive upgrading of estates by installing upv windows and other improvements thus bringing reasonable properties up to a good standard <e> <s> we all want to see that <e> <s> do i therefore take it that that type of full estate upmarket improvement termed in some quarters as enveloping would qualify as capital work <e> <s> it is clear that such work is more than just repair <e> <s> the government should view it sympathetically so that that type of activity can be considered as capital work <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to return to this point but that is where the difficulty starts <e> <s> one does not refurbish an estate twice in a lifetime <e> <s> something that has never been done cannot be taken into account <e> <s> the expenditure may be completely new <e> <s> an authority may be commencing an upgrading programme that has never been done before <e> <s> it may be a particular facet like reroofing or it may involve total central heating of a more modern and acceptable type with double glazing <e> <s> this may bring a difficult estate on stream and enable people to accept it <e> <s> the matter cannot be judged by the yardstick of what has been done in the past because such measures have never been taken before <e> <s> when this bill becomes an act will authorities be able to say that such measures will qualify as capital works as understood by the government and the minister <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the minister has raised the point <e> <s> i may speak again depending on his reply <e> <s> i believe that his comments would be well made now as he has suggested <e>", "<cs> i have not as yet moved amendment no <e> <s> a but perhaps it would be in order for me to speak to the amendment now as the minister referred to it in his general comments as regards what the bill does or does not do for the disabled <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps i should paraphrase what was said <e> <s> the remarks made were based upon representations from the association of disabled professionals stressing that unlike other changes to a building adaptions needed by disabled people do not necessarily add to the value of a house <e> <s> indeed quite often it is the reverse <e> <s> therefore the grants are in a different category <e>", "<cs> i may have missed this if the minister has already told us but have the government had any consultations or discussions with radar or any of the other organisations which cover disabled people <e> <s> if they have not that is a pity and why have they not <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord seebohm <e> <s> successive reports issued by a variety of bodies such as <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> naturally i shall read what he has said but i accept his assurance that the bill as presently drafted will allow this exercise to take place <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should have risen earlier to speak to amendment no <e> <s> but the principle was covered by the noble lord lord ross when he moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> though neither my name nor that of any of my noble friends on our front bench appears next to this amendment i rise to support it <e> <s> if there are any measures that we can take to eliminate or affect the operation of cowboy builders within the industry then we should take them <e> <s> the activities of cowboy builders have not diminished over the years <e> <s> a substantial volume of building work is now undertaken by such builders in this country mostly at the bottom end of the trade <e> <s> i know that throughout the building industry the building employers confederation and other national organisations besides the trade unions involved there is deep concern at this particular activity and the fact that the government do not appear to be taking the matter seriously enough <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the ministers answer appears at least in my opinion to have completely the opposite effect to what the government hope to achieve <e> <s> he said that the bill as it stands without the amendment moved by the noble lord lord ross being accepted is designed to prevent fraud that is people making fraudulent claims <e> <s> our intention and i think that of the bill is <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that the government are still prepared to protect certain sections of the community <e> <s> some people who have received the benefit of purchasing local authority houses at considerable discounts have then found to their dismay that the houses are not as good as they had thought and they have been granted substantial sums of money from the public purse <e> <s> that has included their own ex-local authority contributing naturally through the national exchequer in order to put those properties into a reasonable condition <e>", "<cs> there have been complaints by two speakers about the complexity of this batch of amendments <e> <s> but the die has been cast <e> <s> following the protest made yesterday about the time taken i believe it was inevitable that the bill had to be undertaken in this way otherwise we should have been faced with a sudden death situation at report stage <e> <s> it is not the most desirable way but at least the amendments are on the marshalled list and available now at committee stage <e> <s> that will allow more time for the interested bodies who will be advising members of the committee in various parts of the chamber to put forward proposals for amendments at an appropriate time for report stage which starts a week on thursday <e> <s> as i have said if the amendments had been tabled then it would have been almost impossible because of the time factor for this chamber to do any kind of justice to them <e>", "<cs> i hope the impression is not abroad that because this front bench has not passed any detailed comment therefore we tacitly accept these amendments <e> <s> we do not <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl lord lytton for giving us something of a dry run this evening on what may well be the salient points to be discussed and amended on report <e> <s> as i said the matter will have to be looked at in great detail <e> <s> i envisage that at the appropriate time on report there will be extensive debates on these important issues when we will attempt to deal with them <e> <s> on that basis there is nothing more i can say tonight but the silence does not on this occasion mean tacit acceptance of the amendments <e>", "<cs> i agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord evans <e> <s> however one of the sad realities of life in politics is that any government are always in charge of the timetable <e> <s> they decide how much cloth goes into the suit <e> <s> they may give the opposition a say in how that cloth is cut up but that is about all the opposition get <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his detailed reply which was somewhat contradictory <e> <s> do i take it that the two authorities that the minister mentioned have divested themselves at their tenants request of all the local authority housing stock and that there are now no more council houses in sevenoaks and chiltern <e>", "<cs> it is a myth to think that homelessness is prevalent only in the large conurbations such as london <e> <s> it is not <e> <s> there is serious concern in rural areas the normal hinterland of government support <e>", "<cs> there is a profound difference here <e> <s> i accept that the legislation on homeless persons means that a local authority will accept responsibility for housing the homeless <e> <s> it does not necessarily say that they have to do it <e> <s> but the minister pulled two rabbits out of the hat when he mentioned sevenoaks and somewhere else <e> <s> will the minister tell me what undertakings have been given by sevenoaks and the other local authority that they can take on board their responsibility for seeing that homeless people are housed in one way or another <e>", "<cs> how can they possibly judge that on the basis of an increasing and unknown number of people who are becoming homeless <e> <s> how can one write a figure into that <e> <s> it is quite impossible because by any statistics over the past two or three years and i have to say that the trend is increasing the number of units required to house homeless people is exploding upwards dramatically <e> <s> so how can the secretary of state be satisfied today that a local authority which transfers an estate next week will be in a position later even to look at the question of homeless people <e> <s> i shall withdraw the <e>", "<cs> i am intrigued by the ministers reply <e> <s> when i was the chairman of a very large housing authority in manchester during the s there were no private flats or houses with which to compare rents <e> <s> they had all been sold off unless they were very high quality very exclusive service flats <e> <s> most local authorities have always followed a policy of establishing a rent structure for their properties which identified different types of <e>", "<cs> we are not going to get any further <e> <s> i think that that particular aspect is nonsense <e> <s> having said that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that in moving the amendment the minister said that he was awaiting the report of a working party investigating the question <e> <s> we shall therefore await the findings of that working party and perhaps if necessary come back to the matter at a later stage <e>", "<cs> one point that has been missed and it answers the point made by the noble baroness lady masham is that in all the building schemes that were invoked a few years ago when the big building programmes were under way by the local authorities there was a stipulation made by a succession of governments that per cent <e> <s> of each contract had to be single-unit accommodation for elderly people <e>", "<cs> i was delighted to hear the ministers optimism despite present knowledge when he expressed the view that in the long-term foreseeable future we may even come into a surplus position in rural areas as regards low-cost housing for rent <e> <s> i think that that was the term he used <e> <s> i have tabled a question for him to answer on monday on starts and completions for last year and for the nine months of this year <e> <s> however in view of what has been said i give him notice now of a further question <e> <s> when he gives me the figures on monday will he tell me if he possibly can how many low-cost homes were started in the months of last year and in the nine months of this year <e> <s> the authorities in those areas are saying that their supply of properties to let has completely dried up <e> <s> therefore if he can tell us on monday with some optimism that such developments are already under way then his remarks that we may see a surplus in the long-term foreseeable future may have some credibility <e> <s> but if he cannot do so it will not <e>", "<cs> that country already has the houses <e> <s> that is why it now has a surplus <e> <s> we do not have any houses from which a surplus could arise <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister is expecting a sudden rapid reduction in the number of ageing people by way of their demise or whether he is expecting a nuclear holocaust but i cannot see this happening any other way <e>", "<cs> that amendment is listed in a separate group with amendments nos <e> <s> f to h <e>", "<cs> as the minister said they are merely technical amendments <e> <s> however can he explain why it is proposed that if local authorities serve repair notices the landlord has to act after days instead of after seven as at present <e> <s> why has that changed <e>", "<cs> the government may think that it is unreasonable but they have not given any evidence to show why it is unreasonable <e> <s> it is only a technical amendment but a change from seven days to is a substantial increase <e> <s> what evidence is there to sustain such a proposal <e>", "<cs> it is as clear as snow but having heard the explanation i have no desire to oppose the amendments <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he said this group of amendments <e> <s> i moved only one amendment <e> <s> may i take it that the minister is dealing with amendment no <e> <s> ab <e> <s> there are some three amendments <e> <s> is the minister dealing with all of them on the same basis in principle <e>", "<cs> i think that the ministers final few words indicated what those of us who support this amendment and it has been a long campaign over a number of years believe the difference is really about <e> <s> the minister says that the local authority ought to be free to take certain types of action <e> <s> we say that in principle that action ought to be mandatory <e> <s> some local authorities are carrying out this function and others are not and we say that the risk is far too high <e>", "<cs> the point i make about this amendment and some of the others that will follow is that we are not satisfied with working on the basis of giving local authorities the chance to do something <e> <s> we say that they should do something <e> <s> however i have no desire to press the amendment <e> <s> obviously i shall look at the general subject when we have gone through these amendments and perhaps we may come back at a later stage <e>", "<cs> for over years a campaign has been underway at westminister <e> <s> it is not a one-party campaign <e> <s> i make that quite clear <e> <s> there have been strong representations by an all-party group called char <e> <s> there has been a series of appalling tragedies <e> <s> i do not wish to go through them <e> <s> they have been mainly in the london area and in such places as manchester and leeds <e> <s> deaths have occurred on a regular basis and each time somebody has been found at fault through inadequate fire escape facilities or doors being locked <e> <s> such standards have been terribly low <e>", "<cs> it does <e> <s> due to the mix-up in the numbers we did not deal with the matter at the time that we should have done so <e> <s> i have no desire to press the amendment <e> <s> it will be an ongoing issue <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think so <e> <s> i do not want to spend too much time on these amendments because i am aware of the time factor and the host of amendments that we still have to go through <e> <s> unfortunately my noble friend lord stallard has had to leave us <e> <s> he has been one of a number of members of this house and members of another place who have followed this issue <e> <s> only two years ago a government back-bencher the noble baroness lady vickers introduced a private members bill at a late stage in a session in this chamber dealing with this matter and had complete support <e> <s> unfortunately there was no parliamentary time available <e>", "<cs> obviously the spirit of the amendment moved by the minister is acceptable <e> <s> as the minister indicated the amendment plugs a gap in the monitoring power of the housing corporation in that as the law stands at present it is only able to require the production of documents when conducting an inquiry into the affairs of a registered housing association <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make the following observation <e> <s> once again i am speaking on behalf of the national federation of housing associations <e> <s> in principle the federation can see little problem with the proposal for the extension of section but would welcome if possible the governments assurance that the word person includes organisations in this context <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that answer as i am sure will be the federation <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee but it is obvious from the ministers answer that a chasm still divides the two sides as to what we desire in giving fair protection to the tenant involved <e> <s> as my noble friend and colleague lord mcintosh indicated on a previous amendment dealing with this subject we shall be returning to this at report stage proceeding on the same basis as this one <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am somewhat disappointed and saddened by the negative response <e> <s> the reasons the minister gave for not acceding to the request do not hold water <e> <s> they are not adequate reasons for refusing representation on the board of people who are at the sharp end of the business <e> <s> while the people who will be appointed may be experts in their own fields of activity they will in my opinion be concerned in the main with ensuring that the housing corporation is financially sound <e> <s> the appointment of the type of person we are suggesting in these amendments would go a long way towards making the body more socially sound <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures given by the minister indicate that the housing problem is becoming worse as a result of the diminishing role of the building programme itself <e> <s> is the minister aware that people throughout the country who deal with house building and the provision of housing are saying that house building is grinding to a standstill and that as a consequence hardly any new properties are being sold <e> <s> is that not an urgent situation about which the government should do something immediately <e>", "<cs> my lords if the figures given by the minister in his answer to my first supplementary question are an indication of the governments success as he says over the last decade why is the number of homeless people in this country ballooning upwards every week <e> <s> why can local authorities no longer build houses and why is even the voluntary sector having to curtail and reduce its building programme <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> that went on the bank rate last year severely restricted and cut the housing programme across the board <e> <s> both the private and public sectors will subscribe to that <e> <s> i therefore wish to ask the minister whether he will plead with the new secretary of state mr patten to indemnify local authorities against the further increase in interest rates when he settles the housing investment programme for the next financial year otherwise they will be building nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back so quickly on this question <e> <s> i believe however that the minister has missed the main point <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> increase in the bank rate has devastated the real purchasing power of the sums that he mentioned <e> <s> will he consult the new secretary of state to see whether the local authorities and the voluntary sector can be indemnified against that increase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for those figures <e> <s> does he agree that the substantial increases that they show include a substantial increase in mortgage rates and that increase has to be met by owner occupiers who still have outstanding mortgages <e> <s> they are having to pay substantial increases due to the increased bank rates <e> <s> i do not include the most recent increase <e> <s> have the government any plans to assist first time buyers or the more recent mortgagees who in increasing numbers are finding it impossible to meet their financial commitments and may well find themselves joining the homeless queue in the near future unless something happens <e>", "<cs> my lords i am disappointed by the ministers reply because what he says is not the case in the real world <e> <s> the public sector and the private sector working within the public sector are not often bound by the same standards <e> <s> safety is one of the biggest areas for concern <e> <s> there are good employers in the private sector who have the fullest regard for the safety of their workers and comply with the acts but there are a host of others who do not especially in the building trade <e> <s> one of the reasons for that is that to reduce prices corners are cut <e> <s> safety measures are one of the biggest casualties <e> <s> that often results in casualties and sometimes fatalities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down and before we dispose of the amendment can he give us a brief resume of the type of company he is talking about <e> <s> having spent a long time in local government i find it difficult to obtain evidence that there are many of those companies about anyway <e> <s> perhaps they have mushroomed in the past or years <e> <s> i know of none influenced or owned to any degree by a local authority in the private sector where the local authority would have the deciding vote <e> <s> i think such companies would be scarce and difficult to find <e> <s> perhaps the minister can give us one or two examples <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that brief reply <e> <s> i understand the interest of the noble baroness lady fisher she has already spoken of the national exhibition centre at birmingham <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that generous reply <e> <s> it gives us what we asked for <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the minister rising to the defence of the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> if he thinks that i took a mean advantage i have to say that i only repeated what i have said more than once in your lordships house <e> <s> at this time of the year the government are in consultation i shall not say negotiating with authorities <e> <s> i was always led to believe that consultations meant consultations on the basis of forming a decision or of consultations being taken into consideration when a decision was being arrived at <e> <s> one was to be consulted about a decision whether or not it was in ones favour <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention of withdrawing anything because i believe that what i have said represents the overwhelming view of local authorities in this country <e> <s> not only that people like myself who have been involved in housing over a number of years feel this <e> <s> in my opinion the government will have to start being less economical with the truth at the dispatch box when they talk about housing <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis of the exchange that has just taken place i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please speak a little more slowly <e> <s> i am having difficulty in following what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will agree that his reply was rather complicated <e>", "<cs> my lords in some respects the debate we have had has been wider than the amendment on the marshalled list but has given us a chance to talk about the immediate situation of homelessness <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his reply but not for its content because i am saddened that the government think their policy for dealing with homelessness is right <e> <s> i think it is sad that the government appear to be living in tram lines from which they do not appear to be able to get out and do something about the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the ministers response that the door is somewhat open <e> <s> he overstated his own case at the end when he referred to resisting the amendment because i thought that he had gone some way along the road to meet some of my points <e>", "<cs> my lords i also want to support the amendment and not just for the reasons that have been given <e> <s> we have had debates in your lordships house on a variety of reports by various commissions for instance the audit commission report the duke of edinburghs report <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise very briefly to support this amendment so ably moved by the noble lord lord stanley of alderley supported by the noble lord lord hylton <e> <s> i believe that they have covered all the arguments for this amendment in a very constructive and acceptable way <e> <s> on that basis i rise to support it on behalf of the members on this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his reply and for his generous tribute to me and to the campaign in which i have been involved <e> <s> it would be remiss of me not to mention that a great many members on all sides of your lordships house and in another place have given the cause their total support <e> <s> i can say on behalf of all the individuals and organisations involved that they will accept the amendments minor though they appear very gratefully as a step in the right direction <e> <s> once again i express my sincere thanks to the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of the reassurance that the minister gave but i am still of the opinion that it would have been better to accept the amendment <e> <s> i believe that it is better to have a national basis on which to assess than continually allow the secretary of state to make his own determinations <e> <s> however i have no intention of pressing the issue <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords one should give brief thanks for small gifts <e> <s> i thank the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that i was grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> however as he has given me no comfort that would be rather false <e> <s> at this time of night and at this stage of the bill i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the last remark made by the minister which is of a very helpful nature <e> <s> however i believe that he has rather downgraded the problems that i have been talking about as regards the areas which this amendment is trying to help <e> <s> the minister said that the problems are local and minor but they are not <e> <s> for example the city of manchester begins at the boundary of trafford and ends at the boundary of tameside <e> <s> there is no question but that that area has become a black spot in terms of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little disappointed with the ministers reply although some of it was informative and helpful <e> <s> he said that i had been rather vociferous during the passage of the bill <e> <s> in a sense i think that politics has entered a new age <e> <s> indeed many people in the minsters own party have been most vociferous in the past week and not on the subject of housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that detailed answer <e> <s> however is the minister not aware that following the substantial cuts which have been made responsible people in the housing field are saying that had the level of spending on housing investment programmes been maintained in real terms at the level there would have been approximately additional houses in the public sector to let to low wage earners <e> <s> does that not convey clearly that responsibility for the increasing incidence of homelessness lies at the door of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords answer does not particularly help the situation <e> <s> if we are talking about the finance that should be made available to local authorities i should point out that i was not including the substantial amounts of local authorities own capital receipts which were originally promised to them but which have been withheld <e> <s> when ministers in both houses and departmental spokesmen repeat as they did at the weekend that the governments housing policy is a success i should ask whether they intend the number of homeless people to be increased <e> <s> that is the end product of what is happening <e> <s> i am simply asking the minister whether in considering the housing investment programme for this year he will deal with homelessness as a matter of urgency and allow authorities to spend substantial sums increasing sums of their own money to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when i came from euston station this morning two out of four lifts were out of order <e> <s> one escalator which was out of order was a very long one indeed <e> <s> on it there was marooned halfway down a young lady who was having extreme difficulty in carrying a heavy case and trying to negotiate the steps <e> <s> does the minister agree that the situation is potentially a recipe for disaster and that something ought to be done to eliminate it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that unless the is forthcoming the centre will be in jeopardy <e> <s> the sad fact is that if such a centre were to close we should be unable to predict with any certainty whether anything would <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the government are proceeding along this course without any consultation whatever with the people involved before arriving at a decision <e> <s> bearing in mind that over the past years the government have in most cases set their face quite rigidly against any form of devolution why are they going in the opposite direction now <e> <s> is it not a fact that good judges on this subject are fearful that there may be some very damaging consequences as a result of this exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords that answer is misleading <e> <s> from what the minister said the government are engaged in consultations but they are not about the decision to disband the present set-up <e> <s> the consultations are on meeting the demands that the government are making and carrying out the exercise <e> <s> they are not about the decision and i do not think that that can be classed as consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there has been severe criticism of the governments policy as regards more centralisation of casualty departments <e> <s> centralisation has resulted in the closure of some of the outlying hospitals which historically had casualty departments that worked very well <e> <s> is the minister aware that this situation is causing great concern among people who have to go longer distances for emergency treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to speak i too should like to congratulate the noble lord lord layton on his maiden speech <e> <s> he was obviously master of his brief and understood very well the particular facet of the subject to which he spoke <e> <s> i look forward to hearing from him on future occasions as the subject of the environment has started to take pride of place in our national discussions right across the political spectrum <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend makes the case on that point far more eloquently than i could <e> <s> however i do not wish to turn this into a debate on nuclear energy because i have no doubt that your lordships will come back to a debate on energy in the near future <e> <s> that will be the time to expand on the case and go into detail on the views that i believe we all hold quite sincerely <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that as a result of water privatisation it is expected that the salaries of the top people running the privatised companies will double immediately <e> <s> does he consider the doubling of those peoples salaries to over conducive to helping the government in the fight against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that about two years ago the government introduced regulations which restricted the number of householders who could apply for thermal insulation such as double glazing and loft insulation to the top age groups <e> <s> was that not a retrograde step <e> <s> should we not because of the value of saving energy encourage all householders to pursue this kind of activity with reasonable support from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> am i to assume that those grants will be available to all age groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord diamond for giving way <e> <s> further to the intervention by the noble lord on the government bench is it not also a fact that in another place the speaker had already ruled that the bill was not hybrid and that it was this house which overturned that ruling <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also express my appreciation to the noble lord lord ezra for bringing the subject before the house <e> <s> it is a very important subject and goes beyond the privatisation of electricity <e>", "<cs> i shall my lords although i am reluctant to do so <e> <s> the noble lord spoke for a long time the other night about minutes and has spoken at length tonight <e> <s> i shall give way provided his intervention is short <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is trying to convince me that when the population of the world doubles in the next years wind and water will solve all the energy problems <e> <s> he is talking of cloud-cuckoo-land because there is no possibility of that happening <e> <s> i have to remind the noble lord and i am assured of the thoroughness with which he goes into these things that there was a report published last week by a select committee of your lordships house on the greenhouse effect <e> <s> in that report there is a brief paragraph on this point <e> <s> however i read the evidence submitted to the committee and there were or organisations dealing in depth with the greenhouse problem what causes it and what may eliminate it <e> <s> on page paragraph the report states that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the arrears mentioned in the report of this year amounted to million an increase of per cent <e> <s> compared with last years figure of over million <e> <s> that is deemed to be the result of the housing benefit legislation introduced by the government last year when they were warned by noble lords on all sides of the house of the effect that it would have <e>", "<cs> my lords that answer is so ridiculous <e> <s> we are not talking about administration we are talking about housing benefit that is completely and utterly necessary to their survival being removed from people at the bottom end of the social scale <e> <s> will the minister answer my question and not manufacture one of his own <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> the information that i have received from people involved in the negotiations shows that despite the pleas that have been made in your lordships house from all quarters for increased spending on housing because of the social problems public sector housing in this country will once again suffer a cut in real terms this year of million in the settlement that the minister has stated will be announced shortly <e> <s> in real terms that is an per cent <e> <s> cut <e> <s> does the minister consider that local authorities can continue their functions of caring for people and getting homeless people off the streets with cuts of such magnitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry quickly to rise again <e> <s> the minister indicates that my figures are correct <e> <s> my figure was billion he <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the recently formed housing forum it is not a political organisation but consists of members of the riba and representatives of local authorities the public accountants organisations and the institute of housing states clearly that by the turn of the century there will be need for a further million houses <e> <s> how does the minister expect local authorities and the public and private sectors to achieve such a target when even the private sector building programme has fallen by per cent <e> <s> during the past three months <e> <s> is it not time that the government listened to people outside the political spectrum and started allowing local authorities once again to build the houses which are so urgently needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> however as time has moved on is it not quite apparent that this sweetener which was given to the group could in fact be only one sweetener in a basket of many <e> <s> can the noble lord tell us whether other sweeteners were offered and taken up <e> <s> if that is so why was your lordships house not told about this on previous occasions when the matter was raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> the main thrust of my debate concerned manchester but the question i asked was directed solely to the survival of strangeways with which i am concerned the carrying out almost of a statutory duty on a voluntary basis <e> <s> i note what the minister stated about heavy spending but i and the noble lord lord donaldson are asking whether the government should be looking at greater funding for the voluntary bodies that are at present in existence <e> <s> they are doing a job on behalf of the community which is threatened by lack of finance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that even with the recent announcement concerning investment in our rail programme compared with our compatriots in the ec we are bottom of the league <e> <s> when do the government expect this situation to alter and when will they invest comparable sums in our railway industry to those invested by other parts of continental europe <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in areas such as the large cities for example manchester the number of deaths of children below the age of months and at birth is still twice the national average and that the number of fairly young men dying from heart disease is also twice the national average <e> <s> will those factors be taken into account in the distribution of resources with a view to redressing the imbalance <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may acquaint the noble earl with some of the effects of that increase <e> <s> is the minister aware that since may the average increase in mortgages in this country has been per month <e> <s> in the london area it is almost double that at per month <e> <s> is the minister also aware that in that same period the number of mortgagees who are between six and months in arrears has risen to an increase of per cent <e> <s> does he not understand that we may be watching a social disaster unfolding <e> <s> when will the government do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble earls answer to my supplementary question of course we welcome any increased funding for housing <e> <s> however is the minister not aware that when he claims a record year it is a spurious claim <e> <s> under a previous conservative government and the succeeding labour government we were building houses a year <e> <s> so the noble earl is being selective in claiming a record <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl now answer the question that i put to him and not the one he wants to answer which has not been asked <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the two-thirds of overseas contracts to which he referred were won by british nuclear fuels in the face of severe competition from the french industry <e> <s> can he also confirm that further negotiations are taking place with the german industry in order to commence their contracts at the turn of the century <e> <s> if the industry were to close down would not over jobs be lost <e> <s> would we not be handing over a thriving industry with a very rosy future to the french industry and lengthening our own dole queues <e>", "<cs> my lords the question relates to our survival as a maritime nation <e> <s> is not the biggest threat to our survival if hostilities broke out and god forbid the fact that we now have hardly any merchant navy left to sustain us in the face of an adversary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was told before we rose for the christmas recess that the chairman of the trafford development corporation was to be replaced <e> <s> does the minister also recall that two years ago i challenged the wisdom of the government appointing the same person to chair two large-scale quangos in the same area <e> <s> is it not a fact that too much responsibility has been loaded on to one person <e> <s> we were led to believe that the plans for that area would generate to jobs in what was the largest manufacturing area in the united kingdom <e> <s> is that still the governments objective and when will some action be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may press the minister <e> <s> i refer specifically to jobs in the manufacturing industry not floor space that may become warehouses <e> <s> are the government committed to the area once again becoming a major area of manufacturing bearing in mind that last month we lost more jobs in the manufacturing sector in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that while we bounce statistics across the dispatch box to one another the governments own report on this subject shows a requirement for a million new homes to be built for rent by the turn <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case will the minister explain why day by day the number of homeless people in other major cities is increasing dramatically <e> <s> what is the answer to that problem or do the government not have one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that of the local authorities surveyed per cent <e> <s> of them noted an increase in harassment and illegal evictions <e> <s> is it not sad that out of the complaints made only led to prosecutions <e> <s> is he further aware that those figures are a direct contradiction of what he says <e> <s> it was not good enough for the newly appointed minister in another place to try to discredit the report by saying that the act had not been in place long enough to indicate what was happening when he himself had been in the department for less than a fortnight <e> <s> this is a <e>", "<cs> my lords in his earlier reply the minister indicated once again that the government saw this particular act as a major solution to the question of rehousing the homeless <e> <s> however he did not give us any concrete evidence other than the fact that one person had received a prison sentence for violating the law <e> <s> therefore that person can no longer be deemed as homeless <e> <s> can he now give us figures to indicate in any respect whatever how many people have left the homeless queue and been rehoused in private tenanted property as a result of the act <e> <s> i should tell him that i cannot find evidence of any <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell the house now that this exercise has effectively created a monopoly what proposals the government have in mind to ensure and guarantee that the taxpayer will have the benefit of reasonable and realistic pricing <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the ministers statement <e> <s> i have spent a long time as a member of your lordships house and of the other place debating a succession of bills dealing with football <e> <s> i was surprised that the minister showed chagrin when my noble friend on the front bench levied criticism at the government for the way in which they delivered the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join previous speakers in expressing appreciation to the noble and gallant lord lord carver for initiating this debate and for the lucid manner in which he introduced it <e> <s> this is a very important subject which ranges far wider than the united kingdom <e> <s> it concerns what is taking place in the world today <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the figure of billion that he quoted is a five-fold increase in that deficit since this government took office <e> <s> bearing in mind that only a few years ago this field of activity was described as a sunrise industry can he tell us whether the government have any plans or are contemplating any further action to reduce the present trend i say trend because it is getting worse all the time arrest it and finally reverse it <e> <s> otherwise we shall be in serious difficulty in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords the second part of the ministers answer indicated that the section of industry widely known as the silicon chip industry shows a deficit of nearly million at present if i understand the figure correctly <e> <s> does the minister accept that a large slice of the blame for that situation is due to the governments political stupidity in privatising inmos by selling it off to emi thorn which then sold it off to one of our competitors on the continent thus exacerbating a situation that was already deteriorating <e>", "<cs> my lords although the figures that the minister gave indicating the increase are welcome is he aware that there was a meeting in committee room b on tuesday morning of your lordships all-party group on the building industry which was addressed by representatives of the building employers confederation and they said quite clearly that over the wider spectrum there has been a per cent <e> <s> downturn in the building of houses and flats over the past months <e> <s> they were asked for a remedy <e> <s> they said that the only thing that could stop a further serious deterioration over the next months would be a modest decrease in the bank rate for the money that they had to borrow <e> <s> what hope can the minister give that their wishes will be fulfilled in order to build more houses which are most urgently required <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is the minister aware that that was a realistic price in the interests of the taxpayers <e> <s> can he confirm that there were substantial lands included in this deal <e> <s> can the minister also give an undertaking that if on the sale of those lands by the present owners who purchased british rail engineering limited there are substantial profits the government will consider implementing a clawback scheme in the interests of taxpayers <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care to the previous speakers <e> <s> i was not aware that the amendment concerned abortions <e> <s> those members of the committee who listened to the the today programme on the radio this morning will have heard medical people from romania talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the diminution in bad behaviour at football matches and mainly outside the grounds owes a great deal to the involvement of the official supporters clubs and their national movement <e> <s> further will he accept from me that when setting up a body of people to decide on the guidelines for football it would be tragic if the official supporters clubs were left out bearing in mind the objective contribution that they could make <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that if one takes the figure that the minister is allowing plus inflation which is not contained in that figure on those criteria the increase for people in the bournemouth area over the next three years will be in the region of per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> where is the protection for the consumer that the minister in another place promised during the passage of the water bill in order to justify that privatisation measure which they forced through this house and another place <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that figures that were quoted by the noble lord lord elliott for the newcastle authority will mean that users of the water in that area over the next three years will face an average increase of per cent <e> <s> that is twice the amount of the present inflation figures <e> <s> as my noble friend lord williams on the front bench has asked what will the government do when the new massive private companies start to levy their charges <e> <s> will all water users be faced with an increase of upwards of per cent <e> <s> if so what will become of the governments fight against inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords members of your lordships house will probably agree that the subject we are discussing is the most important issue that lies before us as a nation <e> <s> it relates to our future wellbeing and the maintenance and improvement of our standard of living <e> <s> i shall not go into detail in regard to the national figures because they have been well aired by other speakers not just today but at recent question times <e> <s> one would not deny that <e>", "<cs> my lords over the past to years some local authorities have had to take care of an increasing number of elderly people in their areas <e> <s> they have had to build residential homes at substantial cost to their taxpayers <e> <s> is the minister saying that because of the increase in the number of ageing people as mentioned by the noble lord lord mellish ratepayers will no longer have to bear the funding <e> <s> will the government pick up the bill as they ought to have done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind the fact that recent reports including one debated in this house show conclusively that one of the greatest culprits in encouraging the greenhouse effect is fossil-fuel power stations what has become of the governments programme to deal with that situation in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i asked what had become of the governments programme to deal with fossil-fuel power stations and the emissions from their chimneys which cause the greenhouse effect <e> <s> how far are the government into the programme which was announced some time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that unless there is a substantial increase in the training of apprentices in the engineering industry in this country up to something like it was a decade ago we shall be in no position to take advantage of the single market that will be in existence from <e> <s> bearing that in mind if we do not get the funds from europe will the government look at this matter as one of urgency and themselves provide funds or more money toward that end <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that when dealing with this subject last week in another place the prime minister gave an undertaking that the secretary of state for the environment would be making a leaflet available with points of guidance in it in order for the tenant to be able to protect himself from a landlord who may exploit the situation <e> <s> will the minister urge the secretary of state to make these leaflets available as a matter of urgency in view of the track record of some landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> however is the minister aware that although the first half of last year probably produced the best figure since the second half showed a very serious deterioration as the increased payments started to bite <e> <s> we are now at the point where repossessions in the last six months of last year increased by per cent <e> <s> does he agree that there is at present a very serious situation which is deteriorating even faster <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply to me the minister seemed to draw some laughs from the noble lords behind him <e> <s> does he consider that the other figures that are being produced by the council of mortgage lenders show that households are more than six months in arrears <e> <s> that is an increase of per cent <e> <s> does he consider it laughable that home buyers are now a year or more behind with their mortgages <e> <s> that is an increase of per cent <e> <s> does he also think it is laughable that repossessions show an increase of per cent <e> <s> when one takes into account that for those same people water and electricity payments will increase by a minimum of per cent <e> <s> and the poll tax is per cent <e> <s> higher than the government predicted what messages of comfort has he for them <e> <s> some of them are now going into home ownership bankruptcy <e> <s> do they just have to bite the bullet and get on with the business even if it means that to get out of debt they have to move from their houses in order for the building society to put the house back on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> first i should like to express my appreciation to the noble baroness for raising this topic for debate <e> <s> it is an important matter and indeed a vital one for the community as a whole <e> <s> i shall speak more or less about the areas in which i have spent most of my life and which i have represented namely the inner cities <e> <s> i take the point made by the noble lord lord wise about the need to consider the rural areas <e> <s> in those areas a citizens advice bureau might be the only lifeline for people on their own and in need of services <e> <s> the need for the service to be provided in such areas could very well be a high priority <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am extremely grateful for that non-answer <e> <s> is he also aware that responsible newspapers published graphs this morning showing a charge level of approximately to <e> <s> if one takes the difference between labour authorities and conservative authorities based on the national average it is less than p a week <e> <s> does that not destroy mr kenneth bakers idea that the sole cause of the difference is due to high-spending profligate labour authorities when the overwhelming cause of the situation is lack of government funding <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave a figure of per cent <e> <s> is he aware that whereas some time ago the prime minister said that the poll tax must provide for per cent <e> <s> of local authority spending it must now provide for per cent <e> <s> who got the sums wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister answer the second part of my question <e> <s> the prime minister said that the poll tax would be expected to cover per cent <e> <s> of local authority spending but in fact it must now cover per cent <e> <s> who got the sums wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will understand if i restrict myself to the people covered by the word poor in the motion on the order paper <e> <s> i refer explicitly in my few minutes to perhaps the poorest sector in the community those people without even a roof over their heads <e> <s> much has been said in this house over the past few years on this subject and i know that all quarters of the house have generally pressed the government to do something about this as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> would he care to tell us why three of the highest rent increases have been levied totally against the governments recommendations by conservative authorities such as redbridge <e> <s> that borough will levy a rent increase of per week <e> <s> reigate will levy per week and another borough will levy an increase of per week <e> <s> these increases are totally against the governments wishes <e> <s> can the minister tell us why these authorities have levied such tremendous increases <e> <s> will the increases qualify in full for housing benefit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a strong feeling abroad in the borough of redbridge that the a week increase has been deliberately levied because when the tenants of the council estates in redbridge were balloted on the matter of privatisation they voted to stay with the local authority <e> <s> the feeling is abroad that this is the conservative local authoritys way of punishing them <e> <s> will the minister give an undertaking that any surpluses that accrue to the housing revenue account because of the substantial increases will not be used next year by these authorities to levy an artificially low poll tax <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not understand that his answer to the question of my noble friend lord hatch means that even with the improvements that he has announced great britain will still be a massive contributor to acid rain and damage to the ozone layer <e> <s> does he realise that the programme that he has announced is not what was originally envisaged and announced by various ministers including the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i am rather surprised at the figure of per cent <e> <s> the question on the order paper is broadly based and i hope that he and other noble lords will understand if at this point i restrict myself to the part which refers to amateur sports <e> <s> if one takes a broad base of amateur sports including rugby union association football bowls tennis and athletics is the minister aware that the increase is a minimum of per cent <e> <s> and in some cases over per cent <e> <s> bearing in mind that the government appear to be rethinking some of the sums that must be paid by people under both the unified business rate and the poll tax will he ask his right honourable friend the secretary of state whether in reviewing the other areas of concern regarding the new financial arrangements he will take on board some of the discrepancies that appear to have occurred with regard to sporting clubs in general <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister know that i too am aware that under the new arrangements the local authority can give discretionary grant <e> <s> however does he agree that it is only a discretionary grant and the local authority if it is very hard put to it may not be able to give any grant at all <e> <s> will the minister ask the secretary of state in the general review of the new financial arrangements to consider the adverse effects that the new financial arrangements are having on sport in general but mainly at this point in time on amateur clubs which may well go out of existence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for giving way as i spoke at some length at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> however the minister must be aware that historically local authorities that dealt with council housing over a long period based most of their rents not on historical costs or replacement costs but on the historical cost of their own housing stock <e> <s> in effect as debt charges started to decline they reduced the necessity to finance properties <e> <s> every tenant benefited by that and the government were not involved <e> <s> why have the government moved away from that position <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for intervening again but my colleague on the front bench lord mcintosh and i mentioned five outer london authorities <e> <s> we can see no reason for their rent increases being so high <e> <s> the minister made the point that it was in the inner london authorities that substantial increases might be needed to cater for deprivation and need <e> <s> however cities such as manchester and leeds which have immense problems have kept close to the guidelines <e> <s> we want to know why the authorities just outside london have applied high increases when we believe that there in no justification for them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i live in greater manchester and that i visited strangeways in the autumn of last year <e> <s> the noble earl is right about the improvements that are in being <e> <s> however while i was there as recently as last autumn the prison was endeavouring to resolve a staffing dispute between the prison department of the home office and the officers of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i normally rise to speak in your lordships house on the question of housing particularly at the lower end of the spectrum and make a plea on its behalf <e> <s> however that subject has been adequately covered by my noble friend lord mcintosh and the noble lord lord pitt and therefore i shall not speak to it today <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that most of the authorities that have been capped are in areas of the country which suffer the greatest deprivation and that apart from education which accounts for just over per cent <e> <s> of local authority spending those local authority departments which spend by far the highest amounts are social services departments which will have to take on board new duties under the terms of the new bill <e> <s> if sufficient funds are not made available we shall see more disabled and mentally ill people discharged onto the streets but it will be the local authorities that will be blamed for that situation instead of the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that to any fair minded person those criteria seem very strange when some labour authorities are spending considerably less than some conservative authorities which are levying considerably higher charges than they are <e> <s> when speaking on the charge capping in another place the secretary of state indicated that he had no doubt that there would be a further parade of bleeding stumps pleading with him on this matter <e> <s> is the minister aware that one of the bleeding stumps that has emerged is the secretary of states own constituency where small businesses are now up in arms because of the serious effect that the present financial arrangements will have on them <e> <s> can we therefore look forward to the secretary of state finding other criteria to get him off the hook in his own constituency <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to speak on this amendment <e> <s> however as a former councillor who was on the health authority representing the people of manchester i take the opposite view to that of the noble lord lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> i became the last deputy chairman of manchester executive council of health <e> <s> as regards accountability to the customer i do not believe that the health service has progressed one iota <e> <s> in fact it has gone in reverse by virtue of what the noble lord who has just spoken has done <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will allow me to ask how he will deal with the situation if there is a serious concern in an area about the performance of the health authority be it district or regional and no one including the secretary of state is concerned <e> <s> i made out a case concerning what was done in yorkshire by a former secretary of state for health <e> <s> there was an almost total lack of confidence in what had taken place <e> <s> in such a situation is the minister saying that the secretary of state whoever he may be shall be deemed to be totally infallible and will do what is right <e> <s> does the minister not understand that where things are going radically wrong the only safety valve is those people who face the ballot box the local authority representatives <e>", "<cs> the minister is missing the point <e> <s> i know that members of parliament are available but they are not available at the same level and because of other committments they do not have the same personal contacts as people who live and operate in the local area <e> <s> the noble lord will have to do a little better than that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the area of tameside in greater manchester where i live only one school has opted out of local authority control <e> <s> that school in audenshaw has received over million in direct <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply and for the help that has already been given which has been greatly appreciated <e> <s> however is the minister not aware that apart from the fact that there was no loss of life this particular area of wales was struck by a calamity of enormous dimensions <e> <s> while the minister has said that the government have applied the bellwin scheme does he accept that the bellwin scheme admirable though it is is in no way sufficient to meet the needs of those affected by such an incident <e> <s> is he aware for example that before the local authority could benefit from the bellwin scheme it had to raise of its own money <e> <s> will the minister ask the secretary of state for wales to try to pump money into the area in order to avoid the need for the local authority to find that <e> <s> will he ask his right honourable friend to make that money available immediately because the need is urgent and great <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify the point that i raised <e> <s> i still do not understand his answer to the second part of my question <e> <s> the county council officer who is dealing with the matter and to whom i spoke said that it was necessary for the council through rates or a precept to raise before it qualifies for the bellwin formula <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> if it is correct will the noble lord waive the requirement given the urgent situation in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the true answer lies in the replies that have quite recently been given by ministers from the dispatch box to the effect that the government no longer consider local authorities as bulk builders of accommodation to let <e> <s> is he aware that the governments target of such properties to be built over the next three years of them in the first months is already falling short <e> <s> if my information is correct that target will be over units short <e> <s> can he say whether it is true that some of the money allocated has more or less been allowed on pawn from the housing corporation which now finds itself in extreme difficulty <e> <s> does he agree that it looks as though the whole programme will literally be off gear and well below what the government intended <e> <s> in view of the urgent need will the government allow local authorities with capital receipts to get on with building this type of housing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back so quickly <e> <s> only a few weeks ago at the dispatch box the noble lord said and other ministers have repeated quite categorically that the government no longer see local authorities as building houses in bulk for letting to people at the bottom end of the social scale <e> <s> is that true or not <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly on a couple of points which have been touched on <e> <s> the minister made great play of the national audit office being something of a watchdog <e> <s> of course it is but it is only able to give views on events that have happened <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham referred to british aerospace and the sale of rover <e> <s> all those who listened to our exchanges at the time of the sale know that things went on which were not in accord with what one could call fair dealing and proper public accountability <e> <s> i understand that the issue has still not been resolved <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i must say i am surprised as perhaps are other noble lords that at this late stage of the bill no real hard discussions have taken place with the mod <e> <s> i should have thought that the department is now in a position to say what it thinks is desirable and undesirable <e> <s> it would be a most peculiar situation if talks were set to take place in the short time which is left indeed we are talking about a matter of weeks in which this bill has completed its passage through both chambers <e>", "<cs> i think that the minister is trying to make a bad case <e> <s> if we consider the history of what this government have done they have in some respects totally rejected the advice of highly qualified professionals at the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> i am not against that <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down i must say that i am puzzled by one of his remarks <e> <s> he said that if the period were extended to three months it may well put the purchaser at a commercial disadvantage compared with other people <e> <s> i cannot recall whether the minister used the word competitor but i assume that that is what he meant <e> <s> how could that happen when the terms regarding purchase and ownership have already been decided <e> <s> i do not relate the two ideas unless the minister is saying that the new owner will lower working conditions for his staff so that he can compete with other people in the future <e> <s> what did the minister mean <e> <s> i cannot relate the two ideas <e> <s> they can have nothing to do with commercial <e>", "<cs> the ministers appear to be nodding their heads so i think the noble lord has got it quite right <e> <s> however having heard the ministers reply to both myself and the noble lord on the liberal benches we should look at what he meant <e> <s> it is mad to try to proceed on this basis <e> <s> it does not augur well for future industrial relations for whoever becomes the owner <e> <s> the whole matter may be in conflict with ec and ilo views <e> <s> however i do not propose to press the amendment tonight although we shall certainly come back to it at a later stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one or two observations on what the minister has said <e> <s> i think he agrees that his comments were somewhat long and involved and they need to be looked at in detail by noble lords and by the people affected before reaching any conclusions on the actual meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords is there an established need for an increase in the number of orthoptists <e> <s> if so do government proposals take that sufficiently into account <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may commence by expressing my appreciation to my <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is it not a fact that if the cost of those days were to be added to the total expenditure it would amount to a significant sum of money <e> <s> will he also agree that if the expenses of the fire service were also included it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one of the local authorities selected for poll tax capping by mr patten is situated in the greater manchester area namely rochdale <e> <s> is he also aware that if the costs involved amount to a substantial amount of money and if that has to be met by local ratepayers it may well result in some of the other nine authorities coming within the criteria for poll tax capping <e> <s> if the government or mr patten were to do that next year does he not consider that that would be grossly unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords as other speakers have said we owe a great debt to the noble lord lord moran for introducing this very topical and important subject <e> <s> i believe that this matter has been brought more sharply to the notice of the average person because of a recent publicity campaign and <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to what the minister had to say in reply <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene briefly at this stage <e> <s> i understand that under the rules of procedure of the house apart from the mover of the amendment no one is supposed to rise in support of it at report stage <e> <s> however i believe that my noble friend lord graham has made the case for the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if the noble baroness lady faithfull and my noble friend lord stallard are correct resources are drawn away from some small organisations which provide a useful service <e> <s> it may well be that shelter and shac will be pleased that they have had their grants trebled <e> <s> set against the appalling situation of the homeless in this country in some respects the minister wants commendation for the fact that the government have increased the grant to million <e> <s> does he not understand that in the overall picture that is a financial pippin <e> <s> does the minister not agree that the government should be pumping in resources to a much greater degree <e> <s> what the government are doing at the moment is quite insufficient to deal with the problem <e>", "<cs> my lords dare i as a mere englishmen who nevertheless has spent a lot of time in club life say that nostalgia has passed the noble lord lord campbell by because clubs are not as he described <e> <s> the clubs that we are talking about are based on the principle of the working mens club where the club belongs to and is completely owned in its entirety by the members <e> <s> in most cases the members consider and look upon the club as an extension of their home <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that his answer does not accord with the housing associations view of the situation <e> <s> is it not a fact that the government brought forward million in january from this years allocation to cover last years expected overspend <e> <s> the effect of that was to cut the target for approvals this year from units to <e> <s> the associations now believe that the figure could be reduced to <e> <s> the government have stated repeatedly that they no longer view councils as builders of houses but only as enablers and that the charity organisations will take their place <e> <s> do the figures not indicate that the government are failing abysmally in what they are trying to do <e>", "<cs> my lords it was predicted that units would be produced in - <e> <s> unless there is a further increase in funding the figure may reduce to over the two years <e> <s> does that not indicate that the situation needs looking into <e> <s> mr splcer the housing minister ought not to continue to reject overtures of the housing associations as he did last week <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the last question bear the truth <e> <s> is is not the case that the housing associations through the housing corporation are ready to meet an expanding need but the government are not prepared to find the money <e>", "<cs> my lords did the minister have a chance last weekend to view the programme on the destruction of the rain forests in guyana and the appalling rapidity with which that is taking place <e> <s> that is a very poor country with hardly any other resources <e> <s> is not an answer that industrialised countries should give considerably more financial aid <e> <s> otherwise they may well be banging their heads on a closed door <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that naturally i welcome the fact that over the past few years the building industry has done rather well <e> <s> is the minister also aware that the predictions of the building industry do not accord with the latter part of his answer <e> <s> they state that only per cent <e> <s> of firms are working at near capacity as against per cent <e> <s> last year and that significant pockets of spare capacity are now appearing in the south-east outside of london <e> <s> however is not the most disturbing fact that private industrial work is <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be brief <e> <s> if as the building industry states there is a substantial cutback in private industrial building does that not augur badly for our future <e> <s> we are now trying to regain our position as a major manufacturing country on the same basis as our contemporaries and business rivals in europe <e> <s> surely the cutback will adversely affect any attempt to correct the balance of payments in manufacturing <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply to the main question referred to the decrease in the infant mortality rate <e> <s> however is she aware that in the central area of manchester and also in other cities the number of deaths of children at birth and below the age of one year is still more than twice the national average with very little sign of improvement <e> <s> when will the government do something about the situation by providing extra resources in this areas for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that there was resistance to this because local authorities in general are becoming increasingly angry it organisations by-passing the local planning authorities by promoting private bills in the other place is well as in your lordships <e> <s> house <e> <s> when shall we end this situation in which the local people literally have no say in such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister care to comment on the statement which was reportedly made by mr wakeham at the weekend that because of nuclear energys contribution to a cleaner environment the nuclear energy industry in this country may be worthy of a second chance <e> <s> if that is so and the government are considering lifting the moratorium that they have placed on the building of nuclear power stations until would it not be a blunder of the worst kind to rush into a programme of decommissioning of nuclear power stations at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord williams for selecting such an important and topical subject for debate <e> <s> i understand that it is a convention of the house not to refer to another noble lord unless one has given him notice <e> <s> however in his opening remarks my noble friend lord williams referred to the time in office of the noble lord lord young of graffham <e> <s> as the debate concerns the department of trade and industry for which until quite recently the noble lord was responsible i thought that he would have done us the courtesy of attending it <e> <s> after all he was responsible for some of the mistakes that were made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a consultants report on safety with regard to building contracts issued before the project started predicted that there was a probability of deaths during the construction of the channel tunnel <e> <s> is it not rather sad that there should have been a death for every mile that has been built from <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for the detailed reply that he has given <e> <s> however will the government take on board suggestions that as the various phases of the building are completed they are put into immediate use in order to create a viable establishment at strangeways <e> <s> will he refer briefly to the part that has been played by the visitors centre which is controlled by the voluntary organisation selcare and which is the only building that has been serviceable for some time <e> <s> does he agree that it has played a tremendous part in supporting the prison authorities and staff during the difficult period that they have experienced and are still experiencing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> will he confirm that he is aware of the governments stated policy of almost removing local authorities from the house building programme <e> <s> his answer to me on the last occasion was that they already had enough stock <e> <s> with reference to the voluntary sector is he aware that this year because of financial problems the housing associations in conjunction with the building people have had to cut their programme from to <e> <s> does he consider that that is progress or progress in reverse <e> <s> does he expect that that will solve the housing problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in his answers the minister has given the impression that the governments house building programme certainly in the voluntary sector has been a success <e> <s> only a few months ago it was expected that the government would start to build houses <e> <s> that figure has now been reduced to <e> <s> as my noble friend lord northfield said the housing associations are asking for more than million of next years money to be brought forward in order to keep up the momentum of the original programme <e> <s> bearing in mind the present high interest charges that must be paid for voluntary sector housing does not that request make sense <e> <s> will the government reverse their present policy to one that makes sense <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave a figure for the increase during the past decade <e> <s> can he indicate how many of those people were involved in manufacturing industries <e> <s> how does he relate what he says to the fact that during the past months an additional jobs were lost in manufacturing industries <e> <s> how many of those people were self-employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to congratulate the noble lord lord wade <e> <s> unfortunately i could not listen to all his maiden speech but i was present for the last few minutes of it and heard enough to realise that a very powerful speaker with wide knowledge of his subject has joined us <e> <s> naturally we hope to hear further from him in the future <e> <s> however he will understand when i say that i found his closing remarks to be a little contentious <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to say to the noble lord lord renton that if he reads the record in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount made such an outrageously partisan speech that a reply is needed <e> <s> when he refers to behaviour the noble viscount appears satisfied that employers should be the people with the thumbscrews and the rack so that they can literally dictate to the trade unions <e> <s> such behaviour results not in negotiation but in imposition <e> <s> the noble viscount may not like what i say <e> <s> however i shall recount some other examples <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount says oh <e> <s> he quoted the president of my union who naturally wanted that job situation for my trade union but he did not achieve it <e> <s> it is very strange that a person who does not win the issue is deemed to have behaved badly <e>", "<cs> my lords i referred to certain members of the party opposite who are well known for such opposition <e> <s> i cast no personal slur on the noble lord <e> <s> i know his views too well <e> <s> i never for one moment thought that he would understand that i was accusing him of such beliefs <e>", "<cs> the minister will know that it is out of order to intervene on an intervention <e>", "<cs> i stand by what i said about the secretary of state <e> <s> i do not withdraw one word of it <e>", "<cs> i was not laughing at the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> there might have been more members of the labour party here if the prime minister had been a little more generous in her allocation of peerages <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> he referred to training <e> <s> a few moments ago the minister claimed that the government had a marvellous record for training and denigrated the last labour governments record on that subject <e> <s> the minister must be aware that engineering is the biggest manufacturing sector of this country <e> <s> is he aware that under this governments proposals we are training only per cent <e> <s> of the number of engineers that we trained under the previous labour government <e> <s> does he not agree that it is peculiar to call that a success when there is a reduction to two-thirds in the number of engineers being trained <e>", "<cs> my lords i should say that was the information that was given to us <e> <s> i accept that as factual information but only the people involved would know whether it was factual information <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware of the report of the health education authority published last week showing that deaths from heart disease in areas such as manchester and leeds are more than double the national average <e> <s> when can those of us who live in those areas expect some government initiative to put the figures in balance by bringing our figures down and not the southern half of the countrys figures up <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that we had the same answer quite recently <e> <s> does he accept that unless additional finance is forthcoming for the housing corporation housing starts in may grind to a complete halt <e> <s> is he also aware that the housing corporation has asked for an advance of million for next year in order to keep the building programme rolling <e> <s> does the minister not agree that that makes sense <e> <s> will he urge his right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place to grant the housing corporations request <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that one of the worst facets of what is now taking place is that because of their financial situation some of the housing associations are having to dispose of land which they bought two or three years ago when prices were at their peak <e> <s> they are now having to sell it in a depressed market at a much lower price thereby further depleting their meagre financial resources <e> <s> will he consider that point to see whether assistance can be given in that direction <e>", "<cs> my lords is the leader of the house aware that some people are concerned when they see former ministers from this chamber and another place taking chairmanships and other high-salaried posts in companies which they helped to privatise in the very recent past <e> <s> does he not understand that people outside do not readily accept that as wholesome conduct <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his reply <e> <s> i recognise that he has a valid point regarding the possibility of people being placed at risk by entering dangerous areas with which they are not familiar <e> <s> before taking the matter further i should like to read what the minister said <e> <s> with the proviso i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what the noble lord lord ross has said <e> <s> the amendments are linked <e> <s> i have no desire to dwell further on the case which the noble lord has made very adequately other than to say that if one goes to areas of entertainment where people gather in the evenings or at weekends and take advantage of the fast food outlets one can see that the local people have to cope with an appalling situation <e> <s> however the people who live near football grounds are lucky because although there may be a mess on saturday night very often the football club will employ people to ensure that the area is cleaned up by sunday morning <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> there is a great deal of merit in what he said and in the way in which he explained the situation <e> <s> i should like to read his remarks and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened in detail to the amendments that the noble lord moved <e> <s> the salient point that he made at the beginning interested me most <e> <s> he referred to consultation <e> <s> i believe that it is a misuse of the word consultation if it merely means saying to people after the change has been <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down he referred to the fact that these amendments refer to the problems of trolleys <e> <s> following his answer to the last series of amendments on this subject does he not realise that some of us do not know whether we are off our trolley or have been run over by one <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that even though there is a downturn at present in the building industry there is still a severe shortage of skilled operatives <e> <s> come the time when the government may be able to lower interest rates and the building industry starts to increase its activity again will it not further exacerbate the problem if there is a growing shortage of skilled operatives <e> <s> in its own interests the nation will need a larger pool of skilled young people going into the trade <e> <s> can the minister take that on board in his general considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords although i go almost all of the way with the remarks made by my noble friend lord mellish about the dedication of social workers is the minister aware that there have been a number of cases where children have met their deaths in the most horrendous way and where inquiries in various forms have been set up which have reached the conclusion that the performance of some senior social workers involved in those cases left much to be desired <e> <s> no action is ever really taken to redress what has taken place and we cannot bring these children back <e> <s> although some people are found wanting in this respect nothing happens to their careers thereafter <e>", "<cs> i rise in support of the amendment because recent history has shown us that when people are not obligated by law to carry out a function they often ignore it <e> <s> one of the greatest sufferers has been the environment for example the wholesale pollution of some of the major rivers of europe is supposed to have happened by accident but i do not believe that <e> <s> the noble lord does us a <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lewis has made a reasonable and positive case for his amendment <e> <s> i have to say with some sadness that ministers keep falling back onto the powers given to the secretary of state and what he can do <e> <s> we know from the past few years and even longer ago that successive secretaries of state have not been models of consistency <e> <s> their approach to subjects can often differ depending on personality <e> <s> i do not want to go into detail at this hour of the night about ministers who have been removed from office for various causes or non-causes by the present prime minister <e>", "<cs> i hope that i am in order in rising at this time <e> <s> my noble friend lady white made the point that i was intending to make <e> <s> my noble friends previous point was a vital one <e> <s> she said that the secretary of state would make the final decision <e> <s> as she and the minister said he has probably got the finest advice in the land but from what the minister says it almost puts the secretary of state in an unchallengeable position <e> <s> when he makes the decision he may choose to discount the advice that he is given <e> <s> it has not been unknown for secretaries of state in a variety of matters to have flown in the face of advice <e> <s> if the press reports are correct we have just had a perfect example of this in what happened to nuclear energy when it appears that a secretary of state totally discounted all the advice given by the experts in that field <e>", "<cs> historically it has always been a fact of life in the united kingdom that there must be some form of appeal in important matters <e> <s> although to laymen like myself these are new frontiers surely there should be some appeal mechanism <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is remiss of me to keep rising at this time of night but the minister is proceeding on the assumption that we start from the base that all those involved in these emissions are goodies till proved baddies <e> <s> the noble lord lord lewis has made a legitimate case <e> <s> whatever walk of life one works in whether it is building engineering the city of london or the legal profession there are people who have made reputations that stand being tested by anybody <e> <s> there are other people involved in those spheres who do not come out so well whichever yardstick one uses <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to delay the committee but i am entitled to ask the minister what he refers to <e>", "<cs> i should like the minister to explain the governments intentions <e> <s> the amendment removed the word inspectors for the definition of those appointed to police the genetic modification regulations <e> <s> is it still intended to conclude an agency agreement with the hse to provide the inspectors <e> <s> currently there are only two inspectors in an establishment of three which means that it is per cent <e> <s> below the full establishment <e> <s> that small number already has to police nearly institutions <e> <s> what are the governments intentions in that regard <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the ministers reply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will understand when i direct my supplementary question to the second half of my question on the order paper <e> <s> is he aware that in an article in last sundays <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i consider the question posed by my noble friend lord jenkins that the nuclear industry has no future is absolute bunk <e> <s> is he aware that i was directing my question to the pursuit of the international not domestic provision of power <e> <s> does he recall that your lordships select committee recently debated this very question <e> <s> it indicated the need for a substantial increase of power in the near future because of the population explosion internationally <e> <s> i am trying to make the point to the government that the moratorium that they placed on the industry until is seriously damaging our nuclear industrys capacity to compete with our main competitor the french <e> <s> will the government consider that issue as a matter of urgency <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that if the suggestion made by the noble lord in his supplementary question that written acceptance should be treated as a contract was written into the law that would stop some of the unfortunate gazumping which mainly affects young first-time buyers <e> <s> does he agree that it might also act as a brake on the undesirable inflationary spiral in house prices which has occurred over the past two or three years <e>", "<cs> i am surprised that the committee seems almost to have got into a situation of debating into which class of the social structure people fit however employed <e> <s> i was disappointed to hear the noble lord lord rochester wholeheartedly agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord on the government benches <e>", "<cs> as the minister made no reference to it does he totally discount the relevance of the remarks made by his noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lord caldecote <e>", "<cs> is the minister not aware that this is not the first time that there have been suggestions that the closed shop should be ended <e> <s> is he not aware that in in this countrys hour of greatest peril winston churchill approached the trade union movement and asked it to waive its historic rights which it did <e> <s> it agreed to dilution within the engineering services and that allowed hundreds of thousands of men and women to be recruited into engineering as semi-skilled people <e> <s> in some cases they became highly skilled without the problem of having to join a trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday in another place the deputy leader of the conservative party announced that part of the national health service and community care act will be placed on ice and postponed <e> <s> as a result what advice have the government given to local authorities about the recruitment of staff for future needs <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that some of the extremely steep increases in the construction of sizewell b have been brought about by the moratorium imposed on the building of a succession of nuclear power stations <e> <s> is it not because of that decision that sizewell has had to carry a far higher proportion of initial research and development costs than would have been the case if the costs had been divided among the new nuclear power stations <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the british thoracic society will be told today by a professor from the university of columbia who specialises in air pollution that internationally asthma attacks and chest infections have almost doubled in the past decade because of the use of fossilised fuels by power stations and emissions from car exhausts <e> <s> will the government bear that in mind in any future energy policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that in a general sense we treat the people involved rather more shabbily than other countries such as australia and america that took part in nuclear tests <e> <s> if that is the case is it not time that we put matters right for the diminishing number of people involved <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the company received less than hours notice that such a search was to be made and that even though the chairman offered total co-operation and to make available any documents that the commission wished to specify it did not specify any documents but made the search an open one which included the perusal of some of the chairmans private belongings <e> <s> is the minister aware that such a search is not what we expect in this country and is totally unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords are the examiners powers restricted to the private sector or do they also have power to investigate government documents on demand <e> <s> if they have that power would it not have saved us all a great deal of trouble if they had investigated the dti papers when the british aerospace deal involving rover group was going through <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministers reply to my noble friend lord mason of barnsley was that we were not talking about the manufacturing industries but the long-term unemployed <e> <s> can the minister tell us what proportion of the long-term unemployed come from the manufacturing industries <e> <s> surely that is important <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of a report which was published yesterday which shows that more than families are now in bed and breakfast accommodation waiting for permanent homes and another are living in self-contained properties rented for a short time from private landlords <e> <s> is the minister aware that those figures indicate a per cent <e> <s> increase in six months in the numbers of such families <e> <s> does he understand that unless there is a tremendous upturn in the provision of low cost rented properties those deplorable figures will continue to rise <e> <s> will the government take note of that position and do more than they are doing at present to reduce those terrible figures <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that but for the governments privatisation programme the project may have gone ahead immediately in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the points made by the noble lord lord jenkin in opposition to the amendment <e> <s> from my experience there would be some logic in what he says if government departments i do not refer only to present government departments were the front runners or innovators of some of the more progressive issues dealing with the environment <e> <s> but sadly they are not <e> <s> from recent experience government appear to be the worst in terms of ignoring legislation that has been passed in another place and in this house when dealing with people out in the sticks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his considered reply <e> <s> perhaps i should say from the outset that i shall not be pressing the amendment to a division <e> <s> further if he thought that i was trying to mislead the house by not giving quite the correct page numbers which refer to local government i should tell him that that was not my intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the amendment <e> <s> however i am not completely satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> having been involved over a number of years with legislation from various governments i have always accepted the principle that unless a provision is included in a bill and declared as such it is not a commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may raise one brief point before the noble baroness sits down <e> <s> one group of people has been of great value in affecting the environment in a beneficial way <e> <s> i am talking about hm alkali inspectorate which perhaps possesses more knowledge on the subject than any other group of professionals <e> <s> i may have caught the minister on the hop on this subject but perhaps she can give an indication whether the inspectorates views will be sought <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> have any further measures been considered to try to ameliorate the appalling suffering among the tens of thousands of mainly women and children in the refugee camps in the countries that adjoin iraq <e> <s> perhaps i may press the minister <e> <s> are any further measures under consideration to try to relieve the suffering of those unfortunate people <e>", "<cs> my lords in a way i am grateful to the minister for the detailed manner in which she has replied <e> <s> i do not intend to press this matter to a vote <e> <s> i believe that the minister and her advisers wish to proceed on the basis that all employers and those involved in manufacture will act responsibly and in accordance with the spirit of the bill <e> <s> history shows that not all manufacturers do that <e> <s> as a young councillor in manchester i worked with the rivers committee of a local authority <e> <s> from the experience that i gained i learned that on many occasions rivers were polluted <e> <s> i do not believe that much accidental polluting takes place <e> <s> people were breaking the law then and they will continue to do so if they can <e> <s> the provision as it is now in the bill will enable them to continue polluting <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the question is about sellafield and that by the introduction of new technologies high-level nuclear waste there has been reduced to one-third of its previous size <e> <s> bnfl should be commended for that step forward in technology instead of people consistently carping about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i and many other people await the governments conclusions with interest especially bearing in mind that the latest figures show that at the present rate of payment local authorities will be owed billion in respect of the non-payment of the unified business rate at the end of the financial year and billion in respect of non-payment of the poll tax mainly by people who wish to pay but who cannot do so and also by a minority who choose not to pay <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords when answering my first question the minister implied that the government were satisfied with the rate of collection <e> <s> the figures that i have show that for the first quarter there was a deficit of billion in the amount expected by local authorities due to the non-payment of the unified business rate <e> <s> the point i was making was that if that goes on for the rest of the year local authorities will be billion in deficit <e> <s> is the minister aware that tens of thousands of small businesses have already been driven into bankruptcy due to their inability to pay the charge <e> <s> that is not because they will not pay it but because they cannot pay it <e> <s> is it the governments intention to drive tens of thousands more small businesses to the wall <e> <s> if it is not will they do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that no chancellor in our history before received the benefits of huge sums of money from completely new sources <e> <s> bearing in mind that those have been received by successive chancellors can the minister tell us why we are in such a serious financial and economic situation <e> <s> where have those huge new financial resources been deployed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to condone any mistake where the cost of that mistake has to be borne by the public purse <e> <s> however could the mistake have been made as a result of the complexity of the legislation which was being implemented <e> <s> as we pointed out during the passage of that legislation in your lordships house it is complicated <e> <s> is it the case that what happened was more the result of a misunderstanding than of a mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to accept from the minister that there was not a mistake <e> <s> however i wonder why the question was raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that answer <e> <s> is he aware that information which i have obtained from the library states that th december is the new date for applications to be registered on the list but that even after that date applications for registration will be received <e> <s> can he say whether the fact that the dates are being opened up in such a way to give open-ended registration has anything to do with the governments dip in the public opinion polls <e>", "<cs> my lords according to the library the information comes from the home office <e> <s> it has been in touch with his department regarding the matter <e> <s> i do not believe that the information is incorrect <e> <s> will the minister accept that perhaps he has got it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords bearing in mind that the waiting period is still quite lengthy for people whose living may be at stake would it not be fair to restore the status quo as soon as the applicant lodges his appeal so that his job is not filled by someone else <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a large number of people will still suffer unnecessarily under the present situation <e> <s> does he agree that the matter ought to be reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend on the front bench indicated i shall speak mostly on the issue of housing <e> <s> however i cannot resist pausing for a moment in order to say something about transport although much has been said today about that as regards both the railways and the roads <e> <s> i travel down to london each week by intercity <e>", "<cs> my lords my point was not disposing of the land but bringing redevelopment to what is now very attractive land used as a public amenity <e> <s> that was the point i was making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving those detailed figures <e> <s> in relation to the public sector is she aware that the figures are probably the lowest within living memory <e> <s> is she also aware that between the early s and the late s local authorities whatever their political control and under whatever government built more than million houses for people within their areas <e> <s> why are the government persisting with a policy of seeing local authorities as enablers and not builders <e> <s> it is clear that the charitable and housing associations cannot fulfil that role and the private rented sector certainly cannot do so <e> <s> will the government now do an about-face and allow the local authorities increased access to more than billion that has been raised from council house sales but withheld in order to let them get on with a rapidly increased building programme to provide the houses that are badly needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister gave many complex figures but the fact is that the governments reports show that the nation needs at least a further million houses for rent by the turn of the century <e> <s> at the present rate of progress announced by the minister there is no possibility of reaching that target by the end of the next century <e> <s> when are we to make a start on eating into the present figures <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> is she aware of the deep concern among the people involved regarding the deterioration in the fabric of many schools in the public sector <e> <s> bearing in mind that the city technology colleges are to receive million in the current financial year for their building programme would it not be fair and just for the local authorities to be allowed to operate under the same system <e> <s> is the minister aware that if that happened it would substantially reduce the number of schools that require their fabric treating which would be to the benefit of all <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in my first question i was attempting to establish the different criteria used for city technology colleges as against local authority education establishments bearing in mind the distribution of government funds <e> <s> i was not speaking of the private sector <e> <s> i was suggesting that if the local authorities were financed in the same way it would go a long way towards helping them reduce the serious and adverse conditions that exist in some schools <e> <s> will the minister plead with the secretary of state for something to be done in that regard <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister say whether the figures that he gave in his first answer include part-time jobs <e> <s> if they do can he say what is the number of part-time jobs <e> <s> does he not agree that the biggest increase in employment is in part-time and not full-time jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> however is he aware that in annual terms that sum of money would amount roughly to billion <e> <s> bearing in mind that our country is now in a rather serious recession by any standards where do the government envisage finding the money to continue to fund such an exercise <e> <s> would they find it at the cost of other social services or would they find it from fresh sources <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister not aware that the shipyard is in an area which has one of the highest unemployment rates in the united kingdom and where there is very little prospect of anything to take its place <e> <s> will he give serious consideration to taking the matter to the new prime minister with the request that was put so well by the right reverend prelate in his question <e>"]
