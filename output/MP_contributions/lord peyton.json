["<cs> my lords i too like the noble lord lord mishcon noted the fact that cakes were not to be permitted <e> <s> i suppose that your lordships can take comfort from the fact that the government are proceeding with care and that they have received some solemn warning about the dreadful consequences that might flow if cake was made available in betting shops <e> <s> i am bound to say however that they are not immediately clear to me and i should be very grateful as i am sure would be the rest of your lordships if my noble friend would be kind enough to explain a little more than he has already explained what dreadful dangers would flow from the selling of cakes in betting shops which would be avoided by the presence or availability of biscuits <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very willing to explain but of course it will prolong my remarks <e> <s> what i am seeking to encourage the government to do now that they are showing their concern for the comfort of those who attend betting shops is to be more concerned with the comfort of those who go to racecourses <e> <s> i am suggesting that that comfort could be materially assisted if for instance racing on a sunday were permitted or took place in the same way as some other sporting functions to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry that we did not have the opportunity of hearing the noble lord lord mishcon on that <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for his advice <e> <s> but i am afraid that the net effect of his advice if he will forgive me for saying so is to prolong my speech which i would not have wished to do <e>"]
