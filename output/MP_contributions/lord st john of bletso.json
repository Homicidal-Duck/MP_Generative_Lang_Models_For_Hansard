introduction <e> <s> i am conscious of the traditions of this house and of the vast experienc and depth of knowledge of all aspects of life represented here <e> <s> although i have spent most of my life in south africa and thus to some degree have been remote from the public debates on defence matters which are of such immediate concern to the countries of the northern hemisphere nevertheless i have no doubt of the importance of the subject we are debating <e>", "<cs> my lords may i join those of your lordships who have followed my noble friend lord russell of liverpool in congratulating him most warmly on a fine maiden speech <e> <s> as a comparatively new boy and one of the youngest members of your lordshipshouse i particularly welcome him <e> <s> he is only the third member of your lordships house to possess an mba degree which makes him an expert in the subject of this debate <e> <s> and when i use the word expert i am not using that old definition <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that unless the international monetary fund and other supranational organisations are seen to observe their own policy guidelines and obligations without practising undue discrimination towards one country it will be impossible to persuade south africa of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the original motivation for boycotting south african sport was that sport was structured on racial gounds and that the government policy prevented integration in sport <e> <s> is the noble lord the minister aware that sport in south africa is now fully autonomous <e> <s> i say that from the point of view that i have spent the last seven years in south africa and have experienced considerable change in sporting policy <e> <s> finally does it not appear that the

noble friend lord spens for introducing this debate on a subject which although it has been extensively debated has seen little constructive change to the fragmented and outdated liquor licensing laws

apologise for being a late entry this evening <e> <s> i should like to mention a few words as i spoke in a similar debate some three years ago when the subject was raised by my late friend lord spens

i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for his answer <e> <s> can he say how the government intend to ensure that the economy remains energy self-sufficient through the s when an energy shortage is widely predicted particularly in the light of the implications for the nuclear industry following the recent soviet disaster <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have stated that the government are at present looking at the revision of the group areas act <e> <s> that is being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i join noble lords and noble baronesses in expressing my deep concern at the current state of emergency the widespread detentions including the detention of trade union leaders and the severe censorship of the

my thanks to the noble lord lord thorneycroft for introducing this most critical and important debate at a most worrisome time <e> <s> it is a time when so much uncertainty and nervousness surrounds our market <e> <s> like the noble lord lord donoughue i had the misfortune of being behind a topicline screen on black monday to evidence the precipitous falls and to look on in sheer horror and trepidation not only as my personal portfolio fell but as the markets collapsed around me <e>", "<cs> there is little that i can add to what has already been said on the subject <e> <s> however i wish to express my support for the amendment <e> <s> there is the anomalous position which was pointed out on second reading that one can drink on a moving boat train or plane for hours a day <e> <s> i merely wish to raise the point which the member for romsey and waterside mentioned in committee in another place that in keeping with the efforts that are being made to encourage tourism especially in the rural areas surely licensees should be given the opportunity to respond to the demands of customers <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who has spent most of his life in south africa i join the noble lord in expressing my grave concern at the retrogressive and repressive measures announced by the south african government in restricting passive and active opponents to their policies <e>", "<cs> my lords will her majestys government bear in mind that consgold is already over per cent <e> <s> south african owned and that it has substantial interests there <e> <s> is there any evidence that consgold has lost business as a result of its south african interests <e>", "<cs> my lords i too wish to join noble lords in thanking the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for introducing todays debate <e> <s> i believe that i am the only one among your lordships who has spent almost all his life in south africa <e> <s> i have spent a total of years there i am now a proud years old <e>", "<cs> my lords i join those of your lordships in thanking the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing the debate this evening and regret that the noble baroness lady nicol could not join us <e> <s> the long list

fine maiden speech <e> <s> i can well appreciate the nerves of one of the younger members making his first speech in your lordships house <e> <s> his expertise in the area of landscape design will i

uncertainties that have arisen in connection with the use of interest rate swaps by local authorities building societies pension funds and non-corporate entities <e> <s> as has also been mentioned the amendment is aimed at bringing the proposed legislation in line with section of the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord ezra for introducing this debate today <e> <s> i should also like to apologise for having arrived a few minutes late <e> <s> i was unaware that the consideration of commons amendments on the companies bill would come to such an abrupt end <e> <s> i was under the impression that it would continue until oclock this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys gracious speech drew attention to the need for her majestys government to <e>", "<cs> my lords i share the concern of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby in regard to the allegations of captain coetzee in south africa <e> <s> is the minister aware that the minister of justice in south africa has initiated a preliminary investigation into this alleged affair <e> <s> findings will be made public by this friday <e> <s> furthermore the state president has indicated his commitment to getting to the root of the affair <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i appreciate his criticism of what has happened in south africa but does he not agree

to be an injection of capital into south africa <e> <s> so far the noble lord has not mentioned any one point in respect of which he has any theory to help alleviate what i was saying about the problem of the future poverty and homelessness in south africa in the years to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak on the broadcasting bill as someone who has lived in africa for many years and was unable to enjoy the many benefits of the british system of television broadcasting <e> <s> when i came to britain the quality of british television was a revelation to me <e> <s> as i have lived here i have found the scope and potential of the new developments in television just as exciting <e>", "<cs> i too support amendment no <e> <s> a which seeks to enhance the recycling powers of the bill <e> <s> i am sure that all members of the committee will be keen to ensure that the emerging recycling capabilities of the private sector have at least as good an opportunity to compete in the tendering processes as do the less environmentally friendly disposal techniques such as tipping <e> <s> currently that is funded entirely from the public purse <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment and i ask the minister to give the committee an assurance that the bill will not allow the long-term and by definition real costs of land filling to be disguised at the competitive tendering stage <e> <s> furthermore will the bill address and cure what the secretary of state recently described as an artificial depression of the real costs of landfill because of the way in which local authorities organise their accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister comment on the practicalities of carrying a hard ecu a soft ecu and sterling and the practicalities of drawing up separate price lists

debate on the broadcasting bill than cross-media ownership <e> <s> after so many speakers and after minutes of discussions have elapsed it is difficult to say something original <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i apologise on behalf of the noble lord lord colwyn who wanted to speak this evening but who was unfortunately unwell and had to leave early <e> <s> the amendment would encourage the sharing of satellite dishes by households <e> <s> it addresses a situation where several different people all of whom want to watch satellite television may want to club together to install one dish which is then linked to all their homes <e> <s> by sharing one dish the proliferation of dishes is limited as one dish per household is not needed <e> <s> they can also share the costs of the shared dish <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to address my remarks this evening to the governments commitment to <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords who have spoken i welcome the bill <e> <s> it can only be described as long overdue <e> <s> as a motorcyclist like the noble viscount lord falkland weather conditions permitting i have not had to endure the continuous frustration of traffic congestion in and around london <e>", "<cs> my lords while most of us oppose the separate development and homeland policy in south africa does the minister agree that when a
