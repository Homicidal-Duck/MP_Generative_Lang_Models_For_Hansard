["<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i ask the noble viscount in considering an improvement in the drafting of his amendment whether he could find a more appropriate word than employer <e> <s> it is not an employer <e> <s> the parties enter into a contract in regard to charges <e> <s> there is not an employer either in the ordinary sense of the word or in the specialised sense which it bears in the building industry <e> <s> if the noble viscount is to redraft his amendment perhaps he could take care of that <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister replies may i say a word on this matter <e> <s> as i understand it we are taking a number of amendments together <e> <s> the purpose of the fasciculus of amendments and new clauses which we are taking is that it adds to the administrative machinery of administering building controls other than by local authorities <e> <s> the danger of it is that it adds unnecessarily to the mechanism of private control thereby prejudicing the chances of success of such private control <e> <s> that may not be a serious disadvantage in the eyes of noble lords opposite who are basically opposed to any system of alternative control and indeed it may be a positive advantage i hope that this is not a cynical observation if they can point to the cumbrous machinery and expense as a justification for retaining the monopoly of control with the local authorities <e> <s> however those who want to see an alternative scheme of control that is the principle of this part of the bill as accepted by parliament are <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down will he be good enough to give consideration to two related points in the proposed regulations <e> <s> can he kindly see whether it is possible to introduce some caution against any cross-subsidisation by local authorities in respect of their charges from other housing services <e> <s> secondly can he ensure that the regulations include a notional element for insurance premium <e> <s> my noble friend will i think appreciate that these two things are requisite if there is not to be an imbalance and possible distortion between the charges by local authorities and those in the private sector controlled scheme to the disadvantage of the latter <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister sits down may i ask whether we may assume from what he says that in default of putting this very sympathetic and well drafted new clause on to the statute book he will at any rate circularise local authorities drawing their attention to the importance of this matter and seeking their assistance in seeing that repairs are executed for these tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start briefly but cordially and sincerely by adding my mite of congratulation to those so fittingly expressed with characteristic felicity of phrase by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> the noble lord lord bottomley was for many years an ornament in the other place as some of us know <e> <s> very soon your lordships will appreciate that their great loss is a great gain to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether the price paid here reflects the principles and criteria of assessment of compensation in english statute law and if there are any divergences therefrom of what they consist <e>"]
