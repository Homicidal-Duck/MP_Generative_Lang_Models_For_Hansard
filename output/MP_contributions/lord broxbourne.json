are not defined <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will know there is a power in this regard where a member state is guilty of persistent violation of the principles and the principles include

it we are taking a number of amendments together <e> <s> the purpose of the fasciculus of amendments and new clauses which we are taking is that it adds to the administrative machinery of administering building controls other than by local authorities <e> <s> the danger of it is that it adds unnecessarily to the mechanism of private control thereby prejudicing the chances of success of such private control <e> <s> that may not be a serious disadvantage in the eyes of noble lords opposite who are basically opposed to any system of alternative control and indeed it may be a positive advantage i hope that this is not a cynical observation if they can point to the cumbrous machinery and expense as a justification for retaining the monopoly of control with the local authorities <e>

private sector controlled scheme to the disadvantage of the latter <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister sits down may i ask whether we may assume from what he says that in default of putting this very sympathetic and well drafted new clause on to the statute book he will at any rate circularise local authorities drawing their attention to the importance of this matter and seeking their assistance in seeing that repairs are executed for these tenants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i start briefly but cordially and sincerely by adding my mite of congratulation to those so fittingly expressed with characteristic felicity of phrase by my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter to the noble lord lord bottomley <e> <s> the noble lord lord bottomley was for many years an ornament in the other place as some of us know <e> <s> very soon your lordships will appreciate that their great loss is a great gain to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords could my noble friend say whether the price paid here reflects the principles and criteria of assessment of compensation in english statute law and if there are any divergences therefrom of what they consist <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment

the motive animating the amendment is concerned i would concede that that no doubt is reasonable <e> <s> in so far as it is animated by a desire to improve our rating system that is something with

lordships who have found it necessary or expedient to understand the amendment and what it seeks to do <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness there is of course an error on the face of the amendment which refers to section <e>", "<cs> i am glad for two reasons that i gave way to the noble lord lord marsh <e> <s> first he made such an interesting contribution and secondly as he may recall when we first met in he was trying to prevent my return to the house of commons <e> <s> having frustrated him in that no doubt laudable undertaking i can at any rate make this small recompense today <e>", "<cs> before we pass from this amendment may i be allowed for a brief moment to put a question to the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i put it as he knows as somebody who over the years has been an enthusiast for parliamentary control which is the objective of his amendment <e> <s> can he tell the committee what was the practice of the governments of which he was a distinguished ornament in this regard during their period of office <e> <s> if the noble lord lord graham should be at all diffident in answering this question and looks for somebody with higher authority to respond to my request we are indeed fortunate and privileged this evening to have among us the noble lord below the gangway who as he knows i hold in the highest regard and respect and have always done so <e> <s> nobody could speak with greater authority on this than he so perhaps he could vouchsafe that information to the committee <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to say anything in this debate at all until i heard the provocative remarks of the noble baroness to the effect that my noble friend the minister had no support or at any rate no vocal support from the benches behind him <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness will take warning from this occurrence as to the unwisdom of throwing out such challenges in that it only takes up more time of the committee by making noble lords make speeches which they had not intended to make and as to which there are those who may think they would have been better left unmade and the noble baroness may be one of them <e> <s> on the other hand my noble friend the minister may be glad to have some testimony however small to the fact that he is not that shrinking isolated figure that the noble baroness seeks to portray <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene for only a brief moment <e> <s> it may be that my noble friend lord mottistone in spite of his enviably equable cheerful and optimistic disposition may be a little disappointed by the reply of his noble friend the minister in this regard <e> <s> this amendment makes a relatively modest suggestion for improving the position of industrial hereditaments <e> <s> i believe it has been common ground in the discussions on this bill to date that industrial hereditaments and industrial ratepayers are in a disadvantaged and somewhat unenviable position at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend appreciate that both the paraphrase of the statutory requirements by the noble baroness and my noble friends correction and supplementation thereof omitted the opening words <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin with an apology to the house in general and to the noble lord lord kennet in particular for having missed the opening of his speech <e> <s> if it was of the same high quality as the rest of his speech <e> <s> i have certainly been punished for my lateness <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of the question from the noble lord on the front bench opposite relating to any possible effect on revaluation and my noble friends reply thereto may i ask whether this does not supply further evidence of the imperative need for an urgent acceleration of the processes of reviewing and

virtues of having an unwritten constitution that almost anything can be said regarding any particular point without its being proved wrong <e>", "<cs> as always the noble lord makes an interesting point in an effective way but if i may respectfully say so nothing that he said in any way answers the point i am making <e> <s> it may be that an unscrupulous government would seek to use as a

persuasive than it normally is when she is good enough to address us <e>", "<cs> i claim no expertise on the political complexion of the common council of the city of london <e> <s> my understanding

the study and preparation of amendments to these complex provisions <e> <s> there is never any need for the noble lord lord mishcon to apologise for any of his contributions to the proceedings in this chamber which so greatly assist your lordships in your various debates <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies to what my noble friend lord selkirk has asked him may i ask him a further question for enlightenment on that matter <e> <s> where in this bill do we find the exact functions of the supervisory committee <e> <s> they have been described as executive <e> <s> the only functions which i with a very imperfect knowledge of the bill find are the functions given in clause and again in clause clause of course being the one on which my noble friend lord selkirk originally raised this point <e> <s> the only functions which the supervisory committee seems to have are to call the administrator before it and cross-examine him so to speak <e> <s> what happens then when it has done that and has the answers to the questions it put to him <e> <s> what flows from that <e> <s> what executive powers in fact does it have and where are they defined <e> <s> i may be the only noble lord in the committee who is unaware of the answer but it is just conceivable that i am not <e>", "<cs> with very great respect that is a reiteration of the power to call the receiver and as it were cross-examine him <e> <s> my question was what is the stage after that <e> <s> what executive supervisory function is the supervisory committee then able to exercise and where is the power specified <e>", "<cs> if one thing is certain it is that the noble and learned lord lord denning certainly requires no assistance or support to convey his authoritative sentiments to the committee <e> <s> however may i respond for one very brief moment to noble lord lord bruce of donington who with his customary generosity extended his invitation not only to the noble and learned lord lord denning but to the lesser noble lords who sit on these benches <e> <s> that is to draw attention to a matter of drafting in the noble lords amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate we are faced with the difficult task of making short speeches on what is a very long report <e> <s> i must say that i am somewhat daunted not to say surprised by the length and weight of the report <e> <s> after all if the commandments could be reduced to verses in the twentieth chapter of exodus and st matthew could record the sermon on the mount in verses in the fifth chapter of his gospel i would be tempted to hope that my greatly respected friend and erstwhile formidable forensic opponent graham eyre could perhaps have managed to compress his report into something less than chapters with a great array of supporting appendices figures and diagrams <e> <s> nevertheless i pay tribute to his monumental work <e> <s> i congratulate him on the clarity cogency and comprehensiveness of his report and i salute

too as he has been good enough to observe have a long-time interest in the construction industry <e> <s> it is not a technical interest of the kind that requires declaration in this house <e> <s> the nearest i get to a financial interest in the construction industry is in the interpretation in a professional capacity of building and civil engineering contracts and the resolution of conflicts arising therefrom <e> <s> i cannot flatter myself that among the favourite bedside reading of your lordships is likely to be <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend the minister sits down would he be good enough to comment on a short point as i do not propose to trouble your lordships with a speech on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords may i now put noble lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for giving way with his characteristic courtesy <e> <s> can he comment on the position of one specific category <e> <s> i refer to the officials serving in the european parliament <e> <s> he may have seen the submission of some of them <e> <s> the noble lord puts his point on the question of liability to taxation <e> <s> has he considered the effect of article of the protocol on the privileges and immunities of the european communities which provides that british officials of the institutions remain resident for tax purposes in this country <e> <s> would it not follow from that that any curtailment or denial of voting rights to them would <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend leaves that point will he be good enough to supplement the point put to him by my noble friend lady elles in regard to the voting rights of officials in community institutions and particularly officials in the european parliament <e> <s> has he had an opportunity as yet to consider the anomaly of non-representation coupled with liability to taxation <e> <s> has he perhaps with the assistance of the assiduous and athletic noble baroness who sits next to him as yet been able to familiarise himself with the protocol to which i ventured to draw attention in the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend amplify that part of his answer to the noble baroness which related to the directives on unfair advertising and doorstep selling <e> <s> does he appreciate i can think of no conceivable reason why he should know but convention forces me to put the question in this form that these directives were under patient and diligent scrutiny six or seven years ago by the legal committee of the european parliament of which i was then a member and indeed chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of the question of the noble lord opposite will ministers continue their support for the work of the national housebuilding council and where possible reinforce it in prescribing suitable standards of house building and construction particularly in view of their new status and responsibilities accorded under recent legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish in a very few moments at this late hour that comforting phrase to one who spent so many years in the late hours and laborious processes of another place to

since the passage of the professions supplementary to medicine act <e> <s> i ask my noble friend to do everything possible and indeed urge his colleagues so to do to assist and promote the praiseworthy efforts of this profession to keep the country on its feet <e>", "<cs> i rise very briefly to re-affirm my support for the proposition contained in this amendment <e> <s> i say re-affirm because on second reading of this bill i made a brief intervention in support of my noble friend lady elles following representations i had received in particular from officials of the european parliament <e>", "<cs> i will not be tempted to indulge in the delights of prophecy as to which of the parties of the two noble lords will be the runner-up in the next election <e> <s> i shall leave that to fate to decide <e> <s> nor would i venture to enter into any kind of dispute between the two noble lords who are very eminent representatives of their respective parties <e> <s> i do not expect to be invited to assume the role of arbitrator even by my former and most distinguished client the noble lord lord mishcon nor in the language of the continental lawyers as an amiable compositor in this dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the constitutional point raised at the end of the questions put by the noble and learned lord opposite will my noble friend confirm that any substitution of majority voting for unanimity would require amendment of the treaty in respect of the articles which call for unanimity and that that would require the appropriate procedures prescribed by the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply relating to the current position may i ask him without tempting providence unduly to go a little further as to future prospects in the matter <e> <s> do ministers remain convinced subject to the uncertainties of the law of the validity of their contention that these goods comply with the specified criteria for zero rating in the directive <e> <s> if that is so having regard to the uncertainties imposed on undertakings as varied as the production of animal feedstuffs and the construction industry will ministers now urge the commission either to come to a satisfactory and speedy settlement or in default to use its powers under article of the treaty and refer the matter forthwith to the european court of justice for a final decision <e>", "<cs> my lords while not wishing to urge on my noble friend the belligerent courses suggested to him by noble lords opposite and without wishing to enter into the complexities of the luxembourg convention would he at any rate make certain that the community commission does refer the matter to the court as soon as possible having regard to the fact that there is a one-sided aspect to this <e> <s> it alone can refer the matter and not a member state under this particular procedure <e>", "<cs> i welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this impressive fasciculus of amendments moved so cogently by the noble baroness <e> <s> i was not successful in making a contribution to the previous debate a deprivation which your lordships will no doubt be able to endure with commendable equanimity <e>", "<cs> my noble friend speaks with the kindness of an old friend <e> <s> had i been able to speak i should have been able to explain with voice as well as subsequently with vote that i am in favour of the principles and objects of this bill but that i have certain reservations about the machinery of it more particularly in the context of town and country planning with which these amendments are concerned <e>", "<cs> further to the point made just now by my noble friend can my noble friend the minister give some indication in his reply of the provenance and status of the term strategic guidance <e> <s> i do not recall it in planning or local government law and certainly a strategic authority is not a term of art in local government or planning law <e> <s> if any of your lordships from the inexhaustible quarry of your collective wisdom can show some precedent or place in which this term has been used in a statute i shall of course unhesitatingly accept it but it would be interesting to know because it is unusual to say the least as my noble friend has just indicated to incorporate into a statute novel words without any definition of their status or what they are supposed to mean <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that the obscurity and complexity of the rent acts lead to a frustration in regard to lettings and not only in this particular context <e> <s> does he recall the words of an eminent lawyer and parliamentarian that anybody is very lucky if he is ever right about anything on the rent acts <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being unfashionable but i hope not divisive perhaps i may strike a somewhat more sympathetic note in regard to these amendments than my noble friends have been able to <e> <s> at an earlier stage of the proceedings on this bill i testified to my belief in the importance of what <e>", "<cs> my lords may i offer my respectful congratulations on the speed with which action has been taken on the directive on product liability which was under active consideration in the legal committee of the european parliament only seven or eight years ago <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to take up any of your lordships time on a dissertation on the merits of these amendments though for the avoidance of doubt if this is pressed and my noble friend the minister advises its rejection i shall support him in that regard <e> <s> i rise only on a point of construction <e> <s> my noble friend lord peyton in a characteristically lucid and felicitous speech said that the words take into account the views might be interpreted as putting an obligation of acceptance upon the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged to the noble lord for his characteristic courtesy <e> <s> can my noble friend the minister confirm that however desirable such a step may be in principle it does not fit into the mechanism of the ec as at present constituted <e> <s> will it not require amendment of the treaty under article with its prescribed procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm that the very lengthy gestatory processes of this directive which were referred to by the noble baroness opposite do not make it a case of <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister re-affirm the governments support for the good work done by the national house building council in prescribing and enforcing good standards of construction in the building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords the concept of european union belongs to that considerable category of concepts which as generalisations win universal assent and acclaim only to encounter difference and disagreement when practical effect is sought to be given to them <e> <s> i think that today we must concentrate on the practicalities of this matter and that to some extent means a dichotomic debate on the one hand spinelli on the other other and perhaps more practical approaches <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the congratulations to my noble friend on her well-deserved promotion <e> <s> i should like to ask her whether she would not agree that on a matter so vital to the health and <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if cases arising from the alleged contravention of those rights which we are very properly committed to respect by reason of our treaty adherence to the european convention on human rights could be heard at first instance by our own judges in our own courts <e> <s> if in the event legislation to achieve this end is initiated in the forthcoming session can reliance be placed on the support of the noble earl and his distinguished colleagues on the front bench <e> <s> i say nothing specifically in regard to the noble and learned lord on the woolsack because i apprehend that for him no special exhortation is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the supplementary question asked by the noble viscount lord hanworth is it right that this contract was entered into under the institution of civil engineers conditions of contract and will the arbitration provisions of that contract be followed if need be in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to provide protection in the courts of the united kingdom for the rights and freedoms specified in the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms to which the united kingdom is a party <e> <s> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the previous supplementary question is my noble friend the minister familiar with i am sure he is the pathway employment service operated by mencap to bring into open employment persons suffering from mental handicap <e> <s> does he appreciate that a measure of success has already been achieved <e> <s> will he lend his powerful and prominent assistance to these worthy endeavours <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the unkind things said about the various organs in the supplementary questions will my noble friend confirm without prejudice to the review that in its nearly years of existence the restrictive practices court has functioned well and has wholly justified the intitiative of those who put the legislation on the statute book in the act <e>", "<cs> my lords after two such admirable consecutive speeches from noble baronesses it now falls to me however inadequately to implement the principle of non-sex-discrimination <e> <s> i feel privileged to take part in this debate which has been characterised by so many interesting and informative speeches <e> <s> i should like to start by congratulating my noble friend lord mottistone on his initiative in bringing this matter before the house in such an interesting way <e> <s> i should like to thank him also for the speech in which he propounded it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords that naturally was a disappointing wind-up by my noble friend the minister <e> <s> perhaps in the calm of the christmas recess he would like to think about this i was going to say a little more clearly but i mean closely a little more closely so that he can see the merits of this proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords the matter under discussion today is difficult delicate and in a sense distasteful <e> <s> nevertheless i feel impelled to intervene in what i hope will be only a short speech because i am conscious that i necessarily took up a good deal of your lordships time yesterday and i would not want to trespass on your good nature and tolerance <e> <s> but i hope that when my noble friend comes to reply we shall have a more positive approach from the government than we have yet had on this difficult matter <e>", "<cs> ah <e> <s> the noble earl intervenes <e>", "<cs> my lords in the more than half a century that i have had the benefit of the noble earls friendship since the days when i was trying to learn at christ church and he was a distinguished don i heard him say many wise things but not this and not tonight <e>", "<cs> i rise only briefly to express reluctant disappointment at the speech of the noble lord who moved the amendment <e> <s> i hasten to add that i feel no disappointment about the quality and style and delivery of his speech <e> <s> as usual it was felicitous and acceptable to your lordships <e> <s> my disappointment was with the content <e> <s> the noble lord spoke for nearly minutes <e> <s> he expressed the good intentions that lay behind the amendment <e> <s> no one doubts his good intentions <e> <s> equally he will be aware of the dangers and proverbial destination of good intentions <e> <s> what he did not tell your lordships was how the machinery proposed in the amendment was to be given effect to <e>", "<cs> if

committee which i should otherwise have been attending <e> <s> i am so sorry <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend leaves that point will he accept that certainly in another place whatever the strength of the whipping it is always understood that on matters of conscience members follow their view <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether the standard forms of contract are in use for these purposes and in particular whether the ice conditions of contract are used <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the very proper concern felt by my noble friend the minister in respect of this very important matter but i should like to ask him whether he does not agree that the best guarantee against avoidable delay is the ability industry experience and good judgment of sir frank layfield who fortunately for all accepted the arduous task of presiding over this important and difficult inquiry <e> <s> does my noble friend the minister not further agree that the report of an inquiry that with its days of hearing- days longer than the stansted inquiry is unique in length in technical complexity and in the range and variety of scientific analysis and evidence requires the highest common factor of accuracy authority and expedition <e> <s> cannot sir frank be confidently relied upon to produce the desired result <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend appreciate that the history of this case illustrates the slow and unsatisfactory working of the current machinery for the resolution of human rights issues <e> <s> does the noble earl recall and i am sure that delving into the inexhaustible quarry of his knowledge he does that it was when mrs campbell and mrs cosans submitted their complaints when the commission reported when the european court pronounced judgment <e> <s> and the matter is still outstanding <e> <s> is this not clear and convincing evidence of the need to provide judicial remedies in the courts of the united kingdom <e> <s> will ministers now review revise and rationalise their hitherto disappointingly negative approach to the human rights and fundamental freedoms bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this committee <e>", "<cs> my lords in regard to the suggestion of the noble lord lord stoddart as to the procedure in the other place and his suggestion that that puts this house at a disadvantage does my noble friend appreciate that the first three of the four possible methods canvassed by the noble lord seem on the face of it to be inappropriate and the fourth could be applied only by leave of mr speaker and that only very sparingly and on rare occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his characteristic courtesy <e> <s> does not my noble friend the minister consider that with the increasing old age and short sight in the community much confusion could be avoided and time economised by the introduction of a reform of the coinage suggested with his characteristic public spirit by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> this is particularly in relation to those tiresome small coins the piece the p piece and the p piece which cause great difficulty to those afflicted with one or other or <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me i would rather he described it in the terms of the long title and the memorandum as a bill to bring within the jurisdiction of the british courts matters of human rights and fundamental freedoms <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the point raised by the noble lord lord somers will my noble friend perhaps when his attention can be spared from loftier concerns give some consideration to the temperature of the writing room of this house <e> <s> can something be done about that so as to alleviate the distresss and discomfort involved and possibly even increase the efficiency of those under-privileged members of this house who have no personal accommodation of their own <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper

noble and learned friend the minister comes to reply can he amplify that which was said in reply to the point that was made so cogently and succinctly by my noble friend lord mottistone <e> <s> he argued that the matter should be looked at in the round and having regard to all relevant statutory provisions whether or not they were specified <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord resumes may i ask

constitutional position as expounded just now by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that while these questions of nomenclature are very fascinating it is perhaps a case of a rose by any other name <e> <s> is it not a clear fact that the services rendered are valuable <e> <s> would it perhaps help this house if some well-intentioned noble lord were to put down a question for written answer to enable my noble friend to identify more specifically the duties and functions attaching thereto <e>", "<cs> i rise only for a moment to express some surprise at the misapprehension under which the noble lord lord underhill laboured as to the effect of this amendment <e> <s> i should have thought and respectfully submit that the drafting of the amendment is admirably clear <e> <s> it is an amendment designed as my noble friend has said not to lay an additional burden on local authorities but to impose a perfectly reasonable obligation on bodies receiving moneys out of the public purse <e> <s> in so far as such bodies have nothing to hide then they have no reason to be apprehensive of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i did not hear the intervention of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> perhaps it was as well <e>", "<cs> in those i shall not say happier but more lucrative days when the noble and learned lord and i used to have exchanges in another

way <e>", "<cs> in reference to the point made by the noble and learned lord lord denning as to the -year period having existed since the copyright act has my noble friend the minister any information for the committee as to the relationship in the expectation of life as between and today <e>", "<cs> unlike the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead and with qualifications the noble and learned lord lord denning i find the words of these subsections both intelligible and helpful <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead has been conscripted by the chief patronage secretary <e> <s> no doubt we can await with pleasure his coming to join us on these benches and then we shall be able to echo the words of virgil <e>", "<cs> may i just as a footnote come to the question raised by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> the answer was given by the noble and learned lord lord denning who was right as always <e> <s> the provision is clause of this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a poor return for the kindness of the house in attending this debate and listening to my opening speech if i took more than two minutes to express my thanks <e> <s> but equally it would be a poor return if i did not take those two minutes for that purpose <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to differ from the noble and learned lord lord denning to whom i in common with most noble lords always listen with great respect <e> <s> but i rise to support the amendment so eloquently and persuasively moved by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i hope that i do not observe a twinge of pain or apprehension across his features when i make that announcement <e> <s> perhaps he is trying to recall the words of virgil <e>", "<cs> it is a far cry from the days when the noble lord used to honour me occasionally with his instructions in a professional capacity <e>", "<cs> i shall express a few short words of sympathy for the amendment <e> <s> i should like to make it clear that that sympathy is not evoked by the characteristically over generous comments about myself made by the noble lord who is himself such a great expert on all building and construction matters <e>", "<cs> not unnaturally i am bound to confess some disappointment with my noble friends response <e> <s> he says that this provision would create complications and raise difficult matters for the courts to decide <e> <s> in addition to being a distinguished minister my noble friend is i believe a chartered surveyor <e> <s> he has the edge on me <e> <s> although i also am a chartered surveyor i am only an honorary one and i understand that he is a practising one <e> <s> surely he knows that in arbitrations in the official referees court matters of this kind are being canvassed and decided every day <e> <s> his argument is not a valid one <e> <s> i see noble and learned lords on the cross-benches who know far more about these matters than either my noble friend or i will ever do <e> <s> they would recognise the truth of that proposition <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for the courtesy of his reply <e> <s> however does he appreciate that i cannot greet its content with unqualified rapture <e> <s> is it not illogical to insist on personal service on the taxpayer when the inspector knows that he can act only as a courier or post office <e> <s> would it not be more logical to amend the law so that these matters can be dealt with directly and <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend undertake to ensure that if a request is made to the inspector as suggested in his answer to the supplementary question from the noble lord opposite the inspector will not reply that he is inhibited from so doing by the statutory obligation placed on him by the income tax act <e>", "<cs> my lords by way of reinforcing exhortation with example will my noble friend kindly urge the authorities which direct the administration of this house to reduce the number of ashtrays which are so liberally displayed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend means private bills <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in spite of the undoubted legal expertise of her majestys ministers this question is not properly addressed to them <e> <s> does not article b of the treaty of rome preserve the right of interpreting the validity of the articles of the treaty to the european court of justice and would it not be better for the noble baroness to address herself to that authoritative source

needed to be a firm logistical infrastructure for this concept <e> <s> my noble friend is too enviably youthful to recall these matters at first hand but will he accept the importance of the points so persuasively brought to the attention of your lordships by my noble friend lord mottistone and reiterate the governments intention to give this logistical support to after-care <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by expressing my apologies to the noble lord lord willis <e> <s> i did not observe him rising and i hope that he will acquit me of any discourtesy <e>", "<cs> i rise at this moment only to make a very brief intervention in order to clarify the position as regards amendment no <e> <s> which is standing in my name on the marshalled list <e> <s> my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls was obviously surprised when i indicated that this amendment was not being moved <e> <s> i could not fail but to note the puzzled expression which momentarily clouded his distinguished features <e> <s> i hasten to reassure him and the committee in general that this does not indicate any change of heart on my part <e> <s> i do not resile at all from the sentiments conveyed in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is purely a matter of form and drafting <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> follows precisely the wording of the amendment moved in the other place by my respected friend anthony steen <e> <s> it was drawn to my attention by the minister and his ever helpful expert <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope that we can interpret his declaration of neutrality as benevolent neutrality <e> <s> in that confident expectation i commend the amendments to the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much obliged to the noble lord for his characteristic courtesy <e> <s> will my noble friend confirm that any such proposal would require unanimity and that therefore if as is much to be hoped the government stand firm in their opposition to this proposal it would be a case of <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from the previous questions and the answers thereto will my noble friend with his customary cogency and modesty make it clear that it is for the courts and not for ministers to interpret the statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that whatever the importance of the reopening of stations there is a prior importance in the clearing up and improvement of existing stations of which the nearby victoria station is a notorious example <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend able to assist noble lords of whom i am one who have no close familiarity with these idiosyncratic matters by defining the terms of reference and composition of the committee of experts and saying what jurisdiction they have to pronounce upon the statute law of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down i wonder whether the characteristically constructive suggestion from the noble baroness lady seear that if this amendment were withdrawn the minister might undertake to give sympathetic consideration to an amendment at third reading substituting years for five would meet the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise briefly to support the amendment moved with characteristic clarity and authority by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who as the house knows is the distinguished president of mencap <e> <s> therefore there is little that i as a very undistinguished vice president of that organisation can or should seek to add <e> <s> in the circumstances i am in the happy position to which metellus cimber in shakespeares <e>", "<cs> my lords yes a previous president <e> <s> i take it that the noble lord was not going to query my tribute to the noble lord lord renton because i am sure he would warmly associate himself with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i make my brief intervention only because i have in that capacity received representations and it is perhaps appropriate that i record my support for the amendment <e> <s> i am not at all critical of ministers in making these submissions <e> <s> i fully acknowledge their good intentions and as i hope a good friend i seek only to help them avoid the proverbial dangers and destinations of good intentions <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the reference in the statement to the single european act could my noble friend tell the house whether consideration was given at the summit to the effect and implications of article a of that act <e> <s> the article substitutes a so-called new co-operation procedure for important matters hitherto requiring unanimity under article of the ec treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will study the procedure under article a of the single european act he will see that it substitutes a so-called co-operation procedure which does away with the requirement of unanimity in important matters affecting the national interest <e>", "<cs> my lords while the minister will deserve and no doubt receive the congratulations of the house on his statement can he say whether the special needs of mental health and mental handicap have been taken into account because whatever the progress with community care there will always be a substantial residual need for hospital accommodation <e>", "<cs> my lords as one who had the privilege of following aneurin bevan in another place in the debate to celebrate the th anniversary of the national health service may i respectfully associate myself with the congratulations expressed by the noble lord lord ennals on the work of the health service and hope that we can now as then keep these matters free from political controversy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to record my support for the amendment <e> <s> the statistics of the matter are complex but the principle is clear <e> <s> i should like to respond to the request i have received from mencap and to testify to my support <e>", "<cs> i have listened with some sympathy to the expos of the noble lord lord mcintosh delivered with his characteristic lucidity and skill <e> <s> i want just to query whether the drafting of amendment no <e> <s> is correct <e> <s> if i read it aright it would leave clause as reading does acts the amendment leaves out -calculated to <e>", "<cs> i believe that the committee will be disposed to give the noble lord the benefit of the doubt <e> <s> he need not plead as a serious matter of mitigation that he is not a lawyer <e> <s> indeed there are some who would think that that is a matter of congratulation rather than commiseration <e> <s> no doubt the ingenious parliamentary draftsmen will scrutinise the matter with the care that it deserves and the expertise that they possess <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that there were better simpler and more acceptable ways of meeting the point <e>", "<cs> in this year of the tercentenary does not the noble lord recall the cromwellian injunction to the rump parliament <e> <s> it was <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that whatever the advantages or disadvantages and there are both of the important suggestion made by the noble lord opposite with all his authority and experience in these matters it would entail basic amendment to the town and country planning acts in which the grant or otherwise of planning permission is made dependent on the development plan and other material considerations in which land ownership is not specified <e>", "<cs> my lords has not the noble lord lord ezra got it wrong on this occasion which is unusual for him with his distinction in this and other fields <e> <s> does not the environmental policy as recently stated so eloquently by the prime minister represent not a change but a reaffirmation and re-emphasis of what has been traditional conservative policy since disraelis government introduced the public health act <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he help the house in one respect on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the noble lord opposite did not give any indication of what the tests are which are referred to in section of the income and corporation taxes act <e> <s> no doubt he thought that they were indelibly stamped on the minds of every noble lord <e> <s> i must confess that in that case i am an exception <e> <s> i would welcome a little guidance and instruction as to the broad effect of these esoteric provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> while i understand

"<cs> my lords your lordships will notice that we have the advantage of a mass of expert evidence much of it oral and therefore subject to the salutory process of cross-examination <e> <s> there is an impressive list at appendix of the witnesses and those they represented <e> <s> appendix has an intriguing glossary of acronyms as they are called <e> <s> some of the abbreviations in that glossary will be familiar others less so <e> <s> indeed they might be suitable for parlour <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his characteristic courtesy <e> <s> does he recall that in my opening remarks i said that the principle has to be applied only to use the correct article as the legal base <e> <s> but i also said that although the principle is there in practice we would not be disadvantaged <e>", "<cs> my lords in case i notice a flicker of apprehension upon the brows of noble lords i shall instantly make it clear that i have no intention of making another speech <e> <s> it would be an imposition upon noble lords as i have already spoken in a little detail in introducing the report <e> <s> equally however i think it would be inappropriate and ungrateful if i did not just in a sentence or two record my appreciation of the debate and of the speeches of the noble lords who have contributed so persuasively and eloquently to it <e>", "<cs> my lords on this delicate subject
