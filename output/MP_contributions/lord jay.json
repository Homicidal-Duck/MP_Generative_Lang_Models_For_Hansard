["<cs> my lords i should like to thank the house for the warm reception that is much needed by any maiden speaker <e> <s> it is indeed rather unnerving in any debate to follow an ex-chancellor of the exchequer an ex-governor of the bank of england and a still surviving secretary of state who did his best to cheer us up this afternoon <e> <s> i can claim perhaps one experience that none of them has had <e> <s> i started my working life on th october the first day of the great wall street crash <e> <s> that memory gives one a feeling of having been here before <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend lord sefton that this is a valuable report <e> <s> its statistical precision should not be taken too seriously however since i fear that the economic future cannot be measured to one decimal point <e> <s> its conclusions as the authors of course realise must depend on all kinds of assumptions about external sources such as the price of oil and the liberation of the united kingdom from the common agricultural policy and above all the policies of united kingdom governments <e> <s> for instance the authors assume gloomily that oil will cost dollars a barrel in the year and even more gloomily that present government policies will be continued into the s <e> <s> on the latter assumption they are probably right in concluding that despite all the investment going on and the excellent projects such as those eloquently retailed by the noble lord lord goold they predict and i am afraid they are right to do so that national unemployment will remain at over million until and that the nation will suffer an acute worsening of what they call the north-south divide in those years <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the manpower cuts forced on london transport by the government have in recent weeks caused increasing congestion delay <e>", "<cs> my lords if as one reads there is so much revenue available to allow for large tax reductions why cannot some money be found for the acute needs of the health services <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support strongly but briefly the quest of my noble friend lord dean for real action to achieve a result in the present homeless situation <e> <s> over the past two years the volume of homelessness in the home counties has increased by over per cent <e> <s> it is now far worse than in and it is continually worsening <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to support the noble baroness who has just spoken and to ask the minister whether he can assure us that he is not doing anything in this legislation to discourage local authorities giving preference in appropriate cases to local labour <e> <s> he will remember that the secretary of state for trade and industry has published a white paper of which he is very proud <e> <s> on page of that white paper he refers to the task forces which my noble friend has just mentioned <e> <s> he tells us that the nature of these task forces in inner cities is to <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down can he answer my question <e> <s> does what he has just said about local labour conform with the secretary of states statement in the white paper that special attention sould be given by taskforces to the employment of local labour <e>", "<cs> my lords though i do not wholly agree with the noble lord lord rees in all that he said this evening i congratulate him all the more warmly because in another place i often enjoyed his financial expertise and indeed agility of mind <e> <s> i hope they bloom merrily here too <e>", "<cs> my lords what i actually said was that i thought we ought to remove the barriers to trade which were preventing us from importing foodstuffs from all the countries of the world best able to supply us <e>", "<cs> my lords does the ministers answer mean that the actions of the agencies employees will be subject to parliamentary questions in both houses in the same way as the actions of civil servants are now <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i shall be in order in warmly congratulating both maiden speakers today having myself shared a distant academic past with the noble lord lord joseph and some less-distant years in the newspaper industry with the noble lord lord stevens <e> <s> i believe that both of us shared the joys and the sorrows of open competition in that industry <e> <s> i am sure that they both have a point of view which deserves to be heard again in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords has the secretary of state noticed that so far as concerns imports far from a decline it is precisely the huge increase in manufactured imports which is pushing us into deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that london transport underground services still show all the signs of being acutely under-staffed and as the government are enforcing financial targets on the authority do they still refuse to accept any responsibility for the inconvenience forced on the public <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be even more desirable if the huge food stocks could be made available to the ordinary public in the ec at the price at which the commission is now selling them to the soviet union <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for those figures <e> <s> do they not mean that far from a firm limit having been set and financial discipline imposed on the common agricultural policy expenditure will now increase further as well as the liability on the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be very unfortunate when unemployment in the northern regions still stands at per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or more and when there is an unsatisfied demand for factories in the region that the government should do anything to cut the finance available for factory building to this authority which has always been the chosen henchman for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we need both the private and the public sector here <e> <s> can we assume that from now on the government will provide english industrial estates with financial resources equal to those provided in the past five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give my reasons for having placed the instruction that stands in my name <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments view that when unemployment goes down it is due to the government but that when it goes up it is not due to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it the governments view that when unemployment goes down it is due to the government but that when it goes up it is not due to the government <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the finance bill is no precedent <e> <s> the finance bill is covered by the provisional collection of taxes act and has no relevance to expenditure of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully agree with the right reverend prelate that we are faced with a deterioration of public transport in many areas <e> <s> perhaps i may return for a moment from manchester to london <e> <s> it is my experience that london transports underground services in the past few months have been more seriously disrupted by delays congestion and breakdowns than at any time previously even during the war years <e> <s> gaps between trains prolonged waits particularly on the circle and northern lines have made it impossible to predict journey times to an extent which was unknown before the government took over london transport from the glc <e>", "<cs> my lords is the secretary of state not able to give us the figure he proposes for the present year <e> <s> if the reports we read are correct does this lavish spending on advertising and publicity by his department mean that he is now a convert to the view that the best way to solve problems is to throw public money at them <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may try to give some assistance to the minister <e> <s> i understand that he is now saying that the core subjects are themselves foundation subjects <e> <s> if that is so would it not be better to amend clause to say that there are two kinds of foundation subjects first the core subjects and secondly the other foundation subjects <e> <s> none of the misunderstandings which have arisen tonight would then arise in the minds of any intelligent reader of the clause <e> <s> as it is the clause is muddled and hurried <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that those noble lords who have supported the bill this afternoon have spent a good deal more time pointing out imperfections in the existing rating system than in making a case for the bill <e> <s> it is of course one thing to point to the undoubted flaws in the present system it is quite different to make a convincing case for the proposals now before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords what good reason can there be for preventing local authorities spending if they wish all their capital receipts on building new houses to rent which everyone agrees are acutely needed <e>", "<cs> the ministers reply on this amendment seems to me extraordinary indeed almost incredible <e> <s> here we are talking of a number of homes and of people who are almost destitute <e> <s> incidentally let us remember that the great increase in homelessness that has come about in the last few years has arisen largely because of the governments own housing policy <e> <s> therefore they must accept a special responsibility in this case <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord permit me to intervene <e> <s> i have read schedule <e> <s> it may be my fault for not being a sufficiently trained lawyer but i cannot find any reference either to per cent <e> <s> or to per cent <e> <s> in that schedule <e> <s> since so much of the governments argument for the bill rests on this i think that we ought to know where it can be found <e>", "<cs> so the noble lord is telling us that this rebate on which the whole case for the bill on second reading and in the debate this afternoon rested is not in the bill at all but will perhaps we do not yet know appear in some order to be made at some later unspecified date <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> i am merely saying that clear words in an act of parliament are one thing but the promise from a minister to introduce an order at some future date although it may be fulfilled in practice is quite different <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to emphasise one point <e> <s> as i understand the law until now the charities which organise these services have been charities exempt from tax <e> <s> if they own property by dint of that exemption they are not liable to make any payment by way of rates to local authorities <e> <s> the volunteers giving these services will in many cases be unable to pay <e> <s> they will either have to abandon the service altogether which will be a great loss or alternatively the charity will have to provide them with the money in order to pay the community charge <e> <s> in that case the government will in effect be taxing charities which has been contrary to all practice and law and to the policy of all governments until now <e> <s> we shall reach the point when as a result of this community charge the government will be introducing the principle of taxing charities by the back door <e> <s> surely they do not wish to do that <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister can clarify one point <e> <s> as i understand it he has offered two concessions first that a code of practice should be established at a later date and secondly that certain information relating to employment shall be as he called it off limits for the purposes of the register <e> <s> as this is a crucial matter of civil liberties can the minister tell us whether these changes will be included as amendments in the bill or whether parliament is simply asked to take it on trust that by some administrative method the government will carry out those changes at some future date <e> <s> is it not desirable that they should be clearly embodied in the bill <e>", "<cs> the minister has not told us about the code of practice and how it is to acquire legal force <e> <s> is it to acquire legal force and if so how if it is not to be embodied in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter seems to be arguing that we should have no anti-tax evasion provisions at all because such provisions would have an implied grave reflection on the moral conduct of our fellow citizens <e> <s> i hardly think that he wishes to push matters as far as that <e> <s> his main argument seems to rest on a mistaken view of what has been argued from other parts of the committee <e> <s> he says that it is very wrong and deplorable that someone should say that he wishes to exercise his vote and thereby reflect the policy of local authorities and at the same time not contribute to their expense <e>", "<cs> i think that if the noble lord thinks that he did not really listen to what i was saying <e> <s> i said that it was not a moral reflection on large numbers of our fellow citizens to say that we should make our tax system proof against evasion <e> <s> i should have thought that most of us would agree with that <e> <s> however i do not think that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has answered the point that some people might be driven by this provision to relinquish their right to vote <e> <s> that would be a highly undesirable development <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister could tell us whether price waterhouse is telling the truth in saying as i understand it that two draft reports were delivered to the department in may <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that i was most encouraged to find that the bank of england reduced interest rates on the day after i put down this question <e> <s> i was rather less encouraged when a week or so later it put them all up again <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that if both interest rates and exchange rates stay for too long at recent levels there is a real risk of unemployment beginning to rise again before the end of the year <e>", "<cs> it seems to some of us at any rate that the more we hear about this tax the more extraordinary it appears <e> <s> i should like to ask the minister to elucidate one point further <e> <s> he has explained that the liability to pay in this case will not fall on the non-earning partner of any couple that is to say it will not fall on somebody who has no income <e> <s> how exactly will the local authority know whether all these individuals whether or not wives have an income <e> <s> with the rating system up to now all the local authority needed to know was the value of the property <e> <s> it did not have to inquire into everybodys income <e> <s> we are now apparently being told that the local authority will have to know the incomes of at any rate a very large number of people resident in its area <e> <s> is it to get these from the inland revenue or is it to have some rival system of assessing peoples incomes which may not be the same as that of the inland revenue <e> <s> i am sure that there is an answer to this and some of us would like to know what it is <e>", "<cs> it does not seem to me that the minister has answered my question <e> <s> i asked how the local authority would ascertain the income of every person <e> <s> the whole of his recent speech was dependent upon the assumption that the local authority knew who was in receipt of income and who was not <e> <s> we have still not been told about the way in which local authorities will gather such information <e> <s> after all it is a vast operation to discover everyones income <e>", "<cs> in fairness to the minister i think we have made some progress <e> <s> as i understand it we have established that the local authority has no information about income of any of these people <e>", "<cs> in the case of the village shop should we not also take into account the fact that in the common case of a village shop run by a husband and wife who live on the premises when the bill becomes law they will presumably by paying not merely the non-domestic rate but also the ordinary domestic rate the poll tax as it is commonly called in each case <e> <s> that will be an additional tax in their case <e> <s> as a result of the bill they will have to pay both imposts <e> <s> surely that is something that should be taken into account when we consider the case of the village shop <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the minister has answered the question raised by the noble lord lord carr of hadley at the beginning of the debate <e> <s> he said that in order for westminster city council which is unusual but not unique to carry on a spending level at a point agreed by the government it must either double the domestic rate or make reductions in expenditure below the level of approximately per cent <e> <s> if not more <e>", "<cs> it did not appear to me either that the minister answered the points put to him by his noble friend lord rippon <e> <s> if i understood him correctly the noble lord lord rippon argued that rate capping in this case would limit the independence of local authorities and therefore would reduce the force of the argument about the accountability which is supposed to be included in this system <e> <s> as he said accountability means many things to different people <e> <s> what it is presumably intended to mean in the argument in support of the bill is the influence of the elector in electing a local authority and controlling or at least influencing the level of expenditure by that authority <e>", "<cs> that may be so but it does not alter the fact that in future per cent <e> <s> plus per cent <e> <s> will amount to per cent <e>", "<cs> it does not seem to me that the minister has answered fully the points which have been made in earlier speeches <e> <s> i noticed that the minister said that there would be no restrictions on foreign ownership <e> <s> i think that those were his words <e> <s> the noble lord lord grimond quite rightly said that the steel industry has not merely commercial implications but also social implications <e> <s> beyond that it has very considerable defence implications <e> <s> we could not have afforded the last war let alone have won it had we not had a steel industry in this country <e>", "<cs> certainly <e>", "<cs> is the minister saying that if some branch of an unfriendly government such as i mentioned acquired a majority of these shares all the government would do would be to refer it to the monopolies commission <e>", "<cs> my lords as the present pressure for new urban development in the south-east is largely the effect of the virtual abandonment of any regional and industrial policy by the present government is it not clear that with a continuously weak regional policy the building of one new town of this kind would simply be followed by a demand for more and more <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is an exodus of population from the south-east does not that weaken the case for building more new towns there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that london transport is acutely undermanned at the present time and that in those circumstances the chance would be about whether or not there was someone near those switches <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down again in the relatively simple case where both parents have been divorced and remarried would there then be four parents all of whom would have a vote or would that be a case where the governing body would take some sensible and responsible discretionary decision <e>", "<cs> my lords is this not an extraordinary way to legislate <e> <s> we now seem to have reached a position in which any local government elector anywhere in the kingdom is included in the category of having a statutory right to intervene whereas apparently those teaching in the very school which is at issue are denied that statutory right and merely given some vague promise <e> <s> i am sure that the minister means well but that cannot be the correct way to legislate <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister not take more seriously the warnings given by the noble lord <e> <s> lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> is he not aware that the combination of the present acute shortage of manpower on london transport and the introduction of the barriers carries serious risks <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government be extremely cautious in accepting any agreement which would mean the abandoning or weakening of the united kingdom governments control over the sterling exchange rate <e> <s> without that we should be left with very little control over our own economy in a period in which we are drifting into ever-greater external deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister one question <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment refers to the secretary of state <e> <s> i presume that this means the secretary of state who has responsibility for the dhss <e> <s> is it quite clear from the bill that that is so <e> <s> is it certain that we are not giving this power to almost any secretary of state <e> <s> the bill should obviously be clear on this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that a great deal of money has been raised for this project on the basis of promises about times and speeds which cannot possibly be carried out without a great deal of expenditure of public money <e> <s> would it not have been rather better to have studied all these facts before the money was raised and the promises given <e>", "<cs> my lords although we have large reserves now thanks in part to oil earnings would it not be wiser if the government took the medium term prospect rather more seriously <e> <s> we now seem to be running the largest current account balance of payments deficit in any year since <e> <s> whereas oil earnings were set to rise years ago they arc now bound to fall in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware that unhappily our oil earnings are not a cycle but more like a mountain which rose to a peak about three years ago and has steadily fallen thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the ministers soothing words i believe that the bill <e> <s> unless it is drastically amended is likely to make an already bad housing situation even worse that it is already <e> <s> if there is one thing of which years as a constituency member of another place convinced me it is that had housing probably produces more hardship in the large cities in this country than any other factor <e> <s> incidentally a great deal of that hardship falls upon growing children who are in no way responsible for their plight <e>", "<cs> my lords would not many of these troubles have been avoided if the development of stansted airport had not been held up for years as a result of a lot of special pleadings <e>", "<cs> the minister said that the government are trying to increase the availability of rented properties but the government are not trying to do that at all <e> <s> the great majority of rented properties are council-owned properties <e> <s> the whole of the governments policy is tending to reduce the number of rented council properties available in the community <e>", "<cs> all that the noble lord has just said makes no difference whatever to the fact that if you reduce the total of council-owned rented properties on the present scale you will reduce the total of rented properties available in the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords the pleasure of following the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter always puts me in memory of times past <e> <s> similarly the year puts me in memory of the year which was also a vintage year <e> <s> in april of that year the chancellor of the exchequer made huge tax cuts which he said would encourage incentive and promote a strong economy <e> <s> at mid-summer he invited us all to invest in success <e> <s> however by july it was clear that consumption and imports were increasing rapidly and the trade balance was in deficit <e> <s> also in july of that year interest rates were raised to stop the rot and there was a run on the pound in august <e> <s> in october <e>", "<cs> my lords i advise the noble viscount if i am entitled to reply to take a look at what has happened in the united states in the past two years and to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords does that mean that as our economy gets stronger still the balance of payments deficit will be even larger <e>", "<cs> my lords as the chancellor also disagrees with the prime minister on that we are more or less even <e>", "<cs> can we be absolutely clear about one fact <e> <s> did we rightly understand the noble earl to say that the electoral reform society will be paid by the applicant <e> <s> presumably the applicants in this case are the relevant landlords <e> <s> surely it would be grossly improper for one of the parties to the argument to be paying the independent body which is supposed to be conducting the election <e> <s> although i am sure that the electoral reform society is the most independent and honest authority that we have a great many people will not believe that this is a system of which parliament could approve <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are unable to answer the question in the simple form in which i asked it are they qualified to reform our whole education system <e>", "<cs> my lords despite all these excuses would it not be much better if the government honestly published the real figures so that accurate comparisons could be made with the past <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that at the rate of balance of payments deficit which he announced and forecast today unless we borrow from overseas our official reserve will last only about three years <e>", "<cs> my lords if british aerospace knew in advance that planning permission was likely to be given on the sites and the ministry of defence did not is that not another case of insider trading <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister naturally put the best face he could on the package which is now before us <e> <s> i should like briefly to consider some of its longer term implications <e> <s> what the bill does is to increase by per cent <e> <s> the level of taxation which the ec imposes on its own people a lasting increase according to the explanatory memorandum of from million to million in the contribution from the uk taxpayer and a special levy according to the bill of million although i think the minister said million this year from the united kingdom disguised as my noble friend said as a non-repayable advance authorised by the subterfuge of an intergovernment agreement outside the machinery of the ec <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case why could it not just be called a payment and not a non-repayable advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than happy to congratulate most warmly the noble lord lord alexander on his lucid polished and highly informative speech <e> <s> i am sure that he will bring a great deal of both legal and financial wisdom to the house <e> <s> i rather suspect that he is one of those people one finds it hard to disagree with whatever they say <e>", "<cs> my lords what the minister said today did only a little to modify my belief in the light of the fennell report and of ones own experience in the underground since the govrenment took it over from the glc three years ago that the financial targets set by the government have led to an obsession with cost cutting and cutting staff resulting in disregard of safety and the final disaster in recent months <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister leaves finance arc the government making any change to the general revenue target which has been imposed on london transport and which has led to the reduction in staff and therefore to a great many of these difficulties <e> <s> is not that being adjusted <e>", "<cs> my lords is it a fact as reported that british rail faced with privatisation is now considering a plan to make a cut of nearly million a year in expenditure on signal maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that though our visibles trade in total has always shown a deficit our trade in manufactures showed a surplus until a very few years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor can help those of us who are not lawyers in this house by citing any specific precedent for a sweeping provision of this kind other than the special cases quoted by the noble and learned lord lord simon being included in legislation in recent years <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not have been better if the promoters of the project and the government had investigated the real practical possibilities of running trains at this speed through kent before and not after they had induced investors to put up very large sums of money for the project <e>", "<cs> my lords since on any interpretation according to the court of auditors fraud amounts to at least tens of millions of pounds a high proportion of which comes indirectly from the british taxpayer and is apparently caused by corruption and fraud in the distribution of export subsidies from the commission is it not time that the government took more effective action to stop what is surely a scandalous misuse of british taxpayers money <e>", "<cs> my lords to complete the picture has the minister also noticed that the level of manufacturing output in volume was not recovered after the collapse of the s until last year and that this is the first time since that manufacturing output has failed for years to exceed its previous peak <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to discourage extremism in local government and because the eccentric behaviour of the leader of westminster city council has led not merely to the expenditure of million but to a reported protest to buckingham palace from the netherlands royal family in respect of the cemeteries affair would it not be in everyones interest if westminster city council now selected a more responsbile leader <e>", "<cs> surely the weakness of the ministers case is this <e> <s> he now tells us that the individual concerned is not committing an offence unless he knows that it is an offence to try to enter that ground <e> <s> that means he is not committing an offence unless he regards it as an offence <e> <s> but that is not what the bill says <e> <s> the bill says that it is illegal to attempt to enter the ground <e> <s> it is perfectly possible without knowing that one is attempting to commit an offence to attempt to commit what is in fact an offence <e> <s> therefore it does not seem to me that the bill coincides with the defence which the minister is now making for it <e>", "<cs> can the minister answer more clearly the question asked by the noble lord lord ezra <e> <s> why do these difficulties apply at per cent <e> <s> but not at per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as the court of auditors reports reveal a scandalous level of fraud and waste not merely in export subsidies but in storage and in many other cases are the government really satisfied that their action will be effective in stopping what is a gross misuse of british taxpayers money <e> <s> can the noble baroness now tell us what really happened in when the noble lord lord cockfield claims that he put forward a splendid plan for stopping all this fraud which was then blocked by the british government <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the noble lord lord cockfield or even sir john hoskyns may have said would it not be better if more of these very well qualified persons in brussels were to devote more time and energy to correcting such frauds than to devising all sorts of blueprints for imaginary futures <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i also wish to support the amendments spoken to by my noble friend lord williams of elvel <e> <s> they place a more positive onus of proof on those advocating mergers <e> <s> experience is on the side of my noble friend <e> <s> in the days when mr charles clore as he then was invented takeover bids it used to be argued that mergers whether hostile through takeover bids or amicable could be beneficial to the public interest because they would lead to better use of the assets owned by at least one of the companies involved in the merger <e>", "<cs> my lords have the governments present anti-inflation policies achieved the results that they intended <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not a risk that the undermanning of our public transport services enforced by the governments financial targets may become a threat not just to efficiency but to the safety of those services <e>", "<cs> my lords this country had no visible trade deficit with those other countries before we joined the ec <e> <s> as the deficit has become worse in almost every year since that time what reason has the minister for believing that if further restraints on imports are removed in the situation will not become even worse <e>", "<cs> my lords if an ever-growing deficit is a sign of success are we to expect it to increase indefinitely <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister two questions about where this bill stands <e> <s> it seems to me that we are not making an important distinction as clear as we might do <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter myself having been both a minister and a civil servant that ministers are not always right nor are civil servants always right <e> <s> i also agree with the noble lord lord pym that with regard to the question of public policy a civil servant has no right to take the view that he knows better than the elected government <e> <s> they may both be wrong <e> <s> however on a question of policy we must work on the assumption that the elected government and the responsible minister are more likely to be right than a judge or jury or a civil servant or a newspaper <e>", "<cs> it was the robot scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i want briefly to express the hope that the select committee which will no doubt examine this bill will investigate very carefully whether it is in the best interests of those living in the spitalfields area <e> <s> there are many people in the area and some of those representing the area who have doubts on that score <e> <s> it is true that there are many defects in the present market but i think that it has yet to be established at least before the select committee that there will not be a number of defects in the new market at temple mills in addition <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister confirm or deny the report that the government intend to solve the balance of payment problems by abolishing the figures <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister also give the figure for <e> <s> to what extent does this very large amount of spending involve the use of public money for what is really party propaganda <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if instead some of those millions of pounds were spent on health and education <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to congratulate most warmly the noble baroness lady robson of kiddington on initiating this debate <e> <s> i wish to thank the noble baroness and the select committee for an admirable report which has done a great public service in fully exposing what everyone i believe now agrees has become a major public scandal <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that and it would not be true <e> <s> most of the profits have not gone to farmers but to landowners <e> <s> however that is not what i am arguing at the moment <e> <s> but the truth is that if there was no gap between world prices and ec prices there would then be no export subsidies no major storage and as a consequence no fraud <e> <s> the frauds largely consist in ingenious methods of acquiring foods at the world price and selling them to the ec at the artificial ec price <e> <s> that would not matter if the gap between ec and world food prices was something like or per cent <e> <s> but for the past years it has averaged per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> and that is still the case <e> <s> it is interesting to recall that under the notorious british corn laws of to levies never rose above per cent <e> <s> but here we are dealing with food levies of per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree partially with the noble lord lord bellwin on one thing namely that the recent practices of the westminster city council are much in need of reform <e> <s> the bill however quite apart from its other deficiencies seems to me to be a very poor response to the debate on homelessness that we had in this house as recently as th june <e> <s> the bill will do little or nothing to improve the deteriorating housing situation from which we suffer in this country <e> <s> if anything by financially tying the hands of local authorities ring-fencing them as we have heard even further it will make the problems and the plight of the homeless and the badly housed even worse than before <e> <s> one certainty is that rents will rise <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am present can the minister tell us how many new rented houses or flats have been made available by the private sector or the housing associations in the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords that does not wholly explain why it is necessary to alter the word discharge to carry on <e> <s> can the minister say whether there is a difference in the meaning of those two words and if so what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that one engineer alone will not solve the trouble which is due to a general shortage of escalator maintenance staff caused by excessive cost cutting to meet the governments financial targets <e>", "<cs> both the two members of the committee who have just spoken referred to central government and the central civil service which of course this bill does not affect as well as to the local civil service <e> <s> perhaps in his reply the minister could explain the relation between the limitations and restrictions which exist in the national civil service and those which a local civil servant will have to fulfil if this provision becomes law that is to say if this amendment is not passed <e> <s> this bill applies only to local civil servants <e> <s> will there be similar increased restrictions introduced for the national civil service and if not why in this particular respect should we discriminate only against local civil servants <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce briefly the points made by my noble friend lord mcintosh <e> <s> in answer to my question earlier today about the relationship between these proposals and the situation in the national civil service the minister appeared to say that all the bill is doing is applying to local government rules which are already in force in the national civil service <e> <s> i should be extremely surprised to find it true that in the national civil service every officer earning over a year was placed on a restricted list of this kind <e> <s> can the minister therefore tell us what is the situation in the national civil service and whether there is any limit as low as <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in warmly congratulating the minister on his promotion i can say with complete conviction that we cannot at any rate blame him for either last years or this years budget and finance bill <e> <s> i think the best that can be said about these two measures for this year is that they will not be so damaging as last years which stepped up spending by those with the larger incomes and so converted the balance of payments deficit for from the chancellor of the exchequers forecast of billion to an actual deficit of about billion <e>", "<cs> my lords forecast or no forecast as the present appalling balance of payments deficit is the main cause of the persistent weakness of sterling have the government any policy whatever for reducing the payments deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister satisfied that this proposed draft order will adequately protect the interests of the british fishing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree with the chancellor of the exchequer or the prime minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that it was necessary to look at the background of the order <e> <s> however there are some facts in the background which he did not mention <e> <s> one is that had this country never accepted the common fisheries policy we should still have as norway does a -mile fishing zone of our own <e> <s> norway has successfully preserved its zone <e> <s> that was not done here <e> <s> as a result of the common fisheries policy this country contributed something like three-quarters of the total stock of fish to the pool <e> <s> i understand that under the british quota the british fishing industry is only able to take out about per cent <e> <s> as opposed to the three-quarters put in <e> <s> those are the basic facts to the background <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down will he say whether british fishermen will have corresponding reciprocal rights in spanish waters <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that we can all agree that the present traffic confusion cannot be ended by building major new roads in inner london <e> <s> those of us who in the s opposed inner london motorways always argued that major new roads in inner london would simply generate more traffic <e> <s> that has since been proved correct <e> <s> minor improvements yes but major new roads and widening schemes would cause great destruction involve enormous cost and simply shift the bottlenecks half a mile or more further on <e>", "<cs> my lords if there is a declining balance and an expected deficit in the fund why have the government abolished altogether the treasury contribution to the fund which has been a fundamental support for the system ever since it was set up <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why until recently we were told that we were enjoying an economic miracle but we are now told that things are so bad that we must have per cent <e> <s> interest rates indefinitely <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boardman opened the debate with a somewhat political speech which we all enjoyed <e> <s> i make no apology for confining myself to economics <e> <s> of course a free market as almost everyone has agreed today and freely moving prices are desirable over a major area of any economy in particular over the production and distribution of a large variety of goods and services and the activities of small firms <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government content with the situation in which the number of homeless families is at record levels <e> <s> we are apparently building fewer houses to let than in almost any year since the war <e>", "<cs> my lords how many houses to let do the government expect to be built in the present year <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not clear that these private personal pensions are becoming a much riskier deal for the ordinary person than the safe insurance pension <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case and as i understand that at least per cent <e> <s> of the new cars sold are company cars would not a tougher tax treatment of company cars be beneficial to the budget revenue the balance of payments and probably to traffic chaos in london <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister also tell the house whether when the government say that a higher proportion of our manufactured imports consists of capital equipment they are classing company cars as capital equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords when the government tell us as they often do that a high proportion of our imported manufactured goods are capital goods rather than consumption goods for that purpose do they count these company cars as capital equipment <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the noble lord lord crook on his most informative maiden speech i would say only that the more people we have in this house who know what they are talking about the better it is for all of us <e>", "<cs> my lords as this government have interfered more in local government than any other government in living memory are they at all worried by the extremist policies of this local authority even when the policies extend to breaches of the law <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the district auditor does would not the happiest solution to the troubles be for the militant lady who leads the council now to resign <e>", "<cs> can the minister make one fact perfectly clear <e> <s> he said as regards the manually-held data that that would be treated with the same confidentiality as would a loan from a bank <e> <s> is that on the face of the bill or is he merely asking us to accept that from his verbal statement <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it that this government have been fighting inflation for years and more but inflation still seems to be winning <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister answer one other question arising from this issue <e> <s> if there were a proposal to privatise this company would it require primary legislation or could the government effect this in some other way <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government not worried at all by the prospect that on the present chancellors own estimates by the end of this year this countrys overseas borrowings will be billion mainly in the short-term on which very high interest payments across the exchanges are now being paid <e> <s> those have already pushed us into deficit both on visible and invisible account for the first time in our peacetime history <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister also aware that the chancellor in his red book predicts an overall current deficit of billion this year <e> <s> at that rate by the end of the year we shall be approaching the south american system of borrowing overseas to pay the interest on our previous borrowings <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl now answer the question that i asked earlier <e> <s> could this curious company be privatised without primary legislation or would it require primary legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords as the minister also observed a growing number of privatised british firms are being renationalised as subsidiaries of french state-owned companies <e> <s> can the minister say whether that was one of the objects of the governments privatisation policy <e>", "<cs> my lords what possible good reason can there be for preventing authorities from using their own funds to build low-cost housing which everyone agrees is one of our most acute social needs at present <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it would be better to have a little more consumer choice and allow local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords does that also cover buckingham palace and windsor castle <e> <s> what are the changes which may or may not take place within the next few years <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly admired the enthusiasm for the environment which the noble earl lord lindsay expressed in his speech today <e> <s> however i am not so sure that that is an argument for the project <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister believes that the mortgage rate should be taken out of the rpi does he also believe that rents should be removed <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that as long as they tolerate company chairmen payingthemselves half a million pounds a year there is no chance whatever of the working population generally listening to the governments appeals for pay restraint <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever that answer means the company has been one of the governments most successful instruments for many years in promoting employment in areas that needed it in england <e> <s> it owns a large area of valuable industrial property <e> <s> will the minister note that any serious curtailment of its activities would be a major blow to these areas in particular in the north of england <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not notice that one of his arguments is in fact in favour of the amendment <e> <s> several times he argued that the great advantage of reductions in taxation is that they give incentive to the worker because he can earn more by having an increase in his spendable income <e> <s> that is precisely one of the merits of child benefit <e> <s> it is a social payment such that if your wage or salary is increased you do not lose social benefit <e> <s> that is an extremely powerful argument in regard to just the incentive to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> that would appear to be one of the major elements in this argument <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why those organisations have to be subsidised with public money part of which comes from the british taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain why the edinburgh actuaries are in need of this special help <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating my noble friend lord richard on his maiden speech and the noble lord lord jenkins on introducing this debate i cannot help remarking that the speech of the minister was very much more precise in detail than the speech of the noble lord lord jenkins <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government know whether the alleged low cost of producing nuclear power in france fully takes into account decommissioning costs <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from anything else the admirable and most timely report of the select committee of the other house on company investigations which many speakers have mentioned today justifies this debate <e> <s> in fact it cries out for a debate and for many other things including action from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords since major reforms of the protectionist common agricultural policy are fully as much in the interests of this country as of the food exporting nations and the gatt negotiations generally why does our minister of agriculture appear to support the ec in declining to make serious concessions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to watch the noble baronesss lips at arms length <e> <s> does she agree that it would be most unfortunate if obstinacy on this issue were to wreck the gatt negotiations altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords in fairness to the present government should it not be acknowledged that the chancellors hard ecu is probably the least damaging of all these crazy schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the distressing case involving the year-old child stephanie fox whom the court recently found to have been murdered by her father while she was in the care of wandsworth council the special independent panel of inquiry set up to investigate the case stated that the child was refused a nursery place for six months owing <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister also note that unless the government ease their extreme restrictions on essential local expenditure tragedies of this kind are all too likely to occur <e> <s> if they do the government will bear the very heavy responsibility <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord wyatt spoke today with all the balance impartiality and objectivity that we would expect from our television channels but he did not wholly convince me <e>", "<cs> my lords if the commission officials exceeded their powers would the british authorities have corresponding powers to inspect the personal bank account of members of the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with more than usual enthusiasm that i offer my congratulations to both the maiden speakers today <e> <s> in the case of the noble lord lord tombs that is partly because i recall that in the s the board of trade gave a good deal of encouragement and support to rolls-royce for the rb engine <e> <s> even though i believe that the noble lord was not with the company at that time he will nevertheless agree that it received a good deal of help from the government <e> <s> in the case of my noble friend lord varley i offer my congratulations in the spirit of my belief that there is no former colleague from the other place whom i would welcome here both as a parliamentarian and a colleague with more enthusiasm than i would him <e>", "<cs> my lords would it then be possible for someone who possessed a large amount of funds to transfer a small amount of funds up to the maximum and in effect gain that concession without having saved anything at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as the ec under pressure from the french is even now trying to obstruct real progress towards freer trade what are the british government doing to ensure that these negotiations do not collapse <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not a pathetically small figure as regards housing for letting being built by the private sector <e> <s> it suggests that the governments housing legislation and their whole policy of encouraging the private sector to provide low rental homes are likely to prove an almost total failure <e>", "<cs> my lords why then are the government preventing local authorities from building houses when clearly thousands of children are now being brought up in bed and breakfast so-called homes <e>", "<cs> my lords as both the fixing of the gold parity of sterling in and adherence to the bretton woods system in required the approval of parliament do the government propose to ask parliament to approve this comparable decision <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to say that every government to which i have belonged whether as ornament or not began life with a huge balance of payments deficit left by a conservative government and ended their term of office with a balance of payments surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not even accurate about that <e> <s> they succeeded a caretaker government which did not include the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords it was a pleasure and like old times to listen to my noble friend lady castle of blackburn <e> <s> after listening to her uncontroversial speech today i look forward with great pleasure to her controversial speeches to come <e>", "<cs> my lords do we really have adequate parliamentary authority in these matters when it is apparently possible for one man who is not even a british subject to control one-third of the british press and also a large slice of the television network <e>", "<cs> my lords if the minister cannot answer my first question can he say whether mr murdoch in his periodical visits to no <e> <s> downing street counts as a family friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this afternoon i speak with diffidence as a non-member of such an eminent committee <e> <s> i should like heartily to applaud all that has been said about the clarity and lucidity of this report <e> <s> i fully agree with one of its conclusions namely that these issues are well worth discussing in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to have that confirmation of the account that i gave of the incident <e> <s> the upshot was that the government were not consulted and hitler obtained the gold <e> <s> that is not in dispute <e>", "<cs> i am glad to hear that <e>", "<cs> on that point may i ask my noble friend a question <e> <s> if most of these are non-issues and if it is all so far away in the distance why do we have these intergovernmental conferences <e>"]
