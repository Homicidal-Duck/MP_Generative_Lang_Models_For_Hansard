["<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will give me the indulgence of the house during my maiden speech <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord dunleath for initiating this important and indeed opportune debate and for putting forward such positive proposals for deliberation and consideration <e> <s> although the political situation in northern ireland is indeed in a state of flux and uncertainty i believe that the government are right in putting forward a consultative document for consideration <e> <s> if a successful assembly were to emerge as a result of the proposed conference that would certainly assist in underpinning the stability of a country which is of the utmost importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for initiating the debate and for his evident in fact obvious concern for the problems of northern ireland particularly at this time <e> <s> i can <e>", "<cs> my lords my intervention will be brief but i trust relevant to this order <e> <s> in view of the current negotiations and problems in regard to britains contribution in fact overpayment to the communitys budget i should like to put forward a proposal for consideration by the government <e> <s> it is universally recognised that one of the main problems affecting industry is not only the current damaging level of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate the noble lord lord hunt on a really remarkably able penetrating and perceptive maiden speech <e> <s> naturally we much look forward to hearing him on many occasions in the future <e> <s> i should also like to be associated with the remarks made in this house last week in regard to the northern ireland secretary of state <e> <s> i would like to add the word good humour to the qualities of resilience and courage he has demonstrated daily in northern ireland <e> <s> again i should like to say how fortunate northern ireland is in the calibre and quality of successive northern ireland office ministers in northern ireland all of whom have shown a tremendous concern and interest in our affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel reticent about following in the slipstream of a former prime minister and a former governor and i believe that a further former prime minister will also be partaking in the discussion on this order <e> <s> may i thank the noble lord lord grey for his kind remarks <e> <s> i can assure him that his recent appointment as chancellor of the university of ulster has brought widespread happiness and pleasure to every section of the community in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in this time of financial stringency i welcome this order and in particular the million subsidy for electricity tariffs which will be of undoubted assistance to industry commerce agriculture and in particular the housewife <e> <s> in regard to the provision for a further loan for the de lorean car company i should like just to remind the constant critics of this project that in america there is widespread interest indeed enthusiasm for this project <e> <s> furthermore this house should remember that the market place for this car is in america not in this country <e>", "<cs> i am obliged to my noble friend my lords and i wish to refer back to the question of the job creation agency <e> <s> when the government decided not to restructure the job creating agency in northern ireland there was widespread criticism among industry i believe i am right in saying among the trade union movement and from the economic council <e> <s> i urge my noble friend to reconsider who is right and who is wrong <e> <s> can the northern ireland office be right when industry trade unions and the economic council all criticised this decision <e>", "<cs> my lords since this is the first opportunity i have had to congratulate my noble friend lord elton on taking over the portfolio of agriculture in the northern ireland office i should like to wish him all possible success in his mission <e> <s> perhaps i need hardly remind him that agriculture is still our biggest and most important industry in northern ireland <e> <s> its health has a direct effect on the wellbeing and prosperity of a rural community <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should like to congratulate my noble friend lord gowrie on the presentation of the bill <e> <s> however is it not ironical that the bill which has been drafted with the important ingredients of maximum flexibility sensitivity to political entrenchment and recommending gradual evolution should receive even prior to publication in fact even prior to conception such a negative response <e> <s> in fact it has received almost universal condemnation from northern ireland politicians and the media when in my opinion positive thought has never been more opportune and important <e> <s> i say that because the salient and stark fact of economic life in northern ireland today is that after almost years continuous years of violence and tragic loss of both life and property the country has been brought to a state of severe economic decline which now threatens the whole fabric of society in northern ireland since there are severe cracks emerging in almost every sector of the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support and endorse the tributes paid to my noble friend and indeed all ministers in the northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in welcoming and supporting the long awaited order i wish to declare an interest for since autumn i have been chairman of laganside limited a government-sponsored company which might be described as an interim vehicle in order for the responsibilities for this ambitious redevelopment on laganside river to be transferred on a phased and orderly basis from the department of the environment to the proposed corporation <e> <s> i have no doubt whatsoever that the interim period will prove most beneficial for the redevelopment of laganside <e>"]
