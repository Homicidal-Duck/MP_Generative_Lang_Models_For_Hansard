["<cs> my lords your lordships may feel that a debate on the much disputed subject of unemployment is an awkward occasion for a non-controversial maiden speech <e> <s> i take heart from the fact that the authors of the report come from all parts of your lordships house and at the same time cowardice seems inapposite to a new peer whose letters patent were sealed on th july this year bastille day <e> <s> i say to myself <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl the minister of state for tabling what seems to me an admirable amendment <e> <s> it contains two provisions the duty of the local authority to provide after-care and the obligation to co-operate with the health board and any relevant voluntary organisation <e> <s> at present there is a good deal of evidence that too often in scotland in matters of mental health provision not just after-care but other matters too social work authorities the regional and island councils and health boards make and put into action plans without co-operating indeed without consulting adequately one with another and without consulting the relevant voluntary organisations <e> <s> from time to time this has resulted in considerable waste of money and energy <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords have been written to on this subject by a number of lobbyists on each side of the fence <e> <s> it is a very important issue it is an issue of principle <e> <s> also it is <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate as one would expect has been conducted at an extremely high level <e> <s> like the noble lord who has just spoken i would not claim to be an expert <e> <s> i was not even a subaltern in the brigade of the noble lord lord carver and the church to which i belong would not allow me to be a prelate <e> <s> but from until after the end of the war i worked as a junior laboratory assistant with a team of cambridge scientists carrying out research for the nagasaki atom bomb <e> <s> i remember so clearly on the day the bomb was dropped the horror of those young researchers <e> <s> they had hoped the bomb would only be used as a threat and that it would never have to be dropped <e> <s> they knew the implications <e> <s> they had looked forward so much <e> <s> i remember them saying to the splendid results of the research they were doing how all big ships in the end would be fuelled by nuclear power and how all electricity would be generated that way one day but the sooner nuclear weapons were banned they said on that occasion the better <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first join in the congratulations to my noble friend lady cox on an exceedingly interesting and able maiden speech <e> <s> it is excellent that we are going to have her voice in our midst in the future <e> <s> i rise to speak with diffidence on a matter which concerns only the area south of the border but i do so because i am the chairman of the scottish community education council which has precisely the type of powers which are suggested in the acace report <e> <s> whether this is the right solution for a much greater area nine times as large in england and wales i am not sure but i do in fact deal a great deal of the time with these matters as well <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question that the structural changes now taking place with accelerating speed in this and other countries the changes in our economic life in the world of work and in the way we live our lives generally have enormous implications for young people for their immediate future and for their longer term future <e> <s> the debate on this issue has unfortunately got stuck in the increasingly arid wastes of a monthly outcry about the unemployment statistics and about whether or not x amount of extra millions of pounds would cure the problem <e> <s> even your lordships debate this afternoon seems to suggest that the implications of the changes that are now taking place are largely disastrous for young people that the past was absolutely golden that we are doing nothing or too little about the future that the youth training scheme has everything that you can think of that is wrong with it and that somehow we as a nation are letting our young people down and the future is black <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships experience and expertise in the matters under debate are of course copious <e> <s> i have been listening with enormous interest especially to my noble friend lord maude of stratford-upon-avon whose maiden speech was on an aspect very near to my heart <e> <s> but personally i have a great fear about this debate and perhaps even more importantly about the national debate now going on across the country <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike previous speakers i was not a member of the committee when it produced its report but i congratulate them on its contents <e> <s> i want to say a brief word about one particular aspect of the social fund and to talk about it in relation particularly to local authorities <e> <s> the part that i want to discuss is the per cent <e> <s> of the whole social fund which is now earmarked for what the commission describes as projects of a pilot or innovative nature <e> <s> these schemes are to be designed specifically to explore the practical possibilities of new ideas new ways of doing things so that if they are successful they can be developed on a larger scale within the country concerned and even act as a catalyst in parts of the community elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to say a word if i may about cable programmes and certain important aspects of the subject what it seems likely the customer will want from cable and whether the bill is an adequate framework to ensure that he gets what he wants <e> <s> if he does not get what he wants the whole enterprise will clearly fail <e> <s> ever since the debate on this <e>", "<cs> it is unfortunate that this particular amendment is being taken at this late hour because i believe it to be extremely important to the very fabric of the bill and the potentiality of cable in this country <e> <s> the amendment is an attempt as my noble friend has said to ensure that so far as possible in future not only do cable operators intend to offer programmes of local interest and concern and intend to employ local people and local groups but that this does actually happen that it happens to an adequate extent that it happens from the outset and that it happens successfully <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister replies i may remind your lordships that people are prepared to pay a great deal to belong to different clubs and societies in which they are involved for the purposes of different hobbies <e> <s> this could become a very large proportion of the income of a cable authority <e> <s> some noble lords have regretted that a suggested figure of per cent <e> <s> of gross turnover is in the amendment but if it has succeeded in exploring the issue by being worded in that way then it was worthwhile <e> <s> in fact there could be a lot of money in this for a cable authority and there could be a lot of money forthcoming from inner cities and from great housing schemes <e> <s> the money may well be there but it will only be forthcoming if there exist attractive programme enterprises in which people want to be involved <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it is extremely unfortunate that this question should speak of the failure of the youth training scheme when a radical and forward-looking scheme for mainly year-olds at the present time which is being watched by the whole of europe and is in its first year is being looked at by parents and by young people who will become eligible next year <e> <s> is it not unfortunate to do anything to suggest that this scheme is at the moment a failure <e>", "<cs> before deciding what we should do with this amendment we need to be clear exactly what it is that the amendment is saying <e> <s> is the amendment proposing an authority with a capital a to whom the director general will be responsible which is what the noble lord lord ezra seemed to be talking about or is the amendment proposing an advisory committee which will not be executive at all except that it will have one enormously important executive act to perform the appointment of the director general <e> <s> the latter is what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran was suggesting <e> <s> we have heard two completely different suggestions from the noble lords proposing this amendment and a variety of proposals from noble lords backing them <e> <s> we need to be clear what it is that has been suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble baroness lady lockwood for instituting the debate and for making it one about local government in general and not particularly about the party political issues which are so difficult to separate <e> <s> i wish to make only one point <e> <s> it is a point that i do not think is made in alan nortons survey <e> <s> it has certainly not been made by the three noble lords who have so far spoken <e> <s> yet it is absolutely basic to the success of local government in britain <e> <s> i know this from my experience in scotland where metropolitan areas are differently treated and where the point does not arise in quite the same way <e> <s> but no modern local government system however well thought out however well researched and however well defined by statute can possibly work in this country unless the elected councillors accept that they have to operate within the overall economic strategy of the government of the day whether or not at any given moment those councillors whatever their political persuasion may be agree personally with the strategy <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness does not mind my interrupting for one moment would she say that the dereliction in those areas was totally unrelated to the rate levels that have been created by the councils <e>", "<cs> before we launch into a long discussion about this amendment may i suggest that the noble lord lord molloy is probably knocking on a door that was opened a number of years ago <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that the manpower services commission will grant-aid employers to make alterations to premises in order to help to accommodate particular disabilities of people working for them <e> <s> it is unlikely that any disabled person would find that he or she could not be accommodated in this way <e> <s> i think that is already available but of course i agree with everything that the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support my noble friend lady faithfull in speaking to these two amendments <e> <s> both at the second reading and during the committee stage when i put my name to a similar amendment which was subsequently withdrawn i expressed to your lordships my belief which was based on wide consultation among voluntary organisations that there is enormous potential in cable for an extension of the operations of <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble baroness lady burton and her colleagues for instigating this debate on a very important and very interesting subject <e> <s> i should like to confine my remarks to one aspect because i believe that it is the aspect which is uppermost in the minds of most women at the present time <e> <s> it is this <e> <s> how much truth is there in the sneaking feeling which many women have often unspoken that if there are not to be enough jobs to go round it is women especially married women who will who even should lose out <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he tell the committee and the people of scotland whether if this amendment was accepted the people of scotland would be at a disadvantage as compared to the people of england if the england and wales bill goes through <e>", "<cs> is not the law in scotland slightly different <e>", "<cs> my lords as i personally felt it surely would be this has been a most useful debate <e> <s> the breadth and depth of experience that your lordships have brought to the discussion has been enormous <e> <s> the problems that we have in britain as we struggle in education and training to bring about the great changes which every developed country has to bring about at the present time and because time is not on our side we must try to do it reasonably swiftly have been reflected in your lordships debate <e> <s> as several noble lords have said there have been enormous areas of agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a word or two following what my noble friend lady gardner called her more prosaic contribution <e> <s> i should like to say a word about the specal importance of the subject of this debate to the future of the people of scotland particularly in relation to housing <e> <s> i do not need to remind your lordships that in scotland we do not always behave or indeed want to behave in the same way as people behave south of the border <e> <s> our history is different our priorities are often different the way we order our affairs is different and social change often comes according to a different timetable <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i detect that we are a little short in the chamber of recent or current local government experience <e> <s> i think this is a point which the minister really should look at <e> <s> there are certain people who are barrack-room lawyers who pursue their local councillors with points that they want to investigate <e> <s> i thought along with the noble lord lord grimond that there was already good access <e> <s> i have always provided all the papers that constituents of mine i am no longer a councillor have wanted and they have doubtless copied them but do think that they should copy them at their own expense and i do think it should be indicated in some way that they should not use the copying machine in the department where they are looking up matters <e> <s> there is usually only one copying machine there and they could hold things up <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to go over all the arguments again <e> <s> they were discussed at committee stage when i did not speak <e> <s> i did however listen to the arguments that were put <e> <s> all of us know that the fairness of the rating system as it stands in scotland is increasingly questionable <e> <s> it is trivialising the matter in my view to mention only football pitches <e> <s> it is recognised widely and not just by people at the tory party conference to which the noble lord lord ross had time to listen in that either the system needs alteration or we need a new system <e> <s> many groups have taken long and earnest looks at the problem over the last few years <e> <s> i am sure that many of your lordships took part in those groups and you will know as well as i do the problems that exist in finding the best means of altering the system so that we do not end up with something which people dislike even more than they dislike the rating system and which is even less fair that the rating system is at present <e>", "<cs> my lords having studied the cosla papers and the recommendations from tayside region to cosla and having discussed it with many local government people in scotland i can tell your lordships that those people are saying the rating system is basically sound but so far we have not found a way of collecting local government taxes which is as cost-effective as the rating system and works as smoothly as the rating system <e> <s> what was said was that it is basically sound but needs alteration <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords there is clearly agreement among your lordships and i believe it reflects agreement across the country as a whole that this bill will be judged according to three overriding criteria <e> <s> it must be realistic up-to-date and workable in the circumstances of today <e> <s> it must aim at the clearest possible understanding and acceptance by all the public and by the police themselves of the framework within which the police operate <e> <s> it must ensure that that framework is properly balanced on the one hand as many noble lords have said by safeguards for individual citizens as they go about their normal business and on the other by affording sufficient scope for the police to do their job sufficient scope but no more than that <e> <s> that implies adequate professionalism to make use of that scope <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question that during the lifetime of people who are young today they will have to adapt to change to an extent unknown to previous generations <e> <s> i want to speak about the resulting acute and growing need for local easily accessible opportunities for ordinary people of all ages wherever they live whatever their previous academic attainment to learn the new things that they want to learn and to develop their talents so that they can cope with life as it unfolds <e> <s> for many people those opportunities are needed literally in order to survive and needed in new forms of which my noble friend lord vaizey spoke <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that many voluntary organisations within the youth service will regard this statement as far from the minimal and wishy-washy affair which noble lords opposite have indicated <e> <s> the voluntary organisations are deeply divided about whether it would be the best way to make it a mandatory requirement on local authorities to provide for the youth service <e> <s> they will regard grants for training and for innovation for voluntary organisations as immensely helpful at a point where they most need help and i should have thought they would welcome this warmly <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is about matters of far reaching economic social and political significance for the eec and for this country <e> <s> its subject matter is closely connected as the noble lord lord mccarthy has said with the anxiety that is at the very top of public consciousness at the present time anxiety as to what can be done to provide what seems to be in this and in a number of other countries in europe a missing link in our national stategy <e> <s> it is the link between on the one hand the vital containment of inflation and increasing of competitiveness and <e> <s> on the other hand the reduction of unemployment through the generation of more jobs <e> <s> this missing link was discussed as the noble lord lord mccarthy said with the chancellor of the exchequer on television over the weekend <e> <s> my right honourable friend certainly did not brush aside the fact that unemployment is thoroughly bad bad for those that are unemployed for long periods divisive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are all grateful to the noble lord for his clear and concise introduction to what seems to me to be an admirably clear report <e> <s> in so far as the report goes and within the limits which the sub-committee set itself i agree with the contents and i agree with certain reservations which the report makes clear that the new erdf regulation is an acceptable updating and improvement of previous arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to speak in such august and such male company but i want very much to follow up briefly what has already been said about morale and about motivation <e> <s> i base what i say entirely on current and very recent experience in working with civil servants in the manpower services commission and in the scottish office <e> <s> it seems to me that the public at large and indeed many of us in parliament simply do not appreciate what we have been asking of our civil servants during these last few years of great change <e> <s> nor do we appreciate the initiative the flexibility and the skill with which the vast majority have responded <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we have recently been taking too much for granted in this respect <e> <s> my noble friend lord soames did i think say that <e> <s> at one time it may have been fair to take the civil service for granted now it is manifestly unfair <e> <s> indeed it is ultimately counter-productive as well <e> <s> the traditional skills of civil servants what we used to mean by civil service efficiency were the skills of the administrator of systems systems which were largely unseen by the public <e> <s> they were the skills of guardians of an ever-expanding public purse as well as the skills also unseen of putting together and proposing policy options of supporting and protecting ministers and the like <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse the very constructive suggestion which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe made about the possibility of a single business school in scotland <e> <s> there is a crying need for us to concentrate our business education in one place and to get a really high standard for people who want this type of provision <e> <s> there is a great need and i hope that as a result of this discussion the minister will follow it up <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> what would be the situation if it was a case of dumping at sea <e> <s> certainly in scotland coastal protection is the responsibility of the regional councils and there might be two or three in my own area district councils who would have to be notified they would all be affected by it <e> <s> they might not agree how far they were going to respond <e> <s> i would have thought that it was a little more complex than the noble baroness is perhaps suggesting <e>", "<cs> before i am sure whether i agree with a great many noble lords that a preamble of this sort is desirable may i ask the minister whether he feels it is possible to define in this kind of way the objectives of the bill <e> <s> i think that i gathered from the noble lord lord mackie of benshie that he is not completely sold on this particular wording <e> <s> but if such a preamble is possible clearly crisply and all-embracingly to describe the objectives i should be very willing to go along with it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to be very careful not to be pressed by noble lords into doing something that prevents innovation in machinery <e> <s> this is not stationary <e> <s> we want masses of innovation <e> <s> we want new methods of delivering chemicals in the way that is required <e> <s> a great deal has to be done about this <e> <s> decisions or regulations should not be made to prevent people from doing it <e> <s> they should not be made to feel fearful of producing machinery and developing it in case it cannot be used <e> <s> that would be the most disastrous thing of all and totally counterproductive <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will bear that in mind <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stanley expressed the fear that people might become so alarmed that all sprays were dangerous that the whole fun would go out of rambling <e> <s> i should like to point out that not all people exploring the countryside are on rights of way or belong to the ramblers association <e> <s> on my farm there is a camp site where young people come every year <e> <s> they have permission to go on a whole lot of routes across ground which does not include public rights of way or highways <e> <s> if they became alarmed that every field they went into which has been sprayed was dangerous i do not think the experience would be any fun at all <e> <s> should there be chemicals which are known to be dangerous to walk across they would of course be told <e> <s> no sensible farmer who welcomed them would fail to do that <e> <s> the whole thing is not quite as cut and dried as the noble lord lord melchett thinks <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend the minister answers is it conceivable that this question might be looked at from another viewpoint <e> <s> for example does not the residue in flax matter <e> <s> it is not going to be eaten although it is an agricultural product <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that no farmer if he knows that there is any question of soil being permanently damaged by the use of a specific pesticide will use it <e> <s> nor will he use it if he knows that if he persistently uses a certain pesticide it will build up in the soil <e> <s> what is needed is the education of farmers perhaps some advertising and maybe a specification on the container <e> <s> these are all things that the minister might think about <e> <s> it is a very important issue <e> <s> i do not believe however that farmers need very strong persuasion once they know the implications <e> <s> they know that the soil is the most valuable thing that they have <e> <s> it is their capital <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i am being very much of a dim-wit but quite apart from the issue of volatility i do not understand the context of this amendment <e> <s> it comes does it not <e> <s> under clause <e>", "<cs> some noble lords may have been saying that but i do not think all noble lords have <e> <s> i think all noble lords have agreed that the public dislikes aerial spraying <e> <s> it seems to me to be of the greatest importance that anything the government do by regulation should leave room for the development of more accurate ways of spraying arable crops by air and more successful ways as well as spraying that cannot be done from the ground <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to suggest to your lordships with the greatest respect that the way in which we are conducting our national debate about unemployment outside and inside parliament is increasingly out of date arid and for the man in the street a growing cause for cynicism <e> <s> i want to suggest that it is high time that both the agenda and the style of the national discussion changed <e> <s> of course every citizen has a right some a duty to question whether current policies are the best ones to propose improvements and alternatives <e> <s> of course it is important constantly to remind the government of the day that they act for every single citizen that the economy exists for the people and not the people for the economy and that in deciding overall economic strategy the effect on individuals must unfailingly be the major consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that the next step is that computer learning should take place under all subjects across the curriculum <e> <s> will he confirm that this is now under way especially within pilot courses for to year-olds which are being run by more than local authorities supported by central government through the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is agreeing that the original purpose in publicly funding student unions was so that students should learn democracy does he really persist in his opinion that the failure to produce figures in regard to their accounts is unimportant <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no personal experience of the workings of the present system of the district salmon fishery boards <e> <s> i have caught only two salmon in my life and i have no financial interest except inasmuch as every scot has a financial interest in this subject <e> <s> i do know however that informed opinion among those closely involved is that the present system is badly out of date that <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> while the overall figures <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell the house what consultations he has had with the existing council for disability in scotland and what relationship the new council would have with that council <e>", "<cs> i too should like to oppose the amendment <e> <s> most of the points i was going to make have been made very much better than i <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> in spite of what he has said may i ask whether local planning committees will be consulted before red boxes of sir giles gilbert scotts distinguished design are demolished wholesale <e> <s> furthermore is there any chance that at least some of the existing boxes might be listed as are i believe some pillar boxes <e>", "<cs> my lords i was a member of the sub-committee which produced this report <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord seebohm for his chairmanship of that sub-committee and for the very clear exposition of the report which he has just given to your lordships <e> <s> i hope i may be forgiven by him and by the other members of the committee if i take issue as i did in the committee with some of the conclusions in our report <e>", "<cs> my lords if and when the government consider the grant for will they take into account the open universitys substantial contribution not just to undergraduate education but to continuing education and training particularly in the scientific technical and vocational fields <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in scotland the organisation of the whole of international youth year has been coordinated by a committee consisting entirely of young people themselves and that they were greatly encouraged by the attendance at the launch of his honourable friend the under-secretary of state for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the university of dundee suggested a way of getting round this technical difficulty within the scottish education department <e> <s> it suggested that the money saved from scottish general university student grants might be transferred to supporting special grants for post-graduate students on courses in remote sensing electronics and in computer science those courses having been set up specially by the manpower services commission in response to acute need in scotland <e> <s> was this considered and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree however that what the university of dundee suggested the funding of students does not come through the university grants committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in welcoming the speech of the noble lord lord murray <e> <s> i spent several years as a member of the manpower services commission alongside his tuc colleagues <e> <s> it is good to hear him paying tribute to what the msc has done in helping governments of the day in industrial affairs <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that answer may i ask the noble and learned lord whether anything can be done to help the prison officers in institutions such as glenochil to cope with a situation where the stress of the period just before a boys release which is very great particularly when the family background is of the kind which clearly pertained to this young man is added to by the fact that he is going to face further charges <e> <s> a social inquiry report in relation to the second series of charges comes too late <e> <s> it seems that there is a very special problem here where a person who is going to be released is under stress in any case because release involves stress and in addition is going to have to go through the whole thing again <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has again brought in front of your lordships house the amendment that he moved in committee giving as the grounds for justifying this break with our normal convention that new information is available as a result of the publication of the annual report of the tsb <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that the employees and the unions were in favour <e> <s> the depositors cannot be consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed say that <e> <s> there has been a tremendous scottish nationalist campaign in the last fortnight to get this going ably assisted by the alliance and now it seems that the main opposition party has got on the bandwagon as well <e> <s> my noble friends i would claim are misled <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord vinson in his admirable speech has told us that he wears the badge of an inventor <e> <s> what he did not add was that having made his initial invention he manufactured it in a nissen hut <e> <s> he floated the invention on the stock market and it won the queens award for industry <e> <s> i am not sure whether my noble friend lord thomas would be prepared having written his extremely eminent books which have achieved such enormous exports and have made this country so famous to print them in a nissen hut and thus perhaps qualify for the queens award for exports <e> <s> however he has made a very valid point <e> <s> we are extremely fortunate to have the noble lord lord vinson in this house <e> <s> he has shared his experience and knowledge with us up to a point and we shall learn more of it as time goes on <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down was he saying that the system for disposal of waste in scotland including strathclyde which he visited carried out by the lower-tier district councils is unsatisfactory and dangerous <e> <s> i have never understood that there was any problem at all <e> <s> it may be that the analysts whom he mentioned would have liked this to be a regional council function <e> <s> however i have never understood that there was any problem <e>", "<cs> there is one very important point which has not been made in this long debate <e> <s> i feel it needs making and clearly <e> <s> i speak as one who has spent the whole of her adult life working within voluntary organisations who was involved for eight years as the chairman of a main committee of a strategic local government council that committee being responsible for much strategic grant-aiding and i speak as someone who has discovered that the way to get continuity and stability of funding and the understanding of councillors of all political parties for voluntary organisations is by depoliticising the exercise <e> <s> how does one do that when the exercise is about money raised by local government councillors on behalf of the people they represent and they have different political views and so do their electors <e> <s> how does one do that <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i believe i said myself just now that i do not think the voluntary organisations quite envisage the kind of politicisation that will take place if this amendment should be accepted <e>", "<cs> i was glad to hear the noble lord say that he was not going to press this amendment tonight because i think that in the course of his introduction of the amendment he has revealed not only a weakness in the scheme as it might be amended if that amendment was accepted but also in the noble lord the ministers argument as well <e> <s> suppose a majority of authorities decided to accept this voluntary scheme and under clause towards the bottom of page in the absence of agreement between all the councils the majority accept that it is binding on them and some councils are therefore left out of the scheme <e> <s> i wonder whether the government have thought through how that will affect the fixing of the upper expenditure limit of that council and my language unfortunately does not stretch to england in this case the amount up to which the council may spend the amount of the taxpayers support of that authority and the amount at which it is rate capped <e> <s> those things have to be fixed at a given moment in the cycle of budgeting and the decision about the scheme might happen at a different moment in the cycle of budgeting <e> <s> so that i think there is a hole in the argument unless the noble lord can fill it now <e> <s> perhaps that is something that could be looked at before the next stage <e>", "<cs> the council for voluntary organisations was kind enough to explain its point of view to me as well as to the noble viscount and i talked about it with its representative <e> <s> from my own experience and also after conversations with representatives of the london boroughs association i feel strongly that while the anxiety of the voluntary organisations is extremely understandable in this respect this solution will not solve the problem in fact it will be counter-productive <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> i of course will read what he said in his long contribution earlier in the debate <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord says <e> <s> i shall read with interest what he said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the two noble baronesses for their welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the excellent work that has been done in preparation for the world conference by nongovernmental womens organisations for example the topic papers which have been produced in england the comprehensive report by the scottish womens joint action committee and the wales assembly for women <e> <s> is she further aware that in all those papers there is a firm view expressed that the convention should be ratified <e>", "<cs> my lords it was interesting that at the beginning of this debate there was what to me seemed a very encouraging acceptance from both the front benches opposite that something has to be done to arrest the decline in bus travel <e> <s> there seemed to be acceptance of what my noble friend lord brabazon said that the potential market for the bus industry might be much larger than at present that the potential ability of the industry to transport many more people is greater than we imagine <e> <s> the right reverend prelate indicated that in some way the radical approach of the bill to this intractable problem is evil <e> <s> i was going to answer that but it was very much better answered than i could answer it by the noble lord lord harris of high cross <e> <s> therefore i shall not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> before the committee leaves clause perhaps i may mention the fact that three matters may require tidying up at the report stage <e> <s> i apologise to the noble baroness for the rather dilatory nature of this process <e> <s> the bill has changed very much during its progress in another place and i think it is extremely important to local authorities that we should get this bill right because it is going to be a very important bill for them <e>", "<cs> i appreciate very much that reply and i am sure that those consultations will bear good fruit <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble baroness lady nicol for her continuing encouragement for what i personally regard as a very important bill <e> <s> in answer to her question her main fear that hiding behind the data protection act might preclude the release of information of the kind she mentioned is not justified <e> <s> the noble baroness may recall that the data protection act covers only personal information relating to identifiable individuals <e> <s> a planning application such as the noble baroness suggested would not be affected nor would computer information about traffic flows or teacher/pupil ratios in schools <e>", "<cs> to continue the friendly little discussion on this side of the committee my experience of the subject which does not cover the past two or three years but is not as out of date as all that is that the proposition put by my noble friend lady vickers on the face of it looks attractive to the local authority member <e> <s> local authorities have been struggling through the last years to make the best of an exceedingly difficult job <e> <s> where they have managed on comparatively low subsidy to keep a few buses running they feel that they have done enormously well <e> <s> i was one of those councillors and we certainly made the most of it to our electorate <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies i do not know as much as i should about strathclyde region but it is one of the authorities to which he referred and which would be involved should the amendment be accepted <e> <s> does he have it in mind that strathclyde with a population of million half that of scotland might make the request to the secretary of state for scotland that its transport executive should remain for some time while the bill operated in the rural areas <e> <s> is that what he has in mind <e> <s> does he have it in mind that it could be suggested that half of scotland should not deregulate at the same time as the other half <e> <s> is there to be that kind of thing <e>", "<cs> what the noble baroness is forgetting is the nature of these experiments <e> <s> a local authority which is trying to regulate bus services in an area is dealing with the big boys and the little boys <e> <s> in the hereford area the big boy has won <e> <s> i think my noble friend said that there is now only one competitor left <e> <s> i think that is right <e> <s> the midland red is reigning supreme but with a reduction of per cent <e> <s> in fares <e>", "<cs> i was at a meeting with the convention of scottish local authorities and they made a number of points about the bill <e> <s> they were very strong on this point <e> <s> they pointed out that so far as they are concerned the administrative arrangements are dependent on speed and on achieving as good an understanding as they can get as quickly as possible <e> <s> for a number of reasons all of which i think the noble lord opposite has just enunciated it seems to me there is a strong point here and if the government could look at this again it would be extremely helpful to local authorities <e> <s> those authorities are anxious about playing their full part in the implementation of the bill <e>", "<cs> i have not spoken in this debate because i thought it was going in the way that it should go <e> <s> it would be to be seen to be voting for something which would say that there would be no bus in remote areas in scotland because the bus operator was not able to say that he was going to do these things and to provide them which would be something which very few disabled people would want <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord mcintosh will allow me also to intervene <e> <s> it seems to me quite wrong to say that the local authority is just as detached as a traffic commissioner and that the contrast is between somebody appointed by local government and somebody appointed by central government <e> <s> anyone who has been in local government knows for example that where the bus stops where the crowd is and where the crush of traffic is there are problems sometimes as to who is an operator and who is allowed to do it are all matters of very great interest to local electors <e> <s> if local government has this responsibility and is reflecting the will of the electors it is inevitably involved in local politics whereas the traffic commissioners and traffic commissioners hitherto have been able to stand back from that <e> <s> i think that that is probably what my noble friend on the front bench was saying <e> <s> that is how i understood him <e> <s> i know that many local authorities are very sorry not to carry out what i think is a purely mechanical process as outlined in the bill <e> <s> if it is to be a mechanical process it might be very much better done by the traffic commissioner <e> <s> i know there is an argument but i am inclined to come down on the side of the bill in this respect <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i agree that the amendment of my noble friend looks like a camel designed by a tug-of-war but i think it does not sit very well within the whole notion of the bill <e> <s> i do not say that on grounds of theory at all but on totally pragmatic grounds <e> <s> i can understand why the county councils have suggested this <e> <s> they are genuinely worried that their ratepayers money will get into trouble in the new system <e> <s> they want quite genuinely to protect their ratepayers money <e> <s> but i go along with my noble friend lord de la warr and i do not think in practice that this will be the problem which they fear <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to discuss the clause and its comprehension with the noble and learned lord but my understanding of this amendment is that it is about the number of taxis that should be allowed and that refusal should not be on the grounds of the maximum number in a place which would make this country like the united states of america <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble earl who moved the amendment i must point out that there is not a limit on the number of taxis in scotland <e> <s> the only effect of that is that there is not a colossal value on the plates <e> <s> if a taxi plate can be worth it means that there are not enough taxis in the area for the people who want them <e> <s> taxi drivers in scotland just do not know about plates and do not know that the situation is different in england <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may clarify it for my noble friend <e> <s> the noble earl who introduced the amendment said that a plate for a taxi in england or wales could cost which is a sign that there are too few taxis in those places <e> <s> as far as i know nowadays in scotland there is no such thing as paying for a plate <e> <s> anybody provided that he can fulfil all the other requirements can drive a taxi <e> <s> there is not a limit on numbers <e>", "<cs> i should like to put the other argument <e> <s> people who are involved as many noble lords doubtless are or have been in the work of voluntary organisations youth groups church groups rock climbers associations and all the rest will know that the responsibility for safety in these matters is very carefully examined by the organisations <e> <s> the responsibility lies with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations of the wages councils as i saw them recently were something over an inch thick and small employers who employ people under the conditions of those councils find this extremely difficult to cope with <e> <s> can the noble lord assure the house that reducing the minimum wage and the overtime rate to one for each industry will mean an enormous reduction in those regulations <e> <s> perhaps he can tell us to how many pages they will be reduced <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend <e> <s> i know that the noble viscount as he explained to me before the second reading has been and still is very keen that the progress of the bill and this stage should ensure that the facts and the ideas were exposed so that they would all be on record for future framers of legislation <e> <s> i was unable to be here at the beginning of the discussion of the first amendment so i missed what was said but it seems to me that the facts that are needed and the arguments that are required to be exposed are on record as a result of the second reading and from what i have heard in the last few minutes of this discussion i am not sure that we are getting any further <e> <s> so with great regret i support my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the proportion spent on training in germany and the united states is through arrangements by employers who want to keep the government out of the system and not involve them in the system and in germany it works extremely well <e> <s> can he confirm that the adult training strategy now under way through the manpower services commission is trying to get the benefit of that system rather than the levy system that was suggested in the original question <e>", "<cs> my noble friend said earlier that it would have been so much better to privatise the buses altogether <e> <s> i do not know whether he was expressing a view held by the association which he chairs but i do not think that the scottish authorities which run buses which as it happens are all regions would agree to that at all <e> <s> they argue that they do not want this arrangement they want the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend one further question <e> <s> much of the discussion has been about the longer-term recommendations and my noble friend has spoken about the increase in alternative ways of treating offenders <e> <s> my anxiety is about the short-term in glenochil and what my noble friend referred to as the aura that has been created and the strain the effect on the most vulnerable that there is when these things happen in succession in a short period <e> <s> it turns their minds to something that perhaps otherwise would not be in <e>", "<cs> i am not sure if i understood clearly what the noble lord lord carmichael was saying <e> <s> i may have misunderstood <e> <s> it seems to me that this is at any rate in part an attempt to return to the system which at the present time i think most noble lords in the committee agree is not working to the maximum benefit of the public <e> <s> that is the system where the local authority and the existing operators can get together to make a deal and then if some routes are left out other people come in <e>", "<cs> apart from publishing a map what is different from the initial stages at the moment <e>", "<cs> if i may come back my question was not what is different about the bill but what is different from the old system which does not work <e> <s> that is what i was asking <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment is completely against the spirit of the bill <e> <s> of course the association of county councils would like to have it because it is making all the decisions <e> <s> i dare say that the big bus companies would like to have it because they are making all the decisions <e> <s> the truth of the matter is that when you start from that premise you do not get an improved service <e> <s> that is my problem <e>", "<cs> before this discussion comes to an end perhaps i may say this <e> <s> when you are in a local authority looking at the tenders you have to look at them in relation to everything that they have been asked to tender for <e> <s> you have to look at all the other requirements <e> <s> although i appreciate that as ever the noble lord is watching to try to make sure that the legislation does the very best it can for the elderly and disabled i think that in judging a tender you would always look at the criteria against which people tender because otherwise it is not fair to decide which is the right one to take <e> <s> you must apply all the criteria that were set out when the tender papers were issued <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord ennals will agree that that is always a condition of tendering <e>", "<cs> of course this is important of course where there are concessionary schemes one wants everybody who qualifies to be able to get on the bus <e> <s> however realism has to come into it <e> <s> if there are really million people who are going to qualify for this i cannot believe that it is going to be possible in rural areas probably elsewhere too but certainly in rural areas to persuade enough bus operators to produce the kind of facilities that they would have to if this amendment were accepted <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may follow what the noble lord lord henderson has said with this argument which he says i keep bringing up in different guises and i am sorry he sees it in that way <e> <s> i do not see why people in rural areas should be totally deprived of buses with concessionary schemes because of a blanket amendment for the sake of urban areas <e> <s> there will be buses running on which you cannot have concessionary fares because they will not be able to do it if this amendment is accepted <e> <s> that is why i talk about the rural areas <e> <s> blanket legislation which suits one part will not suit another <e> <s> i think it is an important argument <e> <s> there must be an answer as i have said and it should be looked for because it is very important <e> <s> i do not think a blanket amendment is the way to do it <e>", "<cs> before my noble and learned friend sits down is it not the case that the limit for england was fixed in <e> <s> that figure is considerably out of date <e> <s> i believe i am right in saying that the consumers association is anxious that the top limit should be as high as possible and reckons that in view of the cost today of a suite of furniture or whatever may be the goods in dispute the figure of is by no means too high <e>", "<cs> my lords we have been talking about the difficulties of getting the bill off the ground <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh with his great knowledge of how metropolitan authorities work and of how transport systems work has indicated some of the detailed problems <e> <s> we must however be realistic about public expectations <e> <s> it has been extremely interesting during the recess to see the enthusiasm that potential private operators and existing private operators are showing in planning how they will operate under the new system and how they will take advantage of it <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment applies not only to tyne and wear but also to glasgow which owns its own underground and to which most of what has been said also relates although the noble lord lord carmichael has yet to speak on this matter <e> <s> he knows the glasgow underground better than i do although i know it fairly well <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from the noble lord that the amendment does not apply to strathclyde in his view <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that it does and my noble friend on he front bench confirms that view <e> <s> if i may continue it seems to me that transport in glasgow is of absolutely crucial importance <e> <s> it is probably more important to people there than anywhere else in scotland that there should be cost-effective and plentiful transport <e> <s> at times the streets of glasgow are enormously congested <e> <s> it is extremely difficult to get across the centre of the city during the rush hour even by bus as we know is the case in other cities <e> <s> in glasgow the best way to travel during the rush hour is by underground <e> <s> i do not have the figures but a great many people use that form of transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear and i wonder whether the house is clear on what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> as i understand it and i listened very carefully to the noble lord the amendment states <e>", "<cs> my lords this seems to me to be a rather out-of-date argument <e> <s> there are instances where consumer groups definitely have a place <e> <s> however anyone who has been involved in the kind of consultation which has to go on in towns and villages across the country when bus services are being discussed and these are discussions which in future the private operators will be having and which the authority will be having knows that it will not be just the county council or the regional council which will sit and decide what it thinks best the matter will be talked about with where they exist parish councils community councils and local groups of all kinds <e> <s> it needs to be far more local than any consumer group can be <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we have a problem <e> <s> my noble friend lord campbell of alloway has been speaking about london to which in that respect the bill does not apply <e> <s> the discussion in committee was all about how far this requirement on operators should be pushed to make sure that there were any buses at all <e> <s> as i understood what he said the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has taken that very much on board <e> <s> he said that his request for a statutory code was for a code saying only that it was important to pay attention to these matters but not laying down statutory requirements as i understood it <e> <s> that is quite different from what my noble friend said <e> <s> if the noble lord said that i wonder whether when he speaks again he will clarify why he says in his amendment that the purpose is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just finish what i was saying otherwise i shall lose the thread <e> <s> i was chided by the noble lord for continuing to dish up an argument i think that was the expression he used about this <e> <s> i shall certainly not repeat it <e> <s> but it seems to me that the amendment as worded does in fact suggest that every operator will have to ensure that any services provided are accessible to and convenient for members of the public who are elderly or disabled <e> <s> that wording means any member of the public who is elderly or disabled in any way <e> <s> i wonder whether the wording reflects what the noble lord was suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask your lordships to look a little more carefully at this amendment and at what it is actually suggesting <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord monk bretton gained the impression that i thought that all conservative councillors were brainwashed by their officials <e> <s> i know too many who have never been brainwashed by officials let alone frequently brainwashed <e> <s> i certainly do not think that <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord nugent that this looks like a continuation right to the end of a campaign against the bill but at the same time having listened very carefully to what my noble friend lord monk bretton has said i appreciate that there has been a genuine attempt to try to find a way of doing something if the bill and its effect fail <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend on the front bench and i may have misunderstood this whether if a second bus is required on a service route because of additional school pupils this can be provided under the existing arrangements without any alteration to the bill <e> <s> what the noble lord lord tordoff has said is perfectly obvious very often people make the decision in the last week of the holidays <e> <s> but there is more than that to it <e> <s> parents who pay for their childrens education also may decide this is an excellent bus service and we want to put our child on the bus rather than take it by car or even to put six children on to the bus instead of taking them by car <e> <s> so it is not only a matter of the authority which is deciding to give free school transport on the bus but also of parents who pay <e> <s> the school numbers can go up and down very quickly <e> <s> is a second bus on the same route and thus part of the same service not possible under the provisions of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord renton has pointed out a clear weakness in this amendment <e> <s> however perhaps i may concentrate on the time element alone which is the point raised by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> he said that a number of shire counties would not manage on the timetable which is set <e> <s> i believe that he is underestimating the competence of a local authority in this respect or he is agreeing rather too early to some special pleading which may be coming to him from some directions <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be possible for a competent local authority with all the strength and experience of its transport department to map out the essential routes now well ahead of deregulation day well ahead of tendering day to produce a format for the tender advertisements so that as soon as they identify those routes which need to go out to tender they have all the information ready for the committee timetable to be set and for the decisions to be taken on the dot <e> <s> i should have thought that was all perfectly possible <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just been reminded by the noble lord that noble lords on the benches opposite are this evening attempting to vote down the humble address on the grounds that the government are not doing enough about unemployment <e> <s> no one could take issue with the treatment of unemployment as a major problem <e> <s> this day of debate deals with the economy and as the gracious speech indicates the economy and employment are inextricably linked <e> <s> from listening to the speeches from the front bench at the opening of the debate however the reasons for this particular amendment on this particular occasion do not seem to me to be so clear <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must thank the noble baroness for introducing this debate and indeed for giving the noble lord lord annan the opportunity to make what i thought was a remarkable and forthright speech as was the speech made by the noble baroness lady lockwood <e>", "<cs> my lords i have special reason to be grateful to the noble lord lord stewart of fulham for introducing the debate from his lifelong experience beginning i believe as a tutor in the wea in his youth <e> <s> for the same reason i have to declare a non-financial interest <e> <s> i am the present chairman of the scottish community education council a body appointed by the secretary of state for scotland to advise him on matters relating to community education and to promote its development in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree absolutely with the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> the evidence is that the current preoccupation of teachers is not just with salaries and the funding of schools but also with what they see as a very real lack of appreciation by the public at the present time of their work its difficulty and its importance to the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords i enter this debate with considerable trepidation <e> <s> unlike my very distinguished fellow countryman who has just spoken my involvement with schools has been almost entirely in the rather different system north of the border <e> <s> but the problems confronted by this bill and the number of remedies proposed are so closely related to what i experienced during my time as a chairman of a local authority education committee and my time as a <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with his amendment can he say whether he does not think that it is a gross insult to young people of and years of age to have their affairs dealt with by someone called the childrens ombudsman <e> <s> it is a monstrous idea to put such a title in the bill <e>", "<cs> i have read the noble lords report <e> <s> i read it when it came out and i have re-read it recently <e> <s> the bill as it stands reiterates much that is in the report but not all of it <e> <s> but if i may return to the amendment we are discussing i was a little surprised to hear the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee say that he supports the proposals in the amendment <e> <s> i think i am right in saying that in the second reading debate he said that of all the people he had spoken to he had found none who did not believe additional parental involvement to be a good thing <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally decides is he saying in subsection that the local education authority in determining the proportion of teaching and non-teaching staff is likely to do so without consulting unions <e> <s> is he denying my point that if it consults the unions the body will get larger rather than smaller and that this will increase the whole number <e> <s> that is basic to his argument <e> <s> the noble lord says that the body does not have to be very big <e> <s> i was trying to make the point that subsection means that there will have to be negotiation with the unions that the numbers will increase and that if the other representation is to be maintained it will become a rather large body <e> <s> is the noble lord denying that <e>", "<cs> my lords from its inception the noble lord lord ferrier has been the doughty fighter that we know him to be against this road <e> <s> as has been said i was chairman of the joint committee <e> <s> we spent days examining in great detail the evidence for and against this road <e> <s> at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the reason some members of the committee did not want that speed limit to be on the face of the bill was that one does not include in legislation points that need not be included <e> <s> as the road is only designed as i said for travel at miles an hour it cannot possibly be faster so there was no need to make the amendment and that was the reason <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is clearly not an enthusiast of the bill but she was not as virulent in her attack as the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i imagine one of the reasons for the noble lords virulence is perhaps the subject on which i want to touch the social implications of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was chairman of the joint committee and sat with the <e>", "<cs> i think that it is important that we do not get entirely conned by this thinking <e> <s> i have every sympathy with what my noble friends lord selkirk and lady elliot have said about the wonderful work of housing associations <e> <s> of course they have done splendid work of course it is the most excellent thing that voluntary people should involve themselves in housing <e> <s> but there is another side to this <e> <s> we are not sitting here thinking entirely about the people who have been involved in housing associations and who doubtless will continue to be involved <e> <s> we are thinking about the tenants the people who rent the houses which in the case of local authority housing have been entirely provided by public funds <e>", "<cs> may i continue <e> <s> i am sorry if i was labouring that point but i think it rather important because times have moved on and people have begun to want to buy houses <e> <s> a housing association house has been provided by public money <e> <s> so far as the tenants are concerned the only point is that the landlords are different <e> <s> i think that to continue to deny all tenants of housing associations the righi to buy which is what the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock is suggesting as i understand it is very unjust indeed to the tenants <e> <s> to try to do this is surprising when one knows how many people want to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him to clarify one point <e> <s> i feel that there is some confusion as to who exactly is affected by the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i <e>", "<cs> i ask the committee to allow me to say that every council house that is built in future would be government-built property that would initially <e>", "<cs> there are all the categories that are exempt in this bill <e> <s> it is completely untrue to say that never will the government help rented property <e> <s> that is very misleading <e>", "<cs> my lords following the last question may i ask my noble friend whether he will ask his right honourable friend to look carefully <e>", "<cs> i did not intervene during the discussions on previous similar amendments but i listened to them with enormous interest and i have been thinking about them since <e> <s> it seems to me that in arguing this afternoon for having five directors instead of one on this regulatory body noble lords opposite have compared it to the board of british rail for example <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe suggested that because the board of british rail is appointed by the government it would be desirable that there should be five directors on this regulatory body in connection with the gas industry also appointed by the government <e>", "<cs> i was not able to be present during the discussion on the previous amendment and so i hope i shall be forgiven if anything i say on this amendment i should have said then <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lord peyton i am extremely glad that the highly party political confrontation type of debate on education has not happened <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness lady seear for introducing this debate in the way that she did <e> <s> i agree that we need perhaps more than any other country a first-rate modern education system <e> <s> i listened very carefully to the speech of the noble baroness and i listened carefully to the many fascinating speeches of other noble lords on all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> before the minister rises may i say briefly that it seems to me that we must be careful about this <e> <s> we need to get rid of the thinking of a nationalised industry where everybody felt threatened by government decisions about gas and where it was essential to have a large voluntary organisation doing this work compared with the thinking of a private industry albeit a monopoly <e> <s> i know that many people have enjoyed their work for the regional councils enormously <e> <s> it has been very great fun to do and very interesting and they have worked extremely hard <e> <s> but from talking to various people whose opinions i respect who have taken part in this organisation i feel that they think that it is an opportunity to do something more streamlined <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies perhaps i may say that we require an explanation from him about why the government are arguing that whereas tenants should have the same rights in scotland as they do in england to buy their houses it should be less possible in scotland to set up a charitable housing association than it is in england <e> <s> why should we be denied that right just because the definition of a charity and the way in which a charity is established is different <e> <s> if there are technical problems then we must hear about them and think about how they can be overcome <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness tell the house what is the level of success of the engineering industry training boards insight programme in persuading girls to undertake engineering degrees <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank noble lords on all sides of the house for the welcome that they have given to this bill <e> <s> the noble earl lord grey welcomed the bill <e> <s> he made the suggestion which my noble friend on the front bench has just mentioned that community health councils should be open to the public <e> <s> as the noble earl himself said this is outside the scope of this bill but it is interesting that the government are clearly warmly disposed towards such a notion <e> <s> from his deep knowledge of the health service the noble lord lord ennals spoke of the importance of these joint consultative committees <e> <s> by implication he spoke of how important it is that they should be open to the public and that the public should be aware of what goes on in them <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that the extraordinary rate anomaly that exists despite the fact that there has not been a revaluation in england since long before the revaluation took place in scotland results in the perthshire cricket club which is situated in a local authority-owned park paying per annum in rates whereas lords cricket club in london pays only <e> <s> is he further aware that lanark bowling association has a rateable value of while a similar stadium erected at about the same time but in carlisle is valued at only one-eleventh of that amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs would clarify this <e> <s> i like my noble friend lady gardner do not understand <e> <s> are we talking about voluntary workers who are doing non-remunerative work and get their expenses back which may be more than <e> <s> or are we talking about the pay that they receive over <e> <s> if it is expenses that they are getting back there is no question of that being income because they have already spent it <e> <s> will the noble baroness clarify what her amendment means before we go any further <e>", "<cs> my lords after all this sexist talk i wonder whether the noble lord might think that we should also be racist <e> <s> as we have the good news that the director-designate is a scotsman we might make sure that the assistant directors were english and welsh <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords made reference to the more remote parts of the united kingdom and the way in which the problems are different <e> <s> we do not want to repeat the arguments <e> <s> i know that the rules of the house are that one does not repeat arguments at length on report <e> <s> we have discussed all this already at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness lady seear that it is excellent news that the tvei is being extended <e> <s> i have seen it on the ground <e> <s> i believe that it is doing what my noble friend the secretary of state has described <e> <s> my noble friend tells us that there are local authorities where tvei is operating <e> <s> can he say how many local authorities who want it have not yet got it as is the case in my own local authority of tayside <e> <s> it is held up by the biggest teaching union the educational institute of scotland <e> <s> does he know how many local authorities have no tvei because of teachers union problems <e> <s> has he any remedies for that <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of noble lords have expressed concern that the trouble is that the money may not turn itself into nutritious food for the people who most need it <e> <s> if one questions those people who have been close to school meals they will tell you that the people who most need nutritious food <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank my noble friend for repeating the statement <e> <s> i should like to ask him two questions <e> <s> first clearly it is extremely sensible in view of the history of the difficulties of rationalising the colleges of education accommodation provision in scotland to merge colleges rather than to close them and to ask new governing bodies to do the rationalisation within themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady serota has already spoken in general about the report on consumer protection and other noble lords have commented in more detail on it <e> <s> i was a member of the committee which produced that report and i too should like to pay tribute to the noble baroness for the splendid way in which she chairs that committee and the clarity with which she leads us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he tell us whether the views he has just expressed on the inadequacies of the possibilities of the internal market are those of the labour party or are they his own <e>", "<cs> when we debated this issue in the last session in the context of the scottish law reform bill i voted for the equivalent of the amendment we are now discussing <e> <s> i did so on the basis of the same very persuasive type of argument that we have heard this afternoon from the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i have since looked into this matter in considerable detail and ascertained the facts of the case and i beseech the committee to reject this amendment <e> <s> i have completely changed my mind <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness confirm the information that i have <e> <s> it is that on th october last year in scotland at a meeting of the pharmaceutical general council of scotland attended by out of local representatives the new contract was accepted unanimously <e> <s> can the noble baroness confirm whether that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords two very delightful very appealing speeches have just been made by two very experienced politicians one noble lord from the cross-benches and one from the labour benches <e> <s> from what they have said one would think that the proposal that is now being made to alter what the other place has said is really nothing just a wee addition that it is having very little effect on the people of scotland and means very little to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that extremely encouraging answer <e> <s> i think this is the first time that your lordships will have heard this good news <e> <s> is the minister aware that the adult literacy and basic skills unit who specifically study these matters estimate that probably one in five of the people who find themselves long-term unemployed have basic literacy numeracy or other skills problems <e> <s> unless they can find somebody to help them it is unlikely that they will ever he able either to find or sustain a job <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course extremely interesting to a scot to know that the proposal is to model the package on that which has been proposed by the independent main committee in scotland <e> <s> i am wondering when we shall hear from her right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland what is happening in scotland about the main report <e> <s> she said it would be shortly does she know how short shortly is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that encouraging answer <e> <s> however does not my noble friend agree that should the european scheme be implemented at the level presently proposed the united kingdom stands to be eligible for some million funding for youth exchanges for each of three years provided the government respond with pound for pound additionality <e> <s> does my noble friend appreciate that this additionality would more than use up the whole of the government funding at present for youth exchanges from this country <e> <s> as many of the present exchanges are to commonwealth countries to countries other than european community countries these would have to be abandoned in order to maintain the european commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him if he would tell the house whether he thinks that the present rating system in scotland should continue or could continue and whether the figures that he has given about the amounts that will have to be raised from different wards in glasgow can possibly be known until it is known what will be the level of rate support grant in a given year <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to speak about a subject that has been touched upon by one or two noble lords <e> <s> it is very important in the context of this debate but has not really been explored at all <e> <s> i refer to the subject of schools and how we can get the changes that are needed there if this country is to continue to improve on its success in the world economy and if each young person is to have a chance in future years of earning a good living in the modern world <e>", "<cs> my lords i go along with the noble lord lord donoughue and agree with him that indeed there are votes in the arts but i strongly question whether his view and the view which has been expressed by other noble lords on the benches opposite that the way forward is bigger and bigger funding by the government is the right way in the modern world <e> <s> indeed the argument sounds to me like an argument from the s and s and not one from the s and s <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that lundy island with its magnificent marine life which the whole house i am sure is pleased to know will be protected is run entirely by a charity <e> <s> can he inform the house what the new measure will cost that charity annually <e>", "<cs> my lords as a scot i rise to speak in this debate because there is a strong scottish dimension to the bill although it applies only to england and wales <e> <s> the systems differ on each side of the border <e> <s> the way that teachers local authorities and the government have acted during simultaneous disputes have differed <e> <s> but the most important issues to be resolved are the same as are many more of the detailed issues <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could just say that the disruption has been going on longer in scotland <e> <s> the offer is exactly the same and it was on the table i think i am right in saying a year ago in october in scotland <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness clarify one or two points <e> <s> she said that the members of the review body would not represent the specific areas from which they were drawn but the amendment says <e>", "<cs> could the items for discussion which form the basis for negotiations go outside what the independent review body puts forward <e>", "<cs> my third point and the most important one is whether the teachers would have to wait for their money until the review body had done its work <e>", "<cs> surely in this context we must remember that councillors are elected by the people of the area which includes the parents to do <e>", "<cs> i did not follow the noble lord <e> <s> he said that the bill precludes local authorities from settling teachers pay but the amendment is trying to ensure that they can <e> <s> the amendment is about individual local authorities it is about the block grant to individual local authorities being paid or am i misunderstanding it <e> <s> however individual local authorities cannot fix teachers pay at present <e> <s> it is fixed collectively in negotiations <e> <s> is not this amendment about individual local authorities <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i understand his saying that this needs to go in so that a different order might be contemplated but it seems to me to say in the legislation that a time to pay order would require one to take account of the financial circumstances is extraordinary <e> <s> anything that was done at any time by such an order would have to take account of the financial circumstances <e> <s> that is what time to pay means <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse what my noble friend has said about the apparent complexity of the scheme to a lay person <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> i understood that the noble lord lord morton of shuna was speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> this subsection contains a list of homely items but it attempts to list what is essential for people to retain if some of their possessions are to be taken away <e> <s> i have been an under-sheriff and i have signed documents which involve this process <e> <s> before doing so i asked precisely and in some detail what it involved for those people <e> <s> of course i wanted to know whether the essentials would remain <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down perhaps i could ask him whether this is suggesting that if somebody has a deep freeze which he regards as essential in the country and which i do not he cannot have a fridge <e> <s> milk cannot be put in a deep-freeze <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may follow on what the noble lord lord alexander has said i have had many letters as many of your lordships have <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that the fact that underlines very many of the letters is that the teachers are saying please we want this whole matter resolved <e> <s> we want peace and we want to get party politics out of this situation to the greatest possible extent that we can <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that growing vegetables on an allotment whether or not it belongs to a local authority can represent a very considerable supplementary income to a family because home-grown vegetables are worth a great deal of money <e> <s> is it not therefore very important that local authorities and others should make it possible for people to use their skills in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate has just made reference to the so-called north-south divide <e> <s> i should like to pursue that matter from the point of view of the implications of the tunnel for scotland implications which have already been referred to by another noble lord but about which i consider there is a little more to say <e>", "<cs> my lords having played a small part in the discussion at committee stage i should like to express appreciation to my noble and learned friend for having taken into account what was said <e> <s> the public do not always realise that when noble lords sit in this grand chamber and consider sometimes very difficult legal issues we are discussing matters which affect human beings very often at the most vulnerable moment in their lives <e> <s> if one is subject to having ones possessions removed because of non <e>", "<cs> my lords it was with some relief that noble lords heard a simple straight pointed question from the right reverend prelate to the minister about this bill <e> <s> we have had a long somewhat girning session which for the sake of your lordships who do not know the word is spelt g-i-r-n-i-n-g from the noble lord lord ross and from the noble and learned lord lord wilson <e> <s> i am not sure what either of them was saying he wanted to happen <e> <s> we heard nothing about that it was entirely negative <e> <s> however i expect that we shall hear more as the debate goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i had hoped that the alliance has within them a party which had the ability to be radical and to look carefully at radical policies <e> <s> if they have looked carefully at local income tax i am surprised that they continue to favour it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him as he is a long standing expert on this matter whether when he says that the rates will be increased he can say with what he is comparing the estimated community charge <e> <s> is it with the rates that will be paid under the new rate just announced by tayside region or with the old rate or with the rateable value <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies to the amendment i should like to say that it is important that we get the record straight as regards what is happening <e> <s> i believe that the amendment would delay the bill for three years <e> <s> i thought that i heard the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside say only one year but perhaps that was a slip of the tongue <e> <s> the amendment would delay the bill by three years <e>", "<cs> but the circumstances in england and wales are different <e> <s> the valuations are <e>", "<cs> the noble lord misheard me <e> <s> i was quoting what the officials of cosla said <e> <s> they said that it was a stringent timetable but that they were perfectly certain that they would do it if they were required to but there was good reason to suggest that the bill might be delayed for a year <e> <s> i was quoting cosla officials on that as compared with the noble lord adding another two years delay for the various reasons that he has given <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord will not mind my just saying that we covered the whole of this ground in the second reading debate and now we are doing it all over again <e> <s> is that necessary <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord replies to this debate can he be a little more precise <e> <s> following on from what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said about holiday homes does he envisage that if for example somebody living in the strathclyde region has a holiday home in the highlands or say the angus glens that person would pay local income tax in the region of the holiday home as well as in the region of his main residence <e> <s> if somebody is living in the lothian region with a holiday home in the borders would he pay there <e> <s> if he does not the highland region the angus district or the borders will be very short of revenue indeed <e> <s> can he make that clear <e> <s> at the same time can the noble lord <e>", "<cs> members of the committee will remember that some time ago this matter was first raised in your lordships house by my noble friend lord dundee when he asked a question <e> <s> i played some part in the discussion which then took place <e> <s> since that time there has been a great deal of discussion in another place and my honourable friend mr michael hirst dealt with the issue in considerable detail with the government during the passage of this bill <e>", "<cs> i too am a life member of the national trust <e> <s> i do not think that when the national trust writes to us as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said we can say it is backed by members <e> <s> there are that number of members but it does not write and ask us all what it should be saying on these issues <e> <s> i do not think it expects us all to agree <e> <s> the national trust is drawing attention to what it fears will be the implications of the bill for it <e> <s> it has every right to do do <e> <s> however i think there are implications in its letter which are quite difficult because the concept of the bill is that the assessor will decide what kind of property it is <e>", "<cs> i know we are coming back to amendments about tied houses as my noble friend said but while we are on the subject of crofters when my noble friend replies i hope he will bear in mind that many farmers nowadays who live in areas close to where my noble neighbour lord mackie of benshie and i live in the glens of angus people in dumfries and galloway and in the borders are now not making very much money at all out of their agricultural activities in the way which has applied for many years to crofters <e> <s> it is not just in the highlands that this problem arises these days <e>", "<cs> i have listened to my noble friend and having put my name to this amendment i hope he appreciates that when the time comes for the implementation of the bill unless his right honourable friend is going to prescribe all local authorities there is a chance that on the track record of this years rate increases and with a second bite of the cherry next year the base on which the whole thing will develop will be very much higher than is reasonable <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has spoken very eruditely on the subject as he always does <e> <s> he was kind enough to introduce me to some of the people who came to see him and to attend the meeting which he called <e> <s> i should have attended i had an invitation but i missed the letter <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside was also there <e> <s> i chatted a little with those representatives about their anxieties <e> <s> in the course of discussion with them i realised that some of their concern was not very well founded <e> <s> i did not feel that they understood the relationship between valuation and the level of rate at any given moment <e>", "<cs> i also received that letter although it is not immediately in front of me <e> <s> however the general gist of the letter is that the cbi support the bill <e> <s> it has consulted its small businesses consultative committee and in this respect so far as concerns small businesses and larger businesses it does not back the point that the noble lord is making <e> <s> i think probably his point is derived from the forum of private business arguments <e>", "<cs> yes i received the letter as well as the noble lord but to take that one sentence out of context is misleading <e> <s> as my noble friend lord sanderson said earlier the cbi is very concerned about the base rate and the implications of too high a base rate from the start in this system <e> <s> but so far as concerns the point about small businesses and percentage of profits it is based on a <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down it occurs to me that there is also the revenue support grant <e> <s> if a circumstance arose where central government imposed a police salaries settlement on local authorities central government would not be there very long if they did not seek to do something about it themselves <e> <s> there is the needs element <e> <s> it is called something else now but there is that part of the revenue support grant with which central government are able to do that <e> <s> as i read the bill it would not necessarily all be on the local community charge <e>", "<cs> the noble lords speech is the most significant of any we have heard because it comes straight from the coal face at which the students work <e> <s> it is interesting to note that the debate has been approached from two angles so far <e> <s> one has been that of the universities because clearly they must try to attract more not fewer overseas students <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i also thought that the noble lord lord morton of shuna put his finger on a number of the right buttons in relation to this matter <e> <s> in the case of farms the reason why the benefit of tied housing is not taxable is that in the old days to live in a tied house was compulsory <e> <s> those people were low paid and lived in very expensive areas and this was the arrangement made <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord lord ross will be able to tell me exactly when it was made <e> <s> i am not sure i know <e> <s> nowadays farm workers are mobile <e> <s> they come to work in their cars <e> <s> many do not want to live in a tied house because they prefer to live in a council house in order to be able to buy it or to begin buying a house which is not a council house <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask my noble friend how this fits in with the progress that we are making towards the separate taxation of married women and the whole analysis of that problem which your lordships select committee made in relation to the european communitys directives on that matter <e> <s> i see that it is linked to the social security arrangements but it looks very odd in the light of how everybody feels about other taxation <e> <s> is my noble and learned friend quite happy that it sits comfortably in relation to the general direction of taxation of married women <e>", "<cs> i speak in particular to amendment no which is in my name and in that of the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> on second reading i gave notice that i would want to ask the minister to look very carefully at the position of two groups the severely mentally handicapped and the severely disabled <e> <s> the minister at that time made it clear that the government had it in mind that there should be a minimum of exemptions in the bill but he gave me encouragement to pursue the matter of the mentally handicapped <e> <s> i speak to this amendment in relation to the mentally handicapped only because it seems to me that one can argue that people who are severely mentally handicapped are in a category of their own <e>", "<cs> in very brief justification i explained that there are two approaches and i have adopted one <e> <s> the argument of my noble friend lord campbell convinced me that perhaps the other way would have been the better way <e>", "<cs> i do not know how army allowances work <e> <s> however with the exception of agriculture my understanding is that in respect of pay a person receives a salary plus perhaps accommodation which is rent free or accommodation which is rent and rate free or accommodation which is rate free <e> <s> no employer will ignore that fact in the salary part of pay <e> <s> the accommodation element is taxable except in the case of agriculture which we have already discussed <e>", "<cs> i am not saying that we should legislate for that <e> <s> i am simply saying that when you fix somebodys pay as against the pay of somebody else you take account of the fact that they have free accommodation <e> <s> but if they suddenly do not have rate-free accommodation because there are not any rates surely you would take account of that <e> <s> it is reasonable <e> <s> that is nothing to do with the bill it is just absolutely obvious <e> <s> i should have thought that it was a false argument <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the people of scotland would <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has undertaken to respond at the next stage to a number of the points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> in regard to the timetable having had a word this afternoon with the noble lord i have asked that the day when the house will be fully occupied for the whole day with the rates bill should not be the day when we take this bill in the dinner hour <e> <s> i have already asked for that but there will have to be a discussion with the usual channels about when the bill will be taken <e>", "<cs> before my noble friends last intervention we had a very romantic kind of run round the highlands <e> <s> i am sure noble lords who visit the highlands from time to time were feeling quite homesick for the experience <e> <s> it sounded as we spoke as though the highlands were very different from any other part of scotland and that crofting in was totally different from farming a small farm in another part of scotland <e> <s> there was a massive bit of special pleading <e>", "<cs> this amendment to the bill is extremely good news <e> <s> there is a specific problem for sports clubs which village halls and pensioners clubs do not have and it is involved with the way in which they are valued <e> <s> i am quite sure that the governments listening ear on the matter is enormously appreciated right across scotland <e> <s> it is excellent that it can be done now for the coming year in this bill <e> <s> i should like to thank the minister very much indeed <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that it is next year <e> <s> we are already into the year in local government with respect to the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord sits down i should like to put this question to him <e> <s> he said that he listened carefully and attentively to the minister <e> <s> having done so does he consider that a simple question such as one must ask in a referendum could be suitably phrased on a subject as complicated as complex and as many faceted as is contained in this bill <e> <s> if so is the noble and learned lord saying that any bill of considerable importance to ordinary people however complicated and many faceted is suitable for a referendum and possibly should be decided by one <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain your lordships but having heard that the noble and learned lord considers we should trust the people i think the people should trust parliament only to decide to have a referendum on a suitable matter <e> <s> it is easy for the opposition to suggest this but in their hearts most experienced political people in your lordships house would find it very difficult to frame a question that would fairly allow an answer on behalf of the people of scotland to the immensely complicated question which would be before them <e> <s> it is an extremely irresponsible suggestion and i certainly shall not support it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord lord wilson decides what to do with his amendment it is important to remember that the categories of houses furnished as houses but which in effect are museums of the type that my noble friend has just described are very much dependent on local government services <e> <s> if they were totally exempt from rates other payers of the community charge would be paying extra for them <e> <s> where would those museums be which are furnished as houses and which are open to the public without the roads that lead to them without the road signs erected by the roads authority which is the regional island council to show the way to them without the recreation and tourism departments of the districts which advertise those properties without the education departments which send school parties round them and which pay to do so without the fire services which make arrangements for their safety without police advice on safety without rubbish collection without in the case of some houses coastal protection which is a regional function without sewerage facilities and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to ask a similar question <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna suggested that local authorities which have large universities within their boundary were going to suffer because the students total community charge would not be coming to them part of it from central government as part of students grant and part of it direct from the students themselves <e> <s> are we to understand that what is happening is that they are being rebated in the same way as others who receive a rebate <e> <s> if so presumably that is taken into account when fixing the revenue support grant as described in schedule to the bill which states that regard will be paid to what in the secretary of states opinion are the respective needs in that year of the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister replies i must say how much i enjoyed the smile that was seen on the face of the noble lord lord ross of marnock just now <e> <s> it was a welcome and most enjoyable sight <e> <s> it may have had something to do with the fact that we are about to break <e>", "<cs> my lords i too listened with great care to what the minister said <e> <s> it was difficult to take in precisely his phraseology and i would be glad if he could confirm that he said what the noble lord lord sanderson suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord gray made reference to some remarks that i made in a discussion at an earlier stage of which in the main this is a re-run <e> <s> it is my belief with my noble friend lord stodart of leaston that there are many farmers in other parts of the country who have similar difficulties in not dissimilar circumstances and that the amendment is therefore not a wise one <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the voluntary registration applies to establishments which are registered with the education authority and because they have partly a social work function may want to apply for registration in order to ensure that they are acceptable to local authorities for placing people in those schools and so on <e> <s> the local authorities will wish to place young people there if they are registered but it is not made compulsory because there is no need for it to be <e> <s> if they do not want to be registered they do not have to be <e> <s> they are registered in any case as schools <e> <s> that is my understanding of it <e> <s> my noble friend on the front bench may have something further to say <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord confirm that he is referring to subsection of clause <e>", "<cs> the whole of clause permits the registration of these establishments under both the and acts as i said when i first rose with registration under the act being on a voluntary basis <e> <s> special provisions are included to disapply certain enforcement and other provisions of part iv of the act which will continue to apply to establishments which are required to be registered under the act <e> <s> there are those establishments which because they have a part of their activity which they desire to register in order that they can become more acceptable to those who might place people in the establishment will wish to register but others will not <e> <s> i think that that is what i said in the first instance <e>", "<cs> i think that the establishments about which we are talking provide care in addition to education to the same children at the same time and in the same place <e> <s> therefore if one has compulsory registration in parallel in relation to those establishments it would not work <e> <s> the suggestion is that there should be informal dual registration and that that would be a considerable improvement on the present situation <e> <s> that is my understanding <e>", "<cs> i spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> to and moved them <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that it has been difficult for the noble lord to spend time analysing the bill in his usual careful way although he has done a great deal of work on it <e> <s> as one can tell from his comments <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asks questions of enormous interest <e> <s> but frankly this bill is not about how nursing homes or other establishments are set up <e> <s> the bill relates to paying fees for registration and for varying registration <e> <s> it has nothing to do with whether patients pay the community charge or whether there is a collective community charge to be paid <e> <s> personally i should certainly not be in a position to answer that question <e> <s> to do that i should have to look back at our discussions on the abolition of domestic rates etc <e> <s> scotland bill <e>", "<cs> the various parts of the bill mention adults and the establishments in which they are involved <e> <s> we were also discussing homes for adults in an earlier part of the bill <e> <s> this amendment concerns adults or children in nursing homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i for one am extremely grateful to my noble friend for reiterating that explanation <e> <s> i found it rather difficult to follow on the last occasion and i still was not absolutely clear after reading his explanation in <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must briefly pay tribute to my noble friends on the front bench especially my noble friend lord glenarthur who has been extremely patient and able in his handling of a most complicated and lengthy procedure <e> <s> it is the duty of oppositions to oppose and those of us who are comparative newcomers to this house have watched opposition of a high quality being undertaken <e> <s> i am not sure that we have had many new ideas from the other side but we have had very good very strong opposition which has been interesting to watch and beneficial to the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e> <s> in so doing i should like to thank your lordships for enabling the bills passage and for agreeing to the small but important improvements made to the bill in this house <e> <s> the bill is all the better for that <e> <s> the provisions on appeals against conditions of registration now encompass conditions made at any time and a formal system exists for the notification by local authorities of their intention to make such conditions <e> <s> in addition the provisions on charging for registration have been extended to place health boards in a similar position as regards the scope of charges to local authorities under other provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord kirkhill for his very generous remarks <e> <s> i agree with him that his noble friends questions at committee stage were exceedingly penetrating <e> <s> i am glad that he feels that the letters which my noble friend on the front bench wrote to him have cleared up such points as we were not able totally to clarify at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord annan is always a difficult act to follow but i have to try and i shall do so <e> <s> i want to say a word to enlarge upon the subject referred to by my noble friend lady blatch in her excellent maiden speech the governments proposal that in england and wales schools within the state system should be given responsibility for their own budgets and that in scotland preparations should be made for similar decentralisation by strengthening school councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we have all enjoyed the practical and in many ways rather profound if understated speech of the noble lord <e> <s> i wish to press the government on the question of educational opportunities for adults <e> <s> in practice how do they envisage ensuring that within the inner urban area strategies better basic learning opportunities are available to those who want and need them <e> <s> i am not referring to training as such nor to young peoples schooling <e> <s> my question and anxiety now are about adult basic education <e> <s> we must remember that we are talking about those who are most disadvantaged and most trapped by the locality in which they live <e> <s> it can so easily happen that the new and refurbished houses the new forms of tenure the new jobs appearing in an area arc all snapped up by people coming from outside simply because those people are better equipped better informed and more confident people <e> <s> that leaves existing residents no better placed than they were <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that response <e> <s> it is extremely helpful to the house in perceiving the value of tvi <e> <s> does he agree that in its excellent survey of tvi the national confederation of parent-teachers associations asked parents whether in relation to their childrens schooling in general they felt that they had enough say in what their children learnt and how <e> <s> further as a result of that question much more than

core curriculum and that computer studies as a discrete subject are for those who want to specialise in that subject <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> my lords have the government made any approach to the open university for help in designing these very important training courses for school governors <e> <s> if they have have they had a satisfactory response <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble

want a job and cannot find a job and so are drawing benefit and that many women who are in part-time work or looking for part-time work are very satisfied with that type of work <e> <s> there is absolutely nothing wrong with counting those women as individuals and not as half people <e>", "<cs> it has been a pleasure to see the noble lord lord ross again <e> <s> the greatest pleasure was to

noble friend tell us why it is that english water authorities are not included in the bill <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the amendment meets the problem because i have not been involved in its drafting nor in the discussions <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> i would not go along with the noble baroness lady stedman that the solution is to say that the local authority has to retain the labour <e> <s> as one noble lord opposite said we are in a completely new ball game where we may have a situation where all the people working in these various areas of activity in a locality are working for private employers <e> <s> we need to be assured by the minister that if for whatever reason a service breaks down the bill does not prevent the local authority finding someone else to do it by whatever means

arrangement could be made in the contract to ensure that equipment that could not come from anywhere else was available for anyone else to use <e> <s> for example if the collection of refuse is contracted out and the authority owns thousands of expensive wheeled-bins which they have just bought presumably the contract will be to use those wheeled-bins <e> <s> they will not all be put in a cocoon or thrown away <e> <s> if in that situation the service broke down say the firm went bust the wheeled-bins would still be there <e> <s> that will all need to be thought about by the local

will not accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i gave reasons at that time and i shall not repeat them as to why i thought the benefit of tendering should be available to people in the islands because

this amendment it seems as if sport and lesiure were going to be included in the list and as if the noble lord lord graham were moving an amendment to say that they should not be able to be included in the list <e> <s> however my understanding from earlier stages of the bill is that the whole subject of whether this area of local authority activity should be included in the list is at the moment out for consultation with local authorities and others interested <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what my noble friend is thinking on this matter <e> <s> however the problem is the same in scotland as in the various counties to which the noble lord lord graham has referred <e> <s> i do not think that this amendment will suffice because the wording does not make sense <e> <s> it refers to at a primary school or village school <e> <s> in the scottish context village schools are nearly always primary schools <e> <s> i do not know whether the amendment refers to all primary schools which have someone who is responsible for the security of the building or all schools in villages whether secondary or primary schools <e> <s> i draw attention to that fact <e> <s> however i shall listen with great interest to what my noble friend says because this is a matter that has also been raised in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the pleasure of holding on to a large number of these red telephone boxes will spread further than this country <e> <s> when i asked a question in the house some time ago your lordships discussion was recorded far afield including in the press

prolonged absence <e> <s> it is good to hear her as ever making an informed and well-thought-out contribution <e> <s> i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not implying that at all <e> <s> disabled people often make the best employees <e> <s> they often make more money for their employers than able-bodied people <e> <s> i was questioning the place in the bill of a discussion of the policy of a company on employing disabled people <e> <s> the bill concerns tendering and the mechanical process of tendering <e> <s> i was commenting on the out-of-date nature of contract compliance and the fact that the amendment would frustrate the purposes of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the main point has not been mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> the question is whether in operating the tendering procedure local authorities should be asked to assist in enforcing a law in other companies through a tendering procedure a law other than one which it is already a mandatory requirement for them to enforce <e> <s> they have the mandatory duty to assist in enforcing race discrimination legislation <e> <s> they do not have a mandatory duty to do this in relation to sex discrimination <e> <s> this point was made clear at previous stages of the bill <e> <s> this is the nub of the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down does she agree with me that whereas the race relations legislation is part of the mandatory responsibility of the local authority the sex discrimination legislation is not and therefore it would be difficult to discriminate between the two <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not realise that i was out of order <e> <s> i thought that i had the right to ask for clarification <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly in this discussion because for a number of years i was a commissioner in the manpower services commission so i have immediate experience of how it has worked in the past and perhaps can imagine how it would work in the future under the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> i imagine that that is how we used to talk but quite honestly i think that the nation now understands that it would be at the tucs peril if it tried to hold up such an excellent scheme when we can all see how well the youth training scheme has developed <e> <s> i should not have thought that the tuc would want to do so <e> <s> nor would i hope that the tuc would want to withdraw from the commission because it has an enormous and important contribution to make as it has all along <e> <s> what the noble lord lord dean said was indeed true <e> <s> the contribution of the trade unions to the development of training has been crucial <e>", "<cs> i should quickly like to complete my argument <e> <s> of course that is true and the <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just interrupt the noble baroness <e> <s> i was not suggesting that the tuc input was not altogether helpful <e> <s> i was chairman of the committee for scotland for several years and the tuc input was enormously helpful <e> <s> i was merely pointing out the pragmatic fact that the structure of the commission with three cbi and three tuc members which had been the vision of my noble friend lord carr and subsequently was the way in which the commission was set up held matters up and made them painfully slow <e> <s> however that was not in any way a criticism of the trade union members in their relationship to yts <e>", "<cs> i do not know the extent to which the noble lord lord basnett has looked at what the manpower services commission has been doing for the disabled over the past few years but it is widely admired all over europe <e> <s> the working up of schemes of the manpower services commission took time for everybody and took time for the disabled <e> <s> the noble lord was quite right about that <e>", "<cs> i am bound to confess that i cannot remember the precise wording of the act on the subject <e> <s> all i know is that the services and the training are now there and it is not as my noble friend suggested we are not merely talking about unemployed young people we are talking about people with disabilities in training for work on the yts <e> <s> we are talking about the whole range of training and opportunities which will help people obtain employment <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness decides what to do with her amendment as she is the one who understands how the scheme works on the ground because she is involved with it on her area manpower board i ask her whether it is not rather misleading to talk about yts as we did on the previous amendment and on this as if it were comparable to applying for a job <e> <s> the yts guarantees a place <e> <s> a number of girls and boys whom i know have gone on one scheme which was not per cent <e> <s> what they wanted <e> <s> they managed to move to another <e> <s> some have managed to move to three because they have not found what they wanted <e> <s> they are not sunk if they go on the wrong scheme <e> <s> is it not a much better discipline and much more realistic for them to approach training as is suggested in the bill as it stands but with the understanding that the real object is to put them into something in which they are interested which they enjoy and which motivates them <e> <s> that is what the youth training scheme is all about <e> <s> i should be interested to know whether the noble baroness agrees with me <e>", "<cs> my lords we are all extremely grateful for the opportunity which has been given to us for this fascinating debate <e> <s> the skill and expertise of managers is crucial not just in business as has been discussed by noble lords so far but also in the health service in local government and in schools particularly under the impending regime <e> <s> my noble friend lord huntly spoke in his eloquent speech of business schools in the private sector <e> <s> i wish to speak particularly about open and distance learning for management education <e> <s> in order to do that i wish to draw on my experience of the open university where i am a member of the governing board <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord graham who also has extensive involvement there will wish to add to what i have to say <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend tell the house what progress the government are making over the provision of opportunities for adult basic education for those who have been out of work for some time and whether it has proved effective <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael emphasised the importance of looking at the bill from the point of view of the tenants of the housing we are discussing <e> <s> i agree with that and i wish to confine my few remarks to the implications of the bill for council house tenants and those on waiting lists in the massive council estates which have long been a problematical feature of our scottish cities and urban burghs the kind of estates to which the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe referred <e>", "<cs> my lords apart from the clauses covering universities the bill is about england and wales <e> <s> i should like briefly to mention one or two points where i believe the scottish experience is perhaps helpful in the consideration of a bill which concerns england and wales <e>", "<cs> will my noble friend say whether he agrees with me that an additional very important point in all this is that the district housing authority which is the district or island council which has the job of operating the act has in many cases to work also with the social work department which is a regional or island council function <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right however to say that this does not apply in all cases and that there are different kinds of people who become homeless <e>", "<cs> are we not discussing this as if the district councils were not the local planning authorities and regional councils were not the strategic planning authorities <e> <s> there is the overall structure plan for the regions and the local plans of the districts <e> <s> i should have thought that all <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble viscount has put forward an idea based on experience in the highland region <e> <s> i do not know whether he has worked out the size of the committee for strathclyde with somebody from each housing authority <e> <s> i do not know whether there is a representative of the tenants on each housing authority or whether the people of argyll might have to represent the people of glasgow <e> <s> i should not have thought that that would be very acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that there is perhaps some scope for us in scotland to learn from the discussions on the <e>", "<cs> i wish to back up what the noble lord lord morton of shuna has just said about the question of the written lease for assured tenants <e> <s> some of the aspects of this bill i find quite hard to follow <e> <s> this one i do not find hard to follow at all <e> <s> i am myself accustomed when letting houses or indeed when i have leased a house to require a written lease and to supply a written lease <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that it is the only way to avoid trouble <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say about this because it seems strange to me that we have not got any further on this particular aspect when the issue appears to be pretty clear <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to make some encouraging noises on this issue <e> <s> if not i shall be rather concerned <e>", "<cs> i agree with what has been said about key money <e> <s> my experience does not enable me to know whether this provision must be included under the new circumstances created by the bill <e> <s> where the market price is set for rent does the situation arise in the same way as it has in the past <e> <s> the system may be self-regulating <e> <s> i should like to be sure that what is feared is not possible <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that people may be at the mercy of a landlord when they are cornered into doing something which they cannot afford <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will explain why it is necessary to include this provision in the bill having regard to the new atmosphere that we are now creating <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an amazing amendment <e> <s> the concept of making it possible for the market to operate and for new money to come into housing which is fundamental to the bill will be undermined if previous succession rights are to be restored <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is an experienced lawyer and knows this subject in great detail <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend the minister said that spouses would have succession <e> <s> that was new in the long statement that he made <e> <s> apart from that the amendment would change the fundamental concept of the bill and surely cannot be accepted by the government <e> <s> unless my noble friend the minister suggests otherwise i shall have to oppose it <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i have understood the issue but i should like to point out that when a valuation is put on a property the potential area of available purchasers is taken into account <e> <s> surely it is essential that the district valuer should take note of the fact that this is a restricted market <e> <s> that is stated in the bill <e> <s> is this not a perfectly reasonable clause <e> <s> i do not fully understand what the noble lord lord grimond is worried about <e> <s> one cannot consider the market to be fully open when it is not <e>", "<cs> this is a rather complex matter and it is difficult to understand how clause works <e> <s> i hope the committee will forgive me if i have misunderstood but it seems to me that as the bill stands the success of this measure depends on the tenant not agreeing to a rent which is in excess of the figure that the rent officer will eventually fix <e> <s> is the noble lord lord morton going to put me right on this <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i think that is my understanding but it seems to me that if the bill is to remain as it is and i have not yet heard my noble friends argument for or against this amendment somehow the tenant in fixing the rent with the landlord in the first place must be able to know fairly well what will happen when the rent officer comes to assess it <e> <s> it seems to me that my noble friend has to explain to me how the <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i point out that the noble earls question was linked with a point that i did not fully understand <e> <s> in striking the deal with the landlord the student or the person who is entitled to the benefit has to know that the deal will work for him before he strikes the deal <e> <s> we heard my noble friend amplify the fact that the local authority can pay more than the benefit <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> however in making the deal in the first place the potential tenant has to know what that figure is likely to be or am i misunderstanding the point <e> <s> how does one find out whether one is a potential tenant in that position <e> <s> i can see that the amendment will not work <e> <s> it will spoil the intention of the bill <e> <s> but how will the tenant know what deal to strike <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord spoke i thought that i began to see how the arrangement might work <e> <s> the amendment suggests that rent should also be limited by the tenant to the market value <e> <s> let us suppose that the tenant is not then paid benefit <e> <s> that may easily happen if somebody takes a house when he is unemployed and then obtains a job <e> <s> the rent is set at a wrong amount <e> <s> that must surely be part of the argument also must it not <e>", "<cs> if i am unemployed i would have every hope that i should obtain a job within the year and i am capable of earning a reasonable salary <e> <s> in the meantime i am entitled to benefit <e> <s> i might well take on a house at a somewhat higher rent in anticipation but then this situation may arise in which case the amendment of the noble lord would not hold good <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has put his finger on the point of the discussion <e> <s> i do not imagine that the noble lord lord taylor believes that a clause such as this will be included in the bill <e> <s> presumably this is a probing amendment because i do not imagine that one would agree to legislation to <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will give way he is with the greatest respect misleading the committee somewhat about the position in scotland <e> <s> we do not call it the national curriculum <e> <s> the common curriculum in scotland covers areas of study just as the present proposals do <e> <s> it is not an identical list <e> <s> however i went into this in some detail to make a comparison <e> <s> what is intended here is precisely the same although it is expressed in different terms <e> <s> the misleading part comes from the suggestion as his noble friend lord glenamara suggested that this was an imposed curriculum <e> <s> it identifies areas of study in the way that the scottish common curriculum does <e> <s> it is not so very different <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the minister <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in the extract which he read from the report on the teaching of english which was published yesterday did i hear that what it says about year-olds conflicts with amendment no <e> <s> or did i mishear <e>", "<cs> i think we all understand the difference between foundation subjects and those which constitute the core <e> <s> we are becoming very muddled in our discussion of this matter <e> <s> we are not clear about this part of the bill <e> <s> we might ask the minister whether for clarification it needs to say foundation and core <e> <s> if it does he could bring forward an amendment <e> <s> if not and if somebody else wants to pursue it he can explain <e> <s> as to the programmes of study he said in the first place that some programmes would be issued as guidelines <e> <s> that seemed to me in spite of the confusion to be a perfectly clear response <e> <s> i wonder whether the committee will agree that that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has put the case very clearly <e> <s> she has generalised on a particular case in sussex <e> <s> it seems to me that if such an occurrence is possible the government should try to ensure that there cannot be room for it <e> <s> it is extraordinary to think that there is any school where it is not possible at least to contemplate taking a different examination although it depends how it works out <e> <s> if a large number of pupils in the school want to take a different examination it is probably possible to do it quite cost-effectively <e> <s> however if only one or two are concerned it could cause extra cost and one may have to think whether there is perhaps a way for parents to meet the cost of the entrance to the exam which was what happened in the authority where i was involved in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch has made a speech which is consistent with the points of view which he has so often expressed in this house <e> <s> we have listened to him with great interest but i think perhaps he has forgotten that local government will not be financed solely through the community charge per cent <e> <s> of it will be paid for by the taxpayer and a further per cent <e> <s> through the business rate <e> <s> i think that slightly alters the balance of the argument that he put forward <e>", "<cs> it is very difficult to tell <e> <s> it was not a disaster for the conservative party <e> <s> the vote went up slightly <e> <s> the great increase was in the vote of the scottish national party and that has to do with the very sort of talk which i have just been describing <e> <s> there is no question about that <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what my noble friend said <e> <s> i hope she realises that this amendment is not just about what is traditionally called adult education as i believe it seemed when the noble baroness was speaking although i may be mistaken <e> <s> it is also about the use of schools by all kinds of groups for example youth groups the girl guides association the scouts the womens institute and other such groups <e>", "<cs> i am not altogether happy with the reply of my noble friend <e> <s> i do not believe she has picked up the point i was making probably because i did not make it very well and it is late in the evening <e> <s> as regards the first amendment she said that the governing body has to consult the head teacher before it responds to the scheme for financial delegation <e> <s> i said that that was so but my point was that when the lea originally consults the governing body before it draws up the scheme for financial delegation it does not have to consult the head teacher <e> <s> that is the flaw <e> <s> i hope the minister will look at that matter <e>", "<cs> it may be that my noble friend will find that this matter should be set out in guidance but the points have to be covered somewhere <e> <s> not all head teachers will decide that they want to be governors <e> <s> my own view is that they get on very much better if they are not governors <e> <s> the head teacher who sits back while the governors meet without a vote but as their principal adviser and now as chief executive may well be in a much stronger position to carry out his or her role <e> <s> this point needs to be considered <e> <s> it is very late and we still have a long way to go <e> <s> for the present i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a need for imagination here with the greatest respect to my noble and learned friend <e> <s> this is not the normal discussion about representation that we have had so often in this chamber where people are trying to say something else when talking about representation <e> <s> what we are talking about is the educational process that goes on when students represent the student body on the governing body what all the students learn from the to-ing and fro-ing between the governing body and the students and what happens as a result in the government of the institution <e> <s> this is all of extreme importance <e> <s> many of us here have experienced it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i am not convinced that the requirements in this amendment are exactly right though the amendment is certainly right in principle <e> <s> i do not think that we have to explain the differences to my noble and learned friend

government <e> <s> i should know but i do not <e> <s> if he has i notice that the noble earl is shaking his head he would know that very often two councils next door to each other obtain quite different value for money <e> <s> one will get a far better education service for the same amount per head than another <e> <s> that is a fact and that is what local government is all about <e> <s>

the whole idea that will gradually develop <e> <s> in five years time this will all be understood by everybody <e> <s> it is easy for members of the committee to make faces but this provision could be the thing that more than anything else helped people who had dropped out of society <e> <s> if one thinks this matter through and talks positively with people who are running such organisations i am as involved as anybody else with the organisations i think that this provision can and will be seen to be of value <e> <s> this is one of the most difficult aspects of the whole exercise and it must be dealt with by the committee <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down can he tell the committee how the ordinary elector knows whether his council is doing well or badly or how it compares with another council <e> <s> can the noble lord answer that question in a sentence because that is the crux of the matter <e>", "<cs> i too raised this matter during second reading <e> <s> it is clearly very important <e> <s> i agree that some students are very tight financially <e> <s> i understood my noble friend to say that account was going to be taken of students costs of living and their expenses when their grants are considered <e> <s> it is important that the per cent <e> <s> community charge should be accepted from now on as part of the living expenses of students as it will be for everybody <e> <s> if my noble friend has said that i am content <e> <s> can he please confirm what he said in the second part of his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the whole point of financial delegation to schools and setting up the new governing bodies that decision-making in future will devolve to schools and not be done in the des or in the local authorities <e> <s> that is where the people are who know what teaching and children are all about <e> <s> that is the whole ethos of the bill <e> <s> is it not very important that the house should accept that <e>", "<cs> i remember being very much involved in the amendment on the scottish bill <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies i should like to clarify what i said <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter thought that i was arguing for a general disability allowance <e> <s> i was not doing that at all <e> <s> i was suggesting that everybody except the very few who are exempt should pay something and that we should ensure that they have the money to do it which is precisely what will happen in respect of people who are on the highest amount of benefit <e> <s> it is the same argument <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i did not hear the noble baroness introduce the amendment because i was called out of the chamber <e> <s> i should like to make one point and i should particularly like to make it in the presence of the right reverend prelate who spoke so well on the subject and issued a note of <e>", "<cs> that is why i look forward to hearing how these groups are to be related <e> <s> i do not know <e> <s> there are various categories of people who are paid allowances to cover costs and pocket-money is meant to cover costs <e> <s> i meant to say so <e> <s> it is a related point <e> <s> however i still believe that we should not say that because their work is so marvellous and they do not receive a salary they should be exempt from paying the community charge <e> <s> that is my argument <e>", "<cs> the government do not pay the pocket-money <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this second reading debate <e> <s> in a small way this subject is an inspiration to us <e> <s> we have certainly borne out the fact that there is no subject which arises in your lordships house which does not find a number of experts to speak upon it <e> <s> we have heard the noble lord lord gallacher speaking as a prominent member of the select committee on the european communities particularly on the agricultural side <e> <s> he knows much about what is going on within the community and he was able to bring that experience to bear in what he said <e> <s> he referred to the producers of lower-strength scotch whisky and any anxieties they may have <e> <s> this was discussed very fully in another place <e> <s> as my noble friend on the front bench said this matter requires an enormous amount of consultation before any minimum strength is fixed <e> <s> all those people will be consulted <e> <s> that assurance was given in another place and i think i can give it now too <e>", "<cs> just for the record i think that when the noble lord recollects the debate we had about the inclusion of age in the register he will realise that we had an important discussion about that aspect <e> <s> the government were asked to include age in order to make it easier to tell one john smith from another in the same household <e> <s> we were told that often one has the grandfather the grandson and the son i am getting my generations confused in the same household <e> <s> however what i mean is that there are sometimes three john smiths in the one household and therefore the provision would help identify which was which <e> <s> nevertheless we received an assurance i think the noble lord has forgotten this that the age would not be on the published register that would be the part that was not published <e> <s> that was why the provision was agreed to <e> <s> it is a most important point <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord lord meston replies i believe that he said that one of his anxieties was that the ethnic origin of the community charge payers would be on the register <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether that is correct <e>", "<cs> i understood the noble lord lord meston to say that one of his major concerns was that the ethnic origin of community charge payers would be revealed on the register <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord dean a question <e> <s> he started off by talking about the yts <e> <s> that has nothing to do with it because the community charge does not apply until the age of and the yts ends at <e> <s> the other scheme is the job training scheme and as i understood it my noble friend said that the amount a person gets on a job training scheme above benefit level would be disregarded so i do not really understand what the noble lord is actually talking about <e>", "<cs> i believe this point is quite important and we have not entirely sorted it out <e> <s> it seems to me that the change on the scottish bill was that the student instead of being rebated according to income would pay per cent <e> <s> what we did not know was whether that would be taken as part of the cost of living in consideration of the sum which the student grant would be in any given year <e>", "<cs> i do not believe this is the right way to look at the issue <e> <s> it seems to me that the critical factor in fixing what a student pays is that which will make the student appreciate whether local government spending increases or decreases how the value for money relates to that and how it compares with what other students are paying in other local authority areas <e> <s> the total sum that a student is paying is critical <e> <s> the proportion depends on the size of the grant <e> <s> i would only wish to put it up if the proportion he is paying for education becomes less in order to maintain the figure at about the same level <e> <s> that could happen <e> <s> should the proportion that the student pays through the grant go up very much which could happen then the proportion could become less presumably <e> <s> the critical factor is that we worked out on a community charge that it would be about p per week <e> <s> if that increases or decreases by a few pence that would be noticeable <e> <s> it would have to do that or the point is missed by the student <e>", "<cs> should this amendment be adopted it would surely be an extraordinary innovation in local government <e> <s> at the moment one of the major items of consideration when striking a rate is the amount to be allowed for in respect of what will not be collected because of evasion <e> <s> it is the responsibility of local government to make an assessment of that <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble lord lord hayter said <e> <s> i have not had the privilege of seeing the ncvo brief or its figures but i see the point of it very much because it is an area in which i myself am involved north of the border <e> <s> recollecting as i do the process within a local authority of going through applications for per cent <e> <s> discretionary relief to be given by the local authority on top of per cent <e> <s> mandatory relief such as we have at the moment i realise that charities do vary enormously <e> <s> the staff on local authorities find this as regards the applications that come before them from charities <e> <s> some really do not merit per cent <e> <s> relief because they have ways of raising funds for themselves within the organisation <e> <s> they do not necessarily have ways of making a profit but they can raise funds which partly meet the rates that they have to pay <e>", "<cs> is it not this sides turn <e>", "<cs> following that exchange i should like briefly to refer to what happened in scotland because it is important to understand that <e> <s> in the region in which i was operating as a councillor when we had revaluation the total rate base of the region stayed the same that is the total valuation of properties in the region stayed the same <e> <s> however for some of the commercial properties in the town where i live the rateable value increased enormously <e> <s> in other places it dropped <e>", "<cs> although my noble friend says that this is a general amendment covering the whole of the country it is tailor-made to affect that which westminster council does for the english national opera <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the people of this country have become accustomed to the concept that they elect councillors to decide on their behalf on the level of local services and that if those councillors prove to be totally wild central government will come to the rescue <e> <s> they elect members of parliament for that purpose <e> <s> there are two legs to the whole understanding of local government <e>", "<cs> i may be misunderstanding the noble lord lord mcintosh but as regards the use of the word unlawful the following is stated in the bill under clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has based his argument on the fact that the community charge in edinburgh glasgow and tayside is likely to be between and a year <e> <s> many people are bandying figures about <e> <s> it is very strange that in scotland if i remember rightly from our discussions on the scottish act the community charge covers per cent <e> <s> of the total local government expenditure whereas in england and wales it covers per cent <e> <s> the governments figure for the average community charge at the moment in england and wales is <e> <s> although i realise that there are some aspects of scottish life which cause more to be spent on local government how can a figure be suggested that is twice the average for england and wales when the proportion of local government expenditure is only per cent <e> <s> as opposed to per cent <e> <s> i do not understand <e>", "<cs> e noble lord explain this point to me <e> <s> he is very knowledgeable on these matters <e> <s> it seems to me that an explanation is needed <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord i do not think that i am missing the point <e> <s> if i were a nurse i should think that there was a considerable difference between being expected to pay in one year or <e> <s> i would calculate the difference between what i paid of the rate element in my rent and the or the <e> <s> the difference would he an extra <e> <s> i should consider that very important <e> <s> that is part of the argument <e>", "<cs> we must not treat this just as raw figures and talk about <e> <s> i become more and more concerned about this because the poorest student nurses are worried stiff by what noble lords and other politicians are saying <e> <s> if those student nurses are on low incomes and presumably they are they will be rebated <e> <s> there is a chart about the rebates which my noble friend sitting beside me has and which i do not fully understand <e> <s> however the rebate will be considerable for student nurses <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord hayter in what if i may say so was an excellent speech said he thought that the view he had taken and which the proposers of the amendment and the others who have so far spoken have taken was the broad view <e> <s> that implies that the view that is taken by those who agree with the notion that everybody with very few exceptions should contribute to local government services is a narrower view <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i must ask him not to assume that i do not know any poor people or that i have not discussed this subject with extremely poor people <e> <s> the bill concerns england <e> <s> i do not know haringey and i do not know london but there are a lot of poor people in scotland <e> <s> not all of them agree at all with the noble lord <e> <s> i ask him to respect the integrity of what noble lords say and not assume that if they disagree with him they do not know what they are talking about <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord morton has thought about the time element involved <e> <s> i quite understand that once the whole procedure is computerised and the names of those who have died travel as fast as light to the centre it will all happen with some speed <e> <s> however it is extremely important that people who become widows or widowers should not receive the community charge bill of their deceased husband or wife in a short space of time after they have died <e> <s> i should have thought that speed is of the essence <e> <s> therefore until the computer programme is organised and everything linked up the notification has to be local <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend the minister has anything to say about that <e>", "<cs> i cannot imagine that this exercise would be very costly <e> <s> it may be but i should not have thought so <e> <s> surely it would not be possible for this to be done speedily at the moment if the procedure were centralised <e> <s> like the noble lord lord morton i have a good deal of faith in scottish local authorities <e> <s> i am sure that they will perform the task in a sensible way <e> <s> if it is done locally it can be <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies i must say to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that although his instinct may be that it is extremely un-scottish to have anything to do with a lottery tayside regional council mooted the idea of a lottery to raise money for sports and leisure facilities <e> <s> a number of councillors objected strongly to that idea <e> <s> they said they could not possibly vote for it <e> <s> they went home for the weekend <e> <s> when they came back the following week they had to confess that they could not find anyone who objected to such a proposal <e> <s> tayside regional council ran a successful lottery <e> <s> everyone rather enjoyed and accepted it <e> <s> it is not necessarily an un-scottish notion although of course the lottery was not applied to paying for the community charge <e> <s> it was to raise money for local government facilities <e> <s> one should <e>", "<cs> just to follow what the noble lord said i do not believe that he had realised that a lottery had been run by at least one local authority in scotland <e> <s> i do not know whether it has been done by others <e> <s> it was accepted by people <e> <s> the council did not push it but people backed it and enjoyed it <e>", "<cs> to give the bill its due it provides only that a council may run a lottery <e> <s> it does not have to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is good to hear the scottish education system being extolled so strongly in your lordships house especially by an english lord and an english baroness <e> <s> far be it for me <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships forgiveness <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies perhaps i may ask the noble baroness lady blackstone whether she really suggests that my noble friend ought to agree to legislate that assessment arrangements should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord peston for his support <e> <s> evidently that did not spoil the impact of my remarks and i am extremely grateful to my noble friend for what he said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government have comparative figures for the situation under the existing laws of sunday trading in scotland and that in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and with the leave of the house perhaps i may ask him whether what he has said means that local authorities will take into account the higher unit costs of smaller schools when they are fixing the formula by which the budget is settled <e> <s> will they also take into account the extra costs of certain laboratories which are provided and the higher costs of schools in certain parts <e> <s> will all that be taken into account under the scheme and therefore the schools which are fearful that the financial delegation will militate against them have nothing to fear <e> <s> is that what he is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the government amendments to which my noble friend has just spoken are indeed good news <e> <s> when at committee stage my noble friend lady young and i tabled a group of amendments all concerned with the position of the head teacher of a school operating a delegated budget we felt that the amendments raised important issues <e> <s> we were i am bound to say a touch disappointed at what seemed to us at the time a somewhat non-committal answer from the government <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady young who intimated that she would not be present thought that the amendment would probably fall <e> <s> i am very glad that it has not done so as the noble lord lord peston has picked it up <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a particularly good idea that my noble friend has put forward <e> <s> the one aspect that will be desirable once a school has decided to opt out is that it should be free of political manoeuvring and thinking and that the governors and staff should be able to get on with the job of running the school <e> <s> if there are people in the area who regret that the school has moved out of the local authority and people in the local authority who are desperate to get it back there will be constant politicisation at least on that issue <e> <s> i should have thought it unlikely that schools would want to opt back <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i hope that this point will be made clear because as the bill stands it is not clear at all <e> <s> if it is not the home address that is referred to it is peculiar that the provision is in the bill at all because everybody knows that the head teacher is at the school <e> <s> it presumably deals with contacting the head teacher inside school hours <e> <s> i suppose that is why it is in the bill <e> <s> as long as it is made absolutely clear somewhere that it is not necessary for the head teacher to publish his or her home address i think those people who are anxious about this matter will be satisfied <e> <s> with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down i take absolutely the point that she has just made <e> <s> it is entirely right that the local authorities should not go on receiving funding for schools that no longer belong to them <e> <s> however my noble friend will have to look again at the clause to which amendment no <e> <s> related <e> <s> on that amendment my noble friend said that a local authority must continue to pay the cost of borrowing in relation to a school which no longer belongs to it <e> <s> that could be a large sum for a long time <e> <s> the two answers given by my noble friend conflict <e> <s> i know that we are not now discussing the previous amendment but it connects with what she just said and i think my noble friend will find that there is considerable illogicality <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the spirit of this amendment <e> <s> i do not know what are the technicalities of it or what is the attitude of my noble friend <e> <s> in scotland we have a slightly more robust approach to the matter <e> <s> we have a great problem with truancy but we have the availability of the sheriffs court which is where the parents appear if their children perpetually absent themselves from school <e> <s> that is a great help <e> <s> i do not believe that sheriffs courts can be introduced into england for this purpose <e> <s> i believe that the points made by my noble friend and from the cross benches are extremely important but whether this bill can be the vehicle for implementing these measures i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know what my noble friends attitude to this amendment is going to be <e> <s> the noble lord lord henderson has just said that the governing bodies must have the expertise <e> <s> with the greatest respect to the noble lord that is not what governors are there for <e> <s> they are there to consider the whole of the needs of the school they do not necessarily have any particular special expertise <e> <s> pedagogical expertise should be within the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords the speeches we have heard so far are most familiar and i go along with them in that adult education is very important and is becoming increasingly important in our society <e> <s> however the issue is what the amendment is seeking to add to the bill which is not already there <e>", "<cs> my lords i go along with all that has been said except the last remarks <e> <s> a little preprandial discussion on scotland does no harm at all <e> <s> however the truth of the matter is that there have always been two ways of funding the universities in scotland <e> <s> they could be funded separately or together as a whole <e> <s> as the noble lord lord morton has said steac the scottish tertiary education advisory council recommended that the funding should be separate <e> <s> they did not in fact recommend the proposal in the amendment but stated that the funding of the scottish universities should be channelled through the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know but presumably the funding council would be on a level with the english funding council and it would not be done through the scottish education system <e> <s> however i do not know <e> <s> if it is against what half the universities want i should have thought that that was an argument very much against the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the spirit of the amendment <e> <s> continuing education is of extreme importance not least at the higher education level <e> <s> i am quite sure that the noble lord is right to highlight the need for strategic thinking about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the people who worked on the scottish bill have been considering this matter for a long time because it arose previously <e> <s> we appreciate that the the crucial question is where one draws the borderline <e> <s> that is what we are talking about <e> <s> the noble lord lord marsh touched upon the argument that the collecting of the community charge from the least well off people is nonsense <e> <s> although one can say that noble lords know that i do not think it is nonsense <e> <s> we discussed that at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am bothered about this matter <e> <s> in our attempt to do what all in the house thought was right to ensure that severely mentally handicapped people do not have to pay the charge we are having to ask that something be said about someone which we would much prefer did not have to be said <e> <s> on reflection i do not think that it would have made any difference if the house had gone the way the noble lord lord allen would have preferred which if i recollect it correctly would be to have a per cent <e> <s> rebate rather than exemption <e> <s> however there would be a problem defining who was to receive it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister answers can he confirm that i am right in <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he confirm that the list which will be available to the public will have on it only the names and addresses <e> <s> is that right <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend replies to the debate i too should like to say that i greatly admire the way in which the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale put the problem and the way in which he attached what seemed to me to be credible figures to the example which he gave so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the government have shut their mind to it <e> <s> does he appreciate that many of us think it right to treat men and women who are living together as individuals whether or not they are married <e> <s> we are glad to see this <e> <s> i think that my noble friends reply explains that clearly <e> <s> i did not know the answer when the noble lord asked the question and i think that i do now <e> <s> i should think that cosla would very much appreciate that answer <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not nark about that <e> <s> at last the government are treating people as individuals <e> <s> we think that that is excellent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the secretary of state for scotland requires any prompting from this house or by the bill to take the opportunity to comment on any question of the closure of ravenscraig or the sale of any piece of machinery owned by british steel in scotland <e> <s> it is rather strange that many noble lords have spoken this afternoon in a rather negative and frightened way about the future <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not it is appropriate to mention that british steel has announced its profits today <e> <s> it has doubled its profits and is now the most profitable steel industry in europe <e> <s> it seems to me that we should be talking positively about the contribution of we scots to the manufacture of steel in europe and in the world <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady fisher is describing a scene which occurs quite often <e> <s> however as i understand the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael someone could move in a year before the tenant died and could inherit the lease <e> <s> was it for one year <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> i understood that <e> <s> it seems absolutely admirable and necessary that the spouse should be able to inherit <e> <s> that is a different issue altogether <e> <s> however for somebody to be able to move in for one year and then to have the tenancy for the whole of his or her life which could happen very often

for the single homeless was kind enough to write to me about the matter <e> <s> i believe that it represents the interests of a number of other bodies <e> <s> although the amendment is somewhat different from that which it was backing that of the noble lord lord mackie i am sure that it will be most pleased to find that key money will be illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very interested to hear what my noble friend says about the amendment <e> <s> i do not know enough about the technicalities to know how it would work but i know that there is a problem particularly in university towns such as edinburgh and glasgow where rooms are let to students <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not going to intervene because what i know about this issue i have read in the press <e> <s> i saw an article in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall listen with very great interest to what my noble friend says when he replies to the noble lord lord mackie <e> <s> i too have our homeland of angus in mind where there have been groups of houses built in quite small clusters and in particular in villages where people who are retiring from working in the countryside wish to go <e> <s> the nature of these clusters of houses is extremely important to the way that people live <e> <s> i have not seen the details of the letter <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend has said about small areas coming within the one-third figure <e> <s> if so those small clusters could probably be protected in the way that the noble lord lord mackie has in mind <e> <s> i shall listen to the reply with much interest <e> <s> it sounds extremely important to me <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for attending to this matter <e> <s> in view of the discussion that we have just had on the previous amendment i should like to remind noble lords that the front bench strongly resisted eight or amendments which i and my noble friend lady young tabled regarding the position of head teachers

do set myself up in opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a word about people who are living in the council housing of rural local authorities <e> <s> i believe that the provisions of the clause will be extremely helpful and attractive if the council housing in which they live is not where they wish to stay indefinitely or housing which they wish to buy <e> <s> it is possible that many people will wish to buy a house in another area <e> <s> the new clause may even enable people to buy houses on farms which are no longer required and which farmers wish to sell but which may need a lot of money spent on them <e> <s> it may be possible to receive a grant in those circumstances <e> <s> such a scheme would be attractive to a rural local authority because it would enable the authority to free houses for the use of homeless people or those on waiting lists <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may ask my noble friend if he can answer my question about the area in which the house has to be located <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether progress in this respect is as fast in scotland as it is in the rest of the uk <e>", "<cs> i have not been following the bill but i have been listening very carefully to this debate <e> <s> if the labour partys point is that it is the tenants who should be consulted and not the local authority why did

<e>", "<cs> the convention of scottish local authorities was kind enough to tell me of its anxieties in relation to budgeting and to give me a detailed breakdown <e> <s> it is natural that local authorities are concerned that the government should continue to watch these costs year by year and that in normal consultations with cosla the costs of school boards will be discussed <e> <s> i

very important for head teachers to be clear about this <e> <s> they should know exactly where they stand as regards the school hoard <e> <s> head teachers frequently find themselves walking a tightrope <e> <s> to an extent they are accountable to parents and to the children themselves and they are also accountable to their employers <e> <s> the implementation of the authoritys policy in the school is a matter of great delicacy and one which teachers regard as part of their professional skill <e> <s> that is what equips them to be head teachers <e>", "<cs> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> indeed it is probably laid down in the standing orders of all the regional councils that if there is a tie it should be decided by lot in some way <e> <s> in some instances it will be by drawing a straw and in others i believe a pack of cards is used <e> <s> however i do not think that central government have ever told local government what they had to do in that respect <e> <s> i believe that local government decided for themselves and i am wondering whether boards should not decide this matter for themselves <e>", "<cs> i apologise to members of the committee and bow to the longstanding knowledge of the noble lord lord hughes on the subject <e> <s> i was merely recollecting that when tayside began both gentlemen concerned drew an ace the first <e>", "<cs> cosla was kind enough to inform me of its anxieties in this area <e> <s> i can understand them <e> <s> but at the same time the scottish parent-teacher council says that it would not like the present arrangement to

its memorandum the law society states <e>", "<cs> surely when the revenue support grant is fixed it will allow for that which is necessary for each school in a particular local authority area <e> <s> overspending would arise from spending money on that which is not absolutely essential but which is extra <e> <s> therefore it would be perfectly reasonable for a local authority unless it is trying to play political games of some kind with the government of the day or the school boards to budget for what the school needs and to have a contingency fund for anything extra which is required <e> <s> i believe that to punish the school boards for what the councillors have decided would be quite wrong <e> <s> i am surprised that the noble lord lord kirkhill is suggesting that that may be legitimate <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that there is a weakness in this amendment although i see what it is trying to achieve <e> <s> if it finds it necessary to do so it should be possible for the board to communicate directly with the authority without going through the head teacher <e> <s> it would be unfortunate if a situation arose in which that was found necessary but it could happen <e> <s> it seems to me that if the bill contains any reference to this point it should state that the board should inform the head teacher of what it has said to the authority rather than the board having to go to the authority through the head teacher <e>", "<cs> in answering the question posed by the noble lord lord mackie of benshie i do not think that my noble friend quite met a request made by the scottish parent-teacher council which said <e>", "<cs> i agree with that point <e> <s> we should not be too easily put off by what is happening in england <e> <s> i have heard from chairmen of governors that the annual meetings they have in order to report to parents have not been well attended in some schools and that there are problems <e> <s> however those meetings are early in their development <e> <s> it will take time as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has said for the culture to change and for parents to realise that they should be involved in the school <e>", "<cs> there is a serious point here <e> <s> it is a very useful power for a board to be able to fix an occasional holiday <e> <s> however i hope that it would never be of the order of a week or a fortnight

which can be alternated while still meeting the minimum school attendance required by law to which the noble lord lord taylor referred <e>", "<cs> i know that cosla is worried about this <e> <s> it feels that inexperienced boards will not be able to cope <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord lord mackie that three years may be a very long time for some boards <e> <s> i think that cosla is

said in an earlier discussion in order to attract and hold good people on these boards it is important to give them plenty to do <e> <s> it would be a great pity to say in the bill that no school board could do anything more for three years <e> <s> i am quite sure that some will be capable of undertaking more and will want to do so more quickly others will not <e> <s> the bill should allow for

received <e> <s> clause of the bill states <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will not accept the amendment <e> <s> i entirely understand the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> he made it very succinctly <e> <s> however perhaps he has not realised that section of the act which i looked up this afternoon relates to attendance allowances and is not about refunds for loss of earnings <e>", "<cs> schedule paragraph proposes somewhat different arrangements for the appointment of the head teachers and of depute and assistant heads <e> <s> i am happy that for the appointment of head teachers the committee should consist of an equal number of people nominated by the authority and by the board and that the chairman of the committee should be one of the authority nominees <e> <s> i can see that arrangement working very well <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is correct in what he has just said <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will look to make quite sure that when the head teacher is off sick there are no holes left in the system so that it is not possible to operate these senior appointments while he is away <e> <s> i do not see how it is going to work either in this respect <e>", "<cs> many head teachers who are members of the eis also belong to the head teachers association <e> <s> it is through that organisation that they have expressed an opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords both noble lords have explained that their respective amendments seek to do away with the parental majority on the school boards <e> <s> i know that both the local authorities in scotland and the biggest teaching union there the eis are extremely keen to see that majority abolished <e> <s> as i said in committee both those bodies were kind enough to explain to me that they did not believe that parents would be up to having such a majority <e> <s> they agree with the noble lord lord carmichael in that it may not be possible to get enough parents to do the job <e> <s> they think that as the noble lord lord mackie said it will destroy the so-called notion of partnership <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> he is absolutely right <e>",

grateful for the amendment because the view was taken on all sides at committee that communication between the boards and the parents is enormously important <e> <s> we want an assurance on the face of the bill that such communications will occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the point made by the noble lord but i do not believe that this amendment will meet it <e> <s> there is a statutory number of attendances which pupils are required to make in the school year so that an occasional holiday would always be instead of another day <e> <s> it would not be additional that is one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall listen carefully to what my noble friend says in reply to the amendment <e> <s> he has done terribly well in sorting out a number of wrinkles in this bill but this is one aspect that is still of concern to me <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i put this question to my noble friend <e> <s> is he saying that the authority tells someone you will be the acting head teacher and that that implies because of amendment no <e> <s> that he has the full responsibilities of a head teacher <e> <s> perhaps i have misunderstood the position <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the increasing number of pumps that sell unleaded petrol would be used more if more members of the public had some idea of whether or not their present car could use unleaded petrol or whether it could be converted <e> <s> does he further agree that it might be a good idea to have some kind of advertising campaign so that the public can better understand the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to my noble friend <e> <s> i too was not present when he spoke due to the rather tardy transport arrangements across the nation today <e> <s> i hope i am not repeating

are still not benefiting from the new opportunities offered by national prosperity <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> i accept of course that the government have taken a number of steps in the right direction in recent budgets and that they have done well by the scotch whisky industry in their negotiations with the european community and japan <e> <s> but in view of the fact that per cent <e> <s> more wine is now drunk in the united kingdom than years ago and rather more than per cent <e> <s> less whisky is it not unfair to the people who work in the industry to

estimates were fixed is made public <e> <s> unless the public has faith in the governments original list it cannot read correctly the disparity between that list and the community charge that has been fixed <e>", "<cs> my lords the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester was anxious that some of the remarks by noble lords might insult the people of scotland <e> <s> i am a scot <e> <s> i live in scotland <e> <s> nothing that has been said has been remotely insulting either to me or to anyone else in scotland <e> <s> however i wish to take issue with the impression that some speakers

the right reverend prelate to the extent that this may be the reason why there is a rise in shopping <e> <s> but if one has a free market that is what happens <e> <s> if you do not believe in it you dislike it <e> <s> i do not think that the right reverend prelate likes a free market very much <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that only yesterday there was a gathering in this house at which a large number of manufacturers in light industry met in order to hear about opportunities which they were keenly seeking to take their industries from the south and south-east of england to scotland <e> <s> one of the main reasons why they wished to do this was that under the new legislation housing will reflect the different values in different parts of the country and the position will be very advantageous in the highlands of scotland <e>", "<cs> i freely admit that i am no expert at all on football <e> <s> but having listened to the discussion on the amendment i cannot help wondering whether those who have spoken have made themselves absolutely clear to the committee <e> <s> indeed we have been talking about the amendment for minutes <e> <s> it seems to me that it is simply saying we do not like the bill we want a pilot scheme and we consider that that is what the government should have <e>", "<cs> i have been a member of the sub-committee of your lordships european committee which has been looking at the subject of mergers in the european context <e> <s> the sub-committee has not yet reported to the main committee <e> <s> in the course of our discussions it has become clear that the community view on merger matters is that as far as possible the criterion on which a decision should be based is that of competition <e> <s> i believe that politics should be kept out of the matter <e> <s> as soon as one begins to consider what is the public interest and to require those proposing a merger to prove that it is in the public interest one enters the political field <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that most noble lords speaking in this debate agree that the many highly desirable changes on which schools in england and wales are now embarked all depend for their success on there being a sufficient number of committed enthusiastic suitably qualified and skilled teachers to put the plans into effect <e> <s> we all agree on that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be extremely grateful to the noble lord lord rochester for giving us the opportunity of this short debate and if i may say so for the way in which he has so clearly set out the issues and his concerns against the background of all his experience in this field <e> <s> i agree with much that he has said <e> <s> i am sure that no speaker in the debate is likely to disagree with the somewhat bland but absolutely true definition of the aims of the white paper as set out in the foreword in which the secretary of state for employment states that <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell the house a little more about the point of view of the convention of scottish local authorities which are the education authorities on this subject <e> <s> i

the house what it came up with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord butterfield has spoken mainly about the feelings of young people in higher education <e> <s> i should like to say a few words about access to higher education for adults <e> <s> during our debate in this house last week about training it was pointed out that the governments white paper on employment in the s while saying much about the developments <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse what the noble lord lord taylor has said <e> <s> i agree with the minister that the suggestion in the amendment is probably not the right one <e> <s> i wonder whether this body cannot continue to be called the national rivers authority but simply with a sub-title of england and wales <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord really think that wilderness land the most beautiful part of the environment stays beautiful by people doing absolutely nothing about it paying nobody to attend to it and leaving it alone so that nature may rampage <e> <s> does he really think that the land is not managed i know he lives a long way from that kind of place but i should have thought he would know that from his reading <e>", "<cs> it is very important to appreciate what kind of body this will be <e> <s> it is to be a pragmatic body which has a set of objectives and duties which it has to fulfil <e> <s> it has to concentrate on those duties and act as efficiently promptly and effectively as possible <e> <s> it should certainly consist of people who understand the subject <e> <s> i believe that clause ensures that the people who are appointed will have relevant experience and will have a track record in those matters <e>", "<cs> some members of the committee may remember that i had the privilege of taking the local government access to information act through this chamber <e> <s> my recollection of that act is that it consists of an extremely complicated set of requirements on local government which are designed specifically for the very complex political structure of local government <e> <s> it requires an additional number of officials to provide papers and so on in advance of meetings and it caters for an organisation which has many sub-committees <e> <s> the whole purpose of the measure was intended to make it impossible for local government which after all consists of local councils which are elected bodies to push measures through sub-committees without the public being aware that they were going through so that by the time they reached the council which is the main committee that must be open to the public the decisions had already been taken <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness agree with me that the local government access to information legislation would be a sledgehammer to crack that nut

planners want to ensure that there is such access may be owned by a number of people who would need to organise their own protection of the environment and their own public access without any interference which may arise just because the land happened at one time to be owned for whatever reason by a water authority <e> <s> i wonder whether i have perhaps misunderstood the meaning of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the fact that the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey had to find a way around the covenant as regards alcohol when he bought his house is a good illustration of what my

reading of the bill but from reading the report of the debate it seems to me that the government intend to do just what the amendment proposes <e> <s> i see from the speech of my noble friend lord sanderson of bowden that the director general himself is to be appointed by the secretaries of state for energy and for scotland that the director will have an office in scotland and will be

difficulties of the secretary of state making appointments <e> <s> however do not all the arguments that he has used also apply to local authorities <e> <s> i do not understand why he thought that

more will therefore happen <e>", "<cs> it is excellent that the bill encourages local authorities to have more scope to contribute towards the economy of their areas <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham described what he believed to be wrong with the bill and wishes to leave out two clauses which limit the powers of local government <e> <s> i believe that the two clauses are essential in enlarging the scope <e> <s> his speech sounded like one made in the late s or early s when local government had to be the entrepreneur and go into competition with the private sect or in the local area <e> <s> we now know that does not work because competition between local government and the private sector damages the private sector <e> <s> it is made more difficult for the local market to work because the authority is in a special position <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend whether he remembers that when the bill was debated i made a suggestion that the authority should be called the national rivers authority for england and wales <e> <s> the reply received from the minister was that it did not matter because scots would not very often come across the term <e> <s> that is the kind of disdain for scottish sentiment which leads to so much trouble and which feeds scottish nationalism and all its dangers <e>", "<cs> i revert to the point raised by the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> i hope that he is not suggesting that central government should be telling local authorities which teachers they should employ and which they should not <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have joined in the interesting discussion particularly the noble lord lord carmichael who has kindly put his name to this amendment as he did to others of mine last week when i could not be present to ensure that various issues were aired <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for what he has said and the noble lord lord macaulay for supporting me on this amendment <e> <s> i was indeed pleased with the response of the minister to the amendment standing in my name on clause <e> <s> that was very helpful <e> <s> he has stated that the wider consultation is better undertaken direct with the secretary of state rather than with the school in the local area <e> <s> i perceive that that is a less divisive way of doing it <e> <s> i understand that time for reflection is allowed for by this method <e> <s> i should like to read very carefully what the minister has said <e> <s> i may wish to come back on this issue <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank noble lords who have supported me and particularly my noble friend for what to me has been an extremely pleasant surprise <e> <s> it will be a pleasant surprise not only to me but to the many people who have advised me on this matter <e> <s> i take the point that the word children is proably not the right one to describe the overall educational responsibility of the secretary of state <e> <s> that probably does need altering <e>", "<cs> of course i agree with the noble lord lord mackie that in rural areas this is very important <e> <s> however i must say to him and the noble lord lord macaulay that this is based on somewhat out-of-date thinking <e> <s> since choice by parents has played a much larger role in the decision as to which secondary school a child will go to it is very difficult to say in a given secondary school from which primary school children will come <e> <s> of course that applies more in the city where no secondary school could say which primary schools would be the origin of their pupils in the year after next or indeed next year <e>", "<cs> the noble lord makes an absolutely valid point <e> <s> i only say to him that the statute would also have to cover friockheim <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords who have supported me <e> <s> i also thank my noble friend <e> <s> i am sorry if the quotation i gave was out of context and misled anyone but it appears to me that the minister in another place gave an undertaking and that it is time that undertaking was fulfilled <e> <s> the minister has indicated that that is now to happen <e> <s> therefore i am content as will many other people be content <e> <s> in thanking the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord macaulay for what he has said <e> <s> i believe it to be very helpful <e> <s> i also thank the minister for his acceptance of the fact that this is a matter that should be discussed with the electoral reform society <e> <s> that meets the point very well <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with his amendment i should like to ask him whether his briefing gives him any reason to think that there are things known about a teacher on the staff of a school which is within a local authority and which then becomes self-governing which are not known to the head teacher <e> <s> my experience is that when a local authority has confidential information about teachers it passes that on to a head teacher who would have all the records <e> <s> a local authority would never not tell the head teacher <e> <s> it seems to me that the important point is that the confidentiality with which the head teacher treats that information should continue in the new situation <e> <s> however i believe this is a tricky matter and the minister should look very carefully at the points that the noble lord has made <e> <s> i agree that this amendment is probably not the answer to the problem because of the effect it could have within a school <e> <s> nevertheless the noble lord raises an important point although i cannot think of an example of information which a head teacher would not already have <e>", "<cs> in response to the comments made by the noble earl lord perth i should point out that flexibility in this matter is terribly important <e> <s> it is quite impossible to see what might be the reason for a school wanting to come to an end and reincarnate itself quite quickly within the local authority <e> <s> it would be a mistake to have any length of time written into the bill for the other quite different reason which has been made plain by noble lords on the benches opposite <e>", "<cs> i do not know how many further education colleges across scotland the noble lord has visited <e> <s> however he said that the example that he gave from the scottish further and higher education association was typical <e> <s> it is presumably typical of glasgow from where the letter was written and possibly of lothian <e>", "<cs> that may be so but the noble lord knows as well as i do that all over scotland living close to where he lives and where i <e>", "<cs> before the minister responds to my noble friends amendment i should like to say a word about the specific aspects of this part of the bill as it relates to the hierarchy having to give written reasons why it is refusing approval if it is so doing <e> <s> if this amendment were to be accepted would it affect the bill in that respect <e> <s> i should also like to ask that question of my noble friend <e> <s> i regard this as important and i shall briefly tell the committee why <e> <s> for a long time the law of scotland has required that when a new teacher came to a church school the religious authorities should approve or disapprove the new appointment as regards the teachers religious beliefs and character <e> <s> however until now there has been no requirement that the teacher should be given any reason for the decision <e> <s> during my time as education committee chairman in tayside i was greatly concerned that in the case of roman catholic schools the hierarchy took the view that when a roman catholic teacher applied for a promoted post if he or she had children who could have been sent to a local roman catholic school but were being sent to a non-denominational school the church would block the appointment <e> <s> that seemed to me to be unfortunate in two ways <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell the house what is the view of the convention of scottish local authorities <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned all the english associations but the bill applies also to scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has explained her argument very fully <e> <s> i have to point out to her that there is no such thing as a county court in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i must follow the noble lord because he has talked about scotland and i live there too <e> <s> the evidence is that at this moment on average per cent <e> <s> of those who are due to pay the community charge have done so and in some areas the figure is per cent <e> <s> the local authorities say that the process is going smoothly <e> <s> the member of parliament for dundee east mr john mcallion who was the chairman of the first campaign to stop people paying has himself admitted that that campaign has failed <e> <s> the people of scotland have caught on to the way that the system works <e> <s> they see what their obligations are <e> <s> my experience is that many parents are extremely glad that young people now contribute to the community charge <e> <s> i simply do not think that what the noble lord has said is the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the minister said and of course these provisions are welcome in scotland <e> <s> could he just tell me what is the effect of all this on the scottish version of the safety net <e> <s> he did not mention that <e> <s> could he enlighten the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for taking on board the first part of the argument put forward by the noble lord lord carmichael in committee on an amendment to which i was unable to speak <e> <s> i note what my noble friend says about consultation <e> <s> as a result of the amendments through which it is difficult to travel when trying to examine their implications is there anywhere where the local authority and the church if it is relevant are informed of what has happened or is it just left to chance <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend will not accept the amendment <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord macaulay that circumstances in scotland are quite different from those in england <e> <s> however i can see no reason why given certain circumstances it should not be possible for a small school in an area with a low population to have this right <e> <s> if the school will not be viable the secretary of state will not agree to it <e> <s> that is the whole point of the provision in the bill <e> <s> i should have thought he could perfectly well look at the matter for himself <e>", "<cs> my lords the lothian parents action group a letter from which the noble lord quoted was also kind enough to write to me setting out its points of view <e> <s> it requires serious consideration because its views are sincerely held <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord may have slightly misunderstood what the amendment is about and what the bill says <e> <s> we are not privatising schools in any way <e> <s> they are self-governing schools paid for by the community charge payers so they are not being privatised <e> <s> there may be a case for suggesting that any changes which may take place in the near future should be indicated to the parents in the statute but any essential characteristics of the school cannot be changed at this stage <e> <s> that comes later as would any changes in admission practices <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask whether we are discussing amendments nos <e> <s> and at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank my noble friend for that amendment <e> <s> some of us felt that it was somewhat overdue when we discussed it last time <e> <s> i am sure the house will appreciate that this is an enormous improvement to the bill <e> <s> it will be a great relief to the local authorities who particularly wished to see the provision inserted <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very interested to hear what my noble friend has to <e>", "<cs> my lords i find that the discussion of diagnostic assessment becomes almost a theology when it enters the school system <e> <s> the noble lord lord macaulay said that it is considered testing should be abandoned <e> <s> he did not say by whom <e> <s> there is a fear among the teaching profession of the idea of testing at those two stages <e> <s> the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee has put that fear into words <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down will she accept from me that teachers are certainly not whipping boys for anything in scotland <e> <s> teachers are enormously respected <e> <s> there is a very wide respect for the teaching profession in scotland among ordinary people <e> <s> i was simply questioning the removing of this testing nothing else <e>", "<cs> my lords this pair of amendments worries me <e> <s> i know that in strathclyde region which is seeking to reduce the number of schools and staff it would be helpful if it could always promote from its own staff <e> <s> it has done so in the past as have other regions <e> <s> however one has the rights of teachers to consider <e> <s> if one is a principal teacher in the western isles orkney the highland or the border where the scope for promotion is fairly small one may well wish to apply for a principal teachers job in strathclyde <e> <s> it is a genuine desire of teachers to move from a smaller into a larger region to gain experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke to this amendment at the previous stage <e> <s> i shall listen with interest to my noble friend <e> <s> however we have not heard the reason why my noble friend the duke of norfolk wishes for two categories of agreements <e> <s> when he replies perhaps he will tell us the precise reasons why two categories of agreement are required one wholehearted and the other less than wholehearted <e> <s> what will be the grounds for the less than wholehearted agreement <e> <s> if they are not grounds of religious belief and character i believe that he indicated that it would not be on those grounds what will the grounds be <e> <s> will the consent be on professional grounds <e> <s> if it is i do not think that the intention of the bill is to give a religious body the possibility of turning a teacher down on professional grounds <e> <s> therefore what will the grounds be for the less than wholehearted approval <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend said that in the case of roman catholic schools they did not wish to approve the appointment but to consent to it <e> <s> i should like to know what are the grounds for consenting or not consenting <e> <s> my noble friend may wish to answer that in the context of the catholic church <e> <s> also has he taken account of the fact that there would probably be different grounds for different religious groups <e> <s> he may find that last point difficult to answer <e> <s> what would be the grounds on which the roman catholic church would consent or not consent to a non-catholic teacher <e>", "<cs> my lords in my view the aim of this amendment which is the exemption of two local government companies that would otherwise be caught by this bill is very commendable indeed <e> <s> its argument is strong on grounds of fairness to the local authorities concerned which have acted in good faith in forming those companies and from the governments point of view on moral grounds as well <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite right that this bill varies in many respects from the english legislation <e> <s> parliament is attempting to make it so far as possible tailor-made for scotland <e> <s> however the issue on the way that parents vote on whether the process for applying self-governing status should begin is a new right for parents <e> <s> i feel very strongly that this right which exists in england should exist in scotland <e> <s> the notion that there should be two bites at the cherry seems unfortunate <e> <s> there would be some turmoil in the period between the two votes if the amendment were accepted <e> <s> there would be a vote and if the second stage was then invoked there would be a pause when everyone was in doubt <e> <s> the process should be completely simple <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not know how many schools will avail themselves of the right to apply to be self-governing <e> <s> i said at second reading that to begin with it would probably be very few but time will tell <e> <s> what is important is that this new right exists <e> <s> it is good for schools for parents and for staff to know that they have the possibility of applying for self-government <e> <s> it is very good indeed for the local authority to know that if it is incompetent or unsympathetic in relation to a particular school that right exists <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord dormand criticised many aspects of the economy <e> <s> as regards training he said that what the government have been doing appeared to be worthy of commendation but that he was not happy about the future <e> <s> i remind him that the governments previous politics on training were drawn at a time when many people were unemployed <e> <s> employers could not be expected to be involved in paying for that training <e> <s> now most of those people are in employment or are potential employees <e> <s> it appears to be nothing but sensible that employers should be involved in putting their money where their mouths are as they have been in germany for so long and with great success <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will persuade his party not to try to frustrate the training schemes that are being designed for scotland towards which it is showing some allergy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow my noble friend lady oppenheim-barnes who is an expert in this matter <e> <s> she knows a great deal about the subject <e> <s> she has made a very encouraging and interesting speech <e> <s> when i went to collect my newspapers in scotland yesterday morning i remarked that i was on the way south to take part in the debate regarding the bill on food safety <e> <s> the lady in the newsagents said well just tell them that it does not matter too much what they do as long as they do not put the prices up too much <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a fascinating series of speeches already and it is a <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord lord ezra explain why these additions are necessary <e> <s> drink chewing gum and other items which one chews and spits out are included in the bill as are food and <e>", "<cs> can my noble friend say whether there is anything under clause b <e>", "<cs> i do not wish in any way to be unhelpful <e> <s> however for the sake of clarity i read what the bill says <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what my noble friend had to say but i had some difficulty in understanding what she and the noble lord lord gallacher said <e> <s> is my noble friend saying that the secretary of state for scotland has studied this point and is happy about it and the fact that for example public analysts are employed by the regional councils while others involved are employed by the district is allowed for in the bill <e> <s> the noble lord said that he in no way wanted to change the responsibilities of the tiers of local government which would be inappropriate under the bill <e> <s> we want to be sure that the wording is correct for scotland so that the whole matter is <e>", "<cs> i was asking my noble friend whether she was happy that the secretary of state has examined the bill closely and is assured that it is doing the same thing for scotland as is being done for england and wales <e>", "<cs> of course there is anxiety about these matters and both noble lords are right to highlight it and to give illustrations <e> <s> i do not know whether either of them has studied how food is created and what the implications will be with labelling of this kind <e> <s> it would mean that every field that was sown with wheat for bread with vegetables or potatoes would have to be hoed by a row of people in a line <e> <s> that is a slow business and it could be done only in dry weather <e> <s> it would be enormously expensive <e> <s> we are not talking about gardening in the back yard <e> <s> we are talking about the growing of food for the nation <e> <s> the price of food would escalate enormously <e> <s> i do not know whether my noble friend has the figures but i am sure prices would increase by a factor of six seven eight nine <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made a fairly lengthy and extremely carefully thought out speech <e> <s> he is saying things which concern a great many people <e> <s> he asked why this country is so far behind other countries <e> <s> some of us have been wondering that but surely that is what the bill is about <e> <s> it seeks to bring us up to date <e> <s> in this clause the government have attempted to strike a sensible balance <e> <s> i say to the noble earl that we should not take all the fun out of life <e> <s> he is saying that if his amendment were accepted the government would have a duty to make sure that all boiled sweets are white <e> <s> i do not think that that would be very much fun for anybody <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord gallacher has said everything that i was planning to say about the amendment except for one thing <e> <s> as a member at any rate during the later stages of the select committee at a time when it was agreed that we should propose to the government that they should not proceed with their plans to allow irradiation until the draft directive had been agreed to i was under the impression as i believe was the committee that that decision was pending and would not take long <e> <s> if it does not take long i stand by our decision <e> <s> i hear on the grapevine perhaps my noble friend the minister can confirm this that the select committee was aiming at a moving target and that it is not proving as simple as the community thought to take that decision <e> <s> if so and it means a long delay i can see the governments point in proceeding because many urgent matters require to be regulated upon <e> <s> we probably should not wait indefinitely for the decision from the community <e> <s> we have been in this position before and it could happen again <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend has to say <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that frequently that does not happen <e> <s> as somebody who travels a great deal on the underground very often with a large suitcase can he tell me what one is supposed to do if one has a large suitcase there is no member of staff present and one cannot get through the gate <e> <s> when my noble friend travelled on the underground perhaps he had his red box with him and suffered with that <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the figures quoted by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe will include many people who have moved from one region to another <e> <s> strathclyde has not yet developed a sophisticated enough system to track them down <e> <s> they are probably paying the community charge in another region while strathclyde is still trying to obtain from them the money which is no longer due <e>", "<cs> my lords i like other noble lords was fascinated by the maiden speech of the noble and learned lord lord emslie <e> <s> i also listened with admiration and interest to the extremely eloquent speeches that other distinguished lawyers made in defence of the status quo of advocates and of the status quo regarding the way in which the courts work <e> <s> i also listened with interest to the noble lord lord evans in defence of the status quo regarding the way in which solicitors work in relation to conveyancing <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend said that there is a list of the various aspects which will be included in the regulations <e> <s> with respect the problem is that the bill says that they may be included <e> <s> is my noble and learned friend prepared to correct himself on that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord accept from me that part of the report pays great tribute to what the government have done <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter has used figures selectively out of the report <e> <s> if my noble friend has time to read it i think he will be encouraged on the governments behalf to continue along the line which the government are taking <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down although i have not been taking part in the debate as a scot i have been listening to and taking part in discussion on the bill relating to scotland i am very concerned about conflict of interest <e> <s> i ask the noble lord for information <e> <s> perhaps we may consider a young couple who are selling a house <e> <s> they go to their family lawyer in a small country practice and ask him to act for them <e> <s> they put the house on the market and a price is decided <e> <s> in a small country town it may happen that the person to whom the owner wishes to sell his house is a long-standing client of a solicitor in the same firm <e> <s> i understand that in scotland solicitors are allowed to act for the seller and the buyer in the same transaction if both clients are long-standing customers of the firm <e> <s> that is so in england <e> <s> i see the noble lord nodding his head <e>", "<cs> in moving the amendment my noble friend said that it was important to make a distinction between treatment and research <e> <s> if treatment is carried out in a certain place for a succession of couples always in order to enable the specific woman in each case to carry a child is properly recorded and the track record of the treatment through the years is observed that becomes research <e> <s> that has been pointed out to me by scientists who are doing that <e> <s> a distinction cannot be made <e> <s> research does not begin and end in any one place treatment is part of research <e> <s> the amendment is confusing although i understand the intention of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to return to a subject raised by the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester the church of englands new report <e>", "<cs> my lords this combination of procedures that my noble friend is proposing is the right one <e> <s> it is absolutely excellent that the relevant groups representing various interests which means representing consumer interests as well as those of the producers should be consulted and then should follow the parliamentary procedure so that parliament has a look at whatever the government propose <e> <s> in these circumstances that seems the right way to do things except as my noble friend said when there is an extreme emergency when the procedure would take too long <e> <s> i personally am extremely appreciative of what she has done <e>", "<cs> my lords on the face of it when it is suggested to your lordships in the course of debating legislation that such and such a body should be set up it always seems an attractive proposition <e> <s> the noble viscount lord falkland made it sound as though the proposed body would increase public confidence and reduce the concern about salmonella and chickens <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for allowing me to intervene <e> <s> it is not the status quo that i favour it is the proposals in the bill which seem to me to be attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot sort out this matter as i have not been into the detail <e> <s> however we have jps in scotland although their role is somewhat different <e> <s> i expect that my noble friend has studied that matter and doubtless the minister has sorted it out <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate that there are enormous problems in thinking through how to apply an arrangement of this sort but i am bound to say i do not think that the government can ignore the matter <e> <s> as my noble friend lord stanley has said it is only in rather rare circumstances that this crops up <e> <s> it has to be because an official has actually made a mistake so that the emergency order was incorrect or the feed turned out not to be contaminated <e> <s> there was a time when farmers had plenty of room for manoeuvre <e> <s> i was one of them and i do not know whether or not i owned up to it but there was room for manoeuvre <e> <s> if someone was unjust to a farmer he could probably accept the extra cost <e> <s> i am not a farmer now but i know it is very difficult nowadays in many areas to farm profitably <e> <s> to treat farmers differently in this respect from other producers of food is not only unjust but wrong <e> <s> it shows a certain lack of awareness on the part of the government of the problems that can be created <e> <s> so i hope that my noble friend if she is going to defend the governments position on this matter will go away and think very hard about it <e> <s> this is a big problem <e> <s> times have changed and farmers have a right to the understanding of the public and of your lordships house in this particular respect <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably the effect of the noble earls amendment is that we will only agree with what europe does in the next <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that my noble friend lord caldecote and the noble baroness lady turner are not absolutely right when they describe the story of the skill centres as one of stability <e> <s> it is the noble baroness lady seear in my view who is giving an accurate description <e> <s> that is not surprising because unknown to my noble friend on the front bench the noble baroness has been involved in the work of the manpower services commission for many years and she knows all about the saga of the skill centres <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be interested to hear what my noble friend on the front bench has to say in response to the amendment <e> <s> both noble lords who have spoken to it know scotland well and will appreciate that the geography is very different from that south of the border <e> <s> the local government arrangements are also different <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ezra said every citizen in scotland is involved with two authorities the district and the region except where there is a unitary authority which is in only a small part of scotland however one has to remember that the regional council may not be geographically close to an event <e> <s> for example if there were a problem in oban the regional council headquarters is in glasgow <e> <s> if there were a problem in wick the regional council headquarters is in inverness <e> <s> one has to remember that there is therefore a remoteness <e> <s> communications are not easy <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house will the minister say whether strathclyde region for example is pressing to be a food industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with trepidation but your lordships must recollect the point of extending rights of audience <e> <s> it is that people should have a greater choice of advocate <e> <s> i understand the high ideals of the bar <e> <s> i understand my noble friend lord alexander referring to the cab rank rule as a simple ethical principle <e> <s> i see how barristers identify with the rule with regard to their integrity and how that integrity helps the court <e> <s> i understand all that but there is a practical point <e>", "<cs> my lords the question is about providing the necessary resources for children who are placed in mainstream schools <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that since the recent education reform act gave local authorities the ability <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord macaulay who sadly is not in his place at present said that he viewed the bill as a failure <e> <s> he blamed that on the way it has been drafted <e> <s> it is often the duty of this house to object to bills which rely too heavily on secondary legislation <e> <s> i was very glad and reassured to hear the most constructive speech of my noble friend lord rippon of hexham on the subject <e> <s> i think i understood him to say that he did not feel that this bill was as guilty as some in that respect <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the taking advantage of tenants by landlords who are paying no attention whatever to the change from rates to the community charge is very bad indeed and that the leaflet and its attendant publicity are the best help yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i must add my words of gratitude to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house is in any doubt about the increase in answerability <e>", "<cs> i too was disappointed that my noble friend did not rise when he was invited to do so by the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> on second reading i mentioned that i thought that a selective use of the affirmative resolution procedure would be helpful <e> <s> i said that because it was quite clear from the debate on second reading and from the discussion outside the house that there was still a lot that people wanted to discuss concerning the details involved in the setting up of the arrangements <e> <s> however that did not alter my view that to make everything always subject to affirmative resolution as i believe the amendments of the noble lord lord airedale suggest is quite unnecessary <e>", "<cs> i should like to declare an interest as a member of the governing body of the open university which despite the remarks of the noble baroness lady blackstone about the admirable record of birkbeck college still has two-thirds of the undergraduate part-time students <e> <s> there is no question but that some financial help would be of enormous benefit to open university undergraduates <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend replies does he agree with me that what the noble baroness is suggesting and also rather more surprisingly my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter that some people might be on benefit and some people might not be that the change in the arrangements with regard to better housing benefit and so on will apply to some students and not to others seems extraordinary <e> <s> i would not have thought it was tenable <e>", "<cs> there is a point which needs to be considered in this amendment <e> <s> it relates very much to the amendment of the noble baroness lady blackstone and may refer to others to which we shall come <e> <s> we are all thinking very hard of how the scheme will affect individual categories of students and we are quite right to do that <e> <s> we must think about it very hard and vote very carefully <e> <s> but we are not thinking about how everybody else will react and if there is to be a shortage of teachers

charities that people will want to look up probably grouped according to interests <e> <s> there would be charities interested in youth work disabilities old people overseas aid and similar subjects

consulted the register <e> <s> i do not know how this situation could be arrived at whether the amendment would cater for it <e> <s> however it seems to me that that is what is needed <e> <s> it would not necessarily need to be a register of every single charity <e>", "<cs> there is one further point which has not been made <e> <s> in attempting to differentiate between the churches and other

has found this to be so <e> <s> i understand what he says very well but he has heard the point that i made <e>", "<cs> as a total layman my concern is to ensure that if a hospital trust takes on the

to the committee <e> <s> i did not arrive until after the noble lord lord ennals had introduced the amendment and so i did not hear everything that he said <e> <s> it is a great pity that the second

situation where in addition to those people with that understanding politicians have been lining up somewhat on party lines <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter indicated that he was speaking for the benches behind him <e> <s> it is unfortunate that that has happened because the reality of the situation is that the people who are most vulnerable and who need the money for this purpose are likely

long time in local government <e> <s> i hope that other members of the committee sitting opposite who have even greater experience of local government than i have will feel the same way <e> <s> it is important to realise how the system works <e>", "<cs> i accept that <e> <s> the noble lord is <e> <s> correct <e> <s> the amendment makes that concept plain too <e> <s> however if the amendment is adopted the area of local government activity which should be the least politicised and which should be most carefully run on pragmatic grounds in a way that will help vulnerable people who would be

councillors allocate budgets a great deal of give and take occurs <e> <s> a ring-fenced sum will already have been allocated to a particular department and the other departments will not give much <e>

envisages in the amendment that everything which a local authority spends on community care including what is allocated at present through normal government grants for their existing social services functions is to be ring fenced <e> <s> will the local authorities lose their discretion as to how they spend existing money <e> <s> the noble lord lord carter spoke about money coming from the poll

the student loans bill concerns loans and the various speakers in the previous debate wanted to have loans in this case rather than grants <e> <s> the point that we must not miss is that we are looking for some way of providing competition for solicitors in this field <e> <s> solicitors fund their own law society and the law society is making estimates as regards what such a body may cost <e> <s> i do not know whether such a body would have to be situated in central edinburgh <e> <s> i should not have thought that that was necessary <e> <s> perhaps the estimates are unnecessarily large <e> <s> but the point is that the bill should permit arrangements to be drawn up in order to find out how the process works and to get the board up and running <e> <s> once it is up and running it may well be able to fund itself however to say in legislation that it should be stopped before it starts by putting disincentives in the way of those who may dip their feet in the water for the first time seems to me a great mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not suggest that anyone was here to protect solicitors <e> <s> i suggested that the point of the bill was to present solicitors with some competition which might be beneficial to the public <e> <s> that is the point of the bill <e> <s> if solicitors were unregulated just imagine the fantastic scene and the government of the day considered it necessary to set up a law society and to persuade the profession to have a law society it might well be that there would have to be a bit of inducement to persuade them <e> <s> however they have an excellent law society which they finance <e> <s> the major institutions must be persuaded that the system can work <e> <s> it may well be that some kind of negotiations must take place <e> <s> we shall hear from my <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord advocate wrote to me because he observed that i had a great interest in this subject <e> <s> he explained that the regulations to which the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey referred will require practitioners to offer all potential clients an interview before any instructions are accepted <e> <s> the idea is that that provision should be contained in regulation rather than on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask whether he recollects that at committee stage i moved an amendment suggesting that the provisions in these regulations should be incorporated into the rules of <e>", "<cs> my lords is <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the institute of fiscal studies figures have probably been totally invalidated by your lordships recent decision to ring fence an enormous area of taxpayers money which is to be spent through local government <e> <s> would it not be better to postpone that decision until we know whether the house of commons agrees that that transfer of money to the taxpayer should be upheld <e>", "<cs> i understand the point about servicemen and crown employees who were accompanying the servicemen at these tests <e> <s> however i should like to point out to the noble lord lord carter that it seems to me that we should not leave out the civilians who worked during the war in the university research teams on the back-up research which supported the tests that eventually led to the development of the first two nuclear bombs <e>", "<cs> we must all consider this matter in depth <e> <s> some people are falling through the net and are in trouble <e> <s> there is no question about that <e> <s> the government have tried specifically to give help through the severe hardship provisions and others <e> <s> it may well be that those provisions are not operating properly <e> <s> my noble friend should take note of what has been said and should consider whether they are operating properly <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall say a few very brief words about two particular aspects of the bill in which i have taken a special interest <e> <s> i believe that it will be a considerable improvement to scots law when ordinary people are able to obtain more information about what charities exist and who runs them <e> <s> by definition charities are excused from income and corporation tax so in a sense they are contributed to by all taxpayers as well as by those who give money to them and raise money for them direct <e> <s> it seems to me helpful and right that information will become more accessible <e> <s> i hope that very soon a truly informative list of charities will be made available from whatever organisation is nominated to perform that service <e>", "<cs> my lords at times i was not absolutely sure how large the p was on the cross-benches <e> <s> the noble lord lord macaulay rightly reminded us that the law and courts are not the property of lawyers but the property of all the people of scotland <e> <s> i am sure that as the bill proceeds that will become clearer in another place than at times it was here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble baroness is right <e> <s> it is crucial that at each level there should be far more awareness than there now is of the detailed as well as the general needs of disabled people <e> <s> she made an important remark when she said that she was not on the authority because she was a disabled person <e> <s> we all know about it and we also know that she is a very experienced person who would not consider that it was her job simply to speak up for disabled people all the time on the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought i had suggested that it was extremely important when appointments were made to be quite sure that there were on the authorities people who understood and probably more than one such person <e> <s> there may be a number who understood <e> <s> as the noble lord says this is a growing part of the task in the health service <e> <s> i do not know what my noble friend has to say on this she may have an answer but i do not feel that this amendment is it <e>", "<cs> my lords like my noble friend lady young i was not able to be present when the matter was discussed in committee <e> <s> however i read with particular interest the speech to which my noble friend lord cockfield referred that made by my noble friend lord jenkin of roding <e> <s> he explained to the committee exactly how it was that we have reached the position of having the rather strange arrangement whereby child benefit is paid tax-free to every mother <e> <s> it is paid to <e>", "<cs> my lords that having been said year by year it would increase as the uprating increased <e> <s> at first it would be per cent <e> <s> but would then increase and could end up as a considerable sum <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who contributed to this short debate <e> <s> my noble friend lord balfour with his usual assiduous attention to the detail of bills asked me a number of pertinent questions <e> <s> he wrote to my noble friend lord sanderson as he said and received a reply which helped him and also helped me <e> <s> we are very grateful for that <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords worried by the vagueness of the phrase appear to the authority should not worry <e> <s> if you are on a local authority and you consult organisations representing people you must decide between all the many organisations and the many people who claim to be the right people to consult <e> <s> you cannot consult everyone <e> <s> like my noble friend lord mottistone i should have thought that that was the right way to put it <e> <s> we often use the phrase in legislation <e> <s> it is for the authority to decide <e> <s> we all know that it will be very difficult to decide who represents the users <e> <s> we have to trust the authorities to do it <e> <s> it will be a very difficult operation <e> <s> indeed an organisation which represents carers will not be an easy one to identify <e> <s> i expect that there will be several but one cannot include everybody <e> <s> i should have thought that this amendment was right from the local authorities point of view and that we should go along with it <e>", "<cs> my lords in talking about this perhaps we are forgetting the way local government is funded at the moment and the way the revenue support grant is worked out <e> <s> all these facts about the extra costs in rural areas are very well known to local government and to central government and the revenue support grant negotiations are all about that the needs element in the whole thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i too warmly welcome the bill <e> <s> i wish to concentrate my comments on part i its general thrust that is the bringing together of the functions of the three predecessor bodies to form two new bodies and the delegation by those bodies of much of the work to local bodies attuned to local needs is eminently sensible <e> <s> it will create a system much better suited to the needs of the s <e> <s> i was not surprised that the bill was widely welcomed in scotland not least by the scottish trades union congress and the scottish council for the development of trade and industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend <e> <s> this is a very pleasant surprise indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the criterion for the decision of all noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords mental illness is one of the difficult areas in local government <e>", "<cs> there is an argument for ring-fencing <e> <s> i would not have ring-fenced anything but i take the point that when their budgets are stretched it is difficult for councils to decide adequately to fund voluntary organisations <e> <s> therefore i can see the point of doing so <e> <s> i am bound to admit that i would have given the job to local councillors who i believe would have done it properly <e>", "<cs> my lords if the staffing of the joint committee proves to be the problem that noble lords opposite suggest are the government open to the possibility of returning to their original proposals which were that the chairmen for england scotland and wales should simply liaise in a non-statutory way as and when required as other organisations in the united kingdom do so satisfactorily <e>", "<cs> the convention of scottish local authorities was kind enough to speak with me about the amendment <e> <s> it may have spoken to the noble lords lord carmichael and lord mackie <e> <s> it is a very interesting point <e> <s> i can understand that the government wish the present system to continue into the future for the sake of continuity and the good working of the system and that the rather different remits for the two bodies should continue <e>", "<cs> i omitted to make one point to the noble lord lord carmichael and indeed to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> it seems to me that if this amendment is accepted and i do not know if the noble lord intends to divide the committee it would mean that scottish enterprise would be involving itself in the social development of glasgow wester hailes and other places which are at present beyond its remit <e> <s> wester hailes whitfield and the gear scheme in glasgow are helped as part of the former agencys remit <e> <s> however in the sense that we have been discussing this matter the social development of large cities would be included <e> <s> therefore on that account this amendment will not do <e> <s> we have been discussing only rural areas and rural deprivation <e>", "<cs> i have a query on this amendment <e> <s> apart from the fact that small boards tend to be much easier to run the noble lord seemed to indicate <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> it would be dreadful if he could not hear my words of wisdom <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> what he meant by saying that there needed to be extra places on the boards for people with expertise in training <e> <s> the people who know most about training are employers who are responsible for training <e> <s> surely members will be appointed by virtue of the fact that they have knowledge of training so that is one area where it is not necessary to add to the board <e>", "<cs> when i first saw the wording of the amendment it seemed that in spirit at least it was important <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> however the noble lord lord carmichael went further than i had imagined was intended by the amendment <e> <s> undoubtedly parts of the role of both bodies scottish enterprise and highlands and islands enterprise must be retained centrally <e> <s> they will have a strategic role <e> <s> the intention i thought was that the functions that they should not delegate but should retain should appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> however the noble lord lord carmichael suggested that the overview of the economy of scotland the whole strategy of how scotland attracts industry and develops its economy should be in the hands of these bodies <e> <s> surely that is the job of the scottish office and the organisation which is specially set up to assist it <e> <s> that is a scottish office affair <e> <s> i do not believe that the electorate of scotland would wish an unelected body to carry out that function <e> <s> that is going too far <e>", "<cs> the noble lords experience goes back a long way and he has given tremendously distinguished service in the new towns <e> <s> he is well known for that <e> <s> my understanding of the story of the new towns is that their enormous success in scotland has been due to the fact that they were not elected bodies but had chairmen fulfilling the role that the noble lord occupied <e> <s> that was what worked so well for the new towns <e> <s> what the noble lord said about the improvement in the relationship between new towns and local authorities is true <e> <s> they came to live together in a way that they had been unable to earlier <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that there have been elected representatives on the new town corporations all along <e> <s> they were there when the jealousy existed and they are still there now that there is less jealousy <e> <s> i do not believe that they have affected the jealousy question <e>", "<cs> the noble lord deals with an important point <e> <s> however perhaps he will consider looking at the community care provisions which by the time this bill is enacted we hope will be well on the way and working smoothly <e> <s> the regional council which will be responsible for community care will be considering all housing possibilities for the people who need it <e> <s> discussions will be carried out with the district councils and with scottish homes in regard to the housing they have available <e> <s> i wonder whether much of that will overlap with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i must say to the noble baroness who has just spoken that from the point of view of the people of scotland the proposals made in this amendment are breathtakingly inappropriate <e> <s> i hope that she realises that <e>", "<cs> i am not quoting i am paraphrasing <e> <s> members of the committee opposite should tune in to those remarks <e> <s> the way to persuade the people of scotland and i dare say the people of wales too to identify with nature conservancy is by devolution of powers to them <e> <s> that is what the bill achieves and that is what this amendment to tally frustrates <e> <s> i hope that the committee will reject the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can reassure the noble lord lord chorley that the countryside <e>", "<cs> i think they will work very well <e> <s> for wales and scotland it would be a mistake to add the countryside element to the joint committee because there might be dual discussion of all kinds of matters <e> <s> i deliberately did not make the point because we are discussing the joint committee for the whole of the uk <e> <s> i respect the views of the area where the two bodies may stay <e>", "<cs> does that mean that he can contribute <e> <s> it is not much good just listening <e>", "<cs> in discussion with the countryside commission for scotland i found that it welcomed warmly the clarification in subsection aaa of amendment no <e> <s> c that the special functions are assigned to the councils jointly <e> <s> the commission finds the word jointly very helpful and i agree <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord thomson knows the area in which i live as well as i do <e> <s> he spoke of the penny-farthing principle or pattern as the inevitable result of allowing a company to have two licences as opposed to one <e> <s> one might equally find that one company had two licences <e> <s> there could be two small areas owned by one licence holder <e> <s> i believe there are some areas in the country that are so small that it is difficult for the company concerned to devote enough resources to such areas to obtain the quality that it would wish <e> <s> we need flexibility here particularly in the smaller areas which do not have large populations and therefore cannot earn a great deal of advertising revenue <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness lady seear and the noble lord lord mccarthy for their contributions to this little debate <e> <s> the noble baroness as i expected was very understanding of the problems <e> <s> i am sure that having listened to the government reply she understands the difficulties in dealing with it <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord mccarthy too for putting the problem as he sees it from the viewpoint of the workers <e> <s> we must do that because they are involved in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow up what the noble lord lord mackie said by reminding him of the deliberations which he and i and other noble lords have had in sub-committee d of your lordships european communities committee where we have been looking at how to enhance the quality of life in rural areas within the community and that includes scotland <e> <s> the conclusion that we have come to which your lordships will read when the report is published is that the quality of life in rural areas can be improved by improving the economy <e> <s> one has to make sure that there are jobs and that there is training for jobs <e> <s> that is what the scottish development agency has done and that is what scottish enterprise will do <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been put to me that some councils in scotland are making much more determined efforts than others to collect a high proportion of the community charge <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me whether the figures bear this out <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not previously spoken on this part of the bill but i have listened with interest to the discussion <e> <s> i think that my noble friend the minister should pay attention to what my noble friend lord balfour has said <e> <s> the wording of amendment no <e> <s> will cause confusion in scotland and as i read the bill the clause applies to scotland <e> <s> i presume that the scottish local authorities have been consulted and welcome it <e> <s> i have no reason to think otherwise <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble baroness lady david consulted the scottish local authorities before she put down her amendments but they would obviously also have an interest in them <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down and with the leave of the house will she take another look at this matter <e> <s> i am perfectly prepared to back the amendment but quite frankly i do not believe that she is right in saying that there will be no confusion in scotland <e> <s> regional authority simply means a local government area <e> <s> the legislation will have to be referred to all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down she spoke as if the code of practice will be entirely about grass cutting <e> <s> does she appreciate that machines cleaning ditches beside the road produce an enormous amount of litter as well <e> <s> my noble friends amendment says any other maintenance <e> <s> will she make sure that it is all road maintenance that produces litter that is affected and not just grass cutting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe has made my remarks for me <e> <s> it has been very sad to hear members of the house of lords which represents the whole of the united kingdom and which has peers from the whole of the united kingdom talking about this issue as if the main point of this part of the bill did not exist namely that people in the whole of the united kingdom will be able to identify better with nature conservancy if the decision-making powers are devolved to the maximum possible extent <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend wishes to say something <e>", "<cs> my lords during this debate noble lords have been trying to whittle down the powers which will be vested in the new nature conservancy bodies and those which are already with the nature conservancy council <e> <s> that has been the exercise <e> <s> i know that it has been done for reasons which people believe are good ones <e> <s> however i hope that noble lords listened to the noble lord lord taylor and that they heard the voice of someone who comes from an area where we very much want to identify better with nature conservancy in other words we want to do it better <e> <s> we accept the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that your lordships will resist the amendment as so many other amendments have been resisted throughout the passage of the bill <e> <s> in the first stages amendments were designed to prevent the devolution of decision-making as regards conservation in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way on that point <e> <s> what he says is simply not the case <e> <s> people from all over scotland have found it extremely difficult to have instructions emanating from peterborough relating to the remote areas of scotland and based on spasmodic visits to those parts instructions which are based on a distant view and on theory rather than on understanding the problems of local people in scotland <e> <s> this is by no means a landowners issue <e> <s> it is a matter on which the people of scotland feel very strongly indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord stanley has shown me the ministers letter to him on the subject <e> <s> it is certainly encouraging and interesting <e> <s> can my noble friend lord reay say whether it would be possible for the code of practice to suggest that local authorities have a standing arrangement rather than a one-off arrangement on co-operating on grass cutting and the collection of rubbish and whether the existence of that arrangement could be made known to the public <e> <s> my noble friend lord stanley asked how the public would know how they could help <e> <s> it seems to me that if that arrangement was known to the public they would be able to alert the authorities if the arrangement was not being put into effect <e> <s> have those possibilities been considered <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down perhaps i may say that he has not quite responded to the point that i made <e> <s> i probably did not make myself clear <e> <s> would it be possible for the code of practice to state that there should be a standing arrangement with the local authority which should be made easily known to the public <e> <s> i do not believe that the procedure outlined by the noble lord providing that someone who happens to see litter on the road should go first to the library and then to the court and so on will be followed very often <e> <s> if there is a simple arrangement which is widely known to the public people can simply complain to the litter authority <e> <s> that would seem a clearer approach and a better one from the point of view of the public <e>"]
