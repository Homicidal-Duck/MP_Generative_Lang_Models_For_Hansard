["<cs> my lords what is the situation as regards the offering of tobacco and cigarettes as prizes at these fetes and galas <e> <s> shopkeepers require a licence for the sale of those goods <e> <s> would the same apply <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble earl lord bessborough who is knowledgeable about the past and the present and who always makes very cogent remarks regarding the future and its problems <e> <s> this is not the first time that i have had the pleasure of following him and if i may say so it is a great pleasure this afternoon to congratulate him on the objective speech that he has made in this realm of fuel policy <e> <s> i am never quite sure whether i should declare an interest in a fuel in an energy debate it is certainly not a financial interest <e> <s> it is within a few weeks years ago since i started work at the pit and from that time until this present moment i have always made it my business to take a lively interest in the question of fuel and energy upon which our economy depends <e> <s> it may be that during the course of the remarks that i have to make there is a partiality and bias towards the fuel of coal and it is to that that i wish to make my remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow the noble earl lord lauderdale because we all know of his great knowledge in the sphere of energy particularly as regards coal <e> <s> today has seen the publication of the annual report of the national coal board and i feel that i cannot refrain from reading this line from a press report this morning <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that there is a reaction to clauses and in some num circles that they provide a charter for the closing down <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that immediately after the executive meeting of the num to which he referred in the statement which took place last week there was a joint application to the minister for energy that they should hold a tripartite meeting the energy minister representatives of the national coal board and representatives of the national union of mineworkers <e> <s> it must have been known to the government that there was increasing anxiety in the coalfields about closures of pits <e> <s> as the <e>", "<cs> my lords the first thing i should like to do is to congratulate the right reverend prelate the bishop of liverpool on his maiden speech <e> <s> i have known him in other spheres <e> <s> as a matter of <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to be more than a few moments but as one who was a member in another place for quite a long time and knowing a little about the members fund i want to express my appreciation of this bill today although it does not affect me <e> <s> i can speak with complete impartiality because i happened to leave after october <e> <s> some were lucky and some were not <e> <s> looking at the members fund from its inception i think it was the child of mr stanley baldwin and the statute said that all members of the house of commons must pay a monthly contribution <e> <s> but it did not say that it would be compulsory whatever the position and circumstances of the individual concerned and that benefits should be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will not mind my correcting him <e> <s> i am not lord blyton <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the interesting and informative speeches that have been made by all of your lordships i think that the whole house is grateful to the noble lord lord chitnis for initiating this debate <e> <s> one thing that it has done is to provide the opportunity for the focussing of attention on a part of the world about which as regards some of us at any rate very little detail is known <e> <s> for myself i admit that my knowledge of latin <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say what in terms of percentages the represent <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this bill because it gives an assurance that the industry will have a future <e> <s> my reply to my namesake the noble lord lord taylor when he asks me whether the industry has a future is this as i see it at this moment if this industry has no future then neither has the country <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord who introduced the bill with his usual patience clarity and deliberation proclaiming clause by clause its virtues i believe it to be a most unfortunate bill in the sphere of industrial relations <e> <s> i see this bill as part of a process on behalf of the government to change trade union law <e> <s> already there have been some parts of that process <e> <s> now we have got this and the possibility of more to come <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that this question is no coincidence coming as it does on the eve of a national miners ballot which takes place on thursday and friday <e> <s> would he also agree that the inference in the question is that the national union of mineworkers is not capable of taking and organising a secret and a fair ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl say whether any consultation took place with the leaders in the industry the coal board itself and the three important unions representing the workers because their co-operation is absolutely necessary so far as the appointment is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to join with the noble lords who have previously spoken in expressing appreciation to the noble lord lord kirkhill for introducing a debate on what to this nation is a very important subject namely energy <e> <s> the subject which he has chosen for discussion this afternoon provides an opportunity for us to ventilate our thoughts on the important question of energy <e> <s> the noble lord who has just sat down made a reference to the appointment of mr macgregor as chairman of the national coal board <e> <s> i did not intend to mention that matter at all <e> <s> all i would say in that connection is that i hope that the incoming chairman will act as sensibly and as objectively as his predecessor the noble lord lord ezra has spoken to us this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a detailed reply from the minister about a number of things that at the moment are taking place in the mining industry picketing the number of men at work stocks of coal and so on <e> <s> does he agree that the most important thing at the moment is for somebody somewhere to take immediate steps to get the two sides together <e> <s> that is the most important thing as i see it <e> <s> we can talk about some of the other things which the minister has mentioned they are very important and it is desirable to talk about them but does he agree that the most important thing is to get the two sides together not to the consultative committee but to the negotiating table <e> <s> if he agrees with that will he use what influence he can and take what steps he can to get the two sides together <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the noble earl with great interest <e> <s> i thought he unfolded the bill very well indeed <e> <s> he waxed most eloquent when he described the need for a greater democratisation of the trade unions <e> <s> that set my mental mechanism in retrospect <e> <s> i remember voting by ballot for industrial action as secretly as it could be under the conditions which were available in the pit yard in <e> <s> listening to the noble earl this afternoon made me wonder whether since that time i have been living in a dream world about democracy in the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> my lords while joining the other speakers in welcoming the statement repeated by the noble earl may i say first of all that i do not think that it is as up-to-date as it might be and as i personally expected it to be <e> <s> there was no mention at all as far as i can recall of the changed situation in the industry in regard to public relations <e>", "<cs> everybody in the country knows through the press this morning and the rest of the media that there has been something of a change so far as the operations of the ncb are concerned <e> <s> i am not clear about this point from the information contained in the press and the rest of the media <e> <s> the question that i should like to ask is this <e> <s> first of all with regard to this new appointment will the minister tell us whether this gentleman is or is not a member of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister confirm that the system of accountancy has been changed by the national coal board and that instead of subsidence costs being a national charge on the coal boards funds they are now an individual responsibility on each separate pit <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount state the cost of this inquiry and how long it has taken since its inception <e>"]
