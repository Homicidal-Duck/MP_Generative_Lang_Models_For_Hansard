["<cs> my lords it is six weeks since i was introduced to your lordships house and i cannot remember a time when i have sat so silent for so long <e> <s> but i felt that it was necessary to get the feel of your lordships chamber and conscious of the honour and privilege of making a maiden speech in this house i felt i wanted to save my maiden speech for a subject on which i could make a modest contribution from my own experience <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the government are not giving too low a priority to this <e> <s> it seems to me to be revealed in a comment of the noble minister on the last amendment when he said it is their own wish that they should go abroad <e> <s> that seems to me to reveal an attitude of mind on the part of the government which is totally wrong <e> <s> it came out slightly on the amendments to clause when the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was moving his amendment <e> <s> it may well be their wish but it is also the countrys need and the noble lord lord drumalbyn has referred to this <e> <s> it is not simply their wish it is their only option in many cases to do business and thank god they do it because it is in the countrys interest <e>", "<cs> if i may just follow that point made by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> may i put a slight gloss on what the noble baroness and the noble lord lord mccarthy have said <e> <s> it seems to me that the argument of the noble lord lord mottistone is based on a slight fallacy in terms of market forces in this situation <e> <s> it is not to say that trained manpower will not be available in those companies which are not doing the training <e> <s> so they will still be technically capable of doing their job they will still be capable of competing in the market-place but they will not be contributing to the training process and as the noble lord lord mccarthy said they are poaching <e> <s> they will not be controlled by the market forces which operate on the day-to-day running of their businesses <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would confirm to his noble friend that had this bill gone through the roman senate in time st paul would very likely not have been a roman citizen <e>", "<cs> my lords to take up the point the noble lord has just made is he really suggesting that there are too many curlews when he talks about culls <e> <s> he talks about seals and other animals and birds <e> <s> he talks about culling curlews but i do not think that enters into this debate at all <e> <s> the suggestion is not that the curlew should be restricted in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to follow someone with the experience of the noble lord lord rhodes in particular when i can claim so little knowledge or experience of the textile industry <e> <s> apart from having been born in lancashire and having been a supplier to the noble lord lord kearton at some stage in my career in the chemical industry i have no detailed knowledge of the textile industry <e> <s> indeed i agreed to serve on the committee largely as a matter of serving my apprenticeship as a newcomer to your lordships house <e> <s> i must say that i welcome that experience and i have certainly benefited from it by listening to the comments of such experienced noble lords and through the chairmanship of the noble viscount lord rochdale who took us through this extremely complex matter with great care and skill <e> <s> i am grateful to him for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord mottistone in congratulating the noble lord lord northfield on tabling this question on the order paper today and indeed for the great work that he has done in this field of a small businesses <e> <s> first perhaps i ought to declare a very indirect interest in that the company for which i work shell uk is very active in the small business field and i am indebted to some of my colleagues for some of the items to which i shall refer tonight <e> <s> i suppose again that it will not come as any surprise that we on the liberal benches have always been keen on small businesses <e> <s> there might by those cynics about to say that we are a small business ourselves but we are changing that <e> <s> however clearly this is not a party matter it is something which goes across all sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt that your lordships house will this afternoon give an unopposed second reading to what i regard as a somewhat pathetic and puny bill <e> <s> i doubt whether a single voice will be raised against what is contained in the bill but there is no doubt that my colleagues and i believe that it is a totally inadequate measure <e> <s> in a sense it is also an unnecessary measure and a measure which stems from what i might describe as a clash of dogmatism <e> <s> dogmatism has been referred to from the government front bench and i would suggest that it is not all on one side of this argument <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord underhill we on these benches have no real objection to the order although in the submissions we in the liberal party made we asked for somewhat higher levels <e> <s> i note with interest that the increase is about per cent <e> <s> for parliamentary elections <e> <s> if one calculates the rate of inflation from the last elections in may that takes us to september of this year <e> <s> i wonder whether the government are trying to tell us something either that they are thinking of having an election then or that they do not expect inflation to increase after that time <e>", "<cs> i also will advise my colleagues to vote for the amendment <e> <s> in a sense the speech we have just heard underlines the point <e> <s> the problem is that reasonable may yet again be reinterpreted if these matters were to go before the law lords once again <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon has said what we need above all at this stage for the glc on transport matters is clarity otherwise we shall find ourselves going around the same bit of track in a few months time with the government getting up again and saying really the glc ought to suck it and see <e> <s> i believe that that is not acceptable <e> <s> although i have problems with the instructions to the greater london council from your lordships house i do not see any other way around this problem now that it has got to this stage <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down could i revert to the point i made at the end of my remarks <e> <s> the wording of the noble lords amendment refers to the exercise of the duty imposedby section of this act but by the withdrawal of his earlier amendment there is no reference to duty in section of the act as it stands unamended <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down does this extend into the area of burglar alarms <e> <s> it seems to me that this might well be the next technological breakthrough and that in fact burglar alarms instead of going off in the middle of the night and keeping the whole neighbourhood awake for the entire weekend might be geared into this sort of system with the sort of constraints and provisos about which the minister is talking <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches join in supporting the amendment which stands in the name of the noble lord lord sandford though with some slight qualifications <e> <s> i do not want to get into the debate which we had the other evening on the un-starred question put down by the noble lord lord northfield but i hope that when considering this amendment the noble lord the minister will look again at some of the points which were made that evening <e>", "<cs> my lords let me start by saying quite clearly from these benches that we welcome this bill and we thank the noble lord lord underhill for introducing it <e> <s> it fills a gap in the legislation which has been caused by the decision of the lords of appeal and the government made it quite clear through the noble lord lord bellwin during the discussion on the transport concessions london bill recently when they sought to confirm the position of london transport in relation to the elderly and the disabled that it was not their intention to take any further action <e> <s> therefore i think it is greatly to the credit of the noble lord lord underhill that he has brought this bill before your lordships today <e>", "<cs> my lords i hestiate to interject but this seems a little difficult coming from a government supporter <e> <s> what will he do if the government will not take it into their hands <e> <s> will london be simply left to rot <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord having now narrowed it down to a very very small minority give us an indication of how many of that minority would be susceptible to temptation and how many of that small minority of a small minority who are suceptible to temptation would actually fall for it <e> <s> then we could perhaps have the weight of his case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships are all grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for introducing this subject tonight <e> <s> it is perhaps not a subject likely to command the headlines in the morning papers or even to get more than a minute or two on today in parliament but i believe that it is an important function of your lordships house to discuss matters of this kind which are indeed significant in the life of the country <e> <s> i apologise for the absence of my noble friend lord beaumont of whitley whom i am sure would have spoken from these benches but he had a previous engagement and i have been thrust into the breach <e> <s> i make no claims to be an expert on the subject beyond having been interested in music for a number of years but i have no great expertise in it <e> <s> already twice tonight i have been asked what instruments i play and i think that they are less frightening than some of the instruments which the noble earl lord longford threatened to produce in your lordships house some weeks ago <e>", "<cs> my lords as perhaps the only member of your lordships house not to have taken part in that discussion on the falkland islands <e>", "<cs> together with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor as he reminds me perhaps we may now resume the debate on the motion moved by the noble lord lord lucas <e> <s> i welcome this opportunity to take part in a broad and wide-ranging debate on the subject of transport in the united kingdom <e> <s> it is a difficult subject primarily because it is one about which everybody knows something <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to the noble lord for interrupting again but i really take the point of his noble friend that we have carefully stayed away from this rather polemical subject this afternoon <e> <s> so i wonder whether the noble earl could draw that part of his remarks to a close lest people on other benches of this house may get rather over-excited at this late hour of the night <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly intervene from these benches to offer our thanks to the government for having ironed out what at committee stage looked to me to be an impossible tangle <e> <s> unlike many of your lordships i came fairly late into this particular arena <e> <s> indeed it was during the unstarred question debate instigated by the noble lord lord northfield <e> <s> the government have done a comprehensive job here <e> <s> they have sorted out a lot of the difficulties in a way which frankly i would not have believed possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord and i agree that that is the situation <e> <s> all we are saying is that this is still somewhat loosely drawn and a local authority that wished to do that within the terms that we have here could perhaps do so and they should be discouraged from doing so <e> <s> i do not see <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house takes note of the report of the european <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that speech <e> <s> when he was dealing with questions that had been put to him i felt he was perhaps a little more forthcoming than his basic brief allowed him to be and i am grateful to him for that <e> <s> there was a slight tendency one felt for the departmental straight bat to show through in his brief <e> <s> i could see that the noble lord lord ohagan was a little depressed at the answer he received <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether there are some historical reasons for the development of this process <e> <s> it seems to me that about years ago many windscreens had laminated glass <e> <s> one of the problems was that if in an accident people put their heads through the windscreen as i think the noble lord lord lucas said the way in which that glass shattered was much more damaging because it tended to go into long slivers or daggers which were very destructive <e> <s> i remember later being quite pleased at the thought that in front of me was a windscreen that would break into small pieces and would not do so much damage <e> <s> with seat belts and the hope that fewer people will be going through their windscreens in future it may be that the move should be back to laminated glass <e> <s> these are considerations in a dynamic developing situation in the technology of windscreen manufacture <e>", "<cs> my lords may i begin by doing three things first of all to congratulate the noble baroness on having had the opportunity and the wit and the perseverance to bring this bill before your lordships today secondly to apologise to your lordships since because of the lateness of the hour and the number of members down to speak and owing to a previous engagement i may not be able to stay till the end much as i would have wished to and thirdly to commiserate somewhat with the noble lord lord elton <e> <s> i think he has done his best in a difficult situation <e> <s> as the noble lord lord bruce of donington has said he has perhaps not got quite the same didactic approach to these subjects as his predecessor lord trefgarne <e> <s> he has indeed allowed logic to be bent or to be put aside for a minute and i am quite sure his predecessor would not have allowed that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating the noble lord on that very firm reply may i ask whether the important factor in this matter is to strengthen the lebanese government to give support to the lebanese army in making lebanon lebanese and to assist in removing all hostile forces from her shores <e>", "<cs> my lords this statement for which we are grateful clearly comes in two parts and perhaps i may deal first with the part relating to the secretary of state <e> <s> it is of course very easy in another place to make a lot of political capital out of this situation <e> <s> i hope that noble lords in this house will not go down that track <e> <s> the suggestion that for a modest shareholding the whole of the governments judgment is to be corrupted seems to me to be nonsense and i am very glad that the secretary of state is in his place to hear the views from at least these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to intervene and pick up one point which the minister made <e> <s> i can well understand that he can take some amusement from the fact that noble lords are trying to give the secretary of state increased powers when on many occasions we are trying to decrease those powers <e> <s> indeed on such occasions it is either that secretaries of state are trying to take powers from other areas such as local authorities and we have seen quite a bit of that in recent times or that they are asking for open-ended powers <e> <s> in a case like this where the secretary of state is being asked to take powers to defend the weak and to assist those people who do not read government publications as much as we do there is a much more valid reason for making the type of insertion in a bill which this amendment seeks to do <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is surely grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for raising what is a serious matter <e> <s> the noble lord the minister will not be surprised when i say that noble lords on these benches are averse to interfering in local government in the day-to-day running of local government <e> <s> there have been exchanges between this bench and the noble lord on interventions by the secretary of state and others in local government matters <e> <s> there was one only the other night and doubtless we shall return to the matter when we come to the question of the transport bill <e> <s> we believe that local authorities should have the freedom to act within what is their proper area <e> <s> that should certainly be subject to the law <e> <s> we also believe that they have a duty to get the best deal possible in their tendering and contracts in their purchasing on behalf of the local ratepayers <e> <s> it is no part of their duty to act on the basis of trying to coerce central government on matters of national policy <e>", "<cs> my lords too should like to join in the thanks extended to the noble lord the minister who always gives a clear exposition of the bills that he brings to your lordships house <e> <s> he tells me that this is the twentieth bill that he has brought to the house in the period that he has been here <e> <s> unfortunately having listened most carefully to what he had to say i merely find that the conclusion that i had reached before the debate started has been underlined namely that this is not a transport bill at all <e> <s> i have to offer the house an alternative long title for the bill which would read <e>", "<cs> may i reinforce that point <e> <s> it seems to me that one of the reasons we are in this position as we said so many times on second reading is a lack of criteria in the bill that decide how the global sum is reached by the secretary of state <e> <s> if the government <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister really has any understanding of what we are trying to say from this side of the committee <e> <s> i take his point that the amendment as drafted may be too narrow or in some ways too wide <e> <s> perhaps from these benches we would not wish to go in for the degree in social engineering that the labour front bench might wish to pursue <e> <s> but until we have some indication from the government as to the rules which the secretary of state intends to apply in reaching his conclusions we are in considerable difficulty <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord the minister nevertheless agree that where a bill has not been subject to full presentation in the other place regardless of who was to blame and i make no comment on that there is still a responsibility on your lordships house to see that the legislation is properly vetted <e>", "<cs> the simple point that i want to make is that even if one accepts the whole of that argument which i do not is a transport bill the right way of coming at it or is a better form of local government finance a better way of coming at it as my noble friend lady stedman would i am sure support <e> <s> the social democratic party and the liberal party have been working on this for some considerable time and she <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment i would point out that line on page of the bill refers to the general level of transport <e> <s> in a sense it is a two-dimensional requirement <e> <s> the amendment adds a third dimension in terms of the integration of transport which is not necessarily contained within clause <e>", "<cs> i take the point that the noble lord is trying to make <e> <s> surely subsection as in the amendment refers to the advice and guidance given by the secretary of state which is a different matter <e> <s> what we are trying to get at in this amendment is to feel at the end of day that the secretary of state has come to his advice and guidance on some rational basis <e> <s> we are making legislation here for some time to come and secretaries of state change <e> <s> one may have the greatest possible confidence in the present secretary of state even if others have not <e> <s> this is what we are trying to probe with this amendment what rational process is going on in the mind of the secretary of state when he comes to the decision to give advice or guidance <e> <s> it relates to that advice and guidance which we all know is semi-mandatory at the end of the day <e> <s> but even if it is not how does he arrive at that decision <e> <s> it may be that the details in this amendment are not the right ones <e> <s> perhaps some of the people to be consulted are not here perhaps some of the people who are here do not need to be consulted <e> <s> he needs surely to take some advice from outside in reaching his decision on what advice he shall give <e>", "<cs> we always listen with interest and respect to the noble dukes interpretation of the views of the hierarchy but i am not entirely sure of its relevance to this amendment <e> <s> i want to follow the noble lord lord mishcon and to say that although what he says is important and we hope that the minister will give some assurance along these lines i hope that in addition he can give some assurance in relation to paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think we are grateful to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for that intervention <e> <s> this was the line which i was proposing to take <e> <s> we have heard frequently in this committee stage that the object of the bill is to give certainty to local authorities up to the level of the amount of grant which the secretary of state is going to authorise <e> <s> surely it is beyond that point that the local authorities need to look for some sort of guidelines as to what is permissible and what is not permissible <e> <s> if the governments attitude is that under no circumstances should any local authority ever go beyond those guidelines that is somewhat at variance with some of the messages that have been coming from the government front bench during this committee stage <e> <s> if at some stage these things are to be tested in the courts it seems to me that the guidelines ought to be within the terms of the and acts <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> did i hear the noble lord aright when he suggested that we should actually demolish the staff of the local <e>", "<cs> this is a circular argument <e> <s> if the bill is to work there will have to be an enormous number of civil servants <e> <s> it goes back to the point made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the only way to get out of that is to demolish local government <e> <s> that is the track we are going down <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i have made a second reading speech since th february and i do not intend to begin another one now <e> <s> i should like to return to the amendment and make one or two simple <e>", "<cs> with respect if the noble lord the minister does not see that it matters which way around this goes why should it not go the right way around and the proper way around and the way that retains the respect of the authority <e>", "<cs> but the noble lord the minister has indicated that he knows which comes first <e>", "<cs> it was interesting that the noble lord lord campbell should have stated the principle of the bill so clearly because clause is an integral part of clause <e> <s> it is a neat way by which the secretary of state can divide up or force a local authority to divide up a transport undertaking into small bite-sized pieces so that the secretary of state can subsequently force it to sell them off by tender <e> <s> he is right to say that this is a crucial part of that chain of command as it were and for that reason we on these benches support the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes in this particular clause but as we have seen in earlier clauses there are other penalties which can accrue from not doing what the secretary of state wishes <e> <s> may i turn to something different and ask the minister whether he can assist us <e> <s> i assume that at the end of the day the secretary of state will be interested in the results of such a review <e> <s> if that is the case i am not clear what the reporting mechanism is and indeed i am surprised that this question has not been asked from the government back-benches and to that end in order that the quality of the review can be thought about by the secretary of state presumably this will require some further civil service back-up in the department of transport <e> <s> we heard the other day of the large increases in staff which will be required <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i think said that it would be a good idea if so far as the glc was concerned all these civil servants were transferred into the central department <e> <s> can the minister give any idea of the increase in size of the civil service as a result of this <e>", "<cs> with regard to the first amendment i had intended to come to this matter at a later stage when dealing with the clause as a whole but it seems to me that it is not so simple as accepting a tender because the executives have the problem that separately identifiable parts of their business do not necessarily stand on their own in relation to the totality of the service being provided <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for that comment <e> <s> perhaps we might consider coming back at a later stage of the bill with an amendment to cover this particular point <e> <s> but i am most grateful to him for what he has said <e>", "<cs> from these benches i think i should say first that we have no dogmatic objection to private services being intermingled with public services <e> <s> but we would object to the secretary of state and the department of transport telling local authorities that they must do these things <e> <s> the minister has said on a number of occasions in response to both myself and others that there is no compulsion within clause <e> <s> no there is no compulsion within clause <e> <s> as the noble lord lord sefton of garston rightly says the compulsion lies within clause <e> <s> it is a financial compulsion <e> <s> when the pel is being drawn up all these matters will be taken into consideration and an executive will not know at the time when it has to make some of these decisions what impact it will have on the setting of the pel <e> <s> it is left in the dark until the end of the year when these matters are discussed <e> <s> then it finds out the penalty for having taken or not taken certain steps <e>", "<cs> this clause reminds me of a piece of a p herbert in i think <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord this <e> <s> these are provisional figures <e> <s> can we then take it that the final figures could be lower than those shown in the white paper <e>", "<cs> i think that there is a particular case for including this provision <e> <s> unemployed people have to travel to seek work <e> <s> they do not all have bicycles <e> <s> persons under training may well have to travel some distance <e> <s> it is surely in the interests of the country as a whole that this provision should be agreed to <e>", "<cs> very briefly i must follow that point of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway because if it is true for the elderly the blind and the disabled there are concessions already in the bill <e> <s> this is the point that the noble lord lord underhill is making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord aberdare and lord lucas of chilworth for what they have said and to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> the fact that we have had such stimulating contributions from all parts of the house justifies my having put this motion on the order paper today <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty is that the national bus company is under no obligation to supply such information however firmly the executive may request it <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment as i read it is to make it necessary for the national bus company to provide such information as is requested by the executive <e> <s> otherwise the nbc may just say no which will place the executive in very considerable difficulties in supplying that information to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i made the somewhat flippant remark on second reading that the clause as drafted gave power to the secretary of state to have a review every thursday fortnight <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill has said a reasonable secretary of state would not call for a review more frequently than he felt was absolutely necessary but let us consider the position if the present wording of the bill had been set down as an amendment <e> <s> undoubtedly the minister would say that it was foolish because it left the bill wide open and was bad drafting <e> <s> i suggest that the bill as drafted leaves a lot to be desired <e> <s> even if the government do not accept that three years is the correct period i hope they will agree that the bill needs amending and if they would prefer a period other than three years perhaps they will bring forward an amendment at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely wanted to refer the noble lord to the wording of the bill <e> <s> it does not talk about being satisfactory in all respects but about the <e>", "<cs> my lords i expressed my views on this bill at second reading and i think that i was one of the first to say that this was not a transport bill at all but it was in fact a local government finance bill <e> <s> that has been echoed several times since <e> <s> how often at this stage of the bill one hears members on both sides of the house saying that we send it away a better bill than it reached us <e> <s> in this case we send it on its way in exactly the same form in which it arrived at second reading <e> <s> i will come back to that later <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that in these wide-ranging thoughts that his right honourable colleague is having they do not include the possibility of reintroducing to the housing bill when it comes through the parliamentary process again any thoughts on the sale of charitable housing association dwellings <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that perhaps we should put our own house in order first <e> <s> will he contemplate an experiment of using wheel clamps in the lords car park outside nos <e> <s> and old palace yard in order that those people who park in an unauthorised manner there blocking parking bays for the staff should be discouraged from so doing <e> <s> will he agree that it is not only difficult for the staff but it may pose a threat to the security of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord underhill i thank the minister for the statement but also like lord underhill i fear that i do not altogether welcome it <e> <s> as he said we spent a considerable amount of time last year on the transport bill when i remember that the government worked very hard to get it through without amendment <e> <s> may i say that i hope that opportunity will be given not only for consultation which is referred to in the statement and in the white paper itself but for a debate on the white paper before the government move into hasty legislation on this because it is going to be contentious <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has put his finger on a number of items that will be contentious even if i do not necessarily agree with the direction in which all his points lead <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord to answer my question about the possibility of a debate on the white paper before legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords we are also grateful that the statement has been repeated in this house <e> <s> it is an important document <e> <s> as already indicated by the noble lord lord underhill it covers a wide range of issues which makes it difficult as the long list of questions that he has put shows to handle a statement of this sort in this way <e> <s> i hope there will be an early opportunity to debate this whole subject not just in relation to objectives of the chairman of british rail but also the inter-relation between them and some sort of transport strategy for this country in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords after that interesting excursion perhaps i can draw you back to the subject of travel concessions for the unemployed <e> <s> first i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for being absent from the chamber during the first few minutes of his speech <e> <s> i made the mistake of thinking that the two statements would run one after the other <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me he is not quite accurate in saying that the bill was defeated <e> <s> it was put back this day six months <e>", "<cs> my lords we are also grateful to the noble lord the minister for repeating this statement <e> <s> we are also glad that some of the fears have been removed from people using the bridge <e> <s> clearly however the situation is still not anything like satisfactory <e> <s> what appeared to be a disaster area has now become merely unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord bellwin for repeating this answer <e> <s> i would not wish in any way to be alarmist about this situation i think it is very easy to draw alarmist conclusions <e> <s> recently there has been much publicity about leukaemia cases occurring near to windscale <e> <s> my own view is that one should be suspicious of too many conclusions being drawn from a very small sample <e> <s> however that will not make the problem go away <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether taking the lord chancellors point and not wishing to pursue the purity of the amendment to the ultimate there is not a sense in which subsection <e>", "<cs> i must begin by informing your lordships that i am a beneficiary from a pension fund of a large oil company which i suspect has little bearing on what i have to say but i say it just the same <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i might distance myself from the more general remarks made by the noble lord lord bishopston <e> <s> quite clearly noble lords on these benches do not regard the oil companies as being rogues and vagabonds tucking away vast sums of money untaxed <e> <s> but on the narrow point of this amendment which is what i thought we were speaking to we will support it <e>", "<cs> my lords to follow the last comment made by the noble lord lord bruce of donington i believe i can say that nobody in this house is more relieved than i am as until four months ago i was living within yards of this particular establishment <e> <s> it is with some gratitude that i am reassured by the statement not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my former neighbours and particularly of the staff and patients at the cottage hospital which is within yards of the national physical laboratory <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are in some slight difficulty <e> <s> as i heard the statement it did not actually contain those words <e> <s> it may be that the noble lord lord bruce of donington has in his hand a piece of paper which does contain those words but they were not part of the statement read out in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that and further to the reply that the minister gave to my noble friend lord grimond may i ask whether there is some responsibility in this country in so far as the ship i understand was loaded in a british port <e>", "<cs> is the noble

to understand why people are so averse to the clause being drawn widely <e> <s> we are talking about discrimination <e> <s> i should think it unfortunate if people were discriminated against for

of the the trainers at a later stage in the bill but as the noble lord rightly says the statutory instrument refers to the first three months of the licence <e> <s> that is the point at which the trainee is at his most vulnerable and inexperienced <e> <s> the fact that at a later stage he may have greater supervision is slightly irrelevant to the point that i was making <e> <s> it is in the first three months that the apprentice instructor needs the greatest degree of supervision <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the wholly part of the bill <e> <s> it is the partly which is worrying us <e> <s> it is surely a concomitant of industrial action of strike action that you seek to damage the person against whom you strike <e> <s> it

argument is to be carried to its logical conclusion the government will shortly be offering a per cent <e> <s> rebate after no occupation at all <e>", "<cs> on that particular point if we are going to detain the committee on matters of this sort <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that those tenants who buy are good tenants and those who do not are bad tenants <e> <s> is that what he is trying to

these benches we would wish to say that we are somewhat amazed by the governments attitude <e> <s> they seem able to stand back from this important dispute and pretend that they are innocent bystanders <e> <s> we would not go down the road of suggesting that this is all a diabolical plot to destroy the num or the trade union movement as a whole <e> <s> nevertheless we are in a position where the most serious confrontation is taking place in one of our basic industries a basic industry which we need to nurture for the future and which in the recent past produced <e>", "<cs> my lords it is just over a year since we started this experience together and it is nearly four hours since we started this debate <e> <s> i feel that after speakers i had better be brief because the noble lord on the front bench opposite has been very patient and he deserves to be able to stand up very soon and let us know what the government really feel about some of our recommendations <e>", "<cs> to pick up the point that the noble lord lord sandford made as the bill stands at the moment it is only in one house of parliament and not in both houses unless and until those later amendments are accepted by this house <e> <s> the clause refers as the bill stands at the moment to the house of commons only <e> <s> this house would have no say at all <e>", "<cs> my lords in these circumstances

house as well <e>", "<cs> without going back to second reading speeches again your lordships will not be surprised to hear me say that we regard this amendment as a second best <e> <s> what we would have greatly preferred is a proper elected body looking after the whole of london transport in a wider area than is intended in the bill <e> <s> we are not going to get that but i hope that we can make some progress on these two <e>", "<cs> if i may follow the point of the noble lord lord alport i would say that the consumer at marks and spencer has another alternative which is to take his business elsewhere <e> <s> in the case of london transport short of climbing into his car and increasing the traffic congestion he does not have that opportunity and that seems to me to be a further distinction <e> <s> perhaps i may make a more general point arising out of the debate <e>", "<cs> i do not think that any of us doubt the respect with which the noble lord the minister views the national bus company but i must say that what he has said today will cause very considerable disquiet in their ranks <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for that but i am not sure that it really helps very much <e> <s> if <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had a series of very simple amendments but i seemed to have stirred up a hornets nest <e> <s> reverting to the words that were used in relation to another earlier amendment when noble lords were talking about the necessity of giving london transport some idea of how it could proceed quickly when we were talking about the appointed day we were told that london regional transport <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to that for the time being means at any particular moment in time in the future as needs change <e> <s> that is inherent in the amendment but perhaps not so clear in the bill <e> <s> that certainly is the intention of the wording <e> <s> it may be that the wording is defective as so often amendments from non-government sources are defective <e> <s> doubtless the minister will tell us about that <e> <s> the intention is that the needs of london as a whole will change from time to time so we are not trying to put in a rigid requirement which is immutable for all time but one that responds to the needs not merely of passenger transport but of greater london as a whole over a continuing period of time <e>", "<cs> i thought that we would come to a fair confrontation on this point <e> <s> this is where philosophically the two sides of the committee divide <e> <s> may i say first to the noble lord lord plummer that i am delighted to hear that pimlico is still there because i use it most mornings and i thought for a minute that he had abolished it <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill summed up the position when he talked about the other needs that exist <e> <s> of course we are not as the minister suggested expecting that london regional transport will be able to cater for every single need on every occasion throughout the whole of greater london <e> <s> but unless we have within the duties of london regional transport some reference to the needs other than the narrow passenger transport needs then we shall not have the sort of london that we want to see <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that when ministers resort to semantics in attacking an amendment they have not got a very good case <e> <s> we all know what we mean by integration <e> <s> we all know that there is a difference between integration and mere co-operation <e> <s> as i said when withdrawing the previous amendment amendment no <e> <s> has our support from these benches and it would have been a pity if the amendment had not been debated <e> <s> however i should <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister talked about the primacy of the financial control but this amendment does not move the primacy back to the duty <e> <s> it states that they shall have due regard <e> <s> that seems to me to be a reasonable balancing point between these difficult problems of need and finance <e> <s> we shall be talking a lot about this during the passage of this bill but let us try to get the balance right <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment gets the balance as nearly right as possible and that the minister is pushing the balance much too far in the direction of financial control <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that clause is rather remarkable <e> <s> throughout the whole of our recent debate we have been pressing for duties to be written into the bill and for those which have been negated by the government and here we have a blanket clause which states that under no circumstances can decisions of the secretary of state on the matter of duty be challenged in the courts <e> <s> i do not need to take the committee through the bromley situation <e> <s> that was regarded by some people as a good thing and by other people as a bad thing <e> <s> nevertheless under the law it was a perfectly right and proper action for bromley to take even if one did not agree with the result <e> <s> but for the government to write into the bill this kind of clause whereby the executive is not capable of being challenged in parliament except in a very minor way once a year when these matters come before another place seems to me to be a very dangerous principle <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to both noble lords who intervened before i sat down <e> <s> i should very much like to read what the minister said <e> <s> my intention was to take this away and think about it in relation to the other amendments relating to the national bus company though i accept that this relates to other matters as well <e> <s> i am sure that we will have to debate this at a further stage <e> <s> i am most grateful to both the noble lord lord teviot and to the minister and i now beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this again turns on the whole question of the fragmentation of transport in greater london <e> <s> i too feel that there is a real danger that the government are going down the road of what i would describe as sub-optimisation <e> <s> various undertakings are being set up whether they be privatised eventually and we shall come to that in a few moments or whether they be the segregation of undertakings still under the control of london transport which will by their very nature try to sub-optimise their own operations <e> <s> in other words they will try to become cost effective in relation to their own operations without due regard to the operations of other parts of the london transport network <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble earl is saying but he slightly contradicts himself <e> <s> he talks about the lowest possible cost and then he talks about cost-effectiveness but they are not the same thing <e> <s> if they are forced to accept tenders at the lowest possible <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that i accept that point of view <e> <s> i should have thought that in this much more rational chamber where debates are listened to and ideas are exchanged there is a far better chance of the government accepting interesting amendments whether from this side of the committee or their own <e>", "<cs> i accept what the noble lord says in terms of the three-year period <e> <s> on re-reading the matter under his guidance i believe i was wrong in what i said and i withdraw it <e> <s> i should like to have another look at the whole question <e> <s> i am not satisfied that a statement is the same as a plan or that the planning system is anything like adequate within the bill as it has been redrafted <e> <s> nevertheless in the circumstances of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the answer that i have been given <e> <s> it explains some of the problems that we had in mind <e> <s> clearly we are anxious to establish a sensible dialogue between the lrt and london regional transport <e> <s> as i indicated this was very much a probing amendment and in response to the ministers reply i beg leave to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> one begins to think it is christmas <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is coming up with goodies all round <e> <s> i accept that he has fulfilled the undertaking that his right honourable friend gave at a late stage in another place <e> <s> i should very much like to read what he said on the fourth part of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am not sure that i entirely go along with his reasoning there but i accept that under the third part <e>", "<cs> i am sorry <e> <s> it is the phrase <e>", "<cs> in other words they know very well that if they do not take into account their supplies will be cut off <e> <s> as i said this is not a very effective amendment <e> <s> the noble lord has been helpful <e> <s> i think it is a clause that we will want to look at again and maybe come back at report stage with perhaps some alternative suggestion on this subsection <e> <s> but meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i merely want to endorse what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> it seems to me that the idea of a rolling plan which we discussed last year in debates on the bill was a better form of planning <e> <s> again one would like to see plan rather than statement but it is a perfectly normal procedure these days in all sorts of business connections to have a rolling system of planning <e> <s> i find it very difficult to understand why this has been changed from what seemed to be a quite sensible provision in the bill last year <e>", "<cs> i am fascinated by clause <e>", "<cs> i just thought that perhaps the greater london council might be pleased to know that the government are still speaking to them <e>", "<cs> this may apply to the first amendment but surely not to the second amendment <e> <s> i thought the purpose of the second amendment was to put a top limit on and stop the wording of this clause the word maximum being raised above the limit which is contained in the earlier clause <e> <s> as i heard what the noble lord lord underbill said it was his purpose to stop that figure being raised to or even per cent <e> <s> it may be that there would be some semantic argument in the use of the word proportion <e> <s> it seems to me it might be possible to raise it to per cent <e> <s> or even per cent <e> <s> if there is no limit put on as in the second amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to do two things <e> <s> first of all i want to support the amendments which the noble lord lord underhill has brought forward <e> <s> i think we talked quite a lot about the planning process the other night and i do not propose again to refer to the arguments we had at that time but there is another matter on which i should like guidance <e> <s> i was told when there was a change in the status of amendment no <e> <s> that in fact it was going to be moved as amendment no <e> <s> a and taken after no <e> <s> in our list <e> <s> i should like guidance on that <e> <s> having said that i give my full support to these amendments <e>", "<cs> i rise to speak since we are speaking at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> which is consequential on no <e> <s> i am not sure how we have got into this cox and box situation with the consequential amendment being moved from here <e> <s> nevertheless i must say that we support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it seems to me that a number of these amendments to which we are coming and the subsequent ones on the passengers committee relate more to the tone and the attitude which is to be taken between the participants <e> <s> we expressed our worries throughout the last part of the committee stage and to a certain extent today partly about the lack of accountability and the fact that accountability to the london members of parliament seems hardly adequate <e> <s> as i said earlier even if they all voted together in a block in another place they would be overwhelmed by the governments majority there <e>", "<cs> may i stress that the clause refers to the passengers committee <e> <s> there will surely have to be consultation with the passengers committee <e> <s> as i have already said this will be a very important body the matrix of the governments set-up <e> <s> it will be a key point in the relationship with the travelling public <e> <s> at second reading i said that i was worried about the passengers committee becoming a toothless watchdog <e> <s> the attitude which is being adopted towards this amendment seems to me to confirm that point of view <e> <s> even if the duty to consult local authorities is thought to be too onerous surely the passengers committee by its very nature ought to be consulted not just informed <e>", "<cs> if that is the way we have to proceed but i must say that this is news to me <e> <s> i am surprised that we should have to take amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> a before amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i am not prepared to go to the wall for this change of words <e> <s> again it is more a question of style and terminology than anything else <e> <s> as the noble lord lord somers said there seems to be a danger of london regional transport appearing to be somewhat dictatorial and i thought that there was an opportunity here for lrt to show that the information it provides will be designed for the people who will have to use it and not just for lrts own purposes <e> <s> but the government are obviously adamant on this point and with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed by the governments continuing attitude on this aspect <e> <s> i am most grateful to noble lords on other benches for their interventions <e> <s> it seems to me that the statutory provision is already in the bill for london regional transport to cause particulars and so on to be published <e> <s> it says that it should be in such a manner as it thinks fit <e> <s> all i am asking is that it should be in such a manner as to be of use to the user of the information <e> <s> that is the only difference between us <e> <s> it is not a question as to whether or not something should be made statutory by the bill <e>", "<cs> we are making our customary progress again i am afraid <e> <s> i find it very difficult when the noble lord says <e> <s> yes the government are looking at the whole question of nationalised industries and therefore we cannot put it into this particular bill <e> <s> this seems to be an argument that arises fairly regularly <e>", "<cs> in the few minutes that we have not got to spare may i support amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord teviot is perhaps a little optimistic about the effect of the amendment but it is certainly something that should be done as a spur towards co-operation and consultation between the various bodies <e> <s> one would prefer rather more positive steps to be included in the bill but so far we have failed to achieve that end <e> <s> there is no doubt that what the noble lord proposes will act as a mirror that can be held up to london regional transport and that should show its shortcomings in this area <e> <s> so far as the other two amendments are concerned anything in the bill that increases the amount of information at a time when many of us are campaigning for greater freedom of information is a good thing <e> <s> i therefore support those amendments as well <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> it is useful to have on the record further reassurance of the attitude of the government to the integration of rail and lrt services <e> <s> i think the noble lord may be a little sanguine in view of past history although more recent history has been somewhat more encouraging but i suspect that is because of the intervention of the glc as much as anything <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the intention behind this amendment because as we have pointed out several times we are worried about the composition of this committee <e> <s> for my own part i am less than happy with such a large proportion of people being nominated by local authorities <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a danger as there frequently is in certain areas of political appointments being made and political dogmatism creeping in if we are not careful <e> <s> it happens in some places with the appointment of school governors <e> <s> it is sad that it should be so but i am afraid it does happen <e> <s> i therefore have considerable hesitation in supporting the terms of this amendment although i understand the thinking behind it <e> <s> also i am not very reassured by what the noble earl the minister has said <e>", "<cs> there is a slightly different dimension here in terms of london <e> <s> one wants some sort of balance of people from inner london and the outer suburban areas and maybe people who use the outer commuter services <e> <s> that is why the idea of local authority nomination is seductive <e> <s> i have put forward my qualifications <e> <s> but it is a question of getting a matrix of interests both geographical and functional <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> at least some goodies are coming this way tonight <e> <s> of course communications between another place and your lordships house are probably the most difficult in the world <e> <s> it is far easier to communicate with hong kong or deepest africa than with some of our honourable friends in another place <e> <s> i was not aware of the tangle in another place until the minister explained it <e> <s> i am most grateful that he has put us all on the right track and i am sure the committee will accept his amendment in which case i shall not move my own amendment <e>", "<cs> we recognise that schemes change from time to time <e> <s> what this amendment says is that they should be no less favourable not that they should not change <e>", "<cs> i had anticipated that perhaps the noble earl might refer to places outside greater london and i concede that that is a weakness of this amendment but in the governments fall-back scheme i see no reference to the outside authorities he <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl and with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has put his finger on a very important point <e> <s> when we listen to the government speaking on local government finance they tell us that the reason for this is that certain local authorities are spending their money unwisely on foolish projects <e> <s> they point in particular at the glc in this regard <e> <s> but i do not think that any of the projects that he mentioned could be regarded as foolish <e> <s> home helps and other matters of that kind which he mentioned are not foolish <e> <s> is he really saying that it is the governments intention willy-nilly to force local authorities to choose between these quite vital services <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the basis of what he was saying <e>", "<cs> that is precisely the answer that one expects from the government but it does not bear on this point <e> <s> what parliament is saying here is that the local authorities should put together a voluntary scheme for concessionary fares <e> <s> if that is what parliament wishes then parliament should make sure that the local authorities have the finance to provide those schemes without doing it at the expense of home helps and the other matters which the noble lord suggested <e> <s> i accept that there has been foolish spending by a number of local authorities in different parts of the country but that as i see it does not bear on the argument that i am putting before your lordships today <e> <s> i am extremely disappointed that the government are not prepared to go along with the suggestions i have made here and i feel that i must divide the committee on this issue <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a very small point to what the noble lord lord pitt has said <e> <s> i support everything that he has said on this <e> <s> by imposing these off-peak restrictions you are not only restricting those people who are moving out of town on the busy buses but also the people who are moving into town on buses that are very often empty <e> <s> it may be just as important for elderly people to travel from somewhere outside the city to see their relatives or whoever else at precisely this time of night <e> <s> they may want to go to see their grandchildren at teatime or whatever <e> <s> i do not want to tell a great sob story <e> <s> all i am saying is that by putting this sort of blanket restriction on the off-peak you are not only blocking people getting on the buses at what is accepted is a reasonably busy time i think the noble lord lord pitt has dealt with that you are also putting a restriction on those people who could on their return journey be travelling on buses which in many cases are travelling empty <e>", "<cs> it does not refer to anything wild that the glc is going to do <e> <s> it says that <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches support what the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead <e> <s> has said <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will understand that retrospective legislation is anathema and this is a piece of retrospective legislation <e> <s> could the noble lord the minister indicate whether there have been any substantial amounts of capital expenditure to date and whether he anticipates that there are likely to be any major items of capital expenditure between now and the time at which the bill becomes an act <e> <s> if not would he be prepared to accept an amendment at a later stage which was not the appointed day i can see that there may be some problems in that and not the date on which the bill was published but the date on which the bill becomes law <e> <s> that seems to me along with the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead to be the proper way in which to proceed <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord the minister be precise about this <e> <s> have these expenditures been entered into since the date the bill was published <e>", "<cs> at such a late stage of the committee stage of this long bill <e> <s> i should have thought that the government could be more forthcoming <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord teviot has made his case <e> <s> that fact has been acknowledged by the government <e> <s> surely they could accept it at this stage <e> <s> this is the right place to have this piece of legislation <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale were here i am sure that he would give us another speech on consolidation <e> <s> this is a means of consolidating an important measure and putting it where it ought to be <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord the minister will give way on this important measure <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to support this amendment which stands in the names of my noble friend lord attlee and myself as well as of the noble lords lord underhill and lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> i do not wish to make another second reading speech but i think that this word integration goes to the heart of a lot of what we on this side of the house feel about london transport for the future <e> <s> we are after all trying to produce a system of public passenger transport in london which will be attractive to the consumer <e> <s> it will not be attractive to the consumer if it goes down the road of disintegration as i described it at an earlier stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say that i was happier with the amendments that we had down on the committee stage <e> <s> it seems to me that a proper interpretation of those amendments would have come nearer to saying what needed to be said as against what this will perhaps achieve <e> <s> nevertheless it is an honest attempt to try to achieve in the bill a proper balance between needs and finance <e> <s> when one says that the government tend to say you are exaggerating needs <e> <s> you are trying to get money out of a bottomless pit and on this side there is a suspicion that as the noble lord lord underhill has said if the bill is left as it is finance will be so powerful and the treasury will have such a big stick that the genuine needs of london transport will be seriously undermined <e>", "<cs> again my lords i added my name to this amendment along with my noble friend lord attlee <e> <s> i cannot embellish much on what the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> it seems to me that the government have made a management decision here <e> <s> they have pre-empted the decision of london regional transport <e> <s> what we do not know are the bases on which that management decision has been made <e> <s> the government have given no clear indication as to why this decision should be made at this stage of the game before london regional transport has been set up <e> <s> they are saying to london regional transport before it is created you must split the bus and the other undertakings <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have not got my name on this amendment i do support it <e> <s> the problems to which the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has alluded are ones which worry a great many people as privatisation becomes more and more a fact of life these days <e> <s> a concern that one hears raised on many occasions when local authorities are privatising their dustbin service when health authorities are privatising laundry services and so on is that this should not be a charter for the cowboys <e> <s> i am sure that the government would not wish that to be the case but i do think that something needs to be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely want to say that the necessity for this amendment underlines a point that was made by several of us at second reading which is that the area being considered is too small <e> <s> the fact is that london regional transport should be part of a metropolitan transport authority which goes outside the present bounds of the greater london council <e> <s> but in the absence of that and the absence of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord

to think at some later moment about what this amendment actually says that the power <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i would join in from these benches in the absence of my noble friend lord banks who was active during the earlier stages of the bill on this issue <e> <s> the amendment has our strong support <e> <s> in a sense it is the price that the government have to pay for the way in which they have gone about organising london regional transport <e> <s> i shall say more about that generally at a later stage this afternoon <e> <s> it cannot be left to chance and i detect that it is the mood of your lordships house that it cannot be left to chance in the hands of this great patchwork of local authorities in london <e> <s> with the best will in the world they cannot put together in present <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl makes the point that lrt should not grant tenders to unscrupulous employers <e> <s> if there is no obligation written into the bill how will lrt know whether they are unscrupulous <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to use the forbidden word but i shall talk about co-ordination <e> <s> it seems to me that this is one of the last backstops of co-ordination in the patchwork of transport which we shall have when independent operators become more usual in london <e> <s> i believe that if we have regard to the needs of the passengers in greater london then the passengers committee should he put into a position where they have a statutory right to look at the whole of this patchwork and not just that part of it which is controlled by london transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no doubt that the noble lord <e> <s> lord underhill will respond at the end but if i may say so <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady gardner is wrong on this <e> <s> the reserve scheme is there if the boroughs fall down <e> <s> what this amendment is saying is that there should be certain minimum standards within any scheme that the boroughs put together and that one of the minima that should be included in the boroughs scheme which we all hope will be put together although i think some of us are less sanguine than others about the possibility is a criterion in relation to hours that is the same as in the reserve scheme <e> <s> i believe that is all it is saying <e>", "<cs> my lords since the noble lady addresses me before i have sat down perhaps i had better remain standing and say a word <e> <s> it seems to me that if a borough wishes to have a better standard then it would be up to it to persuade the other boroughs to adopt that better standard <e> <s> with this written into the bill as i see it one borough standing out for a better standard would not wreck the whole scheme <e> <s> this would be the minimum which parliament had agreed was the acceptable minimum around which the boroughs could agree <e> <s> as i say there may be a chance of having better provisions in the voluntary scheme as it were <e> <s> but at least within the voluntary scheme there would be a fall-back position which at the moment does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> surely the noble lord is slightly wrong about that <e> <s> if there were a common voluntary scheme then there would have to be the same hours across the board <e> <s> in other words it would not be possible would it <e> <s> to work a system where people who were benefiting from a voluntary scheme in one borough were given different times from people in another borough <e> <s> the result of that and this is where i support the noble lord is that we should get the lowest common denominator and therefore that the scheme which was brought in could well be below the minimum standards that we have suggested are required in the back-up scheme <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord moves on to that point may i ask whether the noble earl is suggesting that companies should set up a political fund which should be susceptible to the votes of shareholders that seems to be the logic of his argument and that unless and until that is done companies should not give money to political parties from their general funds <e> <s> that seems to be the logic of his position <e>", "<cs> from this corner of the house as one who has never served in any government but who still has hopes may i thank the noble viscount the leader of the house <e> <s> one ought to say from this side of the house that the withdrawal of the noble earl lord halsbury must be without prejudice to his future position <e> <s> we respect that and we shall support it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister has said that we can make no assumptions <e> <s> it seems to me that the assumption which your lordships must make is that the bill is as it now is in other words the bill is as amended by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if we are to proceed we should proceed on that basis and certain consequences flow from that namely that the delegated members of a new council are for the time being a myth and that there will be elections in greater london and the metropolitan councils next may <e> <s> therefore any other interim provision relating to that is a <e>", "<cs> did i not understand the noble lord <e> <s> lord graham to say that that provision had been repealed in an act which received royal assent in june of this year <e>", "<cs> it is a little difficult to know where to start on this amendment and i do not think i was very much helped by what the minister said <e> <s> it seemed to me that he was painting a picture of wild expenditure way outside the provisions of section because when we really look at the facts the truth of the matter is that the majority of the section expenditure is already committed for the period about which we are talking <e>", "<cs> i should be interested to hear what the noble lord has to say on that at a later stage <e> <s> but the fact is that a great deal of this money is committed to enterprise agencies already and there is not so much loose money lashing around from the p rate that there can now be sudden wild spending in directions which the greater london council have not already thought of <e>", "<cs> does not the noble lord accept that this applies to the metropolitan county councils as well and that all their expenditure will have to be vetted by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord know from this amendment what is meant by reasonable <e>", "<cs> i thought we were debating section powers not any sort of overspending by the glc <e> <s> we should confine ourselves to the p rate and then we will not get ourselves confused <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to interrupt the noble lord at this stage but he will accept that a number of these expenditures roll on a year over year basis <e> <s> this was the point that i was trying to make <e> <s> considerable uncertainty will have been raised in the minds of a number of voluntary organisations which have a rolling programme <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree in response to my noble friends supplementary <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful for the courtesy of the government in repeating this statement in this house <e>

that i am greatly impressed by the grasp of the noble lord lord underhill of the whole subject but i do not believe that now is the time to go into the sort of detail which he has raised with the minister <e> <s> it seems to me that there are likely to be many other matters contained in the white paper which relate to the statement and to <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that in responding to this kind of amendment the noble lord the minister tries to suggest that there is an open-endedness about these section provisions which simply does not exist <e> <s> as my noble friend lord evans of claughton said at the end of the day we are talking about a twopenny rate <e> <s> it is a large sum of money all together i accept in relation to greater london and it is greater london that we are talking about and to a certain extent the greater london council has brought this upon itself by sheer stupidity in the way that it has directed some of this money <e> <s> but as the noble baroness said it is a small fraction of that money that we are talking about <e> <s> it is perhaps a little higher than she would suggest because there are one or two other organisations which disguise themselves as community projects which happen to turn out to be the local labour party doing its own thing <e>", "<cs> my lords with typical generosity the leader of the house has mentioned that on the other side of the house as well as on this side there is to be a free vote <e> <s> i welcome that most generous statement <e> <s> i will deal first with the final point he made about breaking away from the practices of the commons <e> <s> i accept that the noble viscount works hard on our behalf to ensure that we have a fair crack of the whip <e> <s> but it does not seem to me that in changing on this occasion we would be doing anything other than that which was rational on the arguments which have been deployed <e> <s> i am sure that can be explained to members of another place <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord lord peyton in that respect because we should make it quite clear that anything we do is no reflection on what may have been done in another place <e> <s> if we were to do something different it is because our circumstances in respect of this particular issue are quite different <e>", "<cs> moved amendments nos <e> <s> to <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that there was an initiative yesterday morning from mr willis of the tuc in going on the radio <e> <s> should not that have been followed up and should not attention have been paid to suggestions which have been made in various places including articles in <e>", "<cs> my lords surely we would not wish that to go unrebutted <e> <s> parliament has been sitting for a week in the shape of your lordships house and it is quite wrong that we should be expected to wait until another place graces its own chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord himself has raised the question of exports is it not the case that this question has to be seen against the very sad background of the fact that manufactured imports into this country have exceeded manufactured exports for the first time since the industrial revolution <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon i am also grateful to the noble viscount lord mountgarret for putting this <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be wrong to suggest that those parliamentary procedures in the republic of china are very brief and very short <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must thank most gratefully the noble lord lord teviot not only for having placed this question on the order paper but for the quite remarkable speech that he made in asking his question <e> <s> i was deeply impressed by what he said and coming from the government back benches although it was addressed courteously to the government front bench i am sure that the government ought to take very seriously what he said because it struck me as being a devastating speech from the government point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord on his first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> it seems to me however that the question of registration does not solve the problem of someone who tenders for a service and then goes bust <e> <s> the fact that he is registered and therefore has an obligation to provide it in no way stops him going bankrupt and having to withdraw the service <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not more a question of the government putting their finger in rather than pulling it out <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord continues may i ask this question <e> <s> does he not understand that we are saying that the long-term planning aspect of integration will go out of the window with this change <e> <s> perhaps this is a point that we did not make clearly enough <e> <s> can he accept that under the new scheme under the block grant scheme local authorities cannot see far enough ahead without some guarantee of support to put in the sort of integrated transport system which exists at the moment in tyne and wear <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister give way <e> <s> this is the point i was trying to make <e> <s> the effect of what is happening now is that because of the penalties which are being imposed on local authorities from other directions the section support will be nonexistent from local authorities <e> <s> what steps do the <e>", "<cs> my lords may we then have an assurance that the government will use that money for capital and not revenue spending <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to add an additional voice to this excellent argument <e> <s> but it seems to me that the provisions in clause refer back to those in clause <e> <s> it is clause that gives the government power to take certain actions on the basis of the information which can be required under clause <e> <s> the one difference between them is that clause refers to importers exporters manufacturers etc <e> <s> but clause does not contain the word export <e> <s> the object of this amendment surely is to make those two subsections match by inserting the word export <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could briefly intervene at this stage to support this amendment <e> <s> speaking as one who was on the sub-committee of the science and technology select committee i think one of the outstanding moments of our investigations there was when we went to rothamstead and were lectured by somebody from soil survey <e> <s> i think it became apparent to us all that the soil is an area which does not have enough research into it carried out in this country and as the noble lord has said is fundamental to all our agricultural activities <e> <s> certainly it had a dramatic effect on my ideas about how we should be looking at residues not just in terms of crops but in terms of the soil itself <e> <s> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to come between the mackie clan in any way at all but in the absence of the noble lord lord mackie of benshie perhaps i could just assist slightly <e> <s> i wish his plane would arrive because there is another amendment coming up which i may have to move if he is not able to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the isle of man is producing plastic notes <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case is it not clear that there ought to be some authority that can bang their heads together namely some sort of elected authority to cover the strategic matters of greater london <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the reply that the noble earl gave me if we are to wait for further debates why are the government bringing forward a statutory order next week to abolish the glc elections <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether in supporting what has been said by my noble friend i could just ask one question of the noble baroness <e> <s> is she aware that there is concern in some other parts of the world that some of the aid which is being given to africa needed as it

degree of elbow room <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble viscount also accept that there are many houses in wales which are in an even worse state than the county council offices to which he has referred <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to my noble friend the noble baroness indicated that the government supported the united states involvement in this matter but she gave no indication of her views on the involvement of the soviet union which was the subject of part of my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble baroness but the specific question was what was her view on the involvement of the soviet union in that process as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for that somewhat confusing answer confusing because her predecessor the noble lord lord carrington in an interview on channel whatever that is said in august last year

better if it was set down for debate at the proper time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the support i have received from these benches <e> <s> there are two reasons why i reject the suggestions made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> first he does not take into account clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i understand what he is saying and the dangers to which he refers <e> <s> but if the <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to say that this amendment has our full support <e> <s> nothing that i said on the last amendment detracts from our support for the original amendment of the noble baroness lady elles at the committee stage or for this amendment which goes with it <e> <s> we certainly wish it well <e> <s> we very much hope that the government will give the noble baroness the assurances for which she is asking <e> <s> like her i hope that the noble lord lord mishcon will use his good offices with what i should prefer to call the paid opposition in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it is strange is it not that we reduce the age of majority to and allow people to do all sorts of things save only to stand for public office <e> <s> to hear some of the arguments one would think that parliament and the local councils are going to be flooded with -year-olds <e> <s> the noble lord the minister in his wisdom and knowledge says that these people are not mature enough to stand <e> <s> my belief is that that is something which should be tested by the electorate the electorate now entitled to vote at years of age <e>", "<cs> nobody has yet spoken from these benches on this series of amendments deliberately but two of us were members of the select committee <e> <s> i must say i am appalled at the response of the minister <e> <s> i get the impression that he has not been listening to a word that has been said in this debate <e> <s> i can understand that the minister would not wish to accept the amendments from the labour party front bench or even from my noble friend lord evans of claughton <e> <s> but there is no indication in his reply that he has done other than read out a brief that was prepared before this debate started <e> <s> i feel that things that have been said from all round the committee indicate the genuine feeling that all of us have politicians and non-politicians alike that there is a very serious matter of which we in this committee have to take the greatest cognizance <e> <s> we are not just talking about waiting to see what happens which is what the minister is virtually saying and which is virtually the same thing as mrs chalker said to the select committee before they wrote their report <e> <s> if we in the select committee had been contented with that response we would have said so in our report <e> <s> the select committee was not satisfied with that response <e> <s> i like the noble baroness lady lockwood feel that <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether it would be helpful to the committee if the government could indicate to what extent they believe that amendment no <e> <s> is affected by the amendment that has been passed and indeed how subsequent amendments might be affected <e> <s> this might not be the moment to discuss this matter but those of us who are not necessarily directly in touch through the usual channels may find it helpful to know just how many of the subsequent <e>", "<cs> since those amendments are all mine i agree <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord if i may intervene in his intervention we were not asking what another place would do but what the government would do <e> <s> that is a totally different matter <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again <e> <s> the fact is that we have been told which amendments on this side of the committee have been ruled out of order <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> would the noble viscount the leader of the house not accept that it is fundamental so far as this part of the bill is concerned <e> <s> therefore we are in some difficulty as the noble lord the minister has indicated on this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not apply to total exports <e> <s> and really is not the question about manufactured goods <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer but i do not think that being kept informed really covers the situation <e> <s> is it not the case that the first that st albans city council knew of this matter was a letter from the departments of the environment and transport on st may which was the day after the whole subject had been aired in the local press <e> <s> does the minister consider that that is the proper way of keeping local authorities informed of something which is going to have a very serious impact on their city <e>", "<cs> i had expected to hear the walls of jericho falling at that <e> <s> i say jericho because it is just outside bury which is near rochdale <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord and we look forward to the clause coming forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> with those remarkable words i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was not actually thinking of the noble lord lord evans but of the honourable member for rochdale who could give the noble lord lord evans at least nine stones <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister <e> <s> it is obviously too late at night to start bandying arithmetic <e> <s> i note that he has based his argument on the electorate whereas without having gone into the figures the argument that i sought to place before him was inherently based on population <e> <s> all i can say is that the arithmetic comes out rather differently on that basis <e> <s> it would be wise if all of us were to go away and exchange numbers in reading <e>", "<cs> i rise to talk about amendment no <e>

the country at the moment <e> <s> indeed i regret his absence because he would have moved this amendment much better than i can <e>", "<cs> i can perhaps help the noble lord the minister while certain negotiations are going on in response to the question that has been put to him <e> <s> before the noble lord lord melchett decides what he wishes to do on his amendment i should like to respond on behalf of those of us who are supporting amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the minister went a long way i believe in the earlier part of his remarks to offer reassurance <e> <s> i then felt that he started not to back away but to cause further confusion <e> <s> i rather regret that <e> <s> if that part of the brief had gone back to whence it came we might have been a little more reassured <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> certainly i do not wish necessarily to see every function continued in perpetuity as it is at present <e> <s> certainly that is not the view of the select committee <e>", "<cs> it is a rare occasion on which i find myself so whole-heartedly in support of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter and i should not wish to let the occasion pass <e> <s> we have all been enormously impressed by the way in which the noble lord the minister has grasped the complexities of this bill <e> <s> it has obviously been a very trying and tiring period for him <e> <s> he looks remarkably healthy and fit if somewhat lean and hungry <e> <s> in spite of the differences that we still have about the bill and to which we shall doubtless return we greatly admire the way in which he has handled the bill and handled the committee during this very difficult period <e> <s> we greatly thank him for that <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene again <e> <s> the fact is that we have been told which amendments on this side of the committee have been ruled out of order <e> <s> it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to add to what the noble lord lord kaberry of adel has said in his immaculate introduction of these amendments save only this <e> <s> this is a natural corollary to the statements that were made by the noble earl lord cranbrook at committee stage <e> <s> unfortunately he is still out of the country and unable to add his name to these amendments <e> <s> however i feel certain he would have done so had he been here because at the committee stage he criticised his own amendment which if your lordships remember was moved on behalf of the select committee and he said then that he did not believe it was sensible to separate major roads from minor roads <e> <s> he said that the traffic light system of any urban traffic control inevitably involves all roads and he did not believe that one could separate those two classes under a strategic highway authority <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house and before the noble lord sits down surely we are approaching this matter in a very curious way <e> <s> it was my belief that your lordships had made up your minds at committee stage that you were not going down the route which the noble lord is now describing <e> <s> the government may wish at a later stage to overturn that decision of your lordships but surely we are now in a situation where that is the position in regard to the bill <e> <s> the voluntary coming together of districts on this matter is no longer on the cards for this particular function <e> <s> therefore we have to look at the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael has not actually dealt with nos <e> <s> b and c as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords it is actually lord carmichael of kelvingrove <e> <s> lord kilmarnock normally sits behind me <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this may assist the noble lord <e> <s> i think if the noble lord has a choice he may prefer amendment no <e> <s> a in which case presumably the noble lord would withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord as i understand it at the moment we are dealing solely with amendment no <e> <s> according to the marshalled list which has been circulated <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not talking about that at all at the moment <e> <s> we are talking about amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> oddly enough amendment no <e> <s> comes next <e>", "<cs> my lords i am alarmed at the confidence that the government show in the face of so much questioning <e> <s> the government may be right that it is appropriate for the secretary of state to take control but it is not for the government to say so in a clause tucked away in a schedule to the bill <e> <s> they may be right that the miles are necessary to make a coherent network with the other roads in london it may be that the glc has failed it may even be that the environment will be improved and it may be that at the end of the day the position will be altered no whit as the noble lord the minister said <e> <s> but the fact is that this part of the schedule is not as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said merely a change of ownership it is a change in the democratic rights in the statutory rights of the people of this area <e> <s> it is a move away from the safeguards which are contained in the act <e> <s> it is the first stage down the road if i dare say so to the increase in traffic on that road <e> <s> if it were not why would the government want to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords the first note which i have on the piece of paper in front of me is lord underhill <e> <s> like the two previous speakers i greatly regret that the noble lord is not here and were it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that we would be blinded by the grinding of axes <e> <s> i think he probably means that we shall be deafened does he not <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord is aware in this catalogue of extra expenses of the increased cost of audit which arises from deregulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had anticipated that the labour party front bench would wish to make some comment on these slightly different amendments that are being put before us <e> <s> i would join with the noble baroness in welcoming these amendments and in sayng clearly that whatever may happen to subsequent amendments the basic amendments have our support <e> <s> the amendments to which we shall be <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect i think it was an arrangement between the government and the labour party <e> <s> other parties were not involved <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord that is the position <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the response of the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> he is at least consistent in what he has been saying <e> <s> it will be remembered that when at an earlier stage we moved that all british citizens who live in europe should be enfranchised the noble lord opposed it <e> <s> the only inconsistency in the governments position is that this house having agreed to an amendment moved by the noble baroness lady elles community officials are now in a somewhat privileged position <e> <s> but that was the wish of your lordships and so be it <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking the noble lord lord glenarthur <e> <s> it was not an easy task for him to come into an area which requires a certain amount of specialist knowledge <e> <s> i think that having got his toe into the water he will find that these things are habit-forming <e> <s> as a party hack of many years standing i <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to anticipate in any way what i intend to say on th july now that we have a debate down on this subject <e> <s> my interest is instinctively related to manchester being a mancunian and having been as i have said before in your lordships house a candidate for a constituency at one end of ringway when my noble friend lord winstanley was member of parliament for the constituency at the other end of the ringway runway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend who is another old mancunian <e> <s> in his final paragraph the town clerk says <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be that if we have a substantive amendment at the end of this first process the amendment of the noble lord lord plummer might need to be slightly differently worded in the opening half sentence to replace what has gone before it and to insert <e> <s> it is a pure technicality but i think we would have to proceed along those lines in order to take out what had been agreed and to replace it with the amendment of the noble lord lord plummer as moved by lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls there are already dates in the bill like st april <e> <s> it is because of that as the noble earl lord cranbrook has explained that the select committee wished to have a date in and whether it is three weeks four weeks or a calendar month is unimportant <e> <s> since there are already dates in the bill when certain things like the abolition have to happen it was felt necessary to put in a date which was a month before that terminal date <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the crucial word is not the second word in paragraph if any relevant successor body or am i reading the thing back to front <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not so much a question of people getting shut out at the end of the day <e> <s> it is a question of ensuring that somebody triggers the process <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may attempt to get into the discussion and to reinforce one or two of the points that the noble earl has made and i speak again as a member of your lordships select committees subcommittee it seems to me that the noble lord who has just spoken has perhaps slightly misread what is being said because the important words are that he shall take it into consideration <e> <s> i think he is suggesting that they will be removed but they will not <e> <s> what is being taken out is the part about him considering it expedient to do so <e> <s> underlying all this <e>", "<cs> my lords let me try to rephrase that then <e> <s> the subsection states that the secretary of state shall take it into consideration and then we delete from there on <e> <s> but i still maintain that the important part of that phrase is whether he considers it expedient <e> <s> what the select committee is seeking to do is as it were to remove from the secretary of state that discretionary power for the very good reason that what we are deeply worried about is the lack of confidence which is present in these teams of excellent people whom we have talked about so many times in the course of this debate and who we refer to as a result of our select committees report <e> <s> we are terrified that a number of these teams are already breaking up and we are anxious that the government will do everything in their power to reassure those people who are in a state of some trepidation at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords we may be in procedural difficulties here but perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord the minister <e> <s> what do the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for that explanation and i am sure that both my noble friend and the right reverend prelate will also be obliged to him <e> <s> certainly we shall be lending our support to the bill on its passage through this house <e> <s> as i say it is a matter on which we feel very strongly and it has our support <e> <s> i find it difficult to continue any longer in the knowledge that all my questions have been answered and that tomorrow is the longest day <e> <s> i only hope it does not turn out to be a longer day than it has been today <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for that answer and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the response that the noble lord makes <e> <s> this is however somewhat wide of amendment no <e> <s> za <e> <s> it might perhaps be best if we took the point made by the noble lord lord shackleton and left this matter to the procedure committee or the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord the minister <e> <s> there is one small point i should like to come back to with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> the noble lord suggested that these matters were already covered in amendments debated last thursday and which are on the marshalled list for later today <e> <s> if he looks he will find that those amendments largely deal with the intermediate period while the residuary body is in existence <e> <s> this amendment seeks to go beyond that point <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell the house whether he believes that the section provisions should be totally removed from local government or whether there should be some control on the expenditure under section <e> <s> because they are two totally different concepts <e> <s> the second suggestion would bear on what he said but i wonder whether he believes that the section provisions should be removed totally from the hands of local government <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i apologise for interrupting him but i do not think that he is aware of the difficulty in which my noble friend lord airedale finds himself <e> <s> if the amendment of the noble lord lord shackleton is agreed to and this matter is referred back it will not be possible for my noble friend lord airedale to make his point in reference to the amendment that he has put down <e> <s> that is why a number of us on these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am eternally grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i want to pick up a point from the noble lord lord ponsonby <e> <s> it is true that the informal arrangement is there and works but i must say that for a group of peers both the liberal party and the sdp in alliance to have to wait for crumbs to fall from the labour partys table is not something we enjoy <e> <s> that is not to say that the relationship is not perfectly amicable on a daily working basis but it seems to me that the time has now come to formalise the changing position in your lordships house <e> <s> we do not want necessarily to be treated in precisely the same way as the official opposition or her majestys opposition or the paid opposition or call it what you will but we should be counted in on the act on a slightly more formal basis than we have been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect and taking into account what was said yesterday and also speaking as one who has not long been a member of this house and who does not pretend to be knowledgeable about its procedure i should have thought that the noble lords statement was mistaken <e> <s> it was clearly spelt out to the house yesterday that all peers are equal in this house <e> <s> although the usual channels are a useful means of communicating they are not the only means for the house to make up its mind on such matters as this <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this is a perfectly normal term for projects of this sort <e> <s> may i also say that what he said about the extension to the royal docks is of great interest in relation to the development of stolport and people on all sides of the house will be pleased to hear that that part of the project is being given reasonable priority <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government read again the report of your lordships select committee on science and technology on the digitising of maps <e> <s> this will go some way to assisting local authorities in finding where the holes in the ground should go the first time instead of the second or third time <e> <s> are the government aware that members of the select committee are somewhat upset that the ordnance survey is not pressing ahead with this important matter as fast as it should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister but it is not correct to say that we have the right to decide because of course we do not vote against affirmative orders in this house <e> <s> we have the right to discuss but we do not have the right to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that the principle of cross-subsidy which exists within the baa is totally contrary to the principle of cross-subsidy for the buses which it is sought to abolish <e>", "<cs> my lords there are two reasons why i shall be brief first because most of the points have already been covered and secondly because there are celebrations beginning in which i want to take part <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says <e> <s> i would have thought that his remarks tended to underline the point i was making <e> <s> it is precisely to encourage those people to come into the north that more finance is needed to put together the sort of packages that will be attractive to first-time visitors to this country <e> <s> i give an instance that was suggested by the people of manchester <e> <s> the lancashire coast and the scottish coast have some of the finest golf courses in the world <e> <s> a package tour which encouraged americans to do a tour of those golf courses would be very attractive <e> <s> however because of the degree of fragmentation of the tourist boards that sort of thing i understand has never been done <e> <s> it is being done if at all by the people at manchester airport themselves <e> <s> that sort of imaginative idea with a little government backing could produce results <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that correction <e> <s> but it needs to be done rather more than on a county basis <e> <s> it is bringing the counties together that has been the problem for manchester <e> <s> individual county tourist boards have been operating very much on their own <e> <s> one needs to bring together north wales lancashire cheshire yorkshire and the lot to encourage this sort of input <e> <s> i still say that this is not going to solve the problems of the south-east <e>", "<cs> i understood that it was the intention that it would be convenient to take amendments nos <e> <s> and with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i suppose that at the end of the day the noble lord will not press the amendment <e> <s> i had my name to the amendment of the noble lord lord shepherd and i have my name to this <e> <s> i merely want to say at this stage that although one is hopeful that the assurances that the minister gave in response to the noble lord lord shepherd will fill the bill i greatly fear that at the end of the day they will not <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not a question of the governments ideas being right and the oppositions being wrong or even <e>", "<cs> will the noble baroness forgive me <e> <s> i do not dispute a word that she says <e> <s> i wonder however whether her remarks are entirely relevant at this stage to the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> the amendment deals with a rather specific point concerning delay over implementation for certain reasons <e>", "<cs> it is clearly not the case that under this amendment local authorities can opt out <e> <s> under this amendment local authorities can appeal to the secretary of state <e> <s> the decision remains with the secretary of state and in those circumstances it cannot be a wrecking amendment <e> <s> it might be a nuisance to the secretary of state but the power still resides in his hands and therefore still within the objects of the bill <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> it is the use of the words exempted from the provisions of the bill that i object to <e> <s> as i understand the amendment it is purely a delaying amendment for the implementation of the provisions of the bill and no more than that <e> <s> as i have said before the power rests with the secretary of state to use what i believe is a pejorative term <e> <s> to use the words to exempt them from the provisions of the bill is totally to misunderstand the meaning and the intention of this amendment <e>", "<cs> surely in those last few words the noble lord has put his finger on the problem that under the act we could not have expected wider trials than we have had and he has adduced reasons for that <e> <s> but what we have to debate is whether those trials were adequate for the purposes of this bill because both the noble lord lord mcintosh and the noble earl lord de la warr have said they were not representative trial areas for the sort of deregulation which is contained in the bill either in the quality of the deregulation which was introduced in hereford or in the type of area which was being dealt with <e> <s> the noble earl has also said that it was only a partial experiment in the sense that total deregulation did not take place <e> <s> it was also only a partial experiment in that the county council played a very large part in administering what was going on which in future it will not be allowed to do <e>", "<cs> i would not want it to be thought that everybody on this side of the committee assumes that because regulations are made buses are always going to run on time <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords are not suggesting that for a minute <e> <s> but what is worrying noble lords in many parts of the committee is the sort of situation where people who are supposed to be running bus services suddenly find that there is a football match at the other end of the county or the country <e> <s> they take the buses off for that day and send them on excursions to the football match <e> <s> so the services which are supposed to be running do not because market forces are operating freely and operators are making a greater profit by taking people to see hereford united wherever they are playing <e> <s> that seems to me to be the purpose of this amendment and in so far as that is the case i support it <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment perhaps i may say first of all that i am sure that the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil will be pleased to hear that the only reference to cowboys came in a quotation from the secretary of state <e> <s> nevertheless this bears on the problems that could accrue from individual operators coming onto the scene with little or no experience of the art of running the kind of buses referred to in this bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should not draw the general from the particular <e> <s> there is no doubt i believe in this case that inspectors going regularly into a garage that has a number of buses will find it easier and quicker to deal with a significant number than to go round a large number of single buses <e> <s> to go back to the original point that the noble lord made i think i recall that at second reading he objected to the use of the word cowboys <e> <s> that is the only reason why i mentioned it <e> <s> the noble lord may have forgotten it <e> <s> i have not <e>", "<cs> it is even at this late hour a pleasure to be on the same side as the noble lord lord peyton of yeovil <e>", "<cs> i doubt whether his remark will reach the official record but i take it as read <e> <s> this is not simply a matter about financial considerations it is a matter about standards as a whole <e> <s> if the financial considerations are not adequate at the start of the operation then it is very possible that maintenance standards will suffer <e> <s> considerations of safety of the sort that we have been discussing earlier will then come under pressure because once financial standing goes short-cuts are taken by operators in order to keep their operation going and maintenance and safety are things which can suffer <e> <s> it is on those grounds as well as on the ground of wishing to maintain stability of operations in general that i thoroughly applaud the idea of having financial control before the operator is allowed to go into action <e> <s> certainly there are checks on peoples safety standards retrospectively but this provides a degree of control from the very start of the operation and therefore it is to be commended <e>", "<cs> i think that people on all sides of the chamber will be reassured by that offer from the minister <e> <s> at the end of the day i wonder who will decide whether it has been successful or not <e> <s> is it going to be the traffic commissioner or the county council <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse what the noble earl lord de la warr has just said that there are genuine worries that the government saying come in the water is lovely is not sufficient to give confidence to either consumers or operators <e> <s> there seems to be an act of faith needed in accepting the governments point of view <e>", "<cs> i wish to reinforce what the noble lord lord mottistone said <e> <s> if the noble lord had come in for the full committee stage of the bill he would perhaps understand what is going on <e> <s> since he has not been here i believe that he should listen and reserve his judgment for a later stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> in response to that all i can say is that silence is clearly golden <e>", "<cs> that is a fair response to the amendment as it stands but i am not sure that it deals with the problem underlying this question <e> <s> there is a problem of subsidised services being undermined by shared taxi services and particularly in rural areas <e> <s> would the minister care to think about it again and <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> that helps to elucidate the situation <e> <s> i still am not sure that per cent <e> <s> is necessarily the right figure but who knows <e> <s> i should certainly like to read what the minister said and in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the people involved will be grateful for that assurance and on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wish i could believe that it was taken care of in the bill because there are stations in london where it is quite easy to segregate these things <e> <s> waterloo is a case in point <e> <s> it is much more difficult at victoria and at euston where there are barriers it is almost impossible <e> <s> clearly i am not going to press this tonight but i would ask the noble earl to go back to his ministerial friends and say that there is a practical problem here which i do not think they have solved <e> <s> i am overwhelmed by the support of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it is late at night and i am grateful for it <e> <s> nevertheless on the understanding that the noble earl will look at this problem again in purely practical terms i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> as i say it was a device to ask an important question on a human basis <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have given an indication that i wish to oppose the question that the clause stand part <e> <s> again this is very much of a probe particularly relating to subsections <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support this amendment perhaps i may say that i am far from reassured by what has just been said by the noble lord the minister <e> <s> it may be that your lordships consider that the amendment that has been put before you by the noble lord lord carmichael is a better amendment than the one we had last time in that the authority would consist of elected members of constituent borough councils and would be responsible for a london-wide view on strategic highway and traffic issues while at the same time local needs would be catered for at the individual borough level <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> this is surely the problem that there may be a conflict of interest between the electors in their own particular borough and the good of the conurbation <e> <s> it is in those areas that conflict arises which is irresolvable save only by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this house do insist on their amendments nos <e> <s> to to which the commons have disagreed for the reason numbered <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder if the noble lord will give way because i believe he is in error <e> <s> surely the provisions in the bill preclude people who have decided to live permanently abroad because people have to make a declaration that it is ultimately their intention to return to this country within the terms of the bill as it stands with or

whether the government are <e>", "<cs> i want to support the noble lord lord sandford on the narrow point he made at the end of his speech in relation to those small municipal undertakings with a

right <e> <s> this is a complex amendment <e> <s> it is perhaps not easy to see precisely what the meaning is although the noble lord lord carmichael has expressed it as clearly as anyone could <e> <s> i wonder if i may be of some assistance to the noble baroness because it seems to me that what is being suggested here is a change from the rather black-and-white system which is included in the bill at the moment and which says this is commercial and this is not to a process which is more iterative <e> <s> in other words there is a discussion period which goes on in the early stages of the formation of a new map map is perhaps the wrong word but there is a new group of services some of which will be commercial and some of which will be supported by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> may i come back to the noble baroness <e> <s> she asked what is different <e> <s> as i read the bill the situation is that at the moment it is a two-stage process <e> <s> the first stage is that competition is allowed to have its full play and then when the local authorities see how the chips have fallen they look at their area and say there are gaps here <e> <s> there is a service that needs to be provided there so we will put that out to tender on a supported basis <e> <s> the danger with that is that you may have more local authority supported services than you need <e> <s> this is a method by which at an earlier stage there can be some integration of the two types of service which will in the end save the taxpayer money <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is surely wrong because within the bill there is deregulation and this is not stopping deregulation <e> <s> that is the difference between what is in the bill and what went before and what is in the bill with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to pick up the point that the noble lord the minister made <e> <s> the noble lord raised a tremendous spectre in front of us but when he was reading subsection i noticed that in the last two and a half lines the word may appeared twice <e> <s> i did not notice that the stress on the word may was quite so firm as the stress made on the other parts of the subsection that he was reading out <e>", "<cs> my lords did not the minister find it surprising that when the noble lord lord boothby called for a comprehensive traffic authority for london the noble lords friends sitting behind him said hear hear <e> <s> i say this bearing in mind that they have consistently trouped through the lobbies against that proposal over the past few weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse that last remark of the noble lord lord underhill that this is not a party matter <e> <s> it will certainly cut across party lines and people will find themselves on different sides of the argument <e> <s> as he earlier said there is no doubt that okehampton must have a by-pass and there is general acceptance of that on all sides <e> <s> certainly the people of west devon and of cornwall are well aware of the fact that there should be a by-pass but there could have been a by-pass in existence already if successive governments had not chickened out to the farmers <e> <s> we could have had a northern route some years ago <e> <s> it is because of that that we find ourselves in this pickle <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill has rightly said this contravenes the governments policy on national parks as set out in circular no <e> <s> / although i think he was unfair in not quoting the full wording of that circular which said if no alternative exists <e> <s> nevertheless i argue that an alternative does exist in the shape of the northern route <e> <s> i find it difficult to accept that the government believe in their own heart that it could take years or even the eight or nine years referred to in the statement <e> <s> i am convinced that with the work that has taken place already on this subject with the knowledge that everybody has of the facts of the case there could be some way of short circuiting the planning cycle <e> <s> if not then by jove <e> <s> it is about time we considered carefully our planning inquiry system <e>", "<cs> i am always prepared to listen to what the noble lord the minister has to say on matters which are as technical as this and i am sure that his advice is better than mine <e> <s> at least it is on the spot whereas mine is not <e> <s> it seems to me that the problem here is the duty under the education act which is not properly dealt with under clause <e> <s> it is the unresolved conflict between clause and the position in section of the education act that my amendment seeks to tidy up in other words the proposal is to absolve the county council under certain conditions from the provisions of these two conflicting acts <e>", "<cs> we can play a kind of bingo here throwing numbers at each other but i think that would be unwise <e> <s> i think we should both go away and look at what the other has said <e> <s> i shall look at clause and take advice <e> <s> with that in mind i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the question really is when that is going to come <e> <s> this is the second time we have been fobbed off with a statement like that <e> <s> the first was on the london regional transport bill last year and now it is on the transport bill this year <e> <s> assuming that we have a transport bill every year presumably we shall be fobbed off again next year if the government are not bringing forward a wider nationalised industries bill <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first occasion on which i have had the opportunity to join in this little ceremony and i am very grateful to do so <e> <s> i personally have been thrown in at the deep end in a year in which there has been so much activity <e> <s> i am grateful therefore for the support of both my leader and the former chief whip who are beside me at the moment and for the help that they have given me at this time <e>", "<cs> the length of that depends on when the prime minister calls the next election i suspect <e>", "<cs> it is clear that the government in making the moves that they have done and they are indeed welcome and no one in the committee would deny it have gone some way towards recognising the problems that were envisaged and the noble lord lord chelwood and the noble viscount lord hood both expressed those problems perfectly well <e>", "<cs> my lords may i crave the indulgence of the house to do something which perhaps is not in order but which i hope the noble lord lord carmichael will not mind <e> <s> it refers to the next clause of the bill <e> <s> i thought it might be a useful opportunity for the minister to insert into the record correspondence we have had arising out of a discussion which took place on the motion that clause stand part <e> <s> noble lords will remember that in committee i raised the question of the contract position of people hiring shared cabs <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord carmichael will forgive me but he has raised the question of shared cabs and i think that this is probably the only appropriate moment when i can introduce this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord peyton who has given us the benefit of this most excellent exposition not only of this clause but of the bill as a whole does not regard this as a wrecking amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i think it is true to say that the noble lord lord trefgarne undertook to take this matter away and to think about it i do not think he actually undertook to bring back legislation but i am very glad that the government have done so <e> <s> this will be a considerable relief to people and save them trekking to courts in obscure parts of the great wen <e> <s> i am glad that the government at least do not believe that i am always moving wrecking amendments and that i can in fact have some purpose in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i endorse what the noble lord lord henderson of brompton has said and indeed what the noble lord lord carmichael has said <e> <s> all sides of the house are i believe at one on this <e> <s> the need for such an amendment has clearly been recognised by the government <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept that the amendment that has been moved by the opposition is slightly more comprehensive and because of that rather better <e> <s> i hope therefore that the government can on this occasion accept the amendment that has been proposed rather than pursue their own <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has addressed me may i say that it would be a temptation <e> <s> surely a better step would be to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael and do something about the matter at third reading if one is not satisfied with it then <e>", "<cs> my lords i suppose that i should not be astonished at some of the criticism that has been heaped on this modest amendment but i am slightly astonished <e> <s> first the noble lord lord brabazon talked about the local authority being responsible <e> <s> of course in this clause we are talking about the passenger transport authority and one of the purposes of this bill it seems to me is to hold local authorities at arms length <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we all welcome the noble lords noble friend <e> <s> such diverse <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of the few people in the house who has ever been to glossop i thought that i might just add a word or two <e> <s> the position at the moment as the noble lord lord teviot has said is that there is a series of bus services based on glossop which are run by the greater manchester pte <e> <s> derbyshire county council is currently paying over in road use support of which one-third relates to services wholly contained within derbyshire <e> <s> the pte has a garage there and about a dozen buses are based there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene at this point but we are not saying that it would affect the continuation of the present services <e> <s> we are saying that it would affect the operation of the buses if those services had to be changed for reasons which are outside the control of the pte <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment moved by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> it is an important amendment although it is really rather a technical one <e> <s> it is important to minimise the cost to the executives of surplus assets and it is also important not to waste assets which exist on the ground at the moment <e> <s> this may happen if the bill passes in its present form <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some considerable difficulty because this is report stage <e> <s> however i am being challenged directly <e> <s> if the government are saying that the executives will be running exactly the same number of services as they are at the moment using exactly the same number of buses as they are at the moment then where is all the entrepreneurial effort to come from <e> <s> is it all to be channelled into the new services <e> <s> if all that the government seek to achieve is achieved then clearly there will be a reduction in the number of buses needed by the ptes <e> <s> in that case there will be surplus buses which will be hired from companies which have no incentive whatsoever to terminate those hire agreements <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal with that point first <e> <s> if that were true surely it would destroy the arrangement which the government has already agreed to <e> <s> i cannot believe that if the position is possible for the whole of the undertaking it is not possible to administer it for the individual <e> <s> i really have rarely been so angry in this house <e> <s> i feel that the government have turned a very blank face to the genuine worries of individual people who are being used as shuttlecocks in this game that is being played <e> <s> i am really extremely angry about this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would care to comment on the point which the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey made about the fact that the municipalities are being put in an unfair competitive position in relation to the private operators <e> <s> it is an important point <e> <s> the government are really not playing fair with the municipalities on this matter <e> <s> the municipalities are left with a large number of overheads which the new operators will not have <e> <s> does not the noble lord lord sandford agree that that is a very unfair position in which they should be left <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl speaking to amendment no <e> <s> as well as amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not necessarily commend itself to all parts of the house because it was proposed by a labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords referring to what the noble lord lord sandford just said all i can say is that with friends like that why does the minister need an opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords may i too challenge the noble lord lord nugent <e> <s> i am sorry to involve myself in what is clearly a private party on the government side of the house this afternoon but he does need to be challenged <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall simply say that if the noble lord lord belstead is serious about moving amendment no <e> <s> then i am surprised that he is not moving amendment no <e> <s> as a paving amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord will find that in the present circumstances particularly at the older end of the school where the sixth form is involved during the period of the summer a number of children who intended to go out to work find that there is no employment for them and then go back to school again for a final year <e> <s> this is something that i think the government would encourage rather than having children on the dole <e>

no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may assist the noble lord the minister we felt that the education aspect was a slightly different argument and might be better set aside <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that the law has not been changed <e> <s> that may be true <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are in a probing mood may i say that i thoroughly endorse everything that the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove has said particularly in relation to travel passes <e> <s> in earlier stages of the bill one has said how welcome these schemes are and how unwelcome a fall-back to token schemes would be <e> <s> the token schemes are simply not as good as the passes which can be used over wide areas <e> <s> i have referred in the past to the scheme in lancashire which is a wonderful example of what can be done <e> <s> that is a scheme which was intended to be extended into greater manchester and greater merseyside but which may now fall by the wayside <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reassure us about the parishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think there is any need to prolong the agony <e> <s> if this is the result of pushing against an open door i would not wish to push against a closed door or i should receive a very sore nose <e> <s> nevertheless we have made the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that if the noble lord lord airedale were here to respond to that explanation he would give a much better reply than i can but it seems to me to be nonsense that may is the same as shall even in a context such as this <e> <s> nevertheless we doubtless have to bow to the parliamentary draftsmen and legal eagles who cannot speak english but have to use a different sort of language where meaning has no meaning <e> <s> in those circumstances i really have no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment but perhaps the <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard the noble lord the first time and that repetition does not help <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that contribution from the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> i am sure that it does not take us any nearer a solution <e> <s> it certainly will not satisfy the people around the victoria area <e> <s> it is true that there are powers that can be used by the westminster city council and i have said that already <e> <s> but that is just a question of shuffling the problem on to somebody else <e> <s> we need a fundamental solution to this and we seem to get no nearer <e>", "<cs> my lords it may seem curious for an englishman to be speaking on a scottish bill and i apologise for the fact that the noble lord lord t aylor of gryfe is not able to be here today as he certainly would have joined in the debate but i do not really apologise because i think that this is the thin end of a wedge which will hit us south of the border and in any case there is a matter of principle here in which we should all be interested <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock for having raised this amendment on third reading today <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble and learned lord would permit me to interrupt him i know that this is the third reading but i think it is fair to say that i accepted that point <e> <s> what i sought to suggest was that in fact in certain instances these provisions could make it worse and not better <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support this amendment which has been so ably moved by the noble earl lord de la warr let me say straight away that there is a very wide welcome for the concessions that were made by the government at report stage on extending the transitional period by a month <e> <s> i would not wish it to be thought that we are carping about the timetable in any sense at all <e> <s> but there are quite genuine worries in various parts of the country as to whether the jobs that need to be done can be squeezed into the timetable as it exists <e> <s> people are simply frightened at the moment that they cannot get through it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has actually made the same slip of the tongue <e> <s> he said that we should write in schedule but of course it should be schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment which has been moved by the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and to offer a further illustration of the problems that could arise <e> <s> let us imagine the situation after the bill has become an act and competition has become beneficial in a market town which for the sake of argument i was going to call glossop but if i go on talking about that town they will give me the freedom of glossop and though i should enjoy that it is rather a long way away so let me say my home town of taunton <e> <s> as a result of this beneficial competition there are a number of routes which are all operating commercially under three or four different operators <e> <s> then let us suppose that somerset county council wishes to ensure that the disabled can travel freely in the fair town of taunton <e> <s> it may decide that the demand for special facilities could be met economically by equipping just one or two buses to operate a cycle of routes on different days of the week <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not directly attributing it to that clause <e> <s> i was saying that there was an indirect effect on the competitive situation <e> <s> that was the point of my illustration <e> <s> does the noble lord follow me <e>", "<cs> my lords once again the name of the mighty town of glossop comes up <e> <s> one is grateful to the noble earl the minister for this amendment which i hope will clarify the situation more on behalf of the greater manchester pte than the people of glossop <e> <s> but it is welcome nonetheless <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems to me that there is a simple principle involved here <e> <s> as we read it on the face of the bill as currently drafted clause appears only to allow the secretary of state to make one order the effect of which is to remove the executives powers to carry passengers and to hire out vehicles <e> <s> i see that the noble earl lord caithness shakes his head <e> <s> i hope that he will be able to give us some reassurance on this point <e> <s> that would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not a pensions expert and therefore i do not propose to argue on the question of the merits of accrued benefits being transferred <e> <s> however i have sufficient knowledge to know that it is not always to the benefit of employees to transfer accrued benefits <e> <s>

am most grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> it is the principle that parliament should not by an act of privatisation put employees in a worse position than they are at the moment in relation to their pension funds <e> <s> that simply is what the amendment is about and i have no alternative but to divide the house on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i notice that the noble lord lord teviot is unable to be here at the moment <e> <s> on behalf of all those who took part in that debate may i thank the noble lord the minister for having listened to what was said and for recognising that there could be occasions where this provision might be necessary <e> <s> we are most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady stedman who has put her name to this amendment and all of us who have pitched in on this debate as it has gone through the various sittings i thank the noble lord the minister for the acceptance and for the generous way in which he treated his slight aberration on the last occasion <e> <s> it is extremely welcome and gives a degree of flexibility which cannot be abused for the power still rests with the secretary of state but it opens up the possibilities for people who are desperately in need of support <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i just want to take the opportunity to thank the government for taking this step <e> <s> it was an undertaking given at report stage and i think it would be wrong to let the occasion go without giving some thanks to the government for honouring the undertaking <e> <s> we are grateful

lord will understand if having said that i repeat something that i said on second reading that is how good it is to see the noble lord lord underhill back in action in the latter stages of this bill <e> <s> noble lords on all sides of the house are extremely pleased to see him <e>", "<cs> my lords underlying this question is there not a serious matter for your lordships house <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble viscount the leader of the house can address his attention to the problem <e> <s> are we not being treated as second-class citizens <e> <s> it is not a question of whether the opposition has access to something but whether members of your lordships house whose select committee this is have equal access and on this occasion they clearly did not <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord suggesting that the report is biased and unsatisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to an earlier question i thought i heard the noble lord the minister say that the difference between newspaper bingo and telephone bingo was that there was no charge for telephone bingo <e> <s> can he advise the house how he makes a telephone call without paying a charge <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to something which the noble earl lord kinnoull said earlier would the noble lord the minister not agree that it might be unfortunate if stating that the isle of wight was served by an overworked member of parliament and was under-represented should be thought to be a criticism from this house of a member in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to that last remark by the noble lord the minister is it not the case that there have been discussions between messrs phillips and drew and the department of the environment <e> <s> may i ask the minister whether arising out of those discussions they have been able to ascertain what assurances have been given by liverpool council that they will not repeat the same performance next year particularly in the light of what mr mulhearn has recently said in a statement in which he made it quite clear that they were going to go through the same cycle next year <e> <s> while on that subject can the government give the house any assurance that the same sort of thing is not going to happen in lambeth hackney and indeed in the city of manchester in the coming year <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise particularly to the chief whip for not being in my place when he stood up but having lately returned from the south atlantic i had been tidying up and had not realised that we had got through the business with such great despatch as the chief whip normally does when we are not looking <e> <s> it would be appropriate for me to say on behalf of everybody in this house how much we wish a happy christmas and a peaceful new year to those people in the british forces overseas and also to anybody who is working on behalf of this country in foreign parts <e> <s> they certainly deserve it and i wish them a peaceful new year <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the minister a little further on that because it seems to many of us that this is an important point <e> <s> do the government not accept that if the rail link is not justified on its own financial merits the expansion of stansted itself comes under severe question <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government not accept that the absence of a rail link to stansted will put enormous pressure on the road system in the east of london if the expansion of stansted goes ahead to the level envisaged <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl tell us what will be the position with regard to competitive tendering when the airports are privatised <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these benches to greet this statement with enthusiasm although that is not to say that one may not be critical of certain parts of the details <e> <s> but basically let it be known that the alliance believes that a link of this sort is important to the future of this country and therefore we have come to the conclusion that the government on this occasion have come to the right answer for the right reasons <e> <s> of crucial importance is to have a rail link between the industrial heartland of this country scotland the north and the midlands through into the industrial heartlands of europe <e> <s> the channel tunnel group proposals seem to me to provide that in the best possible measure <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may also begin by noting that the noble lord lord nugent of guildford must at the end of today be a happy man having started this process <e> <s> i am sure that by the end of this evening he will see it completed <e> <s> one should also congratulate the right honourable lady mrs chalker on this her final act in the ministry of transport as she has moved on to other things <e> <s> it is probably fair to say that many of us regret her passing from the ministry of transport <e> <s> with the exception of persons here present she is one of the more enlightened members of that department <e> <s> if this is something that she can have in her <e>", "<cs> my lords are we therefore to suppose that the secretary of state for trade and industry did not tell the prime minister that he had given that authority <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl would allow me to intervene i certainly feel great sympathy with what he is saying but i am not quite sure at which particular part of the report he is pointing his finger when he talks about greater central government intervention <e> <s> it seems to me that it does not really point in that direction very much <e>", "<cs> my lords we now come to the wind-up but i do not intend to make a conventional wind-up speech today <e> <s> apart from anything else it would be impossible <e> <s> i leave that to the noble lord the minister on the government front bench <e> <s> in any case this is not that sort of a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for this explanation <e> <s> i am not sure that it does not leave us all rather more confused and perhaps the employees even more confused than that <e> <s> my understanding this morning was that on friday a decision had been made that the staff were not now going to the fire and civil defence authority but were in fact going to the residuary body <e> <s> the noble lord the minister is now telling me that that is not the case and that in fact there is still no decision as to where those staff are going <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the minister but i thought i heard him say that this will be a matter for local authorities but that the government will stop them if they think fit <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the minister for that reply which is far more helpful than i expected <e> <s> i reinforce my point by asking the minister whether the government are aware of the difficulties in regard to rest and recreation in the falkland islands because of climatic conditions and also of the fact that the senior officers there would very much welcome the provision of swimming facilities for the troops <e>", "<cs> my lords finally may i ask the minister whether he is aware that people are not seeking an olympic-size swimming pool or over-elaborate facilities <e> <s> they require simple facilities which provided that they are there and are maintained would be of the greatest possible use <e>", "<cs> my lords it may come as a bit of a surprise to noble lords to see me rising to deal with welsh rates <e> <s> i regret that none of my welsh colleagues is here <e> <s> the only claim i can have is that i am a mancunian and one of the greatest welshmen of all time was born in manchester a former leader of the liberal party david lloyd george <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble viscount i do not think he has answered my question on the differential impact on the welsh counties <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us whether the government are taking steps to prevent people from getting overheated in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords may i echo what i think the noble lord lord gridley said in his supplementary question may we have an assurance from the government that the expenditure will in no way impair the amount of money spent on sound broadcasting which reaches far more people in the third world than television broadcasting ever could and which is already under-funded <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to intervene but which secretary of state does the noble viscount mean <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise again to the noble viscount for interrupting his initial reply but i really did want to tease out of him the fact that the director general for the welsh authority will be serving two masters one the director general in england and one the secretary of state for wales <e> <s> i think it is important to have that on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord clearly underrates his ability to fill in a mere minute and a half <e> <s> i am quite sure that with assistance from other members of your lordships house we can help him out of his agony <e>", "<cs> my lords does that not imply that if the company or any company in the future does not act the government will be powerless to find out this information <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the interesting results of the national freight corporation which were in the paper this morning does the noble lord think that greater employee participation in the coal industry might increase productivity even more <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the sort of complacency that has been exhibited by the noble lord opposite is precisely why books such as <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that when the question of these various acts was raised the other day it was quite clear that the only people who could precipitate the use of those acts were the companies themselves and that the power does not rest with the government to initiate that procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord underhill we welcome this change in the expenses limit <e> <s> i think it is a very important facet of fairness in our elections that these limits are there but they should be realistic and brought up to date from time to time <e> <s> again like the noble lord lord underhill i feel that there is increasing worry on these benches about the amount of money which is spent at the national level in a fairly unrestrained way <e> <s> in comparison with the united states of america we are fortunate in this country in that we get free television and radio time and on the whole the press does its best to obtain a reasonable balance of views though this is less true in the popular press than it is on television <e> <s> this in particular is a source of worry to parties such as ours which depend very much on the money which comes from their own supporters rather than from large organisations <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the supplementary question from the noble lord lord morris and the reply from the minister do the government not feel a little worried that vital defence industries might be falling into hands that are so difficult to identify <e>", "<cs> my lords are we not perhaps in some confusion here over the use of the words country of origin <e> <s> the noble earl the minister is presumably referring to the manufacturing country of origin whereas we on this side of the house are also referring i believe to the operators of the airlines <e> <s> is it not possible for the country of manufacturing origin to set out safety stipulations that are not carried out by user countries of origin <e> <s> it is in the latter case that we should like to ask the noble earl the minister whether the government can ensure that passengers from this country are warned against using airlines of those countries where the country of manufacturing origin may have given necessary safeguards but the user country is not following them up <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister would like to tell us whether or not it would be a good idea if the government recommended that people should fly the worlds favourite airline <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask whether he is aware no doubt he is because of a reply that he gave to my noble friend lady stedman last week that independent monitoring is having to cease because of the lack of funding from the metropolitan counties <e> <s> in view of the fact that the mercury levels in fish in liverpool bay are only just within the eec eqs of mg/kg does the minister not think that this is a time for increasing monitoring rather than reducing it <e> <s> can he further give your lordships house an idea of how frequently his ministry carry out monitoring and how long it takes for the results to be published <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to refer to two minor points <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned days a year <e> <s> are those days in relation to the whole of the coastline of the united kingdom or do they relate to the specific area to which the question refers <e> <s> did i hear the minister say in reply to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the major advantage of a fixed link relates not to road transport but to rail transport and it is on that basis that we stand to benefit <e> <s> does the noble earl not agree that the direct rail link between our industrial centres and the heartland of europe is the important part of the channel tunnel and that the shuttles and the passenger transport are totally peripheral to that <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government accept that the reduction in oil prices should not be seen as a <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i assure him that after john stuart mill we did not need lesser authors <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce this point <e> <s> this is not a question of local option but of natural justice <e> <s> that should apply evenly across the piece <e> <s> i hesitate to enter into this debate because i have not really been following the bill in any detail <e> <s> my noble friend lord ritchie of dundee has had to leave but i am sure that were he here he would be saying precisely the same thing <e> <s> i repeat that it is not a question of local option but of natural justice which should go across the country as a whole <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble baroness will reconsider her position <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene but the welshness of these benches going back some years is also well known <e> <s> it seems to me that the last part of this amendment is the most valid part <e> <s> i understand what the noble baroness is saying in terms of parents being able to insist on the welsh language being used in such cases <e> <s> however where a school is generally an english medium school but has a welsh medium unit attached to it the welsh will be in a minority <e> <s> in that case they may not be able to exert parental pressure to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that unsurprising reply <e> <s> nevertheless is he aware that the present situation is causing considerable confusion and some distress <e> <s> can he advise retailers particularly in the leisure garden centre do-it-yourself areas and the most reverend primate of all england whether they should be opening their shops on sunday <e> <s> will he also advise local authorities whether they should ignore the present law or whether they should prosecute on a wider basis than has been done in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not correct that the government cannot simply leave the matter there <e> <s> there is considerable confusion on it <e> <s> it is not a matter that they can leave to the local authorities <e> <s> it is the governments responsibility to see that the law is adequate for the purposes of the governance of the land and the decision must rest with them to take the next step <e>", "<cs> my lords if the business managers in another place are not as competent as the ones in this place the government must not blame me <e>", "<cs> and by the opposition in canada my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that noble lords have been very careful today to avoid getting themselves into a debate on the white paper and in fact to a remarkable extent they have managed to concentrate their minds on the bill <e> <s> if i may say so without disrespect to your lordships that is unusual <e> <s> i cannot pretend for a moment that this bill will bring mobs out on to the streets in protest <e> <s> indeed i am surprised to find so many noble lords in the house at this time but doubtless we shall dwindle back to our usual merry bunch of half a dozen or so as the committee stage progresses <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl will give way perhaps he would like to correct the figure of <e> <s> i thought he said that these airports employ people <e> <s> he may have slipped a nought <e>", "<cs> my lords in the county of somerset where the noble lord the minister and i both live is not the position similar to that of the isle of wight <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an answer to the noble lords question <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter suggested do the government not understand that stansted cannot go ahead in any viable way unless there is a rail fink <e> <s> will the government give an assurance that they will put their weight behind british rail having a proper rail link into stansted airport <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister ask his noble friend to address the house in english in future <e>", "<cs> my lords without wishing to over correct the noble baroness is she not aware that in fact diethelyne glycol is very rarely used in anti-freeze <e> <s> ethylene glycol is used in anti-freeze and that is in fact much more toxic than diethelyne glycol and probably equally toxic with methanol <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord the minister give us any indication as to whether there is any continuing emission from the derelict power station in which case we could have further incidents of this sort <e>", "<cs> i do not understand what that means either <e>", "<cs> it will not come as a surprise to your lordships that in principle i give my support to amendment no <e> <s> but it will be observed that i have not put my name to amendment no <e> <s> and largely for the reasons that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has set out <e> <s> the mechanics of it are extremely doubtful although i understand the principle that lies behind it <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble earl if i may interrupt him i do not think he was really listening to what the noble lord lord williams said earlier which i think answered the point he is just making <e>", "<cs> may i from these benches support this raft of amendments in principle <e> <s> i have my name attached to some of them but not to others <e> <s> it is not attached to no <e> <s> and there is a competition between nos <e> <s> and and no <e> <s> and several others <e> <s> i do not think i need add much more in terms of the principle to what has already been said from all sides of the committee <e>", "<cs> i want only to say that this seems to be a very gentle way of keeping parliament involved as the noble lord said <e> <s> i often find myself in difficulties when we table amendments which call upon the secretary of state to place orders of one sort or another in front of both houses of parliament because by convention we do not seriously oppose them in this house <e> <s> it seems to me that we might have slightly more control over the secretary of state if he has to report and we can then put down a motion on that report <e> <s> that is why i admire the way in which these amendments have been drafted <e>", "<cs> i am astonished that the noble earl should think that i would lend my name to an amendment that was a labour party ploy or plot or whatever he said <e>", "<cs> only ploys of our own <e> <s> i should like in fact to say again what i did not have the opportunity to say at the end of the last debate which is that this again reinforces the strong feelings that there are on these benches as well as around the chamber not only that something must be done and be seen to be done but that it really must be entrenched as firmly as it can be <e> <s> therefore it seems to me that this provision needs to be on the face of the bill and in such a way that successors successive secretaries of state cannot change it without coming back to parliament <e> <s> of course nothing is permanent but the place to make significant changes of this kind is parliament <e> <s> that is why this amendment is very important and i hope that the government will incorporate it in whatever measures they put forward <e>", "<cs> i am pleased with what we have heard from the noble earl <e> <s> how different this is from the arguments that we had on the buses bill <e> <s> i congratulate sir norman payne and the combined trade unions on having apparently come to an amicable agreement on this matter <e> <s> i wait to hear what the noble lord lord underhill has to say in reply <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has anticipated me in some of the remarks that i was going to make <e> <s> i would like to reinforce the belief that the situation between employees and management in the british airports authority is in many ways a model of what should exist in the rest of industry <e> <s> i see that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter nods in agreement <e> <s> it would be very much to the benefit of all if the machinery were to be kept intact well oiled and properly working <e> <s> the point made by the noble lord lord carmichael about career development was something that i mentioned at second reading <e> <s> the virtue of the structure that the government have decided to set up for the future of the british airports authority is that it can allow transfer of personnel in a sensible career structure from airport to airport <e> <s> that is a valuable asset <e>", "<cs> we are in serious danger of this debate developing into a long discussion <e> <s> i see that the right reverend prelate the bishop of manchester is present as well as my noble friend lord crawshaw of aintree who is actually a salfordian <e> <s> i also see the noble lord lord scanlon who may say something about the benefits of barton airport because at one time he was a trade union branch secretary covering that particular branch area <e> <s> however i do not want to go down that track <e>", "<cs> i am sorry will the noble lord repeat his question <e>", "<cs> i have no idea <e> <s> i shall not get involved in the competitive merits of liverpool airport <e> <s> liverpool airport went down the drain because liverpudlians thought that cunarders would always go on taking people across the atlantic and it was only later that they woke up to the fact that they had all moved to southampton and then it stopped <e> <s> i do not want to get into that argument this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but that does not help the rest of us <e>", "<cs> that does not help us at this moment <e> <s> although i think that the noble earl has gone some way to explaining the position i still do not think he has got to the nub of it <e> <s> as i understand it the situation is that on the break up of the merseyside county council liverpool city council wanted to take over control of the airport <e> <s> they were refused permission to do that on their own by the secretary of state <e> <s> i shall not go into liverpool politics for that is far too complicated but for whatever reasons the surrounding district councils were not prepared to join a consortium of some kind and therefore the secretary of state handed this over to the pta forced it upon the pta <e> <s> the secretary of state is now saying that that will not do so far as this bill is concerned except for the two clauses mentioned by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble earl says that he is willing to accept the majority decision <e> <s> the majority of whom <e> <s> is it the majority of the local district councils <e> <s> if that were the case that could be as unfair as the noble lord lord underhill has just suggested <e> <s> they could be all of one political persuasion <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord foot for illustrating the exeter position so well <e> <s> i agree very much with the noble baroness lady fisher of rednal in relation to humberside <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble earls last remark is quite unacceptable <e> <s> to assume that local authorities have so little regard for the economic structure of their local area is grossly unfair to them <e>", "<cs> i have the feeling that all local authorities are politically dominated <e> <s> it may be that there are those who believe that if they have a conservative administration it is non-political but that is not a view which i take <e>", "<cs> may i delay the committee for a second while we look at this question of the sort of <e>", "<cs> let me make it quite clear that there is no desire from these benches to have companies set up which are not viable <e> <s> if this bill is going to go through then let it go through in a way which produces viable airports and viable airport companies but it seems to me that the price the government are charging for that is resting upon the local ratepayer <e> <s> i accept that the minister has said that he wishes to take this away and look at it again <e> <s> it is a highly complex matter and i do not pretend to understand the ins and outs of it particularly when we are involved in local government finance <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord dean of beswick because that was precisely the interpretation that i put on what the minister said that indeed the money would have to be found from somewhere else and with many of these authorities that does mean a reduction in other services <e> <s> it is that as much as anything that one still detects in the governments attitude which makes one worried <e> <s> we are after all at a fairly late stage of this bill although the report stage and third reading are still to come but the bill has had a lot of time in the other place and received a lot of consideration in committee <e> <s> yet the government are still saying that this is very difficult and very complex but really at the end of the day it is up to local authorities to bear the burden <e> <s> it is for that <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that <e> <s> i am not sure that it takes us very much further but perhaps it does take us a little further and i am very grateful for that <e> <s> i think we must all read what has been said in this debate tonight <e> <s> in the meantime it is getting rather late and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that those tyres operate at a different pressure from normal tyres and that many motorway service stations are not equipped with air pressure gauges and pumps which will pump up those tyres to the required pressure <e> <s> how will the minister make the public aware of the differences in the use of those tyres both in terms of having different plys on different axles as the noble lord asked which is something we have been trying for many years to persuade people not to do and also on this question of different pressures <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl the minister for repeating the statement perhaps i may say that we on these benches view it with considerable sadness as one must when manufacturing jobs are once again disappearing in this country <e> <s> i should like to probe one or two points in addition to those made by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> the first is the question of export orders <e> <s> the statement is very laid back on the subject of export orders <e> <s> there is no indication that the government intend to do anything to assist british rail in obtaining further export orders <e> <s> what is holding back brel from obtaining further export orders <e> <s> is it credit or are there other problems <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble earl the minister and i wish him no harm we do not welcome the statement <e> <s> we are grateful to him for repeating it <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware that where we should be recruiting more engineers is from among women and that it is in girls schools that the pressure should be applied <e> <s> there is a great lack in this country of women in engineering and we compare badly with other countries <e>", "<cs> may i too join in supporting this amendment and congratulating the noble earl on the way in which he has presented it to your lordships committee <e> <s> i was slightly rebuked by him at an earlier stage i thought for raising some of the matters which he has raised on this amendment when i mentioned matters relating to luton on some of the earlier amendments <e> <s> of course he was quite right <e> <s> nevertheless i am unrepentant on that because i think it has given the noble earl lord caithness an opportunity to think a little more about the general problem which is now so well focused in this particular amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl responds to that appeal may i first thank the minister for what he said and secondly say how grateful people on all sides of the committee will be for the clear signs of movement that are now emerging from the government on this point <e> <s> i hope that it will not be seen as carping if i merely say at this stage that this is a big step forward but obviously local authorities need fairly quick reassurance in order to look to their future finances <e> <s> the sooner that the government are able to give clear guidelines as to the steps they intend to take in this direction the more helpful it will be to those local authorities who are having difficulties in balancing their budgets anyway <e>", "<cs> although my name was not put to this amendment by some inadvertence nevertheless the principle lying behind it has my support <e> <s> those noble lords who were around for the transport bill will remember that i spent a considerable amount of time on precisely the problem relating to the transfer of people from existing public authorities into private companies <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl does respond i may say that his opening remark was a curious one when he commented that the amendment was fraught with difficulties <e> <s> it is not the duty of the opposition to sort out the governments difficulties <e> <s> the difficulties are a consequence of the bill and it is up to the government to sort them out <e> <s> we on this side of the committee try our best but the government have much more expertise at their fingertips <e> <s> if the government accept that there is a real problem here then it is largely in their hands to find a way of getting round it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down i think i must say at this stage that on these benches we have considerable sympathy for the underlying feeling behind this amendment and the need to encourage employees to take part in the overall strategy of the companies for which they work <e> <s> certainly my party has a long history of thought and policy in this area <e> <s> but i believe that trying to amend this bill in a piecemeal fashion is not really the way to come at it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord even with the suggestion he has just made is not really getting away from what is an important objection raised by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i think we have to await a proper bill dealing with employee participation employee shareholding and all the rest of the matters which can only come some time after the next election <e>", "<cs> is it not a strange argument to say that one set of directors who presumably are representing outside private shareholding do not have a conflict of interest whereas directors who are operating on behalf of the other shareholding namely the municipal sector in many cases are deemed to have a conflict of interest <e> <s> why should that be so <e> <s> is it simply that people who work for local authorities are less trustworthy than people who work in the private sector <e> <s> if not where does the distinction lie <e>", "<cs> do not the directors who are operating on behalf of the local authority have a duty to their shareholders <e> <s> their shareholders in this case are the ratepayers <e>", "<cs> i think that that is the way we normally proceed <e> <s> the clause to which amendment no <e> <s> relates is a curious one <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the support given to the amendment <e> <s> it does not seem to me that the minister has answered the point particularly the point concerning smaller airports <e> <s> we have this curious situation where full-time officers can be directors but cannot be company secretaries <e> <s> we are talking about professional people <e> <s> we are talking about people who are used to handling conflicts of interest <e> <s> the town clerks of our great cities are constantly faced with conflicts of interest as councils move from one form of political control to another <e> <s> they are highly professional people who more than anyone else are capable of handling the sort of conflict of interest that the government are worried about <e> <s> as i said before the government produce no evidence whatsoever of the problems that might accrue under this <e> <s> i do not feel that i can do other than ask the house to decide <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies i like the noble lord lord carmichael was a little worried about what the noble earl said in respect of the inability of the government to separate the amount out <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a distinguishable amount which will be there on vesting day or whatever the term may be and the servicing of that debt will go on for some considerable time <e> <s> therefore it is possible to calculate what the cost of servicing that debt will be <e> <s> it is not i should have thought a debt which will increase beyond that moment <e> <s> that seemed to me to be inherent not only in the amendment but in the way it was moved by the noble earl <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may offer my support to this series of amendments <e> <s> when we were talking about amendment no <e> <s> and the question of pensions was being discussed the noble earl the minister relied rather heavily on this amendment and said that the government had chosen this mechanism to carry out their responsibilities and to carry out the responsibilities of parliament and of the country towards those people who were put in a position in which they might suffer diminution of pension rights <e>", "<cs> just before the noble earl decides to do what he may well decide to do perhaps i may say this <e> <s> it seems to me that in the first subsection of clause there are two remaining mays <e> <s> i should have thought that that would give the secretary of state quite a lot of flexibility even if the first may is <e>", "<cs> i believe the thing used to be the viking equivalent of a moot <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may reinforce just a couple of points that have been made in this debate <e> <s> certainly i agree entirely on the subject of local authorities and i am considerably concerned about the consultative committees <e> <s> my concern arises from the change of status of baa <e> <s> there is no doubt that the relationship between baa and the consultative committees has been very good and that they have consulted on a wide range of matters <e> <s> i do not think that any of us who know the senior management of baa have any doubt that there will be any immediate change in that position <e> <s> nevertheless faces change and attitudes change <e> <s> the fact is that we are facing a situation in which there is a nationalised industry that is moving into the public sector <e> <s> clearly there must be a difference in the relationship that exists between a nationalised industry and a consultative committee and one that exists between a public limited company and a consultative committee <e>", "<cs> while i do not dissent from what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said in response to the noble lord lord monkswell i feel that he is perhaps being a little unfair on the local authorities by suggesting that their only input is likely to be negative <e> <s> i agree that on questions of noise and transport problems relating to an airport it may seem to be negative but the local authorities are also served by ratepayers who are airport employees <e> <s> a wise local authority would take that into consideration when balancing the pros and cons of an airport in its area <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for replying in that way in some detail <e> <s> i have a vision of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter making exactly that <e>", "<cs> while this is going around i did not intervene because when i came into the chamber and looked at the annunciator i saw that i was moving the amendment and so i felt i did not need to bother <e>", "<cs> i wholeheartedly endorse what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said about mr christopher tugendhat having spent the early part of my working life working for his father but that is another long story <e> <s> the noble lord has put his finger on things in relation to <e>", "<cs> i should like to give my full support to the principle behind this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me we go to a lot of trouble to regulate airline pilots hours and we really ought to go to similar lengths for air traffic control officers <e> <s> the fact is that they perform a vitally important task and in some cases a more important task than airline pilots if i may say so <e> <s> there seems to be a gap in the legislation <e> <s> i am sure the minister will say that there are all sorts of regulations and controls over this and that the civil aviation authority checks these things on a regular basis but the information that i have is that the number of spot checks which take place are perhaps inadequate <e> <s> when this was put to the caa they said that several spot checks have been carried out during the past three years but that the exact number is not readily available suffice to say that spot checks are made <e> <s> frankly that does not convince me and i hope that it does not convince members of the committee <e> <s> it is a serious matter <e>", "<cs> i have considerable sympathy for the ideas that lie behind both these amendments and i am not quite sure which i prefer to be honest <e> <s> there is a genuine problem i think when the government are transferring a public monopoly to a private monopoly to see that the consumer gets a fair deal <e>", "<cs> this proposal again touches on what i was saying previously about obtaining value for money for the consumer which is something which i should like to see <e> <s> i worry slightly about the words <e>", "<cs> i am astonished <e> <s> i am really astonished <e> <s> here are the government demanding facilities that should be placed at the governments disposal and not prepared to pay for them <e> <s> it strikes me as being so simple <e> <s> to say that the government have the intention of paying for these things out of the goodness of their heart is one thing <e> <s> if that is the case why are they not prepared to have it on the face of the bill <e> <s> it is a terrible temptation to divide the committee on such a simple premise and i wonder whether the noble lord cannot give some second thoughts to what he has just said <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to both the noble lord lord williams and the noble earl lord dundee for joining in at this stage <e> <s> i realise that they held back before because of the time situation and like me they <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble earl would possibly be good enough to answer the question that i asked him about the kingman report namely is it not the case that the largest number of people actually took the view that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact as we have said many times from these benches that in the long term the problems will be solved only by the introduction of proper rail links between central london and heathrow and between heathrow and gatwick <e> <s> the roads

able to give a simple answer to this simple question have they been properly represented <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not still the case that there has been an increase in the price of electricity while raw material costs have come down significantly indeed and in particular the price of oil came down by almost per cent <e> <s> before the first increase in the tariff <e> <s> i put it to the minister that it simply does not make sense to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is in october of this year in peking a chemical trade exhibition and that at the moment only one british chemical company is exhibiting there and that approaches to the british overseas trade board have failed to come up with any support for chemical firms wishing to show at that exhibition <e> <s> is that not a pity in relation to the way our competitors from west germany are exhibiting there <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that the noble lord has still not answered the question and

earl able to give comparable figures for the reduction in bus services compared with savings in cost in relation particularly to bus services at late or awkward hours and on sundays <e>", "<cs> my

little more than vigorous competition <e> <s> are the government satisfied that the matter is not already out of hand at a time before deregulation has properly come into effect <e> <s> do the government not fear a similar outbreak of anarchy on the streets of other towns and cities of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords following on the supplementary question of the noble lord lord

house today <e> <s> perhaps he will ask his noble friend the leader of the house whether we can have some greenfly spray down this end of the chamber <e> <s> more pertinent to the question has the minister any idea how many new operators have come in in various areas of the country <e> <s> have there been many or just a few <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may revert to the supplementary question asked by my noble friend <e> <s> if the minister cannot disclose what went on between the prime minister and the german bundesbank president can he at least say whether it is the governments

lords i beg to move that this house do not insist on their amendment no <e> <s> to which the commons disagreed for the reason numbered but propose the said amendment in lieu thereof <e> <s> the

how that overrules what the noble lord lord underhill said <e> <s> if the government are saying that this committee has no right to discuss the matter because a treaty obligation has been entered into why have they been wasting our time and the time of our noble friends on the select committee <e>", "<cs> if a good deal is already being done that falls within the remit of this amendment why are the government not throwing their hats in the air and accepting the amendment immediately <e> <s> although the minister has not yet rejected the amendment my impression is that he has not been exactly enthusiastic about it <e>", "<cs> if i may echo what the noble lord lord underhill said the reason why i put my name to this amendment is not that i was worried about bats especially being a member of your lordships house but because of the interim period when the tunnel is partly constructed <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers has an important point in relation to whether the protective measures would be in place at the right time <e> <s> that is the point on which we seek reassurance from the minister <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with what the noble lord lord ennals is seeking to achieve <e> <s> however i wonder whether again he does not go a little too far by including any premises in the tunnel system because that takes us back to the workers canteen at ashford <e> <s> as regards his suggestion that this is not a party political matter and is therefore a common sense matter that may apply to his party but it certainly does not apply on these benches <e>", "<cs> the minister will not be surprised to hear me say that we fully support the amendment from these benches <e> <s> it is very much in the category of the discussions that we were having last thursday on the necessity for immigration and customs officials to be on passenger trains <e> <s> i believe in many ways this is more important <e>", "<cs> i understand what the minister is saying about traders who have their own customs facilities but those are not the traders about whom <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord care to ask the minister what view the department of trade and industry takes <e> <s> i should have thought that the department was extremely favourable towards this <e>", "<cs> i have given notice of my intention to oppose the question that clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> i shall not detain the committee more than a couple of minutes and in the end it is not my intention firmly to oppose the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to noble lords on behalf of my noble friend lord shackleton who was called away to a meeting but hoped to be back <e> <s> clearly he has not been able to return <e> <s> he asked me to use the opportunity to express his view which i heartily endorse that the house would wish to thank the noble lord lord sherfield for his chairmanship of the select committee which he has now relinquished to my noble friend lord shackleton <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords who served on the committee and on sub-committees would certainly like to thank the noble lord lord sherfield and welcome my noble friend lord shackleton as the new chairman of the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that deregulation of buses has made it more difficult for information technology to be introduced where there are a number of competing operators <e> <s> it is difficult to see who will put in the passenger information which is certainly technically available now at the bus stops and at the central points when there is no co-ordinating body <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that he has been somewhat inaccurate in two responses that he has made to my noble friends <e> <s> the first is that this question does not relate only to public sector hospitals and secondly it does not refer to hospitals only in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords we heartily support the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> i think that the minister will be giving three yes answers to his noble friend as i am sure he is aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord lord ampthill is entirely correct <e> <s> i also support what has been said by the noble lord lord teviot <e> <s> anyone who has driven to dover to catch a ferry knows precisely how horrid is that last stretch of road <e>", "<cs> my lords there are moments when one feels that one has achieved some minor success and this is certainly one of those moments <e> <s> we are all grateful to the government for having taken seriously the comments made both in this chamber and in the select committee and for the amendment that has been tabled <e> <s> it is clearly an amendment that could not have been set down by anybody other than the government because its ramifications are clearly shown in the subsidiary amendments that have had to accompany it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support what the noble lord lord ampthill has said <e> <s> first of all i am slightly amused by the fact that the french call their authority the committee of public safety which i thought meant something else some years ago <e> <s> the recommendation of the select committee of your lordships house is quite clear on this matter <e> <s> it says that many concerns expressed in this part of the report might be laid to rest by the appointment of a totally independent chairman <e>", "<cs> my lords there may be some slight confusion in the mind of the noble viscount lord massereene and ferrard in that we are talking about british rail rather than the eurotunnel shuttles <e> <s> the noble viscount lord craigavon will recognise that i would have put my name to the amendment on this occasion as i did on the last had it not been for the shortage of time because i support the principle that lies behind the amendment <e> <s> i presume that he will not press it to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords fools rush in where angels fear to tread and i think that this is an area where one has to be tactful <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the principles underlying the amendment and with the debate which took place on the last occasion when the minister pointed out the difficulties of making changes in the system <e> <s> nevertheless i think that the government have a duty to examine the general situation in the light of the considerable amount of privatisation which is now going on <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving way <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a slightly unusual situation <e> <s> the determination of market value at the end of the day is a matter about which i am still slightly in doubt <e> <s> after all the value of the land depends on the existence of the tunnel and of the tunnel project <e> <s> therefore if it were to be sold back at that value but the landowner had no possibility of developing the land in a similar way and making a similar profit it would be getting very close to crichel down would it not <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i wonder whether that kind of attitude does not lie behind some of the difficulties that we have already had <e> <s> i am not trying to detract from the fact that the government changed their mind between the committee and report stages and were good enough to say so <e> <s> that is something that takes a certain amount of courage on the part of any government and we are grateful for it <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to an earlier question the noble lord suggested that the matter of gatwick may not have total relevance today <e> <s> however we on these benches would suggest that the future of gatwick is important because that is the main base of british caledonian and any change in ownership of it could shift the balance of usage between heathrow and gatwick quite drastically <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i support the motion that the bill do now pass <e> <s> i join with the noble lord lord underhill in thanking the minister in particular and other noble lords who have taken part but who have not always been part of the transport club in this house <e> <s> it is usually a small and select band of noble lords who sit through committee and report stages of transport bills <e> <s> they can be counted on the figures of one hand <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may assist the answer is approximately three inches <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i too should like to thank the noble viscount for introducing this motion <e> <s> i also thank the chairman of the review body the noble lord lord plowden and his team for the remarkably detailed report that they have produced <e> <s> those of us who read it in detail recognise the house as it is the way in which it works and also the difficulties that are outlined in reaching solutions to its difficult problems <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i join in thanking the noble lord the chief whip for his good wishes and we return them <e> <s> the noble lord lord ponsonby in his comprehensive comments covered virtually all the people to whom we should offer our thanks <e> <s> i agree with every word <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord accept that he has not yet answered the second part of my noble friends question <e> <s> it was clearly directed to the relationship between sterling and the deutschemark with which as he said we have been co-habiting for a number of months <e> <s> when are the government going to legalise that arrangement <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i wonder where within the amendments that we are considering the question of a referendum is referred to <e> <s> i do not recall the noble lord at second reading raising this matter although he may have done so <e> <s> if he wishes to put down an amendment on referenda he is at liberty to do so <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the party of which i am proud to be a member believes that non-selective education is a good thing for the benefit of all children <e> <s> furthermore is the noble baroness aware that on tuesday of last week in the kingston-upon-thames education committee where the conservative party has a majority of three to one a new proposal put forward by the leader of that group was withdrawn because of the confusion that existed within that committee <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister tell the house whether the government are giving any thought to introducing the kind of equipment which the police in holland use <e> <s> there photographs which show both the speed the time and the number plate of the car are taken <e> <s> that makes enforcement far easier than in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i also thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> the whole house and the nation will have felt a deep shock at the tragedy which struck last night to people going innocently about their purposes through the mundane job of simply getting home from the office or going for a night out <e> <s> it is terrible to think that people left their homes and families yesterday morning and that a number of them simply did not return <e> <s> it is also tragic that a number of them did return but will never be the same again because of the awful injuries they sustained <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl may not be aware of it but the internal communications of the house have failed <e> <s> he may have to raise his voice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lords are aware that the public address system in this house has failed <e> <s> i think in the interests of the <e>", "<cs> my lords the view from these benches is couched neither in the triumphal terms of the final paragraph of the statement nor is it the dogmatic response heard from the labour front bench <e> <s> the attitude that on the one hand all privatisation is good is just as foolish as the statement that all privatisation is bad <e> <s> if noble lords wish to hear a further development on that subject they might care to listen to the debate to be opened tomorrow by my noble friend lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the word the noble viscount is looking for is horwich <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to raise a matter in relation to the bill before we pass the motion that the noble lord has put forward <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that government amendments to this bill which consists of clauses and seven schedules have not yet been published <e> <s> i understand that government amendments were tabled yesterday but that they are not yet in the hands of those people who are dealing with this extremely complicated bill <e> <s> rumour has it that the government have also placed a further batch of amendments today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the chemical industry in which i declare an interest uses something like per cent <e> <s> of the total electricity and that some of the major users of electricity find themselves being made totally uncompetitive with people on the continent <e> <s> will he also accept that in particular the producers of french chlorine are buying electricity at something like half the price which the chemical industry in this country is paying <e> <s> this surely cannot be to the benefit of an industry which has a billion export surplus <e>", "<cs> my lords in that convoluted reply are the government saying that they want to have a merger between british airways and british caledonian and that everybody else can take their hat and ball away and play somewhere else <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i also wish to thank the noble lord the chief whip for making this statement <e> <s> he was kind enough to give me some few minutes prior knowledge of what he was going to say <e> <s> again as i think a subsidiary of the usual channels i also welcome attention being drawn to this problem <e>", "<cs> i was under the impression that i was <e> <s> however i was also under the impression that i was not yet speaking to amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> i had it in mind to subsume that within the discussion on amendment no <e> <s> zb which appears certainly in the mind of my noble friend to be a more logical place to do so <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that i shall have a busy christmas reading through these various conventions <e> <s> it seems to me that the broadcasting authorities are clearly worried about this problem <e> <s> i do not think it is quite as simple as the minister suggests <e> <s> however i said that this was intended to be a probing amendment <e> <s> quite clearly this is not the time to press it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord would perhaps rephrase that comment about my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i think my noble friend lord donaldson was asking questions about legality <e> <s> he was not stating that he was acting illegally <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> clearly my noble friend during the recess will wish to study in <e>", "<cs> nor do i wish to pursue it <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation of each of these matters <e> <s> i welcome the fact that he is considering amendment no <e> <s> ac in connection with other matters that have already been discussed <e> <s> i shall merely ask my noble friend to read what he said because i was interested to hear the suggestion that amendment no <e> <s> ab tilted the balance in what i think my noble friend would regard as the wrong direction <e> <s> that clearly was not in his mind when he put down the amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i trust that there is no danger in the use of the word incidental in this case in that it may be confused with the use of the word incidental in other cases for instance the incidental music to a midsummers nights dream in which there will undoubtedly be performing rights <e> <s> i take it that the government have made it quite clear that the use of the word does not overlap into that area as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i join entirely in supporting the expressions that have come from both sides of the house to the members of the staff both internal and external and also to people who are not quite members of the staff but who are supportive of our efforts the <e>", "<cs> i have only one slight reservation about what the noble lord the deputy chairman has just said <e> <s> in view of the fact that my noble friend has had to leave the committee for a period i hope that he will be back later and that his amendment covers the whole clause and he would rather see what is said about the various parts of the subsection before going any further i have been advised that he would wish this amendment not to be moved <e>", "<cs> with respect the bill as it stands does not say so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend asked me simply to say and i am sure that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway will say more than i can say that he has already spoken to this under clauses and on the matter of the methods of seizure about which he is extremely worried <e> <s> he has subsequently received a letter from the noble lord the minister saying that the government intend to look at the seizure provisions both in this clause and in parts i and ii <e> <s> therefore he would not wish to press the matter any further and he is grateful to the minister for having written to him <e> <s> i dare say that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway wishes to say more <e>", "<cs> my noble friend would certainly wish to support lord mottistone in what he has just said <e> <s> it used the word draconian to me when describing these three clauses <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord mottistone has put the case very well <e> <s> why on earth do the government want to put themselves in the position where they are seeking to take powers under this bill which they will undoubtedly pretend that they do not want to use and indeed probably do not want to use <e> <s> there has to be provision one understands in emergencies or in the case of war but that is a totally different situation <e> <s> the government under these clauses are seeking to take powers far wider than they should <e> <s> it is the job of parliament and particularly this part of parliament to challenge the government when they seek to take such powers <e> <s> speaking from these benches generally and in particular on behalf of my noble friend we certainly support everything that the noble lord lord mottistone has just said <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce the noble lords comments <e> <s> the minister has put forward a convincing case in relation to specific circumstances <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interject a word at this stage <e> <s> the assurance that these matters can be debated on either a negative or an affirmative resolution has very little meaning for members of this chamber <e> <s> we are constantly told from the government front bench that when secondary legislation is introduced it can be debated by parliament <e> <s> the truth is that with a large government majority in the other place and with the inability of this chamber either to amend or to vote against an instrument whether it be affirmative or negative those words are totally meaningless <e> <s> some of us are becoming very tired of the government hiding behind secondary legislation in this way <e>", "<cs> i was hoping that the minister would respond to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i suspect that the minister has as clear an understanding of this matter as i have myself <e> <s> we both have our advisers to whom we shall refer <e> <s> perhaps we shall return to this matter at the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i think that is the most that we can possibly ask on this occasion <e> <s> i

review their attitude to tolls on estuarial crossings <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that the deregulation of buses makes this more difficult than it would otherwise have been <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case though that the red telephone box is not universally approved particularly by those people who are disabled who find the doors extremely heavy to open and those of us who find that they have been used as public conveniences <e> <s> is the minister aware that although they are not perfect the new telephone boxes are better from this point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is telling the house about all the things that the clause does not do <e> <s> since i understand that he is at least part author and probably the main author of this clause can he not answer the noble earls question what does it do beyond protecting children <e> <s> if it only protects children then why is the second part not sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that it is perhaps unwise for the government front bench to assume that bills will pass unchanged through parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the promoters of this bill must be grateful

not the slightest intention of listening to what is being said <e> <s> however in the circumstances and at this hour of the night i have no alternative but to seek leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> there are some amendments which are the converse of amendment no <e> <s> ca which we have just discussed on primary schools <e> <s> it is the other side of the coin about children in sixth forms and parents not being allowed to vote <e> <s> i think it is better that we should take that away anyway and consider it in relation to the primary school amendment which we have already withdrawn <e> <s> i think we would agree to the suggestions of the noble lord lord morton and press on <e>", "<cs> does the minister not accept that the freedom of which he speaks pertains only to one generation of parents <e> <s> in one year one group of parents will have the freedom to chose and thereafter the parents will have no further freedom in the matter whatever save only to have the school closed <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord be kind enough to answer my question <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to repeat myself at this time of night because it is getting late <e> <s> i suggested that the government were offering freedom to just one generation of parents that is the generation which chooses to opt for grant-maintained status <e> <s> subsequent generations of parents would not be allowed any freedom at all save only to close the school <e>", "<cs> i thought that we were also discussing amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i had looked forward to the noble baroness dealing with the proposal at page line <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble baroness would speak also to amendment no <e> <s> a in this grouping <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble baroness but she said she would give a brief resume of what happened last thursday night <e> <s> i was here at that time <e> <s> i feel that she has gone beyond that point and is in the process of raising others <e> <s> thus far she has had just under five minutes <e> <s> i wonder whether this is a proper way for the committee to proceed <e> <s> the debate on thursday night has all been reported in <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has suggested that the campaign is at the ratepayers expense <e> <s> surely so far as the london parents ballot is concerned that is not the case <e> <s> the london parents ballot campaign was paid for by that organisation itself and not by the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene only briefly because there was perhaps a question about some of us on the swanage yacht haven bill voting on a totally non-party basis <e> <s> i wish to make it quite clear that we on these benches are not opposed to marinas <e> <s> the proposal for eastbourne is something which we wish to support because the safeguards have been built into the situation regardless of what the noble lord lord teviot says either by tarmac or the water authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord is saying but i believe that this is an opportunity to restore it to being an area of recreation <e> <s> i wish i could afford the kind of boat that people will put there <e> <s> nevertheless it will be an area of recreation and better than it is at the moment <e> <s> i believe that this is a good project and one which has our support <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to everybody who has joined in the debate today on this short but important bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone has clearly raised an important point and one which i should like to take away and look at to see what might be done <e> <s> my initial feeling is that perhaps it is covered by clause and but if i am wrong about that let us by all means find some way of covering it <e> <s> i believe also that his comment is probably more applicable to medical records than to a report of this kind where the whole record would be exposed and quotations from other people may be seen and need to be expunged <e> <s> it is less likely that such quotations will be contained in a medical report but we shall look at the matter and see what can be done <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive an intervention <e> <s> i am grateful to him <e> <s> he refers to left and the right but looking in which direction <e>", "<cs> by some strange mistake on the part of the bureaucracy i find my name coupled with that of the noble baroness lady hooper on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i think this was intended to be one of the amendments on road safety education <e> <s> nevertheless i am very happy to be coupled with her in this particular area because this is an important one <e> <s> there is some ribald laughter from the official opposition front bench which i do not understand <e> <s> a number of people have been rather badly dealt with by people offering unrecognised degrees and i certainly wish to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i speak first as someone who has spent many years working for a multinational corporation that is per cent <e> <s> dutch and secondly as a member of a party which has a total commitment to the european ideal <e> <s> therefore although there are no names on the amendment from these benches we thoroughly support it <e>", "<cs> does it not make the problem of accountability a little difficult if the student is paying in one local government area and voting in another <e> <s> does that not breach the principle of accountability <e>", "<cs> my lords like everyone else this evening i congratulate the noble lord lord nugent of guildford on bringing the bill forward from another place and presenting it to your lordships so clearly tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> does the bill do what he said <e> <s> it only provides for compulsory child restraints in the back seat of motor cars <e> <s> child restraint in other directions has yet to come <e>", "<cs> arising from the point that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter made it seems that we need a definition of the phrase undertaking the course <e> <s> i am sure that my professor would not have regarded me as undertaking my course at certain times in my academic career <e> <s> however i should not want to follow that frivolous point <e> <s> but the wording seems to me to be slightly sloppy <e> <s> does it simply mean from the registration day to the day on which the graduation ceremony takes place <e> <s> as the noble lord has suggested there are periods which might be slightly ill-defined under the wording <e>", "<cs> i understand that but is there a power to define what is meant by undertaking a course <e>", "<cs> i intervene merely to say that b occurs in the clause standing separately from the clause itself <e> <s> it is in clause b <e> <s> if the government assume that its meaning is the same as in clause that is fine but they should say so <e>", "<cs> with respect to the noble lord it occurs in clause b <e>", "<cs> this is an important matter of principle in relation to the bill <e> <s> if this government or any other were to consider increasing the level above that proportion i believe it would be a serious matter <e> <s> we are not arguing simply about numbers <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies could he tell the committee whether the wording as it stands leaves open the possibility of a proportion of less than per cent <e> <s> being prescribed by the secretary of state because it seems to me that that would reinforce the point made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord lord dean of beswick has a fair point <e> <s> i do not feel at all constrained by anything that may have been said in another place from benches other than mine <e> <s> i do not want to get into the private grief of another party <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall take his last point first before i forget it <e> <s> he may be right that there is a slight leapfrogging process here but the drafting has been carried out by some better brains than mine <e> <s> i hope that what i say in response to the noble lord lord prys-davies answers some of the noble lords other questions <e>", "<cs> i should like to consider that matter if i may and perhaps come back to the noble lord later <e> <s> i do not think that at this stage of the game i can guarantee to make any changes of that kind <e> <s> as regards the second comment made by the noble lord lord prys-davies in respect of amendment no <e> <s> the answer is that one can have different layouts for bills <e> <s> this bill seeks to have a logical chronological progression through the various phases <e> <s> in other words amendment no <e> <s> deals with the consent to applications amendment no <e> <s> deals with the access before the supply of that information and amendment no <e> <s> deals with the consent to supply and also with the mechanics of the consent to supply <e> <s> it would be difficult to place the first part of amendment no <e> <s> in a different part where it is disconnected from the mechanics of consent <e> <s> indeed it is signalled in subsection of amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that this clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> from the looks i am receiving from the clerk i am not sure that i am doing this correctly <e> <s> is it all right <e> <s> i beg to move that this clause do not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that this clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for explaining to the committee the purport of his amendment <e> <s> i can only go back to what i said on second reading namely that i believe that the bill already covers these circumstances and i believe that his argument would have more force if we were talking about access to medical records <e> <s> i think that in this rather narrow field of medical reports it is unlikely that this situation will ever occur <e> <s> however far be it from me to leave a situation where anybody is at risk as a result of this bill and as it is argued that it does not damage the bill in any way we are happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause shall not stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> except in scotland the minister is saying presumably <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly as someone who added his name to the amendment <e> <s> there really is very little more to say <e> <s> it seems to me that the debate revolves around the decision as to whether we have a sensible transport system the noble lord lord beloff put his finger right on the button capable of development integrated and envisaged in the bill which many of us criticised <e> <s> we would have approached the problem in different ways <e> <s> nevertheless the transport bill and the local government bill took us down this road <e>", "<cs> perhaps the minister will allow me to correct him <e> <s> is it not true that this will only apply on a much more limited timescale <e> <s> what he has just said about districts not being able to refuse to pay the bill is true on a one-year basis but it is certainly not true over a longer period <e>", "<cs> with respect to the minister the ptas are able to operate on a much longer timescale than that <e> <s> their precepting powers enable them in fact to look forward for two or three years <e> <s> the new system will certainly not enable them to do that <e>", "<cs> as someone who has been involved in the industry for a number of years perhaps i may say that that answer will be less than satisfactory to the industry <e> <s> the industry had hoped that the noble earl would give some encouragement to the view that the secretary of state might be prepared to take this into his hands to produce some form of equalisation <e> <s> one recognises that different parts of the chemical industry in this country use different feedstocks therefore one can get a certain situation where there are curious competitive anomalies arising out of this kind of legislation <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the minister is aware of the casual basis upon which many of these bed and breakfast accommodation places work <e> <s> some of them may be used only half a dozen or a dozen times in a whole year <e> <s> presumably from what the minister said those people would be swept up into this great net at the same time <e> <s> please may we also have a copy of the letter <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask for clarification for the committee <e> <s> was it the case that the noble lord was also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> b <e>", "<cs> from these benches i oppose the amendment on many grounds <e> <s> first if ever i saw a wrecking amendment this is it <e> <s> it removes the effects of the bill from most urban areas <e> <s> basically i think that the people who move the amendment are really unaware of the dangers involved in impacts of cars against other bodies whether they are glancing head-on or going straight into a wall <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that the amount of energy created by a moving body which a child is when it leaves the back seat and hits something in front of it is half mv <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord lord bruce-gardyne whether he agrees that adults should be legally responsible for children under the age of or does he seek some wider change in the law of this country <e>", "<cs> i should like to offer support in principle from these benches for the amendments <e> <s> there is no more democratic form of local government than parish councils in our view <e> <s> therefore the question of accountability is peripheral to the argument <e> <s> both the noble baroness lady stedman and the noble lord lord feversham have made the point very cogently <e> <s> however looking at the <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness speaks perhaps i may ask the minister whether in the negotiations which take place consideration of the existence of large businesses in a parish area large factories for instance will be one of the things that will be taken into account <e> <s> we must recognise that some of the costs that will be borne by the parish may be directly attributable to the presence of industries within their areas and therefore the situation cannot be the same in each area <e> <s> there may be certain pollution costs for instance that ought to be taken into account <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> is he suggesting that this legislation will actually increase the turnout in local elections <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the members of the committee who have joined in this short debate <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord lord renton says and i have considerable sympathy for it <e> <s> one would not necessarily wish to introduce a legal fiction if one can find a better way <e> <s> if the noble lord has a few spare moments between now and report stage i shall be grateful if he can indicate how it can be done in a way which does not create a legal fiction <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one who has not read the report in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> in doing so perhaps i may thank the noble earl lord arran for his kind words <e> <s> i thank those who have contributed to the short debates on the bill <e> <s> i am particularly grateful for the fact that although the government have maintained their neutrality on the bill throughout they have been most helpful in giving advice to my advisers <e> <s> i am extremely grateful to mr maurice frankel of the campaign for freedom of information who has spent a good deal of time working on the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a strange assumption is it not that has been made by both the noble baroness and by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that all people in the top form who vote will vote for opting out <e> <s> it is perfectly possible that they may vote against it <e> <s> or are only people who are for opting out going to be allowed to vote <e>", "<cs> my lords it is precisely in those terms that we address the problem <e> <s> it is quite clear that in certain boroughs that is not the spirit in which this is being approached <e> <s> one fundamental point which people have missed is that in the final line of subsection of the amendment we refer only to those governors for the appointment of whom the authority is responsible <e> <s> in other words we are talking only about the local authority governors <e> <s> there is no attempt to politicise the non-local authority governors <e> <s> that is not what the clause addresses <e> <s> the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls may pull a face but that is not what the amendment addresses <e>", "<cs> my lords since the amendment does not contain any names from these benches i wish to make it clear that it has our wholehearted support <e> <s> having had experience of colleagues working in a multinational organisation many of whom worked in europe i realise that there are problems <e> <s> parents are faced with the choice of leaving their children behind in the uk or possibly allowing their children during a few short years as they move into europe and move out again to get out of touch with the educational system in the uk <e> <s> those children may find it difficult to re-enter the system or to enter the next phase of education <e> <s> this provision is essential in such cases <e> <s> i hope that the government have listened carefully to what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that the high quality of magistrates clerks is vitally important to the administration of justice in our magistrates courts <e> <s> indeed with a lay magistracy it is frightfully important that the clerks are of the highest possible quality <e> <s> if they have to be paid to be of that quality surely we must take steps towards that end <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl also speaking to amendment no <e> <s> which is grouped with this amendment on the marshalled list and which has the wonderful subtitle death <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the government have conceded death <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my voice from these benches in support of the principle behind the amendment <e> <s> as i have said before parish <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment and in doing so mention that as i clearly did not give the correct instructions my name appears on amendments nos <e> <s> a and b but on none of the other amendments in this group <e> <s> that is a total oversight as i wish to support the amendment and all its adjuncts <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may revert to the question asked by the noble lord lord teviot in relation to greater manchester <e> <s> he will admit that he has given a rather alarming figure for the increase in that area <e> <s> is it possible that that figure comes from a first draft budget and that although it does not contain charges for the lrt it includes potential financing charges for the setting up of the lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the cost of setting up airport-type facilities at waterloo far exceeds the cost of having people working on the trains <e> <s> is he further aware that i tried to move amendments to the channel tunnel bill for on-train customs and immigration facilities from waterloo as well as the rest of the country <e> <s> i am delighted to find so many noble lords now coming round to support that view <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just follow up that pointhow many customs and immigration officials can be employed and for how long for million or millionat the time the bill was going through the house the cost was expected to be millionhow many people can be employed and for how long for that cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord peston and lord morton for tabling this amendment <e> <s> one does not need to go over all the ground again <e> <s> there was a considerable amount of misunderstanding on report <e> <s> we are simply asking that the government should say that there is a problem and that they are prepared to do something about it <e> <s> if they do not give that undertaking it presupposes that they are applauding the activities of people in barnet and elsewhere who get involved in these foolish activities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the debate is terminated i think it would be proper for me to say a word about the exchange between the noble lord lord hooson and the secretary of state on the question of the six oclock news <e> <s> i must say straight away that i did not see the six oclock news either <e> <s> i was informed by what i suppose is called the usual reliable source and i passed the information on to my noble friend <e> <s> if i was misinformed and thereby misinformed him so that what was said in the house was not true then i apologise unreservedly <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord like to read out the statistics and we can then produce questions to fit the answers that he has <e>", "<cs> my lords reverting to the iraq-iran war will the noble lord accept from these benches that we are also extremely pleased that the iranian government have taken the step of calling for a ceasefire <e> <s> are her majestys government now going to take steps to renew our representation in tehran which was discontinued when mr chaplin left last year in circumstances which were far from satisfactory <e> <s> have assurances been received from the iranian government that the presence of a british diplomat in tehran could take place with proper security <e>", "<cs> my lords in the event of it coming down in either form have the soviet government given any indication of what compensation they will pay to people who are stricken by this object <e>", "<cs> my lords in associating noble lords on these benches with the remarks made by the government and opposition chief whips we must reflect on the fact that it has been an enormously long session <e> <s> the list of bills which have just received royal assent is formidable <e> <s> since we returned after the general election there have been many changes in your lordships house <e> <s> many old friends have gone and many new friends have joined us <e> <s> we are sad about the ones who have gone and we welcome those who have arrived <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that the rate of increase in postal charges is so fast that the cover will not last very long <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to everybody who has taken part in this short debate <e> <s> i am grateful to the minister for his indication that the government will accept the first of these amendments <e> <s> i hoped that he would go further than that and accept all three in his normal generosity of spirit particularly as it is my birthday <e>", "<cs> obviously we need to look at what the noble earl has said because it is clearly not as straightforward as i thought <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for those remarks <e> <s> we must go away and look at what the minister has said about the other two amendments <e> <s> it seems that since there is a shift of tenancy from one landlord to another it would be wrong if people were to have a diminished right of access to information because of the governments actions in moving the tenancy from one landlord to another <e> <s> in principle i hope that the government can find some way of dealing with this matter <e> <s> i must read what the noble earl has said <e>", "<cs> in the absence of my noble friend lord ross of newport perhaps i may respond from these benches <e> <s> as the noble earl said i am late in the day in joining in but i am sure that my noble friend would wish to be associated with the remarks made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> it has been a toughly argued but good natured debate <e> <s> although we have often won the argument and lost the vote nevertheless i should like to thank the noble earl for his kindness and courtesy in handling the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government aware of a speech made by mr edward shevardnadze on th september at the same time as the prime minister was making her speech to the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not an answer to the question <e> <s> have the government directly responded to that initiative put forward in the speech by mr shevardnadze at the united nations <e>", "<cs> my lords

need a thousand years to find the answer <e> <s> can he say whether the costs of decommissioning are being taken into account in the costing of nuclear power for privatisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady must either not move the amendment or speak to it and subsequently seek to withdraw it <e> <s> she is not entitled to do both at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask your lordships to forgive me if i tend to lay the stress on the first syllable of the word harassment <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord mcintosh will not think that i am trying to play games <e> <s> it just happens to be the way that i pronounce the word <e>", "<cs> my lords again bearing in mind that we are on report does not the noble earl intend to say anything further on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords clearly this is an important matter <e> <s> we also are glad that there are to be changes to the bill at this point <e> <s> it is clear that continuity of security of tenure where there is no substantive change in the circumstances of the tenant is absolutely essential <e> <s> there was a possibility under <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl <e> <s> can he explain what happens if the tenant does not pay in those circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the non-tenant spouse with whom he is having an argument it may well be in his interest and that is the point i was trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord seeks to withdraw his amendment perhaps i may through him ask the minister whether he would also consider giving guidance to voluntary management committees of housing associations and registered housing associations <e> <s> i raised that point in my intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the minister for introducing the order so clearly <e> <s> however like the noble lord from the labour party front bench i also have some qualifications most of which i must say the noble lord lord underhill has dealt with <e> <s> perhaps i may just underline one or two of the matters he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> i am most grateful <e> <s> when he says that the police and prosecution service are well aware and exercise discretion it seems to me that that is perfectly true <e> <s> however in doing what they have done the government may be increasing the power of discretion of the police and diminishing the power of discretion of the magistrates court <e> <s> it seems to me that that is the wrong way round <e>", "<cs> my lords although it is probably true to say that the amendment is flawed i do not think it is flawed for the reasons that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has adduced <e> <s> it seems to me <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact is that where compulsory purchase is carried out by local authorities this is a perfectly normal situation <e> <s> it is possible to achieve a market price in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e> <s> the point is not the present occupancy but the next generation of occupancy <e> <s> when the disabled person dies or moves on the property then moves out of the occupancy of a disabled person to a second generation of the family or right outside <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by offering an apology on behalf of my noble friend lord ross of newport <e> <s> he has had to attend a longstanding engagement which is associated with a trust for the homeless <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will excuse him on that ground <e> <s> as we all know it is a subject

moments hesitation but having had it i hasten to say that we are happy to accept these amendments as well <e> <s> the noble earl lord caithness in reading out the results of the division in another place referred to or so votes against the governments amendment <e> <s> i believe that noble lords should recognise that the people who voted against the governments amendment were doing so largely in support of your lordships amendment feeling that it was a better amendment than the government one <e>", "<cs> my lords we too are grateful that the government have found time for this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to interrupt the noble lord any more than is necessary <e> <s> is he aware of a press report that a member of the british transport police said that the public was now getting too sensitive and was reporting too many smoulderings <e> <s> this has occurred in recent weeks <e> <s> i do not expect the minister to answer me now but does he not agree that it is deplorable that someone in that situation is not actually encouraging london underground to contact the fire brigade as often as mr fennell suggests that they should <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he answer one factual point <e> <s> in the report mr fennell recommended that prodorite should have its costs paid <e> <s> does the noble lord know whether that has been done

underhill i should like to have notes on clauses as soon as possible <e> <s> it would have been useful to have had them before the second reading debate but i know that that is not always possible <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not also the case that local authorities will have an interest in those areas to which the traffic is moved as it were from the congested areas <e> <s> that was why i felt that local authorities should have a special consultation on this matter <e> <s> it is not just a matter of congestion being relieved but that traffic is being pushed somewhere they may not wish it to go <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not make more sense to have a restricted access to the system and to increase egress from the system <e> <s> in other words should not the barriers be at the entrance to the stations and the exits free <e> <s> would not that make greater sense <e>", "<cs> my lords if they do lay eggs will they be contaminated with salmonella <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the cost of the fennell report does the noble lord remember that i asked him during our debate whether prodorite had been reimbursed for the cost of counsel in order to be represented at the inquiry <e> <s> i am still waiting for a reply and i wonder whether the minister is yet in a position to reply to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords we too wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s>

noble lord for the explanations he has given <e> <s> he has come into this legislation at very short notice and we are most grateful to him for the excellent way in which he explained the bill <e>",

ilo convention which was laid before parliament in was ratified within two years <e> <s> but it is now eight years since convention was laid before parliament <e> <s> it seems rather strange <e>",

that the birth of christ offers hope to all who are bereaved <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this suggestion although i am not clear on one point <e> <s> i thought that we were talking about

friend the leader of my party in this house might have gone a little pale <e> <s> from the way the noble baroness shakes her head i think that perhaps section of the act ranges beyond motorcycles <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with the suggestion that there should be some reference to consultation with local authorities in the monitoring process <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord underhill that that would be better written in the bill rather than in guidance notes since those do not bind anybody certainly not the next secretary of state for transport nor an incoming government <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord makes his decision i think it would be right to thank the minister for what he said about reporting back to parliament the results of monitoring <e> <s> i should not like that to go unnoticed <e> <s> perhaps i did not quite hear the noble lord lord underhill <e>", "<cs> i am speaking deliberately from the back benches since this is not a party issue as the noble viscount has said but as a retired member of the select committee on science and technology i should like to offer my support to the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i urge the committee to consider this matter very carefully before deciding what to do <e> <s> frankly the ministers reassurance is not of very great reassurance at all to me particularly in the light of the intervention by the noble lord

response to the noble lord lord nelson of stafford <e> <s> i understand that the report of the select committee was in the governments hands almost a year ago in fact in february last year <e> <s> the reply from the government to your lordships house was delayed because it was intended to include it in the white paper review <e> <s> why has it not been included in the white paper review after the promise given to your lordships select committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the leader of the house for what he said but in this case the noble baroness has made the point for me <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that though the funding of the overseas service has been more stable in recent years nevertheless the increases that he has just mentioned have mainly gone into capital expenditure and that it needs a considerable amount of operating expenditure to work the new transmitters <e> <s> does he agree that if one considers the general level of inflation over the next two years there is going to be a decrease in the amount of money available for the bbc to operate these services in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that more and more of the legislation emanating from the government gives secondary power to secretaries of state which i thought was the point that the noble lord lord hylton was making <e> <s> is it not also the case that frequently in bills measures are not spelt out in detail but residual powers accrue to government ministers <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain what meaning it has in other statutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i have the temerity to join in a scottish debate <e> <s> i apologise that my scottish colleagues have already left for their easter break <e> <s> having listened to the weather forecast and seen the scenes of snow and devastation in scotland i think that perhaps they are wiser than noble lords who have stayed here for the debate <e> <s> i shall be as brief as i can because obviously noble lords on all sides of the house who are going to scotland will wish to get there as quickly as they can <e>", "<cs> my lords as i read the proceedings in another place the honourable member was not there at the time of the third reading <e> <s> but i may be doing him an injustice <e> <s> i am glad to have that information but as i say i do not want to get into these theological disputes north of the border <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be improper for me to join in the meat of this discussion but i think that it is very proper for me to welcome to the dispatch box both the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> it is a rare privilege indeed to be able to congratulate together two maiden speakers and to say how lucky they are to have such a subject with which to open a subject on which there will be absolutely no controversy at all whatever they say <e> <s> as to the meat of the business i have nothing more to say <e>", "<cs> my lords first i want to apologise to all those people waiting for the unstarred question because i believe this order will take a little longer than they might have supposed <e> <s> it is unfortunate that the order is brought on at this time on the eve of the public holiday <e> <s> here we are on maundy thursday with her gracious majesty giving away maundy money with various clerics washing peoples feet and the general feeling of support for the poor whereas the government with their order are succeeding in increasing homelessness in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl accept that it was not a consultation process <e> <s> they were simply being informed of changes <e> <s> they were told that they had to reply by th february and that the document was going to print on th february <e> <s> there was no chance of changing the document <e> <s> it was not consultation <e> <s> it was merely informing people of the changes the government had made <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord the leader of the house but are we to suppose that those documents will be marked confidential and not top secret <e> <s> that is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to the noble lord lord brougham and vaux for introducing this debate today <e> <s> as he rightly said it gives parliament a first chance to discuss the north report and the governments white paper <e> <s> the authors of the north report and the government are to be congratulated <e> <s> i do not often have the opportunity to congratulate the government but i believe that with this white paper they have gone a long way toward achieving the right answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> he will remember that on an earlier occasion we on these benches divided the house on this very subject in order to protect the rights of minority parties of which incidentally we do not count ourselves as one <e> <s> the only noble lords who voted against the government on that occasion were members of my party <e> <s> i suspect that the noble lord himself joined us <e> <s> however as i remember none of his party came with us on that occasion and we were defeated by a large majority <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i must stress that i was not consulting the noble lord on the woolsack with any suggestion other than that it would be interesting to see what would happen if the noble lord were to continue with his protest until tomorrow morning <e> <s> at that time some noble lords most of them barristers will enter the chamber and occupy it for most of the day <e> <s> indeed that would be a sight worth seeing <e>", "<cs> perhaps we could just calm the atmosphere slightly <e> <s> it seems to me that the case has been shown that there is bias and i believe that there is general acceptance of that throughout the committee <e> <s> the question of how we should redress that bias may cause differences across the committee <e> <s> it seems to me that one of the best examples of bias in this situation is that i happen to be a non-executive director of a company and my noble friend

company and i say that quite seriously <e> <s> i believe that that is the problem we face as regards non-executive directors <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but it is quite clear that this amendment is not designed to represent particular interests <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that although we welcome the question asked by the noble lord lord aylestone we deeply regret that his colleague the noble baroness lady burton of coventry cannot be present owing to an accident <e> <s> we all wish her well <e> <s> having said that will the government continue to resist pressure coming from various sources for any extension of night flying into either gatwick or heathrow beyond the emergency arrangements that are normally made <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a fine distinction here <e> <s> as i read the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down and setting aside his split infinitive which i shall ignore for the moment he still has not replied to my noble friend <e> <s> how many of those people who he told us were charged were old age pensioners <e> <s> that is more relevant to the amendment which is before the house than the reply which the noble lord has just given <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord explain why the figure of per cent <e> <s> was thought to be too low <e> <s> he said that according to representations they had received that appeared to be the case <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask for further clarification of subsection because that refers to <e>", "<cs> is there any possibility that the government could put those words on the face of the bill because it does not say that <e> <s> i accept that that is the intention of the government <e> <s> however we on this side are constantly being accused of using strange words in amendments and this does not seem to me to be as specific as the noble lord said it was <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to enter into a theological argument with noble lords opposite <e> <s> it is perhaps sad that the bench of the right reverend prelates is not occupied <e> <s> a question that i should like to ask the noble earl lord onslow privately on some occasion is that i know what went on in sodom but i never found out what they were doing in gomorrah <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will forgive me for intervening <e> <s> he made an interesting comment about the purpose of the secretary of states visit to china <e> <s> i thought that the government always insisted that they did not interfere in business matters <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the government constantly complain about local authorities having propaganda on the rates while they are having propaganda on the taxpayers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse the noble lords last remarks <e> <s> in relation to the business statement i hope that the announcement can be made reasonably early <e> <s> noble lords speaking on the second reading of the southampton rapid transit bill have already seen that moved on the order paper from first business to first business during the dinner hour <e> <s> clearly they will wish to know as soon as humanly possible the time at which that business will start <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that was not the question <e> <s> the question was why do the government feel that in this situation there should be fixed penalties in both part i and part ii of the bill <e> <s> it is a strange proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that if fines are not collected it does not matter how big they are <e> <s> surely the opportunity when people have their cars impounded to make sure that licences are in place and that previous fines have all been paid should be taken by the authorities <e> <s> there seems to be a reluctance on the part of the government to take what seem to us obvious steps <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us what is the latest news her majestys government have on the withdrawal of swapo forces <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister can take this opportunity of discussing the number of lanes on bypasses rather than motorways <e> <s> i recognise that that is slightly wide of the question <e> <s> however is he aware that for example in somerset there is very considerable concern about two roads which have recently been built that is the ilminster bypass and the relief road from tiverton <e> <s> they have been built with two lanes <e> <s> in one case it is an extension of the a which is a dual carriageway up to that point <e> <s> there has already been a significant number of fatalities on those two roads <e> <s> will the department please reconsider its policy on building new bypasses <e>", "<cs> my lords if building regulations are intended to improve energy use by up to per cent <e> <s> why is it that the construction industry in this country finds it so difficult to match the activities of similar industries in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl saying that they do not have climates in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that when the house was discussing the channel tunnel we were told that waterloo was the only possible terminus for that traffic <e> <s> why then has the proposal for the development of the kings cross area suddenly emerged from the blackness <e> <s> as the noble lord will perhaps remember we made suggestions on that occasion that there should be a split between the two <e> <s> however we were told then that we were talking rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to that explanation with some astonishment because it seems to me that if there is to be persuasion it will take place before we get to the point at which direction would be necessary unless presumably as the noble lord lord williams has said there comes a point where our international obligations are not being met <e> <s> at that stage the secretary of state surely must make his mind up whether he wants to direct or does not want to direct a certain action to be taken or not to be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that charge is especially penal for single parent families in particular those on supplementary benefit where that notional benefit in kind can take them into the tax bracket for the first time <e> <s> it is a penal provision <e>", "<cs> my lords while i wish to give general support to the governments position is there any fear that british arms supplied to iraq are finding their way into this conflict <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that the answer to the question put by his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter is <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for introducing this motion <e> <s> i am sure that the noble earl would have been more grateful if he had more support in this debate from all sides of the house <e> <s> i cannot but observe that he has been somewhat let down as regards support from his own side of the house on this occasion <e> <s> i believe that is a pity <e> <s> i do not make that as a party point but it is sad to see that nobody is prepared to support him in what is an important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that one should not normally intervene in these short debates but we have a little time in hand <e> <s> i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> however that proposal does not deal with the question of planning blight in those areas <e> <s> it deals with compensation for disturbance after the line is built but it does not deal with the period leading up to that <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister reinforce what he said on the last occasion that this matter was discussed in the house in relation to the governments support of the arab league particularly in the light of the threats made by mr walid jumblatt yesterday when he threatened that arab league observers would be sent back in coffins <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will recognise that it is not the noble lord lord stanley of alderley it is the noble lord lord wise <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> may i simply say that clause does not do that <e> <s> it is restricting the applicants to people who have experience and capacity capacity is an unfortunate word to use when referring to electricity because it has a specific meaning but i set that aside in matters relevant to the provision of electricity supply services not to the consumption of electricity supply services <e> <s> frankly i would settle for the deletion of the word provision and the substitution of the word consumption <e> <s> one could argue that that is less restrictive than my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister may settle for that <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord consider the possibility of rewording the second part of the clause to give emphasis to consumption rather than to provision <e> <s> if he insists on having something in these terms to spell out to the director general the kind of person he should have i hope he will take the point that we shall not go to the stake over a shopping list of people who ought to be on these committees <e> <s> however the balance should be on the basis of the consumer rather than the provider of electricity services <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not in fact transatlantic traffic going into glasgow <e> <s> the only problem is that it has to go via this other place <e>", "<cs> my lords we also express our gratitude to the minister for so clearly explaining this apparently complicated piece of paper <e> <s> i should just like to ensure that the order makes clear that anyone who is disqualified in another country will not be allowed to operate in this country and presumably <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to tell the minister that that does not touch on either of the points made by the noble lord lord mcintosh or by my noble friend in relation to the way in which charges are made up <e> <s> his reply goes back to the answer given by him earlier which does not deal with the fundamental issue we seek to raise on this amendment <e> <s> can he think again <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is withdrawn perhaps i may draw the noble earls attention to a phrase which he used just now <e> <s> he suggested that his noble friend had deliberately misunderstood something which he said <e> <s> in my view that is not a very felicitous phrase to use in this house <e> <s> i wonder whether he might reconsider the matter <e> <s> i know that it was said with the best of intentions but i think that it will perhaps not look too well on the record <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does so i rise to declare an interest in that i am associated with the chemical industry <e> <s> i also do so to ask what evidence the noble lord has to show that the number of chemical spillages is now greater <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could assist those of us on these benches that is myself and the great crowd who sit behind me <e> <s> can he say whether they intend to take the water industry back into public ownership before or after they abolish the house of lords <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain who is everyone in this circumstance <e> <s> surely that is the basis of the original question put by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that not only do we have high interest rates but also increasing inflation <e>", "<cs> i should like to speak on the question of whether clause shall stand part of the bill and i apologise for slightly causing confusion on this issue <e> <s> i understand it is the intention that i should speak on clause stand part and we will come to the noble earls amendments to the long title at the end of our discussions <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the minister for that reply <e> <s> i am sure that it will give great comfort to the people of hexham and similar places <e> <s> i am delighted to have such a satisfactory reply and certainly i shall not seek to impede the progress of the bill for one minute more <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl beg the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount accept that it would be better to be pressing in the long term for the best system rather than the second best <e>", "<cs> my lords if the shortfall is not million will the noble lord tell us what is it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many people who have missed flights for the reasons described by the noble lord lord rodney will not be satisfied with that reply <e> <s> it may be that technically responsibility lies with the british airports authority but the public roads are also affected <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the incident which has been referred to is not the only one <e> <s> is he aware that my noble friend lady robson of kiddington was involved in a similar incident a week ago yesterday when she was kept waiting in a bus for an hour and a half before she was able to leave <e> <s> that was not an isolated incident and will the department of transport look into the matter in more detail than it has so far <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord finally replies to this i hate to insert a technicality but should the amendment not read whichever is the greater <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he also look at the word express to see whether it should not be expressed <e>", "<cs> my lords how soon after the opening of the tunnel is it expected that direct rail services will be able to reach the north of england <e> <s> what progress has been made to have on-train customs and immigration facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down clause says <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would direct his attention to clause <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the present chaos perhaps the result of the free operation of market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that this prosperity leads to chaos <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the supplementary question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter does it naturally follow that the government are about to require flights from heathrow to land at stansted in order to improve the viability of that airport <e> <s> that seems similar to taking off from glasgow and landing at prestwick <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden is as usual persuasive <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord carmichael will recognise that the amendments are not necessarily the best that could have been produced by a government draftsman <e> <s> i spoke at second reading on some of these matters <e> <s> i am somewhat reassured by what the minister said <e> <s> however he has not reassured the committee in relation to the hampshire example given by the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> if it could happen in hampshire what is different about scotland <e>", "<cs> the only quarrel i have with the amendment is the use of the word equal otherwise i go along with it <e> <s> if one is making a general premise that non-executive directors should be equal to executive directors on boards that is a different argument <e> <s> i feel that there is an argument for that but it should not be incorporated on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that that kind of phraseology reminds some of us who are much younger than she is of a phrase that was used during war time when we were in full retreat <e> <s> it was called retreating to prepared positions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for that correction <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord accept that my noble friend is not asking for statutory bodies to run these matters <e> <s> many of us accept that there was a considerable amount of bureaucracy in the days of the statutory bodies <e> <s> what is asked for is a small independent monitoring body <e> <s> does the noble lord accept that at a time when we are running into skill shortages in this country which put pressure on the economy and which in turn add to inflationary pressures something along those lines might be seen to be necessary <e> <s> should not the government take some part in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a voice from these benches in support of the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> i said at the previous stage that the minister had gone some way to reassuring us and the noble lord lord carmichael has reiterated that point <e> <s> nevertheless this is a serious matter and one upon which i am sure the general public wants some reassurance that public assets are not being stripped off to fill the coffers of the new undertakings almost regardless of who their property belongs to whether it is a management/ employee buy-out or an existing transport company <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join in welcoming the regulations <e> <s> this is a classic case in which consultation has been well carried out and the department having taken notice of the consultations has produced regulations which answer as the noble lord lord underhill said most of the criticisms of the bill that were raised during its passage through the house before it became an act <e> <s> like him i am not satisfied with the situation so far as it concerns taxis although i understand the difficulty of taxi drivers <e> <s> it seems to me that the first step may be to increase the use of rear seat belts for adults in taxis <e> <s> i think that the department would do well to persuade taxi drivers to put up signs in their taxis encouraging adults to use the seat belts which are now fitted in most of the taxis in london <e> <s> that would be a step towards providing proper equipment for children <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the minister for his explanation of the bill <e> <s> it has our wholehearted support <e> <s> i shall not detain the house for more than a second as regards one or two omissions from the bill <e> <s> there may be those on the government benches who will expect me to introduce an amendment to include proportional representation in the bill <e> <s> on this occasion i have no intention of doing so and shall not detain the committee at that stage strong as our belief is in the principle <e> <s> nor shall i cover the ground which we covered in in relation to nominations rather than deposits <e> <s> however i still believe that having a significant number of nominees rather than a high deposit level is a better way of keeping mavericks off the ballot paper <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give us any recent indication of how many escalators are out of service in the central zone of london on any given day <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister accept that the situation is not a result of the fennell report <e> <s> it is a result of incompetence of management on the london underground <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will remember that the fennell report was a result of a serious fire which was a result of incompetent management <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may make a short intervention <e> <s> as i see that the people dealing with the irish business tonight are now in their places i can be brief <e> <s> whether they will be is a different matter <e> <s> it is normal in your lordships house for transport matters to be dealt with by about four people two of whom are here tonight <e> <s> it is nice to welcome the noble lord lord sanderson of bowden to transport discussions <e> <s> i am grateful to the house for having made me an honorary scot for the purpose of the bill <e> <s> i have not found it necessary to call for simultaneous translation at any stage for which i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness give way <e> <s> it has been made clear from all sides of the house that there is no question of subsidies being contained within the amendment <e> <s> it is unfortunate that she is trying to smear the amendment by saying things about it which are untrue <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may congratulate the noble lord on having got the name of my party right for once <e> <s> many people try to find other ways of describing us <e> <s> he is indeed quite right that my noble friend lord mackie of benshie will be dealing with this most important proposition

excellent debate when it takes place <e> <s> however i have to say that many of us regret that scottish business on important matters of this kind has to be taken on a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord rightly refers to the french air traffic controllers strike last weekend which caused chaos <e> <s> is he aware of reports that immigration officers at gatwick airport are now causing difficulties on this side of the channel and has he any comments to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detract from anything that the noble lord lord renton said in the latter part of his speech and i hope that the government front bench listened most carefully <e> <s> however i wish to pick up something that he said early in his speech namely that this house does not have the right to ask the commons to think again and again <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to clear up a point <e> <s> is the noble baroness saying that it is the governments view that spending on research and development is not a form of investment <e> <s> if that view applies to agriculture can she say whether it also applies to industry <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not accept that there are great environmental questions to be taken into account in this matter and it is not merely a question of commerce holidays and trade <e> <s> the environmental impact of extra runway capacity has to be considered not only now but way into the future <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to the noble baroness does she not recall that the question referred to agricultural investment <e> <s> those were the precise words used in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot let this moment go without congratulating the noble lord on his accession to the front bench <e> <s> i hope that he has the same freedom of expression that he has had from the back benches <e> <s> but we wish him well in his new role <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the last remark of the noble baroness it was not those on this side of the house who removed the noble baroness lady hooper from the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may join the two noble lords in the thanks that they have expressed to the staff in all parts of the house <e> <s> indeed the number of people who during the nights before and after the transport strikes have been sleeping within the building have given service beyond the call of duty <e> <s> in that category we must also remember members of the chief whips own staff to whom we are grateful <e> <s> we are grateful to the chief whip for his benign and cheerful countenance

that is not what we are arguing about <e> <s> it has been agreed on all sides that there are authorities which are not tackling this problem as well as they should <e> <s> there are certainly authorities which find the issue extremely difficult however hard they try <e> <s> but the question at the root of this amendment is whether the responsibility for that should be put on to the rest of

of that on to the tenants who are paying their proper share of housing costs <e> <s> that is what the government are seeking to do by their amendment <e> <s> they are seeking to make people who are in no way responsible for the inefficiency of the councils we are talking about responsible for the cost of that inefficiency <e> <s> that is the injustice <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble

here <e> <s> can the minister tell us where palau is <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble viscount aware that when orders come before this house it is too late because we have no way of amending or rejecting orders <e> <s> therefore before the order comes before this house i ask the noble viscount to examine two aspects first the safety angle in relation to shipping and secondly the dangers of over-fishing particularly in the seas around cornwall if this order goes through <e> <s> we should be most grateful if the noble viscount could apply <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that if members of your lordships house attempted to amend such an order or indeed to vote against it the noble lord lord boyd carpenter would be one of the first to bound to his feet to inform us of the

stage and i believe that the noble baroness has gone out of her way to find ways of dealing with the criticism that was offered on that occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if the noble lord were to answer the question which the noble lord lord hatch has put <e> <s> he was asked a specific question <e> <s> if he does not have the answer should he not admit that and offer to write to the noble lord later in accordance with normal procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that slightly confusing answer <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount will be aware of an

have escalators working today when as the noble lord said earlier there are cheap fares being offered to senior citizens on british rail <e> <s> will the noble viscount please take on board the feeling of the house which is looking at this matter seriously <e> <s> will he try to obtain a rather better improvement than per cent <e> <s> when we come round to this question in three months time

noble lord assist us and tell us which particular issue has brought the cameras into this chamber for the first time since the recess <e> <s> could it be something like passenger and goods vehicles recording equipment regulations or indeed the important matters contained in the children bill or could it perhaps be this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount for introducing the regulations so comprehensively <e> <s> during question time today i was moved to suggest that the cam eras were in the chamber for the purpose of listening to this important debate <e>

speech that i had intended to deliver <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to add the voice of noble lords on these benches to the plea made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition <e> <s> it seems to us that the middle day is very crowded <e> <s> also now that the subject of the environment has been added to the debate on the economy on the third day that day too has become seriously overcrowded <e> <s> surely a full day should be available for discussion of the economy and related subjects <e> <s> all the departmental briefs apart from foreign affairs and defence have been crowded on to the middle day which seems an excessive amount of work to get through in one day <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord use his offices with his right honourable friend to suggest to him that if it is his intention to publish a white paper then he should do so tomorrow before the house rises so that there can be an opportunity for some discussion before such matters are introduced into a bill next wednesday if that is also the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the amendment of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> i wish to deal with one or two points which have already been raised <e> <s> this is allegedly an acceptable compromise although we have heard the noble lord lord stanley of alderley say that not everybody is satisfied with it <e>", "<cs> my lords

government are being seriously misrepresented <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must ask the noble lord whether he will specifically deny the allegations that were made in the quotations that i read out <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps may join in those thanks to the noble lord the leader of the house <e> <s> on behalf of leaders and whips generally i should like to express our sorrow to those people who have been inconvenienced by a decision which <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the delay in this matter is causing chaos on our urban roads <e> <s> the

the legislative programme which could be <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the lunchtime papers today it appears that the government of vietnam have announced that they will refuse to accept back refugees who have been forcibly repatriated <e> <s> have the government any comment on that report <e>", "<cs> my lords we now come to the wind-up period of this debate <e> <s> i wish to comment on two of the items that have been mentioned although i shall come to one or two others later <e> <s> i was amused to hear a rather inadvertent slip by the noble lord lord nelson of stafford when he referred to the prime minister as his noble friend <e> <s> i wonder whether he knows something about events in another place tomorrow that we do not know and if so perhaps he would like to communicate that to sir anthony meyer who might be quite pleased to hear it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble viscount but it does not seem to answer the question on security of supply if i may say so <e> <s> questions are being asked on all sides as to when the lights are going to go out <e> <s> are the government assured that in the new circumstances there will not be as we accept over-capacity but that there may well be under-capacity <e> <s> what mechanism is there for ensuring that that happens in the new situation <e> <s> that point was made by the noble lords lord peyton of yeovil and lord stoddart of swindon <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it would be in the interests of this country if the teaching of english were more widespread in eastern europe <e> <s> is he also aware that the bbc world service is carrying out valiant work in that direction <e> <s> can he say whether the government are satisfied that sufficient resources are available to make sure that english rather than german becomes the second language in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords on these benches we also thank the noble earl for repeating the tatement made in another place <e> <s> i have one or two questions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble earl but he must have misunderstood me <e> <s> i was not suggesting that it was a cost-cutting exercise <e> <s> i suggested that it would cost more because the contractors would have to respond to market forces <e> <s> i was asking the minister about the increased costs not the decreased costs <e>", "<cs> my lords why should the tenants who are living up to their obligations and paying on time have to bear the full cost of the defaulters <e> <s> the government have never yet answered that question <e>", "<cs> my lords some noble lords are a little confused about the two answers given by the minister to my noble friend <e> <s> he said in the first place that negotiations were continuing with the vietnamese government <e> <s> he then said that the vietnamese government had not moved from their position of refusing to accept forcibly repatriated refugees <e> <s> the second question my noble friend asked was in that case what contingency plans do the government have <e> <s> can he answer that question now <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers reply to my noble friends

have been offered this afternoon to the noble lord lord shepherd his colleagues the clerks and so on but i warmly second everything that has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister quote any instance this afternoon or this evening when anyone in this house has suggested that kind of central planning <e> <s> have we not all said that there must be some intervention but that market forces must also be allowed to play their part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but could the noble viscount tell us how much the government are investing in the channel tunnel <e>", "<cs> the answer is nothing my lords <e> <s> that was the whole point of section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the noble viscount for repeating the statement in this house <e> <s> i find it a somewhat mind-boggling task to address myself to a complex statement at such short notice <e> <s> i shall not repeat the points that the noble lord lord underhill has made <e> <s> however i am a little worried about some of the language in the statement which appears to suggest that there are plans to transform public transport in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may just indulge myself for a second and ask for clarification on the answer the noble viscount gave on the additional rail link <e> <s> will it be an underground link and part of the underground system or will it be a british rail link <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps people in this house would prefer to have the hospital in our back yard rather than several miles away <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the calculations that the government assert about rail fares what are their expectations of the increase in rail fares particularly for commuters in the south east of england <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware how pleased we are on these benches to see all the green plants on the government back benches flourishing at this time of year <e>", "<cs> it is entirely the noble lords choice as to whether the grouping is accepted <e> <s> should he wish to move the amendments separately i am sure that the committee would not stand in his way <e>", "<cs> from these benches we support the general tenor of what has been said from the cross benches and the government back benches <e> <s> this subsection seems extremely wide <e> <s> the reasons for objecting to it have been put very clearly <e>", "<cs> we seem to have touched the spot with the amendment <e> <s> when we have such a vigorous response from noble lords on the government back benches who tend to be interested in the producers rather than the consumers interest i feel that i may be getting close to the point <e>", "<cs> i did not say the government front bench <e> <s> i absolved it on this occasion <e>", "<cs> i agree with what the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes has said <e> <s> although in general terms clause deals with obstruction of a person acting in the execution of his duty clause talks about people furnishing false or misleading information and recklessly furnishing false and misleading information <e> <s> it does not say much about withholding information or material <e> <s> it seems to me that the provision could do with a little strengthening at that stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord lord dunleath on what he said <e> <s> he has covered a broad spectrum and if that is theology well then it is theology that i greatly enjoy <e> <s> i shall not follow him down the highways and byways of the irish dimension but what he said has my sympathy especially in relation to the stranraer night sleeper <e> <s> it is scandalous that such a useful service should be scrapped <e>", "<cs> my lords i always know when i am about to speak because they turn down the lights in the chamber <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that reply <e> <s> there may be some confusion <e> <s> people are frightfully worried about lists <e> <s> there is no reference to lists in this provision <e> <s> i had in mind that some notice would be posted on the premises to which reference was made and that notice would say we are minded to grant a licence to do such-and-such on these premises <e> <s> that happens in planning consents and so on <e> <s> rather than the keeping of a great register this was simply a method of letting people who live over the garden wall know what is going on in the premises if there is some significant change in the products that are being produced on those premises <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble baroness <e>

<e>", "<cs> perhaps i can assist in this matter <e> <s> i think that the problem here is that although it might be useful to group together all the noble earls amendments nevertheless they impinge on other peoples amendments with which they are also grouped <e> <s> i feel that it would be proper for the committee to deal with the amendments in the groupings that exist on the list in order that other peoples amendments which touch on similar subjects can be dealt with at the right time <e> <s> i believe that we have to proceed along the lines suggested by the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble earl would now wish to speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which is in his name <e>", "<cs> it is christmas twice on the same day <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> i had a check list of matters that i had not mentioned <e> <s> i am glad to say that virtually all have been mentioned <e> <s> one of them was the horne report which i left deliberately because i had assumed that the noble lord lord underhill would deal with it <e> <s> i

minister be good enough to inform the house how many of the people taking up these bursaries are women <e> <s> i ask that because as the noble baroness will know there is a shortage of science teachers in girls schools and this leads to a difficult situation in producing sufficient women graduates in the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister include among those he accuses of knee-jerk reactions president bush <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be appropriate for your lordships to congratulate the noble lord lord mason of barnsley on the progress that he has made on this important matter <e> <s> as a result of his having brought the matter before your lordships house it is now to be dealt with by the government <e> <s> the noble lord is greatly to be congratulated <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> his advice is bound to be far better than mine on these matters <e> <s> nevertheless i hope that he will reconsider this matter and consider the words overall control because they could be considered in certain circumstances to apply to someone who is remote from what i have described as the front office <e> <s> i hope that when the wording of the regulations is drafted that point will be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we all accept that that is his purpose <e> <s> however i am still slightly worried that large organisations may need that purpose spelling out to them <e> <s> no doubt the words that the noble and learned lord has uttered today will spell it out for them <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> when i sat down some minutes ago having moved what i had thought was a simple amendment i expected to be on my feet withdrawing it within two or three minutes <e> <s> talking of conflicts of interest when i see the noble lord lord evans of claughton next week i shall suggest that there may be a conflict of interest as regards all the houses that he has conveyed for me in saddling me with this amendment this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to facilitate the movement of air traffic are the government re-examining the use by the ministry of defence of air space particularly up the east coast <e> <s> if some of that space were handed over to civil aviation would not considerable relief be given to air traffic

from some of the earlier questions does the noble viscount agree that it is foolish to clamp cars that have overstayed on parking meters thus removing from use that parking place until the clamp is removed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that part of the answer to the question of the noble lord lord mowbray and stourton is that the lighting was discontinued because of damage caused to the friezes by the replacement of lights <e> <s> this matter was discussed fairly recently by one of your lordships committees <e> <s> further is he aware that the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister saying that the government give the subject low parliamentary priority <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will excuse me interrupting i must say that the noble baroness is entirely out of

the noble baroness for some glimmer of hope in her reply <e> <s> having been weaned on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am more than grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> she has not only taken note of the amendment which i and other noble lords moved in committee but she has taken note of the intention of the amendment which is probably more important <e> <s> in doing so she has widened the scope of the amendment <e> <s> i recognise that its scope is narrowed in the sense that the matter is now entirely in the hands of the minister but i cannot believe that any minister of any administration now or in the future would possibly conceal from the public the kind of information which we are discussing <e> <s> to do so would be foolish and not in his or her interest let alone the publics interest <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has produced an elegant solution to the problem <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords nothing is more flattering than to have ones own amendment regurgitated from the government front bench <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble baroness for bringing forward this amendment in her name and i can do nothing but support her <e>", "<cs> my lords it is easy to see that this is a debate on transport the house has emptied the lights are down and the television cameras are not switched on because people are not interested in important matters like transport but in other matters elsewhere <e> <s> nevertheless those of us who are interested in transport are extremely grateful to the noble lord lord nugent of guildford for asking this unstarred question <e> <s> apart from anything else it gives us the chance to listen to the noble lord lord underhill on the subject of the home report a subject on which we have been longing to hear him speak for quite a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell the house what the government expect to be the likely effect on the rate of inflation of the increase in the mortgage rate

discussing certain amendments with the noble baroness i found myself confronted with an entirely female team of assistants and officials <e> <s> this potential sixsome is formidable indeed <e> <s> nevertheless they were a group of people prepared to listen to what was said to them and to agree where they felt it was possible to agree and to bring back amendments in the name of the government for which i am extremely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords dare the noble lord bring to his lips the name of the conservative prime minister who brought us into europe <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord underhill i should like to thank the minister for introducing the bill <e> <s> i stated on an earlier occasion in your lordships house that at party conferences this year the caa were good enough to bring a display which i found extremely impressive and totally confusing <e> <s> it gave some conception of the kind of problems that an air traffic controller would experience in dealing with the area around london <e> <s> blips appeared on the screen to indicate the amount of traffic that they had to deal with during the cycle of a days operations <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale who should have had a two-and-a-half hour debate on this matter some time ago but he moved that off the agenda <e> <s> he was not exactly pressed to do so but on the balance of the argument it was felt that because there was a similar debate in that period it would be wise to move it to another day <e> <s> this has been the first opportunity for him to raise this very important matter <e> <s> it is a pity that it is so late but i assure the noble lord that because this is a transport debate there would have been no more speakers had it been earlier in the day <e>", "<cs> my lords that just shows how careful one has to be with the terms one uses when dealing with this subject <e> <s> she is hoping to be a rehabilitation officer for the blind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount for giving way <e> <s> in that cost evaluation how far has consideration been given to <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord the chief whip will excuse me if i say that his last remarks are not particularly helpful to achieving a sensible arrangement in the circumstances <e> <s> we all understand that the pigeons which produce documents from pigeonholes at the other end of the building have somehow gone lame and are taking rather longer than normal to bring the bill forward for first reading in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how pleased we are to see the bill finally arrive here with that one-footed pigeon that has been on its way since the day before yesterday <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will now give the bill a first reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in that case which is <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords on all sides of the house will be grateful for that assurance of improved services on the london underground <e> <s> it may come as a surprise to them <e> <s> does the recent statement that the intention of increasing fares was to reduce the number of passengers on the london <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the government consider that fare increases of this size are inflationary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that illumination <e> <s> will the minister confirm however that these stamps cannot be used for postage into europe or other parts of the world as they have no value on them <e> <s> is that the case <e> <s> if so why are people not informed of that when buying the stamps <e>", "<cs> did they my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may lead the noble lord back to the subject of the question on the order paper <e> <s> is it not surprising that the post office has taken this decision to issue stamps which are not valid in overseas territories <e> <s> is it not alarming that in good conscience people in this country may stamp letters and find them surcharged on arrival at <e>", "<cs> my lords we also are most grateful to the minister for making this statement <e> <s> it is very right and proper that this house should express its total abhorrence of what happened in iraq over the weekend <e> <s> i am grateful that the minister explained so clearly what has been done by the prime minister and the foreign office and also our allies and friends in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount told us that the rate of increase in the number of passengers is slowing down <e> <s> is he aware that that is not surprising since there is no more room to get additional passengers on to the trains <e> <s> does he agree that what is necessary is investment in new rolling stock with doors on trains which open automatically and better motors that allow the trains to accelerate more quickly so that we can get more trains on to the existing track and attract more customers into the trains and off the roads <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl saying to the house that the government do not want people to buy premium bonds <e> <s> if that is the position perhaps he would say so in simple words that the public can understand rather than kidding them into buying things which are a very bad buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with the feeling that i ought to change my tailor <e>", "<cs> my lords we also are grateful to the minister for repeating the statement <e> <s> let us just recall what has happened <e> <s> a journalist travelling on british documents sought in the course of his job to find out the truth about an incident in which people are alleged to have been killed in an explosion <e> <s> the evil regime of saddam hussein did not want the truth about that to come out so it murdered the journalist and locked up his acting chauffeuse <e>", "<cs> can the noble lord tell us what the system is that is contained in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take the time to answer the last question by the noble lord lord stallard <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister seriously trying to tell the house that the retail prices index is the only measure of

improved <e> <s> as the noble lord lord gainford has suggested would it not be wise for the government to encourage british rail to electrify this line in order to obtain the greatest possible benefit

my lords i hope the noble earl will forgive me for interrupting but is he saying that it is not necessary for the representatives from the rest of the united kingdom to represent the views of all the people <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister said that the system was introduced in northern ireland because it was able to represent the views of all the people <e> <s> is he saying that it is not necessary to represent the views of all the people when it comes to the rest of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble viscount does he not consider that the question refers to wider issues than the answers that he has given indicate <e> <s> does not the question refer <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is unable to produce any better answers and if at some time during the darkness of night he hears a swish will he take care not to nod his head too hard <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that there are about plants in different parts of the world

co-operate with the non-proliferation discussions currently taking place in geneva <e>", "<cs> my lords is that not an explanation of why the orthodox christmas is different from our christmas in that

answer to the question put to the minister by his noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble baroness lady masham to which an answer was given relating to zoo animals has the ministry taken any steps to ensure that there is no danger of transmission into herds of deer for producing venison <e>", "<cs> my lords if the disease has affected antelopes what is to stop it affecting deer <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble lord is in such a self-congratulatory mood perhaps he will also extend his congratulations to his noble friend lord cockfield on the work he carried out towards the implementation of the single market when he was a commissioner in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will not be surprised to find that he obtains general approval for the bill from all around the house today <e> <s> that was the case in another place <e> <s> no one in his right mind would stand in the way of legislation which was properly designed to reduce the fear of terrorism whether in the air on land or on the sea <e> <s> the bill goes some considerable way to tightening up the existing legislation <e> <s> in passing i should say that it is good to see

the minister for giving way <e> <s> i accept what he said about airports <e> <s> is he saying that the same provisions will apply to ports and harbours <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is

opposition regarding the number of people who have been able to return to their homes <e> <s> my understanding perhaps the noble lord will correct me if i am wrong is that only per cent <e> <s> of people are as yet back in their homes <e> <s> is he further aware that difficulties are arising for those people who are only partly covered by insurance <e> <s> those who are not covered by insurance appear to be able to obtain money from the local authorities while those who are partly but not fully covered are unable to obtain anything <e> <s> will he comment on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will not pursue that line <e> <s> the government have made a promise to the house and through apparent inadvertence i hope rather than conspiracy are unable to bring an amendment forward <e> <s> i hope the noble lord is not suggesting that the government should hide behind that inadvertence in order to fail to meet a promise to this house <e> <s> the problem is not to do with the bill but with propriety in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount clarify a point which arose from the question of the noble earl lord lauderdale regarding the split between oil and gas <e> <s> as i understand the situation most of the gas comes from the southern north sea <e> <s> if the majority of investment goes there how can there be a massive increase of jobs in scotland <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the amendment <e> <s> i thought the phrase the presumption of openness was the important part of what the noble lord said <e> <s> it is easy to hide behind regulations of one sort or another and eventually it is not good for the health service the patients or anybody else to be more restrictive than is absolutely necessary in the interests of confidentiality for the individual person <e> <s> there are obviously occasions when that is necessary but in general terms we should come down on the side of openness <e> <s> i believe that the

underhill faces <e> <s> we have considerable sympathy for his position <e> <s> however it is true to say that had we come before this chamber without specifying which electoral system we wished to see
