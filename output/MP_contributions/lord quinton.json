["<cs> my lords in my anxiety to conform my behaviour to the customs and conventions of your lordships house i thought it best in the interests of unprovocativeness to move in accordance with the promptings of an academic <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking lord seebohm for raising this topic for our general discussion i want first to apologise to him for having no special expertise of the kind that many previous speakers have displayed in the subject although it is one that i have thought about and one that in its scope and generality seems to me to be very proper for us to discuss here <e> <s> i must also apologise to your lordships for the fact that i may have to leave before the debate is terminated <e>", "<cs> my lords it is late in the day and there is much more to be discussed in other debates so i shall not go on at any great length <e> <s> i also feel a considerable unfitness because other noble lords have exhibited a great deal of technical expertise and knowledge <e> <s> i have a little paper of statistics but i may be too ashamed to refer to it very much <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that it is not always outside forces that introduce scenes of disorder when unpopular speakers come on university ground but that in my university recently the university students union which is financed by a ministry of a parliamentary system of government blanketed the university with little orange notices inciting the general university population to take part in a demonstration <e> <s> i shall not say that they invited acts of violence but they definitely incited people to demonstrate not to attend a meeting and engage in dispute or debate but to operate in such a way as to prevent the communication of ideas <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to pay tribute to the right reverend prelate the bishop of <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the noble lord lord swann in welcoming the report which seems to have a number of most estimable qualities <e> <s> it is extremely well written which is always a desirable feature in a report on an educationally sensitive matter <e> <s> the handling of the adverb only is quite admirable throughout <e> <s> it is also an extremely good-natured report in that it alludes to two traditional criticisms of the ugc and broadly and i am sure correctly rejects them as without substance <e>", "<cs> my lords in yesterdays edition of <e>", "<cs> in supporting the amendment put forward by my noble friend lord mottistone i declare an interest because i am chairman of the board of the organisation which at the distributing end is at present most elaborately involved in making copies of commercial and other periodical material for distribution to interested persons namely the british library <e>", "<cs> my lords for anyone like myself at a very remote distance from the professional frontline on this subject there is a more than usual danger that one will be saying things that are already totally out of date <e> <s> it is for this reason as part of my gratitude to the noble lord lord kilmarnock for introducing the subject that i welcomed the emphasis in the early part of his remarks on the need for both a continuous flow of up-to-date information about what is going on in view of the horrific statistical gradients that the dotted lines of prediction place before us and which to some extent in africa seem to be being realised and his recommendation of some central body to be a pool of information <e> <s> after all this problem has only been clearly identified for less than a decade even if the virus was already present in people for some considerable time before that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that some of the trouble lying behind the question of my noble friend lord st john is generated by peculiarities in the nomenclature with regard to the design <e> <s> it is a little like the situation in when the russian fleet sailed to japan under the title of the second pacific squadron when it was all a workable part of the russian fleet <e> <s> i hope that it is not a precedent for future developments of the library <e> <s> the point is that there are three main stages in the original plan <e>", "<cs> my lords i am asking the noble baroness a question <e> <s> does she realise that the stages are named in such a way that it appears much has been extinguished when in fact little has <e>", "<cs> i should like to state a case exactly opposite to that presented by the noble lord lord grimond for not having an academic majority on the proposed universities funding council <e> <s> i feel that experience shows that where one has some specifically interested group dealing with government through a body principally composed of representatives of that interest the representatives inevitably have to serve that interest <e> <s> with the best will in the world they cannot return to those institutions which in some sense they represent and say we have taken part in an important decision by the central body which is going to catch a number of peoples fingers in the door around here <e> <s> inevitably they have to operate as delegates <e>", "<cs> my lords might it be a good idea to incorporate a photograph in the badge of the disabled person to whom the badge is awarded <e> <s> a person who is in a position to ascertain whether or not the badge is being correctly used will be able to do so at a glance <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i shall not try the patience of your lordships house if i begin my few remarks with a short personal recollection <e> <s> some years ago when driving through the recently reconstructed bullring area of birmingham that area was not particularly familiar to me anyway i found myself faltering in deciding which way to go <e> <s> i was amazed when a policeman came up to me and addressed me in the local dialect <e> <s> although i was not able to interpret precisely what he said his message was clear enough <e> <s> it was that i should get a move on <e> <s> that was an extraordinary experience as i do not think it had ever happened to me before when driving in england <e> <s> usually every influence that is brought to bear on a driver is directed towards slowing him down <e>", "<cs> as a veteran of the peacock committee it seems to me right that someone should oppose the amendment <e> <s> i have three reasons for doing so although in the manner of issues of this nature they tend to run into one another <e>"]
