["<cs> my lords there must be many in this chamber and elsewhere who would deem it quite impossible for a large group of bishops to agree unanimously about any subject <e> <s> recently we had a meeting of most of the anglican bishops of england scotland and wales as a result of which on their behalf the archbishop wrote to the secretary of state on this subject <e> <s> they said <e>", "<cs> my lords the privilege falls to me of being the first to congratulate the noble duke the duke of abercorn on his maiden speech and to thank him for it <e> <s> if that is an example of the quality of his speeches we look forward very much to hearing him again in the future and we welcome him to this house <e> <s> may i also express gratitude to the noble lord lord dunleath for asking this question and also for the thought-provoking speech he made in introducing it <e> <s> i have also to offer apologies to him and to your lordships house in that i shall have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> it is all saints day and i have an engagement elsewhere <e> <s> i think your lordships may take comfort in the knowledge that all saints comprises both catholics and protestants <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that it was felt by some in northern ireland that the pope had this effect <e> <s> it was not my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a growing convergence among the churches on this subject <e> <s> the british council of churches which incorporates all the major churches except the roman church and many smaller churches have a policy that there should be a fixed easter <e> <s> is he aware that the roman catholic church has itself accepted in principle that this should be so <e> <s> this leaves the orthodox churches of the east the patriarchates and there i think the picture is very different i think there would be considerable difficulty there in a change of this sort <e> <s> in any case it would be necessary that the patriarchates should meet together in holy synod in order to approve a matter which they see as extremely important <e> <s> is the minister aware that the patriarchates have been waiting for such a synod for years <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i make apology to the house because by reason of other <e>", "<cs> my lords we all i am sure feel this deep concern for the four people mentioned in the noble baronesss question <e> <s> but may i ask the noble minister the foreign secretary a further question about the harassment and detention of other members of the episcopal church and of other christians in iran who are iranian citizens <e> <s> they also are of deep concern to us <e> <s> could the foreign secretary inform us whether these matters were discussed when an iranian delegation recently visited this country and what transpired as the effect of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express my gratitude to the noble lord lord hatch of lusby for putting down this question and for the impressive expertise he brought to it <e> <s> i claim no such expertise myself <e> <s> i have been to southern africa on two occasions for several months and have many contacts there <e> <s> but i want to bring this evening some of the views of a delegation of the british council of churches which a month or two ago went to namibia <e> <s> it was led by the bishop of manchester stanley booth-clibborn <e> <s> he was accompanied by an ex-moderator of the united reformed church and a provincial superior of the congregation of notre dame who of course is roman catholic and also a minister of the church of scotland which has such an impressive record in its work in africa <e> <s> so i think it is an impressive group <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already extended to the noble lord lord shaughnessy on his outstanding speech and on his manifest fairness in presenting his evidence to us <e> <s> i was additionally grateful to him for his passage of french which almost persuaded me that i had ability in the language <e> <s> i should also like to make my apology to the house and to the noble lord the foreign secretary since i shall have to withdraw before the end of the debate <e> <s> we have a long list of speakers and it seems that so far most of them have adopted a system of brevity which i hope i shall be able to emulate <e> <s> but any brevity should not reflect a lack of concern on my part and on the part of those others who occupy these benches when we consider the evidence which has been put to us in various ways concerning the situation of the aboriginal peoples in canada <e> <s> we are deeply concerned for them i realise that the whole house is concerned for them <e> <s> i have no skill with which to present constitutional or intricate legal matters <e> <s> we have a desire that anything possible should be done in order that the bill may pass quickly and that sonic of our doubts may be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords being a bishop in the church is a bit like working for a trans-national corporation <e> <s> you have the opportunity of getting around and seeing events through the eyes of your brother church leaders in other parts of the world <e> <s> nevertheless i find myself in these debates on northern ireland always acutely conscious of the fact that i shall be followed by three former prime ministers of that province my credentials to speak are these <e> <s> for the past six years i have been meeting regularly with representatives of the principal churches in ireland <e> <s> alas <e> <s> except on particular occasions these meetings have not included roman catholics <e> <s> the meetings have given me a sobering insight into the depth of the historic divisions which still set catholic and protestant over against each other <e> <s> they have also offered a glimpse of the really heartening initiatives which are taken to bridge those divides by couragous pioneers for peace on both sides of the divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble lord lord wells-pestell for bringing this matter before us again <e> <s> it is obviously a subject upon which we need constantly to be reminded <e> <s> there are still too many who regard disabled people as being a race apart <e> <s> i was going to use the illustration of the sugar as the noble lord has already done nevertheless i forgive him and i apologise to him that i cannot remain for the whole of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to have the privilege of congratulating the noble marquess lord reading on the incisive and important speech which he has just made <e> <s> i am sure we look forward to hearing him very often in this house <e> <s> as we have heard very many welcome this report which represents the desire of public policy makers to consider the implications of the developments of new technologies for ethics for law and for social position <e> <s> some of these matters are well established <e> <s> the development of research which has led to the successful use of <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harris of greenwich has outlined the tragic situation which faces us today in the field of drug addiction <e> <s> that is of some interest to me and my fellow workers in the diocese of chelmsford because hackney is the only place to which we can send people <e> <s> it looks as though that will be cut back and will not be able to take anybody from the county of essex which is a large county as many well know <e>", "<cs> i see my lords <e> <s> my case stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are greatly indebted to the noble lord lord rodney for proposing his motion calling attention to the effect of pseudo-religious cults on family life and young people <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly welcome the debate and am grateful to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for introducing it <e> <s> we are also greatly indebted to noble lords who have already spoken in the debate from great experience and commitment to this field <e>", "<cs> my lords a number of debates have been held in your lordships house in recent years about the prison service and custodial sentencing <e> <s> each time we are faced with fundamental questions as to what prisons are for how we value people who are imprisoned and what our grossly overcrowded prisons say about the state of british society and its legal system <e> <s> this debate <e>"]
