["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his reply and the implied assurance that this matter will receive serious consideration may i ask him whether the government will bear in mind that while everyone recognises the democratic right of assembly that is to say the right to hold public meetings indoors and outdoors there are very many people who do not accept that this necessarily includes the right to organise mass marches through our towns the right to hold up all traffic the right to prevent other citizens from going about their lawful business and perhaps most <e>", "<cs> my lords while recognising the difficulties to which reference has been made in particular the point raised by the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and the obvious difficulty of discriminating between one type of march and another can my noble friend assure us that the possibility i am not asking more than that of restricting marches of a political and demonstration nature will be seriously considered in the course of the governments examination of the problems of law and order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a few words on this subject <e> <s> first i think we all recognise the tremendous difficulties which confront the governor and that it is not possible to please everybody <e> <s> i think we ought to congratulate him on the success he has had so far although there are still difficulties which need to be resolved <e> <s> i should like to support what both lord goronwy-roberts and lord gladwyn have said about the presence of south african troops in rhodesia <e> <s> i think that if the governor is going to be able as i hope he will be rigidly and strictly to enforce the arrangements which have been agreed at lancaster house then he must be in a position to say that so far as he is concerned all the conditions which it is in his power to implement have been implemented <e> <s> i therefore hope that in one way or another it will be possible to ensure the security of the bridge without having to rely further upon south african troops <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also interrupt for one moment <e> <s> the noble lord said he hoped that the detainees detained by mr mugabes supporters would be released surely the government can do more than express a hope <e> <s> surely they are now going to insist that the lancaster house agreement is implemented on all sides and make it a condition that those who do not will not be allowed to take part in the election <e> <s> otherwise it is a farce <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that many people feel that insufficient attention is being given to civil defence <e> <s> can we be assured that the government recognise that the effectiveness of civil defence is a most important factor which a potential aggressor will take into account in assessing the credibility of western defence <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister before he sits down refer to the provision of air raid shelters which he has not mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the question of the noble lord lord shinwell may i ask whether the minister agrees that it is really highly disgraceful and frustrating that after so much lip service has been paid to the principle of standardisation of inter-operability so little progress has been made <e> <s> will her majestys government consider really giving a lead to the other countries in nato to work out a longterm policy <e> <s> the question refers to the next generation of tanks but it may well be the next generation but one that we must consider since research and development start a long time ahead <e> <s> we really must make up our minds to press our allies to work out a long-term programme which will cover not only tanks but as has been said the whole range of weapons required for the alliance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad that the noble earl lord grey has raised this issue <e> <s> i wholeheartedly agree with him and other noble lords about the importance of this issue and the seriousness of the consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords do her majestys government recognise that the majority of the member states of the community will undoubtedly ask <e>", "<cs> my lords those who have tabled this amendment consider that if an employee refuses to join a trade union on the ground that it is affiliated to a political party with which he disagrees and that it as a result he is deprived of his job he should be entitled to claim compensation for unfair dismissal <e> <s> the law as it now stands does not provide that protection and its failure to do so is regarded by the european commission of human rights as constituting a breach of the obligations accepted by britain under the human rights convention <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that is the issue <e> <s> the issue is what do these words mean <e>", "<cs> my lords it is of course quite impossible in a single debate to discuss adequately the vast range of subjects which are dealt with in this voluminous bill whose long title after the recent correction now runs to lines <e> <s> there are many provisions of the bill about which i should like to speak but in order not to take up too much of your lordships time i propose to confine my remarks to two specific points to which i attach much importance <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> why does he say might that before passing such a resolution the planning authority might publish a notice and might consider any objections <e> <s> it says here quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> is a letter different from a circular <e> <s> i do not quite know the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank my noble friend for the assurance he has given <e> <s> naturally i should have preferred him to have accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister and the government always bear in mind that the credibility of our deterrent forces is greatly affected by the visible adequacy of our civil defence preparations <e>", "<cs> my lords while it is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of some of the criticisms that have been made does my noble friend the foreign secretary appreciate how greatly all realistic people welcome the recognition by the two governments that the dangers to the safety of the nato countries extend beyond the nato area and that closest co-operation with a view to necessary action outside that area is very necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to make clear whether or not he supports the policy of his party to withdraw from the community <e>", "<cs> sitting on the fence <e>", "<cs> my lords while i fully support the decision to introduce the trident missile i should like to ask whether the government recognise that the credibility of our nuclear deterrent would be greatly strengthened if it can be seen that we are making very substantial efforts in regard to civil defence <e>", "<cs> my lords is not this an unrealistic proposal and would it not be seen by the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble viscount agree that whatever arguments there may be about vocabulary we ought to be concentrating our attention upon securing a balance of power over the whole field and not trying all the time to draw attention to specific weapons <e> <s> it is a balance of power generally which matters <e>", "<cs> my lords will the government at all costs try to avoid switching money which is earmarked for technological advance to current costs <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the abandonment of trident would totally undermine the credibility of britains nuclear deterrent <e> <s> is it not also a fact that the development of our first nuclear weapon was initiated by the party opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords if her majestys government were to follow the advice of the noble lord lord soper i think we could say goodbye to any prospect of securing the liberation of our fellow countrymen in the falkland islands <e> <s> the situation is far too serious to waste time discussing whether or not the government should have acted sooner <e> <s> i think that my noble friend the foreign secretary has explained the difficulties of the situation and not only the obscurity of the position but also the dangers of exacerbating the situation and possibly of bringing on a crisis which could otherwise have been avoided through the united nations <e> <s> we ought to concentrate our minds on what needs to be done now <e>", "<cs> my lord your lordships will i believe not be surprised when i say that i do not wholly agree with everything that the noble lord lord jenkins has just said <e> <s> as i emphasised when we last debated this question i am totally convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords may i thank the noble lord for not disappointing me and for having once again as he has done in every speech that he has made in the last years referred to the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord accusing me of dishonesty <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the question reflect the state of mind of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords should we not welcome any action which strenghtens the military and defence capability of our american allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that some other countries have acceded to this convention including most of the countries of western europe and the united states of america <e> <s> considering the outstanding record of britain in the field of natural and architectural conservation is it not strange that we should decline to play our part at international level since it is likely to cost only <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister recognise that one of the basic principles of the convention is that we all accept and recognise that the heritage of the world whether natural or architectural is the joint heritage of all mankind and that we all have a part to play in trying to preserve it <e> <s> as for any benefits to us the minister said that he did not think we had anything sufficiently interesting to feature on a world list of objects which needed preserving <e> <s> i have no doubt that stonehenge would be one of the first on the whole of the list <e> <s> does he not really feel that in view of the serious criticism being expressed internationally of our failure to accede the government should give not only consideration but urgent consideration to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the motion of the noble baroness seeks to annul a special development order made by the secretary of state for the environment in respect of a planning proposal for the vauxhall cross site <e> <s> i share a number of the anxieties which the noble baroness has just expressed <e> <s> but i am advised that this house has so far never exercised its power to annul an order subject to negative resolution and i do not think that this is an issue on which it would be appropriate to set such a significant new constitutional precedent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is questionable and that there are doubts on the bench opposite <e> <s> perhaps that will deal with the point <e> <s> however i feel obliged to question whether the use of the special development order procedure is justified in a case such as this <e> <s> while the law does not specifically say so there is no doubt that when conferring these exceptional powers on the minister parliament had in mind problems of a very different kind from the one we are considering today <e> <s> these included in particular the siting of major new industrial developments <e> <s> the noble baroness has quoted the example of the windscale nuclear plant <e> <s> other purposes for which these powers were introduced included the location of new towns and the designation of national parks all of which were of more than local importance <e>", "<cs> my lords in his first reply the noble lord said that the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola was desirable i felt that remark to be rather feeble if i may say so <e> <s> i would ask the noble lord to assure us that the government recognise that the withdrawal of cuban troops from angola is an essential element in the establishment of stable conditions in southern africa <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that opinion polls are not the way to decide defence policy <e>"]
