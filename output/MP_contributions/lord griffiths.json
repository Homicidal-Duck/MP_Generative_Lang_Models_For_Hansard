["<cs> my lords i well remember the day many years ago when as a very anxious young member of the bar i faced the ordeal of first appearing before the appellate committee of your lordships house <e> <s> i was heard with tolerance sympathy and indulgence i did not deserve it <e> <s> today equally anxious and equally undeserving i can only hope that your lordships will extend to me that same benevolent tolerance <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships have had the pleasure of listening to the outstanding contribution to this debate of my noble and learned friend lord ackner in his maiden speech <e> <s> you will readily appreciate that over a period of years when i found myself against mr desmond ackner i was up very early in the morning indeed <e> <s> i should think that over the course of my career he probably owes me about six months sleep <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that all in the house would wish for an efficient legal aid system <e> <s> on the civil side it brings great benefit to the less fortunate members of society and on the criminal side it is only right that where the state chooses to accuse the state should take the responsibility of seeing that there are adequate facilities for a defence <e>", "<cs> i should have no objection to that <e> <s> however i should have to think more about the drafting <e> <s> the drafting i have just proposed is a simple deletion <e> <s> if fair remuneration were re-introduced in a phrase such as <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because if the government decline to pay what i will call fair market rates for legal aid work i fear that there will he a very serious fall in the standard of representation available to those who are currently represented under the legal aid scheme <e> <s> we are talking about civil legal aid and let us be clear what we are really talking about <e> <s> we are talking about helping plaintiffs <e> <s> not many defendants receive civil legal aid in the high court <e> <s> why not <e> <s> it is because you do not sue people who require civil legal aid as they do not have the <e>", "<cs> and that being so i cannot believe the savings are going to be very significant <e> <s> but the potential damage is tremendous and i foresee this scenario eventually possibly developing like this <e> <s> because of the poor remuneration paid to legal aid lawyers lawyers are not properly prepared to do legal aid work <e> <s> the law society and the bar worry about that fact <e> <s> what will happen <e> <s> the only alternative is the contingency fee system <e> <s> if we are not going to provide proper legal aid the only way we can help people is by a contingency fee system <e> <s> if that is introduced we shall run into all the horrific problems that they are encountering on the other side of the water <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i was president of the senate of the four inns of court and the council of the bar for the two years during which protracted negotiations over the level of fees were taking place between the lord chancellors department and representatives of the bar council and the law society <e> <s> maybe my recollection is playing me false but i am bound to say that i heard with astonishment the indictment of my noble and learned friend lord hailsham when he castigated the bodies representing solicitors and barristers for not attempting to negotiate interim payments <e>", "<cs> i gather from what was said by my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor that he was sympathetic to the idea underlying the amendment but felt that probably it was comprised within subsection d <e> <s> i believe that it is important to keep ones eyes on future recruiting particularly bearing in mind that the ultimate bench will come from tomorrows recruits <e> <s> i hope that the drafting of subsection d can be reconsidered so that that concept can be embraced within it even though it is not necessary to have this amendment in addition to paragraph d <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord ackner has already taken the cherries out of my orchard <e> <s> i support the amendment especially because i know that during negotiations with the lord chancellors department the song that was sung all the time was oh the treasury wont wear it <e> <s> if nothing can be done without specific treasury consent it is not a party to the negotiations such negotiations are impossible <e> <s> furthermore it is absolutely outrageous that the lord chancellor of england should be manacled by the treasury in administering this scheme <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment for the reasons advanced <e> <s> it is of particular importance now that the government have decided not to take advantage of the independent views of the taxing masters as they have in the past under the present arrangement <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> the regulations under discussion are the regulations by which the lord chancellor will lay down the scale of fees which are to remunerate virtually the whole of the criminal bar and that large portion of the solicitors profession which conducts civil work and a great many of those who practise in the civil field at the bar <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have great difficulty with the wording of this subsection <e> <s> i do not know what are comprised among the matters for which he is responsible under this act <e> <s> is that meant to bring in paragraphs e and f <e> <s> if not to what is it referring <e> <s> i confess that i just do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment because of the melancholy experience which i had when i was president of the senate <e> <s> i watched the deteriorating relationships between the profession and the lord chancellors department arising out of attempts to have direct negotiation between those bodies on legal aid fees <e> <s> it is very understandable <e> <s> the lord chancellors department regards itself as the keeper of the public purse and very properly so <e> <s> those who are negotiating on behalf of the professions regard it as their task within reason and what is compatible with a public position to secure as good remuneration as they can for the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords i am worried that there may be an impression abroad that judges consider it their duty to pass sentence with a total disregard for the appalling problems of overcrowding in our prisons and that somehow they regard that as someone elses problem which is no concern of theirs and should therefore have no impact on the sentence they pass <e> <s> there may also be an impression that judges somehow resent the operation of parole reducing the period of incarceration which they have considered to be appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords he said nothing more <e>", "<cs> my lords as the first of the judicial brethren to speak after the maiden speech of my noble and learned friend lord goff perhaps i may extend to him my sincere congratulations on his contribution and tell your lordships how profoundly relieved i am to find that i am speaking on the same side of the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords for three years i laboured on the civil justice review of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor <e> <s> during that period we introduced about half a dozen consultation papers <e> <s> we dared to think the unthinkable which is the function of a body undertaking a radical review <e> <s> we put into the consultation papers several suggestions which are now recognised as unthinkable <e> <s> i remember that one of them proposed that we increase the length of the judicial sitting day <e> <s> my experience today convinces me that was a most misconceived suggestion <e>", "<cs> i too am very troubled about this clause <e> <s> i support my noble friend lord allen of abbeydale in his comments both on the unfairness arising from ignoring contributory negligence and on the principle that one should offset compensation for loss of earnings against loss of earnings and not against awards for pain and suffering <e> <s> that would be the result of this clause <e> <s> however i have another rather wider concern <e> <s> under our system of compensation ultimately when one analyses it it is the public who pay the compensation <e> <s> under the present system if one is injured by the fault of another ones sources of compensation are twofold <e> <s> the first source is ones social security benefit <e> <s> the second is payments from insurance <e> <s> payments from insurance come from the public <e> <s> it is quite illusory to think that the payment for ones injury is being paid by an identified <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that if one has taken out a personal accident policy oneself that is not taken into account in diminution of any award that one receives <e> <s> at the moment it is a matter of statutory control that one must give per cent <e> <s> benefit <e> <s> however i believe that there is a real difference between the provision of an insurance policy which one decides to take out oneself using ones own money and a form of taxation which one must pay and about which one has no option <e>", "<cs> my lords i was much saddened to hear the confession of the noble lord lord hacking that in his career as a solicitor he has constantly given wrong advice <e> <s> i wish emphatically to repudiate his attribution of this lamentable development in <e>", "<cs> i rise only as a member of the civil justice review <e> <s> the passage to which my noble friend lord hacking referred reflects the view of many people that there should be a right of appeal from decisions on homelessness <e> <s> if such a right were to be given i should have thought that the county court was clearly the right place for such appeals <e>", "<cs> i find this clause entirely satisfactory as it stands in the bill <e> <s> i should like to take the opportunity to remind your lordships of the nature of the body that is responsible for making the rules of the supreme court because the noble lord lord meston referred to leaving the matter to the mercy of some rule-making committee <e> <s> in fact those responsible for the rules of the supreme court are the lord chancellor together with any four or more of the following persons the lord chief justice the master of the rolls the president of the family division the vice-chancellor three other judges of the supreme court two practising barristers one of whom has to be nominated by the chairman of the senate and inns of court of the bar and two practising solicitors <e> <s> we have a truly independent legal profession in this country and it is unthinkable that the lord chancellor would have any opportunity of choosing either the barristers or the solicitors just to appoint yes-men and make them four of the rule-making committee <e> <s> indeed the vigilance of the senate of the bar and of the law society would ensure that that could not take place <e>", "<cs> i should like to say that it never occurred to me for one monent that the designated judges could be liable for damages in any suit as a result of the exercise of their functions <e> <s> i wish to dissociate myself from any idea that this might have been implanted in order to circumscribe the judges by the executive <e> <s> i entirely repudiate any such idea but if it is felt that the protection is necessary so be it let it be stated <e>", "<cs> whichever lord of appeal in ordinary or judge of the supreme court ultimately has the awesome responsibility of chairing the committee he will need all the consumer assistance that he can get <e> <s> but who are the consumers of advocacy <e> <s> they are the unfortunate judges who are on the receiving end of it day after day <e> <s> i say in all seriousness that it is quite ridiculous that he should not have the assistance on the committee of those who are at the receiving end of advocacy who know the standards of advocacy and who know what our system of legal education produces <e> <s> there should surely be there available to assist him the presiding judge and the circuit judge suggested by my noble and learned friend lord oliver <e> <s> it is not good enough to say you can call them in and get their evidence <e> <s> one wants them there to be available to discuss matters day in day out and to help one frame the questions that should be asked <e> <s> they are absolutely essential to the proper operation of such a committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the experience of sitting as the only judicial member of a law reform committee upon which we had a majority of lay members and a lay chairman <e> <s> i speak of course of the civil justice review many of whose recommendations are now in the bill <e> <s> in that committee many legal procedures that i have accepted without question were challenged by my lay colleagues <e> <s> i was called upon to explain and to justify them if i could <e> <s> fortunately i could not always do so with the result that many improvements to our system of civil justice were proposed <e> <s> on other occasions i was able to explain the practical necessity for a particular procedure <e> <s> i believe that we all found it a thought-provoking experience and it had worthwhile results <e>"]
