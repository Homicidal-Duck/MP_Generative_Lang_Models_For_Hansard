["<cs> my lords anybody who has had as i am old-fashioned enough to believe the good fortune to spend his working life in the law either as a practitioner or as a judge must welcome any new bill affecting the work of the supreme court <e> <s> as the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said the present bill is mainly a consolidating bill <e> <s> therefore the limits of reform which can be effected within its scope are marked but the opportunity is rightly being taken to effect some improvements <e> <s> i respectfully agree with the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones that there are many more which might be effected in the administration of justice in that court <e>", "<cs> as a former trial judge i should like to intervene for one moment to express my respectful <e>", "<cs> i said not universally there are the occasional cases as i have mentioned <e>", "<cs> my noble and learned friend lord diplock has declared that he is the son of a solicitor perhaps i should begin by declaring an interest as one who is the father of a solicitor and who for perhaps half a dozen years or more has been a member of that branch of the profession which the noble lord lord mishcon has adorned for so long <e> <s> that interest being already declared none the less i am not persuaded that the amendment is one which your lordships house should accept <e>", "<cs> would my noble and learned friend allow me to intervene <e> <s> it would be completely wrong in my submission for this to be dealt with by way of an amendment to the criminal appeal act for that body only has a right of appeal against convictions or sentences <e> <s> this is in effect a disciplinary action taken by a crown court judge against a solicitor and therefore the right way should be that way in which disciplinary actions against solicitors are dealt with <e> <s> if there is to be a special provision and the noble lord lord mishcon is right there is agreement here because a solicitor is actually disciplined by a body against whom he has no right at all of appeal <e> <s> many of these matters of contempt and so on go to the civil division of the court of appeal <e> <s> saving the presence of my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls i would venture the view that this ought to go to the civil division of the court of appeal as a disciplinary matter affecting solicitors and has nothing whatever to do with the criminal division <e>", "<cs> may i say one thing about what my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones has said <e> <s> the present two-judge court in the criminal division has always had a lord justice presiding over it <e> <s> i have done so myself on a very many occasions when i was a member of the court of appeal <e> <s> one has suffered from time to time from a sense of acute frustration <e> <s> the device of the two-judge court if i may use that phrase was one started by lord parker when he was <e>", "<cs> everyone must sympathise with what the noble lord lord mishcon has said but here the public interest should prevail <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asked for a further explanation <e> <s> i am not sure that i am capable of giving one <e> <s> i was asked by the lord chief justice to move this amendment since he was unable to be here and i was assured by him that it is desired by the profession and by those who have held the office of circuit judge <e> <s> i am not sure that there is a complete analogy as between a chairman and a deputy chairman and a circuit judge and a deputy circuit judge because in the one case a deputy chairman is a person who holds a recognised office while a so-called deputy circuit judge is merely someone who temporarily has a particular status <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the hour and the number of your lordships who still wish to speak <e> <s> i shall endeavour to be as brief as i can <e> <s> may i begin where the noble baroness lady macleod left off and offer respectful congratulations to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor upon his having introduced the bill so early in this session and also to congratulate the law commission and everyone else who over these last years have worked to produce what has gone into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first thank your lordships for the most generous welcome which this report has had <e> <s> i know my colleagues have been greatly touched by the warmth of the reception <e> <s> if i may i should like to add a special word of thanks to my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for what he said on the last occasion when the matter was before the house when a government statement was made and for his very generous observations which he repeated a few moments ago <e>", "<cs> my lords a plea of justice for lawyers does not often fall on receptive ears but this afternoon that plea so eloquently reinforced by the maiden <e>", "<cs> if i may add a word or two i was a party to the decision in the house which my noble and learned friend lord elwyn-jones mentioned <e> <s> the speech of my noble and learned friend lord fraser was drafted with enormous care and thought because so much difficulty had arisen in the past particularly in the birmingham area and in relation to sikhs <e> <s> those of your lordships who recall the case may remember that the court of appeal headed by the then master of <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first join with those of your lordships who have already spoken in expressing keen anticipation of the maiden speech of the noble lord lord irvine of lairg <e> <s> unlike those of your lordships who have already spoken i claim the privilege of having listened to the noble lord on a number of occasions not let me hasten to add in this house or in another place because that would be wrong but elsewhere <e> <s> on some occasions i have been persuaded that he is right and on some occasions i am sure the fault was mine i have not been so persuaded <e> <s> but win lose or draw the noble lords arguments have always been most beautifully presented and i am sure he will be a great asset to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister must i venture to think resemble a jockey in the grand national as he starts to go round the course the <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i am afraid that i was too late to support the noble lord lord hutchinson on the last one <e> <s> all this amendment does is to give effect to what has been the home office practice as long as i can remember ever since capital punishment was abolished and i think well before that <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be mandatory on the home secretary not to send somebody back on extradition if there is the slightest chance of his being put to death on his return <e>", "<cs> i am not sure <e> <s> having listened to my noble friends lord hutchinson of lullington and lord irvine of lairg that i ought not to begin with a plea of guilty and ask for mitigation of sentence <e> <s> in point of fact i am proposing to defend this clause with all the vigour i can supported by the noble lord lord benson one of my colleagues on the fraud trial committee <e> <s> what we recommend in connection with serious fraud cases was the unanimous recommendation of us all after looking at this problem over about two years of very hard work having listened attentively to all the evidence from the criminal bar association from the criminal branch of the law society and having tried to form a balanced and unprejudiced view of what was relevant to the question of the proper trial of fraud cases <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the intervention <e> <s> i fully appreciate the point <e> <s> if he and those who support him can devise a half-way house which will meet the point which i am making which the committee was making and which falls short of the provisions in clause i for one and i am sure my noble friend lord benson would be perfectly happy <e>", "<cs> i said that that paragraph was largely a quotation from sir rupert cross <e> <s> the noble lord must have forgotten what i said <e> <s> as i am on my feet i hope that the committee will allow me just to add that the difficulty about the point that the noble lord lord gifford made and which the noble lord lord hutchinson is making is that so many documents which are created in the course of the perpetration of a fraud are not created in the course of a trade business profession or other occupation <e> <s> i can see the most eloquent submissions being made by the noble lord lord gifford that they should on that ground be excluded <e>", "<cs> i do not want to delay your lordships at this hour but like the noble lord lord mishcon i have a certain sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> indeed the only answer to it must be that it is already covered by clause <e> <s> for myself simply as a matter of construction i should be a little worried if one put these specific words into clause between paragraphs c and d <e> <s> it might cut down the generality of the provisions in clause <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a word on this as the noble earl said that this was one of our babies <e> <s> up to a limited extent it is <e> <s> i fully see and understand the fears that theoretically at least this could be misused <e> <s> the noble lords lord irvine and lord gifford may riposte to what i am about to say that i have too much faith in the exercise of judicial discretion <e> <s> i simply cannot believe that any judge in his senses would in the circumstances let in the kind of document which they envisage <e> <s> if by any mischance he did so i do not think it would take very long before the court of appeal said something rather sharp about it <e>", "<cs> may i say a word in support of clause as it stands <e> <s> speaking on this occasion perhaps as an ex-chairman of quarter sessions and an ex-magistrate there is no reason on earth why magistrates should not try these cases <e> <s> they are perfectly straightforward <e> <s> one point which i suggest has been overlooked by those who oppose this is as follows <e> <s> the desire to go for trial which used to waste so much time at quarter sessions and does still waste so much time at the crown court is to postpone the inevitable disqualification which must follow <e> <s> the longer one can hold up and delay the longer people will go on opting for trial by jury when they can <e> <s> i always regretted if i may say so with all respect to the late lord justice james and i said so to him at the time that they had made the recommendation in the form they did <e> <s> now is the chance to put it right <e>", "<cs> i desire to support this amendment with all the force that i can <e> <s> i understand that i am about to be reinforced by my noble and learned friend the lord chief justice so i will he as brief as i can <e> <s> memory plays odd tricks but my recollection is that this proposal was first put forward by the committee of lord justice james in <e> <s> unlike the dying professors advice i have not verified my references <e> <s> my recollection is that it found favour in this house but it was rejected in another place <e> <s> that may or may not be right <e> <s> the minister says that i am wrong <e> <s> i have a recollection that it was put forward and rejected <e>", "<cs> i just add as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway mentioned what i had said on second reading that i wholeheartedly support this amendment <e> <s> those of us who have either been reversed on a technicality or who have had to reverse other people on a technicality have long regretted that we have not had this power <e> <s> i respectfully agree with what the noble lord lord morton of shuna said a moment ago <e> <s> this power has existed for some years in scotland and i have always understood that it has existed with great satisfaction <e> <s> it will fill a gap which has long needed filling <e>", "<cs> i support amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> in the alternative if the government will not support that amendment i shall support amendment no <e> <s> a and i certainly support amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i do not want to postpone the amendment on which the noble earl the minister will deal with this matter as the noble lord lord wigoder suggested <e> <s> nor do i wish to postpone the main debate <e> <s> i would just say that the proposal about the right of the crown to claim stand by for jurors emanated as did the proposal to abolish peremptory challenge from the report of the fraud trials committee <e> <s> we were then dealing with and only dealing with serious fraud trials <e> <s> that is a matter the committee will wish to consider later <e>", "<cs> with profound respect to the speech of the noble lord lord mishcon i earnestly urge the committee to retain clause as part of the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones asked what evidence there was of abuse <e> <s> with all respect to the noble and learned lord i was a little surprised to hear the rhetorical question when the <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord as a former lord chancellor has much greater recent experience than i have of this matter <e> <s> i can only say that i am aware of cases where a judge has gone out of his way to see that coloured people were on the jury <e> <s> i recall one case at birmingham which occurred quite a long time ago now when i took that step <e> <s> i may or may not have been entitled to do that but i did it with unfortunate results <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say that as the controversy arose out of one of the recommendations of the fraud trial committee this is a happy solution to a difficult problem <e> <s> in making the original recommendation for the abolition of the right of stand by for the crown my colleagues and i on the fraud trial committee were moved by one consideration only namely a sense of fairness that if the right of the defence to challenge jurors was to be abolished equally the crown should be put in the same position <e>", "<cs> my lords i venture to suggest to your lordships that this amendment is to be supported and to express the hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will have second thoughts other than those which he expressed in committee <e> <s> i of course accept what my noble and learned friend lord hailsham of saint marylebone has just said <e> <s> there have been many occasions on which his department and that of his predecessors in the past has put up a valued fight with the treasury on behalf of the judges and the legal profession <e> <s> many of us in the past have been deeply grateful for <e>", "<cs> before i deal with the point which the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran mentioned last may i declare an interest <e> <s> i have for the last months or so been chairman of the appeal committee of the takeover panel <e> <s> the noble lord lord alexander of weedon as your lordships know is the chairman of the panel but he is out of the country at the moment and i have not been able to make contact with him <e> <s> however i have very little doubt that had i been able to do so or were he here he would say much more eloquently what i am about to say <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry to disappoint the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> i am afraid i am in no position to give any date at all <e> <s> whether lord boardman can i do not know <e>", "<cs> ten days ago when i spoke to an amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran i disclosed an interest <e> <s> perhaps i may disclose the same interest again because i am and i have been as i then told the committee chairman of the takeover panel appeals committee for the past months <e> <s> it is perhaps irrelevant to mention it again because holding that position has enabled me to observe the workings of the takeover panel from a <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment simply as a matter of drafting and the use of the english language <e> <s> the noble lord has pointed out the trouble that has been caused recently over careless drafting to use a neutral expression in relation to insider dealing <e> <s> without forecasting what the courts might do with this phraseology i can see that the use of the word secure here could give rise to trouble <e> <s> as the noble lord has said surely the right word to use is provide simply as a matter of the ordinary use of the english language <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the committee appreciates the motives which underlie this amendment and the other amendment to which the noble lord spoke but i hope that members of the committee will not yield to the noble lords blandishments for the following reason <e> <s> judicial review is a comparatively new creation in our legal history <e> <s> it was sir william wade who not long ago described the judges as having had a burst of judicial activity in bringing about his much-needed reform for the control of the excutive <e> <s> when order was introduced in it became plain that unless it was controlled by those judges who sat in the divisional court the then lord justice donaldson my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls took control of that divisional court in and and got the matter under control there was a grave risk of disparity of decisions developing <e> <s> it so happened that in a case in the court of appeal over which i presided in or with the present lord chief justice the then lord justice lane the question arose as to whether the chancery division should exercise jurisdiction over judicial review <e> <s> we gave a very emphatic no to that question and there were a large number of reasons for that view <e> <s> i understand from my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls that that is still the position unpopular as it was at the time <e>", "<cs> will the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor allow me to raise two matters resulting from what he has said <e> <s> those of us who have in the past tried personal injury cases my <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may support what has fallen from both my noble and learned friends who have just spoken <e> <s> in view of what has been said about the rules committee of the supreme court perhaps i should disclose an interest because for almost all my eight and a half years as a member of the court of appeal i was the court of appeal member of that committee <e> <s> no committee on which i have ever sat has been more careful or more scrupulous in ensuring that the powers conferred upon it by statute are exercised so as to secure just results from the exercise of those powers <e>", "<cs> i should like to echo the point made by my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls <e> <s> i had not spotted it until the noble lord lord hacking and the noble and learned lord the master of the rolls drew attention to it <e> <s> i have always understood that anyone can appear in an arbitration whatever their qualification <e> <s> you can have a friend from down the street you can have your neighbour <e> <s> some of us have occasionally suffered from incoherent advocates without any professional qualification appearing in arbitrations <e> <s> i am sure that my noble and learned friend the master of the rolls would agree that the provision in clause appears to be restricted <e> <s> therefore if this provision stands somebody who hitherto has been entitled to appear before an arbitration will not be entitled to do so <e> <s> like the noble and learned lord i cannot believe that that is the intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment for very much the same reasons as my noble and learned friend lord griffiths gave a few moments ago <e> <s> i venture to enjoin in what he said for this reason <e> <s> he mentioned a recent law reform committee of which he was a member as a lord of appeal in ordinary <e> <s> that committee was appointed by my noble and learned friend lord hailsham <e> <s> he also appointed the fraud trials committee about five years ago of which i was chairman <e> <s> i am not sure whether i now answer the description of my noble and learned friend lord ackner of a departed law <e>", "<cs> my lords happily the noble baroness is still with us and i hope that she will remain with us for a long time <e> <s> she can deal with the contingency to which this amendment is directed by a suitable alteration to her will and no doubt she would wish to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals raised the question of discrimination <e> <s> there is bound to be discrimination one way or the other <e> <s> either one will discriminate against the donor child or one will discriminate against those whom it was the intention of the original creator of the trust or testator to benefit <e>"]
