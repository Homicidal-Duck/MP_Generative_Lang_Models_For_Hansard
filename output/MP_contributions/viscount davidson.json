that the noble lord lord underhill was pleased with my answer <e> <s> before section could be implemented all <e>", "<cs> as far as i am aware no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the first part of a british standard on vehicle security which is being prepared with the co-operation of motor manufacturers will be published in the autumn <e> <s> it will define for the first time a performance based specification for secure locking systems <e> <s> we will also continue to urge car owners to use the security equipment available to them <e> <s> we are undertaking a wide range of publicity campaigns and the motor manufacturers will be improving the advice on car security which they give to car owners <e>", "<cs> my lords the competitiveness of the motor market makes it imperative that public demand is created <e> <s> cars with better security must be seen as more attractive than other cars <e> <s> the fact that the motor manufacturers are beginning to realise that security can be a desirable feature is illustrated by the inclusion of improved locks on the ford granada and some other models <e> <s> so far as laminated side windows are concerned this is being studied from the aspect of both security and safety <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is outside the scope of this question which is to do with security of cars and car locks <e>", "<cs> my lords miles of motorways and miles of trunk road were renewed in and we expect to renew at least miles of motorway and miles of trunk road in <e>", "<cs> my lords in we spent million on capital maintenance and this year we are planning to spend million an increase of per cent <e> <s> my noble friends second supplementary question was to do with our plans for this year <e> <s> there are major motorway renewal schemes planned to be under way for at least some of the time between now and the end of september <e> <s> these works cover the renewal of miles of motorway and the total cost is million <e>", "<cs> my lords cones are required for various reasons which are not always obvious to protect concrete which is still curing to protect excavated areas or damaged safety fences to provide a safety zone for workmen and to provide access for contractors or emergency vehicles <e> <s> nevertheless we have reminded our agents to remove cones as soon as is practicable and also to make use of daytime work more than the night <e>", "<cs> my lords there have been backlogs but since the annual mileage of motorways renewed each year has been doubled <e> <s> by continuing to spend at the present level we should eliminate the backlog of maintenance on both motorways and trunk roads within five or six years <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot my lords <e> <s> however i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i do not know the example that the noble lord speaks about but i shall bring it to the attention of the department <e>", "<cs> i think that is another question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs and the noble lord lord wigoder for their welcome to this order <e> <s> as regards voluntary workers the question has never been addressed by the courts but it is our view that unpaid voluntary employment does constitute employment for the purposes of the act <e> <s> in any case the current order extends the circumstances in which questions about spent convictions can be asked to all those employed or not who are concerned with provision for children <e> <s> i hope that answers the question of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the functions of traffic wardens amendment order be approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> before moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we do not resume this committee stage before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i believe that this would be a convenient moment to stop for the evening <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement following consultations on the scottish tertiary education advisory councils report on a future strategy for higher education in scotland which was published on th december <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord grimond for their reception of this statement <e> <s> that of the noble lord lord ross was somewhat qualified <e> <s> he will not expect me to enter into a debate at this stage on his many points some of which were quite political <e> <s> the noble lord asked me three questions <e> <s> why was there such a delay in responding to the steac report <e> <s> the answer is that the government allowed a period of more than three months up to th march for comments on the steac report <e> <s> they then took time to consider all the comments received before making the statement <e> <s> i therefore do not think that it was as long as the noble lord thought <e>", "<cs> sixty-one miles apart <e> <s> when i was last there they were about or miles apart <e> <s> the merger will facilitate the rationalisation of courses over the two sites and will i hope make it easier to dispose of surplus accommodation at both of them <e> <s> we expect the outcome to be a single strong college of education operating at a reduced overall unit cost but well adapted to meet the teacher training needs of the north and north-east of scotland <e> <s> the noble lord also asked me how many reviews there will be and then told the house the answer <e> <s> i do not think therefore that i need to answer him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i shall certainly convey his views to my right honourable and learned friend the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord may be reassured if i tell him that it will be up to the government to secure the compliance of all governing bodies as to the disposal of parts of their colleges <e> <s> we would of course expect the governing bodies to act responsibly <e> <s> i understand that it may be the intention to appoint independent consultants who would report to the secretary of state on the marketing prospects of the land and buildings at each college <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend lady carnegy of lour and i shall certainly convey what she has said to my right honourable and learned friend <e> <s> as regards the merger between dunfermline college and moray house at present there are no plans for any new name for the joint college but i shall certainly convey my noble friends views <e> <s> it will be a matter for discussion with the governing bodies <e> <s> we do not have any preconceived ideas <e> <s> as regards the existing staffing of the two colleges that will be a matter to be discussed between my department and the governing bodies <e> <s> it will be for the governing bodies to make the decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords an extensive redevelopment programme is planned in order to bring the prison up to modern standards and to improve conditions for the inmates and staff <e> <s> it will include the construction of a new building linking the four large existing wings of the prison to provide additional cells and ancillary accommodation <e> <s> integral sanitation will be provided throughout the prison <e> <s> subject to financial approval work on the preliminary phase of the redevelopment will begin at the end of this year or early in <e> <s> the whole project will take about eight years to complete <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the practice of slopping-out will not go on after the new building has been built and that integral sanitation will be provided throughout the prison <e> <s> i think i should say that the conditions for inmates and staff are thoroughly unsatisfactory which is why we intend to undertake this major scheme <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenarthur is taking a particular interest in the redevelopment and visited wormwood scrubs on th june <e> <s> he has told me how impressed he was by management at the prison and by the dedication and professionalism of all the staff in what are far from ideal conditions <e> <s> we are anxious to proceed with the scheme as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord for not answering his first supplementary question <e> <s> the earlier scheme on which work began in was abandoned in following an investment appraisal <e> <s> the alternative scheme took account of factors that were not apparent when the original scheme was devised including the need to retain the prison chapel the increase in the size of the london remand population and the likely staffing implications <e> <s> the new scheme offers better value for money <e> <s> the new kitchen and refurbished hospital were to have been provided under the earlier scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord john-mackie visited wormwood scrubs i think he would understand why it has to take such a long time <e> <s> it has to be done in phases within a very limited area <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord williams that my noble friend is doing everything in his power to get approval advanced for this expenditure as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mellish and i shall see that he gets that information <e> <s> but it might be more useful if he would care to put down a question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said my noble friend lord glenarthur visited the hospital on th june <e> <s> he is very well aware of the problems there <e> <s> a temporary hospital was established in b-wing when the refurbishment of the old hospital began <e> <s> the temporary hospital will remain in use until the permanent hospital and operating theatre in the new spine link building are completed <e> <s> conditions in the temporary hospital are unsatisfactory and as the noble lord said the main causes for that are a leaking steam main underneath the wing <e> <s> work is in hand to divert the main and so alleviate the problem <e> <s> about will be spent during the preliminary phase of the redevelopment on upgrading the temporary hospital itself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a priority <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we shall continue to mention that matter in our discussions with london regional transports board and management but ultimately it is their responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from lrt that one of the escalators was taken out of service because of the station modernisation works currently under way <e> <s> it is expected to be back in use in the autumn <e> <s> unfortunately the second escalator had to be taken out of service temporarily because of the failure of the handrail tracks <e> <s> those have now been replaced and i gather that it is hoped to have the escalator working again today <e> <s> the escalator concerned is only two years old and i believe that its premature failure is a matter that lrt is taking up with the manufacturers <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware that lrt hoped to have the escalator working today but i am not aware that there is any direct connection between the fact that it is working and the fact that my noble friend is asking his question today <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably due to the fact that the central line was built in the days of the horse and cart <e>", "<cs> my lords the replacement programme that is under way at the moment is massive <e> <s> it is not a matter of lack of funds on the contrary the governments policy of reducing demands on revenue subsidies has made more money available for capital investment <e> <s> the replacement of the escalators is a very complicated job that takes a lot of time <e> <s> much of the work has to be done at night <e> <s> the problem is that although lrts policy is to invite <e>", "<cs> my lords it sounds a little like upstairs downstairs <e> <s> i shall certainly convey my noble friends remarks to the chairman of lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords i was referring to the maintenance work <e>", "<cs> my lords i have absolutely no idea <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissioner is well aware of the need to process applications to join the force as quickly as possible and keeps his procedures under constant review <e> <s> i understand that improvements made over the last year have contributed towards a per cent <e> <s> increase in the number of recruits attested in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year <e> <s> some of the causes of delay are beyond the commissioners control <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure of weeks was the average figure for the intake of recruits who joined the force last january <e> <s> figures for earlier intakes are not available <e> <s> the per cent <e> <s> increase in the number of recruits attested in the first half of this year strongly suggests that the average elapsed time has decreased <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have figures for the provincial forces <e> <s> however i can say further to the noble lord lord allen that there are certain factors under the commissioners control <e> <s> one factor is the time taken to make inquiries about applicants and to interview them and the second is the time which elapses before a successful candidate can join an intake <e> <s> there are other factors outside the commissioners control <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissioner has already been told that he will be able to have increases of up to in the operational strength of the force over the next four years <e> <s> the commissioner is making every effort to reach the new establishment figure as quickly as possible <e> <s> he cannot give any firm guarantees but he aims to reach the new figure by the end of march next year <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but that is probably due to the fact that the period of notice required by the applicants existing employers can be as much as four months and the fact that some applicants are in the final year of university or college <e> <s> there is also the time taken by the provincial forces to carry out some of the initial work on applicants living outside the metropolitan police district <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i cannot say anything other than that i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave the answer to that question some time ago and i am afraid that i cannot find it <e> <s> however there has been an increase <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can do is to draw the noble viscounts views to the attention of the commissioner <e>", "<cs> in rising to move that the house do now resume i suggest we do not return to the committee stage before minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords we have so far received observations from only a small number of organisations and individuals and we look forward to receiving more in the course of the next two or three months <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the concern which may be felt about the implications for jobs and for pay and conditions in the proposals of the peacock committee <e> <s> it is right that all interested parties including employees should express their views <e> <s> the government will reach conclusions only in the light of reactions to the report <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows that is not for me but i note his remarks on the importance of the matter <e> <s> i am sure that he will pursue it through the usual channels <e> <s> i happened to notice or the order paper that the noble lord lord annan has put down a motion on the matter for no day named <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i am in a position to give a guarantee but i am sure that what the noble lord says will be noted by the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the most effective action british consumer organisations can take is to help and encourage their european counterparts to bring pressure to bear on those governments who remain unwilling to liberalise <e> <s> the next formal meeting of the transport council is on th and th november <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport plans however to hold an earlier informal meeting on rd october to speed up progress <e>", "<cs> my lords

injects life into our proceedings here <e> <s> we can only follow her example <e> <s> i shall certainly bring her remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i do not think that there is anything further that i can add except perhaps to say that we should of course welcome any support the noble baroness can give us in our efforts to speed up liberalisation in that sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the report of the interdepartmental committee was published on rd june <e> <s> a copy has been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to confirm to the noble lord that on the principle that the minestone that is rolling can gather no moss acceptance of the recommendations was announced on st october <e> <s> the procedure of dual tendering was found to be ineffective and very costly <e> <s> in future greater reliance will be placed upon marketing and competitive pricing by waste producers <e> <s> information will be given to tenderers to ensure that they do not overlook likely waste sources <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly confirm that <e> <s> if i may just summarise the report the government feel that road construction can make a useful contribution to waste disposal and we want to encourage its use wherever and whenever that is economically viable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a summary of the comments received on the report but as it is rather lengthy and detailed perhaps the noble lord will be satisfied if i send him a copy <e> <s> i shall also consider placing a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have that in front of me but it will be contained in the document that i place in the library <e>", "<cs> with permission my lords i should like to make a statement about urban development corporations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble baroness lady david and the noble baroness lady stedman for their welcoming reception of the statement <e> <s> i am not sure that i am capable of answering all the questions they have asked since my briefing was necessarily short <e> <s> however i shall do my best <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord gisborough

have declined and the area clearly needs a new image building on entrepreneurial spirit <e> <s> i am afraid that i have no details of the geographical location <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey the noble lords remarks to my noble friend lord skelmersdale who will be dealing with the matter next monday <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord dean as i said earlier that we

necessary before each such station may be constructed <e> <s> all relevant matters are fully taken into account before a decision is reached on an application for consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> i do not think that anything is absolutely sure in this world <e> <s> all i can say is that all our nuclear power stations are designed to withstand a large range of aircraft crashes direct hits from conventional weapons and earthquakes <e> <s> i would add that the threat of terrorism and other malicious acts is recognised and the appropriate preventive measures are taken but these cannot be divulged for national security reasons <e> <s> i am therefore not complacent but realistic <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend

important and vital role to play <e> <s> it contributes a very valuable element of diversity and security of supply and it already supplies some of our cheapest electricity <e>", "<cs> my lords i said

all speedlink journeys have been completed within minutes of the scheduled time <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that it is still too early to evaluate the effect of the new opportunities which the energy act has opened up for operators of economic private generation <e> <s> however it is encouraging that the number of private generators selling electricity to boards in great britain

areas of high unemployment and i should have thought that closing down an entire industry is a strange way of solving our unemployment problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it extremely strange that a party which is promising if elected to reduce the unemployment figures by million should at the same time adopt a policy which could lead to an increase in the figures by the same number <e> <s> with regard to safety the nuclear industry is subject to the rigorous systems of safety assurance <e> <s> nuclear power stations are subject to the controls of the statutory independent watchdog the

the leave of the house i should like to say a word about the short debate standing in the name of the noble baroness lady stedman <e> <s> it is customary in short debates that the mover is allowed approximately minutes and that the minister should rise to reply not less than minutes before the scheduled end of the debate <e> <s> this means that all other speeches should be limited to a maximum

resume our consideration at pm if that is convenient <e> <s> i rephrase that <e> <s> we shall resume at eight oclock <e> <s> i mean not before eight oclock <e> <s> that is an even better revision <e>", "<cs> before moving that the house be resumed i suggest we return to the committee stage at minutes to eight if that is agreeable <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the danish scheme imposes a legal requirement on the home owner to provide prospective purchasers with a home energy survey <e> <s> in the view of her majestys government this scheme does not provide an appropriate model for the united kingdom <e> <s> it involves an unacceptable element of compulsion and its achievements in denmark have been largely due to a massive programme of government subsidies for the recommended improvements and formerly for the audits themselves <e> <s> instead her majestys government are promoting energy efficiency in new dwellings through the building regulations and in existing dwellings through a range of other measures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount might find it helpful if i tell him that so far as concerns the new building regulations the department of the environment hopes to issue draft approved documents for public consultation early next year with a view to laying the new regulations which will include improved standards of energy efficiency by the end of the year <e> <s> these should provide a sound base to build on in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the government have announced plans to phase out the non-means tested per cent <e> <s> grant under the homes insulation scheme and to extend the more generous per cent <e> <s> grant to all householders on housing benefit

afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not trying to say anything to your lordships i am repeating a statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the electricity supply industry plans to meet demand during cold winters and has sufficient generating capacity plant to meet forecast demand for the coming winter <e> <s> the area boards distribution network in southern england was severely damaged in the storm of th october <e> <s> the boards mounted a massive exercise to effect repairs rapidly and to restore power to all customers <e> <s> some of this work was of necessity temporary <e> <s> the boards have now embarked on a major programme of permanent repairs <e> <s> the system will be more vulnerable until this work is complete but every effort is being made to restore the system as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord that after the unprecedented devastation caused by the storm on th october there was a magnificent effort by the electricity industry to reconnnect so many consumers so quickly in such dangerous and arduous conditions <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early yet to reach conclusions on the lessons to be learnt from the damage caused by the hurricane which struck the south-east of england in the early hours of th october <e> <s> however it is already clear that much of the damage was caused not only by falling trees which gave rise to faults to overhead lines but also by roots pulling up underground cables <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend is right in certain respects but installing underground cables normally costs between three and times the expense of putting up overhead lines <e> <s> i have here a list of eight technical reasons for not putting electricity cables underground but i do not feel that the house will thank me for reading it out now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for that question <e> <s> electricity boards are required under section of the electricity act to take into account any effect that their proposals might have on the natural beauty of the countryside any flora fauna features of special interest buildings or other objects <e> <s> before boards are permitted to place new overhead lines they are required to obtain consent from the secretary of state for energy who before granting consent takes into account any objections received <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with my noble friend <e> <s> i believe that i said that the cost of installing cables underground is between three and times that of overhead lines <e> <s> for the higher voltages lines can be up to times more expensive <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that there was considerable danger from the latter <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree but it will be up to the consumer to foot the bill <e> <s> the house might like to know that for private lines to houses the first feet laid underground is laid free of charge and the balance is paid for by the customer the cost being a matter of negotiation with the electricity board <e>", "<cs> my lords it depends on which was there first the electricity cable or the house <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the items on the list that i have not read out <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord brabazon of tara i beg to move the motion standing in his name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the government undertake a range of advisory and research activities aimed at improving the safety of pedestrians in residential areas <e> <s> although the regulation of traffic on residential roads is primarily the responsibility of local authorities the department of transport is assessing effective ways of protecting pedestrians using traffic calming measures <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities have the key role in improving pedestrian facilities and in reducing pedestrian casualties per cent <e> <s> of which occur on local authority roads <e> <s> central governments function is to assist local authorities by providing guidance and mechanisms for action <e> <s> i have three leaflets produced by the department of transport which have been placed in the library and which may be of interest to members of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for protecting everybody <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can answer that question my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the feelings of the noble lord lord ezra on that matter <e> <s> i think however that the question is a little wide of that on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that it is a european phrase which has been translated into english <e> <s> i am not sure what the original is <e> <s> i understand that the idea is for drivers to drive more carefully and more calmly <e>", "<cs> my lords when driving in london i do my best to stop at every pedestrian crossing and i hope that everyone else does <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a matter for the local authority <e> <s> the government can only provide guidance and suggestions about how to improve road layouts <e> <s> one of the leaflets that i mentioned shows how accident rates went down considerably when layouts were altered by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bear in mind my noble friends comments and will inform my right honourable friend of his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that i did not have notice of that question <e> <s> i do not have the highway code with me but i shall look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly convey the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement about the future of british rail engineering ltd which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his thanks to me for repeating the statement and to the noble lord lord tordoff for his general and liberal reception of it <e> <s> the reaction of the noble lord lord underhill was not unexpected <e> <s> i do not believe that the statement came as a complete surprise to him <e> <s> it is clear that we shall have to agree to disagree <e>", "<cs> my lords when i asked at my briefing where horwich was i thought it might be halfway between norwich and harwich <e> <s> i completed my briefing and found it to be not far from where the noble lord lord tordoff was born <e> <s> my briefing was successful on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> of course i agree with everything he said <e> <s> i do not feel however that it is my job now to anticipate tomorrows major debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that i did not want to anticipate tomorrows debate <e> <s> as this is a statement i do not think we should continue the discussion any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say what the noble lord thinks i said <e> <s> i said that brs main business is running a railway not running an engineering business <e> <s> the facilities needed for day-to-day maintenance are already separated into br maintenance limited and will remain in br control <e> <s> i think that that answers his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i note my noble friends comments <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords after the end of the short debate on privatisation and before the short debate on alcohol abuse my noble friend lord skelmersdale will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on the primary health care white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords after listening to three ex-presidents of rospa as well as the current president i feel that i have a somewhat daunting task ahead of me <e> <s> i hope that i shall be able to reassure them that the concern they have expressed about the future of rospa is not shared by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords the current programme of work on the severn barrage includes studies of environmental aspects <e> <s> indeed to facilitate this the severn tidal power group has set up an environmental advisory panel which will look into these aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords core samples of the estuary bed have been taken by a drilling barge <e> <s> sonar and seismic surveys have also been made of the area along the possible line of the barrage <e> <s> however a fully detailed survey will not be completed until it is required for final design purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that tidal energy is one of the most promising of our renewable resources <e> <s> the current research programme which concentrates on the severn and mersey estuaries is aimed at reducing uncertainties on cost performance regional and environmental issues <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have any details about that particular estuary but i can say that outline feasibility studies have been carried out for the dee estuary morecambe bay solway firth the humber and the wash <e> <s> however all those areas are less favourable economically than the severn or mersey estuaries <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of those involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon may well be right on both points <e> <s> the environmental studies that are now in train are designed to clarify areas of uncertainty and to explore those that require further study so as to assemble information which can be developed into an environmental impact assessment to support a decision to proceed with construction <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that i cannot give any assurances at this stage as this is part of the study that is being carried out at the moment <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid i do not know the answer to that question but i shall draw it to the attention of those involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have reached the conclusion that we should get on with further in-depth research and planning into the practical rather than the theoretical <e> <s> your lordships may not understand quite how large the scale of the severn barrage project is affecting as it would an extensive regional area and the interests of many individual and institutional bodies <e> <s> the depth of knowledge acquired so far on many topics does not allow us to satisfy at the moment all the relevant questions which can be asked on the various aspects of the scheme <e> <s> if we had gone ahead without looking further into these matters we should have been criticised <e>", "<cs> before moving that the house do resume perhaps i may suggest that we return to the committee stage of this bill at ten minutes past eight oclock <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until ten past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords parking at airports is the responsibility of the airport authority concerned <e> <s> the government have no powers to require enforcement of reserved spaces for disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely that able bodied drivers should not park in spaces reserved for disabled drivers <e> <s> but spaces at airports are not backed by order

do even better than that i shall write to the noble baroness myself before he returns <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that one of the main problems is the amount of traffic at peak periods <e> <s> my noble friend lord brabazon of tara last tuesday answered a question on european air control <e> <s> perhaps i may tell the house that the proposal of my right honourable friend the secretary of state to create a european central flow management unit was endorsed last thursday at a meeting of transport ministers of states belonging to the european civil aviation conference <e> <s> that is a big step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a most interesting suggestion and one which i shall most certainly pass on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords since the government have approved over million for development of local authority and publicly-owned airports <e> <s> the secretary of state has asked the caa when reviewing traffic distribution to take into account the full extent of the contribution which may be made by airports outside the london area <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policies for better schools and greater flexibility in further and higher education are each contributing to increased participation rates both among school-leavers and adults building on the per cent <e> <s> growth in student numbers already achieved since <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that per cent <e> <s> is quite a substantial increase <e> <s> a higher proportion of and year-olds are each year qualifying for higher education and an increasing proportion of those qualifying especially women are being admitted <e> <s> the governments policies assume continued growth in the age participation index and in participation by mature learners <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly take note of everything the noble lord says and i shall pass on his comments to my right honourable friend <e> <s> the government are encouraging increased acceptance of vocational qualifications as a route into higher education <e> <s> they are funding action research in means of increasing access at leeds and bradford universities <e> <s> they are encouraging better links between further and higher education through open college federations and improvements in the availability and quality of access courses and in the assessment of students with non-traditional entry qualifications <e>", "<cs> my lords i take serious note of what my noble friend says <e> <s> the continuing growth in part-time student numbers in higher education does not suggest at the moment that tuition fee relief for these students would be an effective use of scarce public funds <e> <s> however i shall tell my right honourable friend what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss question is slightly outside the scope of the question on the order paper but i am sure that it is one which deserves consideration <e> <s> i shall certainly draw it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> i have no idea my lords <e> <s> the noble lord is much more familiar with this than i am <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a vigorous debate taking place in university circles and elsewhere about fees vouchers and other means of increasing the purchasing power of students with a corresponding reduction in block grants to universities <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science told the vice-chancellors on th september that the government wanted the debate to mature <e> <s> they will not reach a particular view and follow that up with concrete action without very full discussion with the new funding councils and the leaders of universities polytechnics and colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass the noble baronesss comments on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are encouraging more people to go into higher education <e> <s> however the government can do nothing to prevent the fall in the numbers of young people which demography tells us we shall see over the next few years <e> <s> our policies for schools are designed to improve standards of achievement for all pupils at all levels <e> <s> that should feed through to increased participation in post-school education including higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friends imaginative proposal has implications well beyond that of higher education <e> <s> nevertheless i am sure that the departments concerned will take note of what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords on th may my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science issued a consultation document proposing the reform of existing routes to qualified teacher status other than by the successful completion of an initial teacher training course in england or wales <e> <s> responses to the consultation document were requested by th october <e> <s> my right honourable friend will now give most careful consideration to those responses <e>", "<cs> my lords local education authorities currently may employ unqualified teachers who are granted qts qualified teacher status under existing regulations without obligation of on-the-job training <e> <s> our proposals would make <e>", "<cs> my lords we are putting the clock forward <e> <s> local education authorities and schools will not want to apply for a licence for anyone unless they are satisfied that the candidate has the qualities that are needed reinforced by on-the-job training to become a good teacher <e> <s> induction arrangements should ensure that unsatisfactory appointees are weeded out <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that i should enter into a philosophical discussion <e> <s> we are encouraging local education authorities to look more closely at qualified but out-of-service teachers near their schools who might wish to return to teaching some on a part-time basis <e> <s> a surprising number of older people in other careers would like to switch to teaching and we should continue to encourage them to enter initial teacher training <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the consultation document and licensed teacher proposals have been widely misinterpreted <e> <s> of the or so responses received the vast majority accept the need for some reform of existing non-standard routes to qualified teacher status and broadly <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that that was the position but it will not be so in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot answer that question today <e>", "<cs> my lords the vast majority well over per cent <e> <s> of entrants to teaching will continue to be graduates <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for education and science and for wales published proposals for attainment targets and programmes of study for mathematics in mid-august <e> <s> their proposals were based on the mathematics working groups advice but identified certain aspects which required in their view further examination <e> <s> the proposals are

consultations conducted in england by the national curriculum council <e> <s> the government have expressed their views the consultation exercise has allowed others to express theirs <e> <s> in its

present shortages of mathematics teachers <e> <s> but we have an energetic action programme to boost recruitment and to update and reinforce under-qualified existing teachers <e> <s> future demands

encouraging reply in my last answer <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord would like to read it again in <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the latter part of the question that i am sure is one of the matters that the national curriculum council will be taking very seriously on board <e> <s> as to whether teachers can cope in the first instance i should tell the house that only teachers of five and year-old pupils will be affected <e> <s> those teachers will have about six months to familiarise themselves with the new attainment targets and programmes of study <e> <s> various kinds of support will be provided new books equipment and teaching materials through education support grants in-service training through the lea training grants scheme and additional guidance and support through lea advisory services <e> <s> but in any case teachers will find that many of the new requirements simply reinforce what is already happening in good classrooms <e>", "<cs> my lords the implications of the proposal which involves a dvlc-based mileage recording scheme are still being considered <e> <s> an announcement will be made shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords my honourable friend only received the document on the th september and as the noble lord will appreciate he will need time to consider its implications <e> <s> however i can tell him that the government are grateful to the director general of fair trading for co-ordinating the views of bodies representing motor dealers trading standards professionals and others <e> <s> the proposals arising out of such an exercise deserve to be and will be studied with great care <e>", "<cs> my lords that is one of the matters that will be considered <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that certain private companies already operate a mileage register and inquiry service on a limited basis mainly for the motor trade <e> <s> the motor industry is investigating the feasibility of tackling the problem at source by the use of tamper-resistant mileometers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my honourable friend will take account of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the current pattern of provision reflects the outcome of the governments last manpower review in conducted in conjuction with the veterinary profession <e> <s> we shall again in consultation be considering whether a further review is needed and if so when <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendation that the annual intake of students by veterinary schools between and should be reduced from to was recognised by the review body to be

rationalisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that my noble friend lord stodart of leaston chaired the last review body and i am grateful for his comments <e> <s> the departments of agriculture and of education and science in consultation with the university grants committee and representatives of the veterinary profession will discuss the need for a further review and if one is required when it should take place <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords the average student-staff ratio is approximately five to two <e> <s> it is comparable with those in clinical medicine and clinical dentistry <e> <s> departmental university expenditure per full-time equivalent student is in the order of per year which is slightly higher than for clinical medicine and

veterinary surgeons <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that but i am now <e>", "<cs> my lords not at present <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows with permission mr speaker i wish to make a statement about

not sure that i shall be able to answer all the questions here and now <e> <s> most of the answers to the noble baronesses questions are contained in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords that point has been considered <e> <s> it will be up to the financial institution providing the loan to ensure that the loan is repaid <e>", "<cs> my lords the australian scheme has been considered but as the noble lord said the repayment will be liable to tax <e> <s> i think that i shall have to write to the noble lord as regards the amount of the build-up and the discharge of the debt of the student commencing a three-year course in <e> <s> i recommend the noble lord to look at chart on page of the white paper which sets this out <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has a copy of the white paper <e> <s> it sets out the answer in a much better way than i can <e>", "<cs> my lords it is deferred i think until the age of <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble lord lord glenamara had to pay interest on his loan <e> <s> the point about these loans is that they are interest free <e> <s> it is nothing new for students to borrow money <e> <s> one important finding of the survey of undergraduate income and expenditure was that almost half the students covered expected to have debts outstanding at the end of the year surveyed <e> <s> the average amount which those students owed was <e> <s> about per cent <e> <s> of the students had overdrafts per cent <e> <s> had credit card debts per cent <e> <s> borrowed from friends or relatives and just under per cent <e> <s> had commercial loans averaging <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite sure that there will be an opportunity to discuss the white paper in both houses <e> <s> of course i cannot speak for another place and indeed i cannot speak for this place <e> <s> the matter has to be decided through the usual channels <e> <s> however i shall make my best endeavours to ensure that it will be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend and the department will have read this publication <e> <s> i personally have not i shall be very happy to receive a copy from the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords the simple answer is that we are not planning to make it worse <e> <s> we are planning to make it better <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the last point of the noble lord lord grimond i have already said that discussions are taking place with the banking institutions to see how the scheme can best be administered by them <e> <s> there is no evidence that use of loans in student support systems elsewhere has in practice had the effect of reducing the representation of lower social and economic groups <e> <s> in any case like others they will be protected by the income-responsive repayment scheme <e> <s> loans will reduce the dependence of less advantaged children on parents who are hard pressed to help them <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot <e> <s> there were far too many of them <e> <s> i believe the noble baroness knows that <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness that part-time students are not covered by the scheme <e> <s> access funds will help those on courses for which there are no grants available <e> <s> the postgraduate grant will continue unchanged <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of everything my noble friend says <e> <s> all i can say is that i shall make sure that his remarks are drawn to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the latter part of the question of the noble lord i said that postgraduate grants would not be affected <e> <s> postgraduates will still receive the grant and they will get the access fund on top of that <e> <s> as regards students who work during the long vacations that situation will not change in any respect whatever <e> <s> they will all be entitled to borrow up to a year on top of any <e>", "<cs> my lords that last point is i think another question <e> <s> i am not surprised that the noble lord agrees with his noble friend lord glenamara <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord whether he paid interest on his loan when he was studying <e> <s> the whole point of the scheme is that the loans are interest free and available to everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am usually quite observant and i shall certainly report to my right honourable friend who i am sure will read this exchange in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure to what the noble lord lord peston is referring when he talks about an insulting document <e> <s> is he referring to the white paper or to the statement in another place which i have repeated <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord on that point <e> <s> i repeated a statement which was made in another place and i do not agree that it is insulting <e> <s> i am surprised by the reaction on the benches opposite <e> <s> i should have thought that any scheme which allows any person in higher education to borrow per annum over five years without paying any interest is something that should be welcomed and not thrown away <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to have this opportunity to clear up a general misunderstanding <e> <s> there is no vat on unconditional gifts of money to universities <e> <s> nor does the mere acknowledgment of such support attract vat <e> <s> however vat is chargeable where payment is conditional upon a universitys supplying clearly identifiable benefits in return such as advertising or publicity <e> <s> this has always been the position and each case is considered on its particular facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the press reports which are based on a misunderstanding <e> <s> in order to avoid any further misunderstanding in this area i should like to point out that today the customs and excise is issuing a press release on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords to the extent that tax is incurred which can be directly attributed to its taxable activities the university will be able to deduct input tax under the normal rules <e> <s> in that respect the university will be in the same position as any other taxpayer <e> <s> however i remind your lordships that <e>", "<cs> my lords providing that no other benefits are supplied in return such as advertising or the making available of the university facilities to the company vat does not apply <e> <s> companies which are charged vat are able to recover it from customs and excise through the vat credit mechanism <e> <s> most financial support is outside the scope of vat <e> <s> the government have no wish to impose unnecessary tax on a means of helping universities <e> <s> however the vat ec law must be observed <e>", "<cs> my lords the committee of directors of polytechnics and the standing conference of college principals have recently proposed that after st april when they leave local authority control they should enjoy the same vat exception as universities <e> <s> discussions with customs and excise officials are continuing and i am sure that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer will consider the case carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have an answer to that question but i shall write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first reply to the two noble lords who have spoken from the front bench with your lordships leave as i think is normal practice <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord peston on his maiden appearance at the opposition dispatch box as education spokesman <e> <s> i look forward to many friendly exchanges with him across the table <e> <s> i am grateful to him and to the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee for the general welcome they have given the regulations <e> <s> on the whole

for asking this question <e> <s> i remind your lordships that my noble friend asked specifically what measures her majestys government are taking to promote direct intercontinental air services to regional airports in the united kingdom <e> <s> i shall now attempt to answer that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot tell my noble friend the answer to that but i will write to him <e> <s> i could find the answer but it would take me time and i think my noble friend would rather i go on with my speech <e>", "<cs> my lords after the end of the short debate on the high level of consumer debt and before the short debate on assistance available to people with mental illness or mental handicap my noble friend lord strathclyde will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on british shipbuilders <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a further statement about the arrangements for the debate which is now to follow on mental illness <e>", "<cs> my lords the ufc will of course be bound by these sections and all other relevant statutory provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords these matters were discussed at great length and in great depth during the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> i can only say that the whole point of sections and of the education reform act is to emphasise that universities will remain free to attract and use funds from private sources without risk of financial penalty <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government are well aware of the concern expressed by the cvcp <e> <s> i understand that a meeting is to be held next week between the department and the cvcp to discuss the points which have been raised <e> <s> that is one of the points that will be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the cvcp will be taking that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the education reform act maintains the principle of free school education <e> <s> if an educational visit takes place during <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> the overriding policy is that provision of activities during school time has to be free but that out of hours activities can be charged for if leas and schools so choose <e> <s> however the act prohibits charging in respect of activities required to fulfil statutory duties relating to the national curriculum to religious education or as part of a syllabus for prescribed public examinations even if such activities take place out of school hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for informing me of something about which i was not informed previously <e> <s> the charging provisions reaffirm the principle of free school education <e> <s> they safeguard valuable optional activities outside school hours by allowing charges to be made <e> <s> they allow schools to seek voluntary contributions toward any activity provided that they are truly voluntary <e> <s> we believe that parents who have hitherto been willing to pay for many activities during school hours will not now suddenly refuse to contribute voluntarily so ensuring that the activity can take place provided that they are convinced that that activity is educationally worthwhile <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no question of the government imposing charges on anyone <e> <s> what has now been made clear in the act is what leas and schools can charge for if they so choose and what they cannot charge for <e> <s> the power to charge is in all cases discretionary <e> <s> perhaps i should just tell the house that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science will be making regulations requiring schools to publish information about their hours so that parents will know whether any specific activity falls in or out of school time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that my right honourable friend is producing regulations and i think that point will be made clear when they are published <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friend will take note of the noble lords remarks <e> <s> i must say that the basic feature of the new legislation is that it prohibits charges for any activities during the school day <e> <s> parents can contribute voluntarily to such activities but it must be made clear to them that there is no obligation upon them to contribute and that the pupils will not be treated differently according to whether or not their parents have contributed <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see that there is a great deal of feeling about this matter in the house <e> <s> all i can do at this stage is to make sure that my right honourable friend is made aware of what has been said <e>", "<cs> my lords under the act the charging situation will be much cleaner and better <e> <s> it will be better known to parents and leas than it has been in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that this can happen <e>", "<cs> my lords police officers who are considering service as a school governor should ensure that their chief officer has no objection <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been one of the principles of the police service that police officers have to be seen to be totally impartial in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> it is absolutely right that police officers should in certain circumstances be allowed to be governors of schools <e>

federation is seeking leave to appeal to the house of lords at the moment on that case <e>", "<cs> my lords not so far as i know <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the arrangements for this afternoons two short debates standing in the names of the noble lord lord hatch of lusby and the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e> <s> as is the custom in short debates the mover is allowed approximately minutes and the minister should rise to reply not <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after this afternoon my noble friend lady trumpington will with the leave of the house repeat a statement that is to be made in another place on assistance to the egg industry <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science set up a working group in the summer to consider the options for the future of these schools <e> <s> the group aims to report to him early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords this is clearly one of the matters that the working group is considering <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that my right honourable friend will consider any proposals made to him for a joint education committee as regards a particular service <e>", "<cs> my lords the schools that are now under discussion cater for children with <e>", "<cs> my lords i can certainly give the noble lord reassurance on his latter point <e>

issues that the inner london boroughs have been considering as they prepare to take over responsibility for education in <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that i am unable to answer <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the references of the working party are for these specific special schools <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> as regards the schools that we are discussing at the moment there are far more

increase in their enforcement effort during the full holiday period compared with the previous year caught only per cent <e> <s> more drivers who had been drinking <e> <s> it is clear therefore that more people are becoming aware of the dangers arid that there is a long-term downward trend in the amount of drinking and driving <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the original statistics consist of provisional and incomplete figures from police forces in england and wales <e> <s> there are wide differences between force areas <e> <s> the fact that the figures are not yet complete means that comparisons would not be particularly meaningful at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord raises an interesting and i think most important point <e> <s> i can say that we welcome the strong support from the private sector especially the brewers <e> <s> i am pleased to say that the sales of low and non-alcoholic beers are increasing rapidly <e> <s> as regards their cost i shall certainly draw that point to the attention of the brewers <e>", "<cs> my lords calls for random breath testing reflect the welcome hardening of societys attitude towards the drinking driver <e> <s> the police already have wide powers and they can stop at random <e> <s> however they have now said that they would like the law to be changed to allow unfettered discretion to test <e>", "<cs> my lords no not so

requirements <e> <s> nevertheless we hope that local authorities and utilities will not be inhibited from making practical improvements where possible before new legislation is brought in <e>", "<cs>

the tools <e> <s> i will certainly have a word with my right honourable friend to ensure that that is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards small schools the leas may protect them in their formulae in two ways by giving additional resources for small school curriculum protection which will ensure that smaller schools can maintain the breadth of curriculum necessary and for schools with fewer than teachers leas can take into account the variation between the actual teacher costs and the leas average costs of employing teachers <e> <s> the precise arrangements for dealing with these two factors will be for leas to determine locally in their schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give that assurance <e> <s> your lordships know that there will be a general four-year transition

wheel-clamping was privatised it has been much more efficient and effective <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of my noble friends remarks and i shall certainly pass them on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree <e> <s> a report by the transport and road research laboratory shows a substantial reduction in parking on yellow lines and less illegal parking in residents bays and at meters <e> <s> the number of cars illegally parked has decreased since wheel-clamping was introduced from vehicle hours spent on yellow lines each day to vehicle hours each day which is half the original figure <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for confirming what i have just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not but somebody does <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that it was due to wheel-clamping <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill was kind enough to give me notice of his last question we have been in touch with the gwent police who state that they have no such system <e> <s> however the noble lord may be referring to the computer-based system which is being developed by some local authorities in order to keep records of parking offences <e> <s> it involves punching in car registrations to find out whether the car or the owner is guilty of a previous offence <e> <s> as the noble lord said wheel-clamping is a deterrent <e> <s> i believe that it is unlikely that anyone who has been wheel-clamped once certainly twice will become a persistent offender <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that at the moment wheel-clamping takes place only in london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not prepared to speculate on that matter <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the problem is being studied in depth <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on individual travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend has a point but at the moment i cannot go further than i have done already <e>", "<cs> my lords we endorse the recommendation that each authority should ensure specialist coverage of all national curriculum subjects within its inspection and advisory service but in smaller authorities as the audit commission recognises the workload may not justify employing an inspector or adviser for each subject <e> <s> these authorities should consider other ways of ensuring subject coverage <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support the audit commissions broad recommendation that inspection based on systematic observation and recording of the quality of teaching in schools should be given more emphasis in the work of inspectors and advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are already making education support grant available to support an increase in lea inspectors and advisers <e> <s> expenditure of million will be supported over five years <e> <s> this should lead to an increase of some per cent <e> <s> on current numbers of inspectors and advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords the audit commission suggests several options for authorities to consider teams of inspectors and advisers could operate under the oversight of a joint committee of several authorities and an lea could contract with a neighbouring authority for that authoritys service to undertake inspection and advice on its behalf <e> <s> to meet the point of my noble friend a third way is that leas could co-ordinate appointments so as to maintain full specialist coverage for all subjects among them <e> <s> they could then buy specialist expertise from one another <e>", "<cs> my lords we endorse the audit commissions recommendation that every lea should ensure specialist coverage for special educational needs within its inspection and advisory service <e> <s> again it will be for each authority to consider whether its workload justifies employing an inspector or adviser or whether arrangements should be made with another authority to ensure that specialist cover <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has a point <e> <s> leas need to ensure that their inspectors and advisers receive appropriate induction at the outset and suitable continuing professional development thereafter <e> <s> the government have made grant available to the centre for adviser and inspector development to evaluate and develop a distance learning programme for inspectors and advisers <e> <s> this should help to prepare them specifically for monitoring the introduction of our education reforms <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not but that is another question <e> <s> if my noble friend tables a question i shall be happy to answer it <e>", "<cs> my lords the report recommends that leas should decide the workload and staffing of their inspectorate in the light of the tasks to be performed and the resources available <e> <s> it gives illustrations of how many inspector-advisers a small medium and large lea might need depending on whether the planned workload is low or high <e> <s> on this basis alone the low workload figures suggest that nationally there are too many inspector-advisers <e> <s> the high workload figure implies that there are too few <e> <s> the report clearly states that these calculations should not be taken to mean that net increases in lea central staff are required <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said earlier we endorse the report of the audit commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficulty <e> <s> i do not believe that we can start on a full-scale debate between the two noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords most ec member states require coach operators to insure passengers against accidental injury or damage to property while in transit <e> <s> holiday organisers who are members of the bus and coach council or the association of british travel agents are bonded against insolvency and abta members are required from summer to assume a greater liability for the proper performance of their holidays <e> <s> consumers are therefore able to choose whether to protect themselves by placing business with members of these bodies or to opt for cheaper packages without this protection <e> <s> travel insurance is available for individuals who want further protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that situation <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness that from the summer of people who travel will be able to enjoy the benefits of the new abta code which requires organisers to be strictly liable for the provision of the package as promised <e> <s> her majestys government welcome this initiative by tour operators to stand by their products and would support an ec directive to underpin this principle across the industry as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for giving me prior notice of his question however short <e> <s> i hope that my answer will satisfy him to a certain extent <e> <s> we believe that negligence is a key principle in uk law <e> <s> we would have serious concerns about a proposal which makes organisers strictly liable irrespective of proven negligence for all elements of a package deal <e> <s> but if a more balanced proposal were to emerege we would give it serious consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords not at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that is a question for me <e> <s> the house of lords select committee has commented that strict liability is neither right in principle nor economically insurable <e> <s> her majestys government doubt that strict liability is appropriate without limitation for death or injury however caused <e> <s> however we are pleased to note that from november abta member companies will be assuming liability for death or injury to clients caused by negligence on the part of themselves or their suppliers <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i agree entirely <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after pm this afternoon my noble friend lord caithness will with the leave of the house repeat the autumn statement which is to be made in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lady trumpington i beg to move that this debate be now adjourned until monday next <e>", "<cs> my lords links between industry and primary schools have developed very well over the past three years <e> <s> many more primary schools than ever before have such links <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government are well aware of the valuable contributions made by the organisations to which she referred <e> <s> we provide active support for their work and many such organisations receive funding from government departments <e> <s> i am also well aware that my noble friend has been closely involved with industry matters <e> <s> i understand that the excellent work in encouraging local partnerships between industry and education will be carried on by the new foundation for education and business partnerships which itself will receive government support <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord but the proposals for the technology curriculum aim to ensure that primary school children learn about the buying and selling of goods and services <e> <s> government departments in addition to the des also contribute to work in this area <e> <s> the dti for example supports teacher placement officers across the country to help arrange for teachers to spend some time in industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that scheme and it is proving to be a success <e> <s> i shall look into it and write to my noble friend as regards whether it is spreading to other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain about that but i shall make inquiries and write to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it is certainly in the interests of industry to assist as much as it can <e> <s> it is probably the schools which have been more prominent in coming forward with proposals than industry <e> <s> it is in the interests of industry that we should have a properly educated population which is aware of the industrial and economic dimensions of life in the modern world <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say it was the responsibility of industry to find the money <e> <s> it is the responsibility of the government <e> <s> i have already said that we are funding the money for this purpose <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i agree entirely with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the last point <e> <s> the noble lord has obviously read the report entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords debating about the gcse examination with my noble friend lord joseph is rather like taking on the founding fathers on the interpretation of the american constitution <e> <s> in a very real sense my noble friend is the father of the gcse <e> <s> although these new examinations were offered for the first time only in it was on the initiative of my noble friend when he was secretary of state for education and science that the gcse was launched <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the answer to my noble friends question is the latter <e> <s> however if i am wrong i shall furnish him with the relevant information in writing to him on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the government share my noble friends wish for an early decision on the planning applications by london city airport <e> <s> but because of the potential interaction between the airport inquiry and that on the design of the east london river crossing we believe that this can be best achieved through the two concurrent public inquiries which my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for transport propose to hold <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point <e> <s> public inquiries are necessary because the two developments are proposed under different legislation <e> <s> the order in which the inquiries are taken or the extent to which they may overlap will be for the inspectors to determine once they have been appointed <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that ministers are receiving regular reports of the progress on the statutory processes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord agrees with me and delighted to be able to agree with him <e> <s> my right honourable friends are anxious to keep the period of uncertainty as short as possible but the planning applications raise important and complex issues which need to be properly considered <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment that is the case but the whole purpose of the planning inquiry is to see whether the runway can be extended so that aircraft with more capacity can land and take off there <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my right honourable friends are aware of that point <e> <s> they are anxious to keep the period of uncertainty as short as possible <e> <s> but as i said the planning applications are important and raise complex issues <e> <s> they have to be properly considered <e> <s> my right honourable friends will do everything in their power to speed up the process <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly the reason we are undertaking two public inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that my right honourable friends are aware of the necessity for speed in this matter <e> <s> perhaps i shall not be able to report to the house on a regular basis but i am sure that my noble friend will be able to ask the same question on a regular basis <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> the factors which led the government to decide in not to reconstitute the advisory committee on the supply and education of teachers still apply <e>", "<cs> my lords acset was established at a time when major changes in teacher education were in progress <e> <s> following the work of acset the council for the accreditation of teacher education was established to advise the secretary of state on teacher education <e> <s> if the secretary of state requires advice on specific questions such as would previously have been provided by acset he appoints an ad hoc body to provide the information as he has done in for example the case of information technology and appraisal <e> <s> the government see no need for a standing body for that purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i have said that the government do not consider that to be the case <e> <s> the government collect a wide range of information from local authorities <e> <s> the range of data available on the teaching profession is unparalleled <e> <s> there was a considerable degree of agreement between the many surveys carried out this autumn including the <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion <e> <s> i shall take it on board and pass it on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly what the des is doing <e> <s> in november the department produced very tentative supply and demand projections for the mid-s in response to a request from the select committee <e> <s> those figures have recently been updated in response to a further request <e> <s> on the basis of those projections we expect that overall teacher demand and supply will be broadly in balance <e> <s> current initial teacher training entry targets are being met in primary education and we foresee no shortages in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords that is exactly why the government are taking the necessary action to put the matter right in <e> <s> i have a list of the actions which the government are taking <e> <s> i shall write to the noble baroness with that information and place a copy in the library <e>", "<cs> cycling on a footway is illegal and is an offence under section of the highway act as amended by section of the local government act <e> <s> it carries a maximum penalty of <e> <s> enforcement is a matter for the police <e>", "<cs> my lords the government deplore the attitude adopted by nottinghamshire local education authority on this issue but the secretary of state for education and science has reluctantly concluded that there are no grounds for him to intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord but there is no evidence that the authority is failing to perform a duty or acting unreasonably in the narrow sense in which the courts have defined that term <e> <s> although the lea has the power to allow pupils at independent schools and ctcs to take part in workshops under the facilities it has no duty to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that question is rather outside the scope of the question on the order paper which has nothing to do with ctcs <e> <s> it is to do with nottinghamshire leas refusal to allow two pupils one from a ctc and one from a private school to attend a course at the south nottinghamshire music centre <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have voiced their views on this ban <e> <s> i can only say that parents and other electors in nottingham will no doubt draw their own conclusions about the authoritys attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat that this question relates to the two cases in which nottinghamshire lea has refused to allow pupils respectively from a nottinghamshire ctc and a private school to attend courses at the south nottinghamshire music centre <e> <s> i suggest that questions or comments on the wider issues of ctcs are well outwith the scope of this question <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by expressing my gratitude to the select committee for a most interesting and useful report and in particular to the noble lord lord shepherd for initiating this debate and elaborating on the select committees finding <e> <s> i am also grateful to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was arguing a point <e> <s> i have just said that these are extreme but only too familiar examples <e> <s> when one argues a point one may argue from an extreme position <e>", "<cs> not without notice my lords <e>", "<cs> i shall write to the noble lord <e> <s> my noble friend lord nugent of guildford drew attention to the conflicting priorities which individual citizens face when they leave their houses and get into their cars <e> <s> no doubt if we were debating housing and not transport we would hear about the undesirability of sacrificing houses for roads <e> <s> there is no single answer to every problem but we can all agree that transport has been a cinderella to use his phrase for too long <e> <s> that is why we are increasing investment so substantially <e> <s> let me reassure the house that having now put cinderella back on centre stage the government intend to keep her there and make sure that she stays at the ball <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall ensure that that is done if it has not been done already <e> <s> referring to what the noble lord lord ezra was saying with regard to encouraging the transfer of traffic from road to rail i have to remind him that road and rail by and large serve different markets <e> <s> for most traffic the one cannot readily be substituted for the other <e> <s> they also cover different scales of activity <e> <s> roads are responsible for times more passenger travel and times more freight movement than rail <e> <s> a per cent <e> <s> increase in rail traffic would reduce road traffic by less than per cent <e> <s> and that might only be temporary <e> <s> however grants are available from the government under section of the railways act to encourage transfer of freight to rail in cases where there would be worthwhile environmental benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord i withdraw my remark immediately <e> <s> i do not think that i can speak any further on that point which is probably the noble lords loss more than mine <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> it would not be appropriate to introduce such a general dispensation <e> <s> we are encouraging the installation of more sophisticated signal systems designed to optimise the capacity of signalled junctions <e> <s> at appropriate junctions filter lanes can be introduced to aid left-turning traffic <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot agree with my noble friend <e> <s> there are fundamental differences between traffic signal junctions in the united states and the united kingdom <e> <s> in the united kingdom traffic signals use more sophisticated and more flexible control techniques <e> <s> they are rarely used in rural areas <e> <s> they are frequently deployed to give assistance to pedestrians and they often have to cope with higher traffic volumes <e> <s> in the united states traffic signals generally rely on simple fixed-time controls <e> <s> they are often used in rural areas and roundabouts are rare <e> <s> they frequently handle relatively low volumes of traffic and they can often be laid out with more space and better visibility <e> <s> the short answer is that my noble friends suggestion would not be suitable for the traffic conditions of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> pedestrians seeing a gap in oncoming traffic might start to cross not realising that a left turning vehicle from another approach was about to move <e> <s> there is also a danger of increased vehicle accidents owing to misjudgments by left turners <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question <e> <s> i did not realise that many accidents had been caused in that way but i shall look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i must agree with the noble lord <e> <s> there are differences in different states of the united states and there are differences in europe <e> <s> but i still say that the system proposed for the united kingdom would not be suitable <e> <s> there are obviously some arguments for filtering to the left <e> <s> however to be effective there would need to be adequate lengths of road to store waiting traffic and possibly provision for acceleration lanes around the corner <e> <s> but we are looking into that where it is possible <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i am my lords <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will let me know more about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it works perfectly well in the united states <e> <s> i have driven in san francisco and parts of other states <e> <s> but i do not believe that it would work perfectly well here <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is another question but i shall certainly look at it <e>", "<cs> well my lords i wonder whether i am right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady blackstone and the noble lords lord dormand of easington lord ritchie of dundee and lord houghton of sowerby for their contributions to this debate <e> <s> the debate has ranged far more widely than the subject of the order and i do not intend to stray from the order in my brief reply <e> <s> as i said in my opening remarks my right honourable friend is considering all the

shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport about new initiatives to relieve traffic congestion in london <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord underhill and lord tordoff for their qualified reception of what i consider to be a first-class statement <e> <s> documents referred to in a statement are not always available at the same time as the statement <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that they may be a little later than normal but perhaps it was not fully understood that the statement would be repeated in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to my noble friend for his warmer reception to the statement <e> <s> this is a strategic approach to improving traffic and transport conditions in london <e> <s> the feature of the approach is to make the best use of existing roads and cause the least demolition of housing and so on <e> <s> the priority routes also aim to make the best use of capacity <e> <s> we are continuing works programmes to eliminate stress points and bottlenecks on trunk roads and to use new technologies to improve londons traffic-light systems to reduce delays <e> <s> what we have said about parking wheel-clamping and towing away will be necessary on those routes in order to keep the traffic flowing well <e> <s> therefore there must be a strong deterrent to stop people parking on those miles of red routes <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said i have not had time to read the documents but i can tell your lordships that in principle the purpose of my right honourable friend making the statement today is to reduce uncertainty and the effect of blight <e> <s> my understanding is that knocking down houses is the last thing that we wish to do <e> <s> existing roads will be used and improved as much as possible but the details are in the document and the document is still there for discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards trunk roads procedures will be under the highways act which will of course include public inquiries where necessary <e> <s> for local roads the ordinary planning procedures will be followed <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend wants the authorities with existing responsibilities to work together for the common good <e> <s> he will provide the strategic framework within which the local authorities and organisations can work <e> <s> as i have already said the proposal is to appoint not a director-general but a traffic director for these red routes with a small staff to help with the necessary co-ordination <e> <s> so far as the local authorities are concerned there is a proposal that they should review yellow lines so that they are normally provided only where parking would cause an obstruction or hazard to safety <e> <s> again as i said these matters are still open for consultation and discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall have to write to my noble friend about the cromwell road <e> <s> i have the map in front of me but i cannot at this moment say whether it will be one of the red routes <e> <s> if it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i do not have the answer to that question <e> <s> i shall have to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords under the provision of the education act as amended by section of the education reform act local education authorities have a duty to secure social physical and recreational training and leisure-time activities for young people <e> <s> in the exercise of this duty all the inner-london councils development plans propose substantial youth service provision including giving support to voluntary youth organisations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords the government entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> we have recognised the importance of the support which umbrella bodies can give to the delivery of effective youth work at the grass roots by providing as he said interim funding of for each of the three years from / for these bodies to enable them to assist the maintenance of effective voluntary youth services while adjustment is made to new relationships between the voluntary sector and individual inner-london councils <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> but the replies and comments that i have received from those umbrella bodies have in fact been extremely favourable <e> <s> however the boroughs will have to increase the efficiency of the service over time if they are to deliver education at a reasonable cost to their chargepayers <e> <s> it should not be a hard task to be more effective in that respect than the ilea <e> <s> however while agreeing with my noble friend i must say that we should all encourage these organisations to the greatest extent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a view with which i do not agree <e> <s> the government consider that more explicit reference in legislation to the level and type of service provision which local authorities should make is neither necessary nor desirable <e> <s> it is currently for local authorities to assess the needs of young people in their areas in relation to this provision <e> <s> those local authorities who have identified a need to make extensive and varied provision have found no legislative barriers to this and overall expenditure on the youth service is rising <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will furnish me with details i shall certainly look into the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords in future it will be a matter for the umbrella bodies and the local authorities to decide which organisations are worth continuing and which are not <e> <s> however the government have provided interim funding as i said of for each year for the next three years <e> <s> that short-term special funding is designed to enable them to sustain effective support for grass roots works

to what he said and to the misgivings that have been expressed in the house <e> <s> i can assure the house that these comments will be passed on to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords that is quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall of course ask my right honourable friend to look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord peston and lord ritchie of dundee for their welcome and what i consider to be very valuable assistance to our education in this country <e> <s> your lordships have always taken a keen interest in the education support grant programme and this year has been no exception <e> <s> in broad terms it seems to me that there has been a large measure of welcome for the activities proposed for support next year <e> <s> doubtless we would all attach different priorities to different things but i think it is undeniable that the esg programme seeks to address some vital issues <e> <s> it demonstrates once again the value of esgs as a mechanism for targeting resources limited resources i agree but none the less important towards particular priorities <e>", "<cs> my lords london regional transport has a statutory obligation to operate its services with due regard to safety of operation <e> <s> i understand that it is already its practice to ensure that automatic ticket gates are left in the open position if no member of staff is available to supervise them <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am very concerned to learn of my noble friends experience <e> <s> i shall certainly bring it to the attention of the chairman of lrt <e> <s> i can tell my noble friend that the station supervisor is required to record in the station logbook the staff on duty and the condition of the station <e> <s> it is a serious disciplinary matter for a member of staff to be absent from his or her place of duty <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand the noble lords concern <e> <s> i agree that there was considerable public reservation about inconvenience and safety during the progressive installation of the gates in early <e> <s> however i believe that the system has settled down as people have become used to it <e> <s> complaints have virtually ceased <e> <s> the reliability of gates is good and lul is developing ways of making them even easier to use <e> <s> fifteen million separate gate operations were recorded within one week last july <e>", "<cs> my lords if there are no staff the station is closed <e>", "<cs> my lords the special allocation was entirely the initiative of the university grants committee <e> <s> as autonomous institutions it continues to be for individual universities and polytechnics to decide their own priorities within the total resources at their disposal <e>", "<cs> my lords we went over that ground on th june in a similar question from the noble baroness <e> <s> i do not think that she would expect me to bring any fresh answers today <e> <s> the government recognise the independence of our universities and we certainly do not intend to take funding decisions for them <e> <s> it is open to the funding councils to help if they judge that appropriate <e> <s> the universities funding council has inherited a ugc initiative for a million programme over the three years from for the purchase of books and periodicals <e> <s> the first signs are that this initiative

electricity supply amendment northern ireland order and the health and personal social services special agencies northern ireland order will be taken <e>", "<cs> it has been agreed through the usual

<e>", "<cs> my lords i assure the noble lord that i shall draw his comments to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> whether he will take my advice or that of the noble lord is quite a different matter <e> <s> there is a big difference between a general exhortation and effective law <e> <s> for the balance to be enforceable appointees would have to be limited to those willing to declare their party political affiliations <e> <s> alternatively all minorities on the council might be given the right to appoint governors with no control over their suitability <e> <s> neither of those approaches is acceptable <e> <s> if the requirement is to be general and not enforceable there is no point in putting it into law <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that the two are comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord mountevans for initiating this stimulating debate and for giving me the opportunity to set out the governments plans for meeting the future transport needs of the nation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am aware of that <e> <s> let us hope that it does not happen again <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is to remove restrictions in aviation arrangements between governments so that airlines are free to compete on fares and other aspects of their services subject only to proper safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour <e> <s> we have had <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i can advise my noble friend on the latter part of his question <e> <s> however fares from manchester or from any other airport must reflect the costs of providing the service concerned <e> <s> therefore fares from manchester to european destinations tend to be higher than fares from london because of manchesters greater distance and the lower level of demand which reduces operators opportunities for economies of scale <e> <s> but on long-haul routes such as those to the usa the differences are less pronounced and fares tend to be the same whether from manchester or london <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall convey to my right honourable friend anything that the noble lord the leader of the opposition says <e> <s> however as i am sure he knows the government are making a massive investment in the road infrastructure of north wales <e> <s> the most notable element is the improvement to dual-carriageway standard of the a across north wales costing some million <e> <s> it will reduce the journey time from bangor to chester from over three hours to about one hour <e> <s> that is probably quicker than would be the result of electrification of the railways <e>", "<cs> my lords i must agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the agreement in principle at the transport council on th december provides a framework for the next stage of liberalisation and sets goals for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment on the particular case raised by the noble lord but i shall write to him <e> <s> the government encourage the maximum use of regional airports to meet local demand and to relieve the pressure on the london airports <e> <s> over the past decade the government have approved borrowing totalling over million for the development of local authority airports <e> <s> that together with airports internally generated resources has facilitated over million of investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for carrying on for an extra minute <e> <s> i can tell him that there will be no need to exchange all our driving licences at the same time <e>

was largely completed to plan and that since the gates have come into operation revenue from ticket sales at stations with gates has increased by million <e> <s> the gates have enabled london underground to redeploy staff away from ticket collecting to tasks which help passengers and ensure their safety <e> <s> london underground has not reduced the overall number of staff <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> i too have found a considerable improvement since the barriers were introduced during the past year <e> <s> they have had a considerable effect in reducing the level of fraud the figure i gave was million <e> <s> however london underground estimates that fraud costs it and honest passengers over million per year and therefore there is still scope for further reductions <e> <s> london underground is working on that issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on to the chairman of lrt the comments of my noble friend <e> <s> all estimates of fraud should be treated with a certain degree of scepticism <e> <s> it should be emphasised that they are estimates by london underground and not by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords the government may have figures but i do not have them today <e> <s> if there are such figures i shall make sure that the noble lord is advised of them <e> <s> however independent consulting engineers have declared that the gate system is safer than previous ticket barriers and safer even than open stations because as i have said gates can be used to control overcrowding <e> <s> the railway inspectorate and the london fire brigade accept that view <e>", "<cs> my lords because they can be used to control overcrowding <e>", "<cs> my lords i read that in the newspaper yesterday <e> <s> i understood that he was going to travel on the underground every day and not merely make one journey <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that as spokesman for transport i travel regularly on the underground and i have seen a great improvement over the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> regulations specifying fire prevention measures at sub-surface underground stations were introduced last september <e> <s> regulation requires that stations must have at least two staff on duty at any time otherwise that station is closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a red box <e> <s> however i can tell my noble friend that each station has next to the other gates special manual gate facilities for passengers who are disabled who have heavy luggage or who are accompanied by small children <e> <s> if any of your lordships find difficulty i suggest that you should write to the chairman of lrt <e>", "<cs> my lords accidents resulting in death and injury over the period totalled an increase of per cent <e> <s> over the previous year <e> <s> the extent to which alcohol and other factors played <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought the figures i gave were encouraging <e> <s> while per cent <e> <s> more tests were carried out than in the proportion of drivers failing the breath test fell from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to enter into this particular debate but your lordships will be interested to hear that an on-going programme of research is being carried out by the transport and road research laboratory <e> <s> trial surveys took place last year in wiltshire and the previous year in warwickshire and sussex and a survey is to go ahead on a national basis later this year <e> <s> this research project will tell us more about the

write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the noble lord on getting in that question but i think it is a long way away from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure i gave was for the christmas period this year <e> <s> i do not think figures are yet available to break that down <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with that <e> <s> everybody is aware that

number of people driving i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly inform my right honourable friend at the home office of what the noble baroness has said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said my right honourable friend the home secretary will announce the governments response to the police request for wider powers to stop and breath-test drivers <e> <s> i cannot go further than that today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can start by saying that this has been a rush-hour debate <e> <s> i am sure that noble lords will not expect me to answer or comment on all the points that have been raised but i shall do my best <e> <s> i can assure the house that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport will read with the greatest of interest the debate in the <e>", "<cs> no my lords legal powers to determine the dates of school terms lie with local education authorities or school governors <e> <s> responsibility for the timing of school examinations rests with the gcse examining groups and the gce examining boards <e>", "<cs> my lords the government appreciate the need for coherence in the pattern of school terms and holidays but see no advantage in imposing dates nationally <e> <s> coherence is being achieved where it matters most at the local level where local education authorities have powers to determine the dates of terms and holidays for county and controlled schools which constitute about per cent <e> <s> of all maintained schools <e>", "<cs> my lords that would be a major change with implications for society generally <e> <s> we do not think now is the right time to contemplate <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that this circular which has not yet been issued in its final form will contain no new guidance on the length or arrangement of the school year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the noble lords views about easter and its continuous movement <e> <s> however i have to say that that will still be a matter for the local education authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are very much aware of the concern expressed on that particular matter <e> <s> although it is too late to change the timetable for i understand that gcse examining groups are looking very carefully at the position for and beyond <e> <s> perhaps i may say that with the exams starting so early and having disposed of those many pupils would stay on to play more cricket than they have before <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite right but that is a matter for the gcse examining groups and i am sure that they are looking into it at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what has been said in this house this afternoon <e> <s> i shall certainly not be chary about doing that <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall draw that to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the british transport police committee <e> <s> however i understand that the committee considered the question of privacy last year and agreed that the chief constables annual report for and subsequent years would be given a wider audience that in the past <e> <s> accordingly the annual report for which will be presented to the btp committee within the next few months will not be restricted and its contents will be generally available <e> <s> meanwhile as the noble lord will know copies of past reports are already available in the library of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord is delighted <e>", "<cs> my lords the precise arrangements are for british transport police and the police committee to decide <e> <s> i understand that as in previous years a copy of the report will be available in the library of this house and that copies will be distributed to main public libraries <e> <s> i believe that is broadly in line with the practice in other police forces <e> <s> that practice is largely a matter for chief constables to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have already said these are matters for the british transport police committee to consider and decide upon <e> <s> the question of publication was considered by the committee following the appointment of a new chief constable in april <e> <s> the committee decided to make copies of future reports more widely available than in the past <e> <s> however the report had by then already been printed in the old form <e> <s> i draw the attention of the noble lord to the british transport police <e>", "<cs> my lords i am saying that the btp committee has decided that the report will be available in future <e>", "<cs> my lords the civil aviation authority is to advise this summer on the adequacy of uk airport capacity to the year in response to a commission given to it by the government in july <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully accept the need to press ahead on airport capacity <e> <s> however very complex works are involved <e> <s> it is important that decisions are taken in the light of properly considered and researched advice <e>", "<cs> my lords all these matters are included in the remit of the caa <e> <s> its advice will include forecasts of air space and airport capacity <e> <s> it will examine the contribution of regional airports consider possible locations and timing of additional runway capacity to serve the south-east and examine the merits of possible demand management measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot comment in particular on cardiff airport <e> <s> however i can say that the government already encourage the use and development of all regional airports to handle all the traffic they can attract <e> <s> the government have recently agreed the construction of a new million terminal for manchester and are negotiating with the usa over extra services <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are prepared to look sympathetically at applications for the civil use of mod airfields where that is compatible with the operational role <e> <s> the civil enclave has already established raf manston as the kent international airport <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise i did not hear the noble lord <e> <s> i shall write to him about air space <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion and i am sure that the caa will take note of it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> that point will be taken note of <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i shall recognise that <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for reminding me of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that <e> <s> however i think it is straying a little from the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> that my lords is another side of the coin <e>", "<cs> my lords successive surveys carried out by the tranport and road research laboratory have shown that wheelclamping has proved to be an effective deterrent against illegal parking in central areas of london <e> <s> benefits from clamping are improved traffic flow more free parking spaces less abuse of residents parking bays and increased parking revenues <e>", "<cs> my lords the clamping zone was made permanent in and was extended to further parts of westminster kensington and chelsea the city of london and the southern part of camden <e> <s> in october approval was given to clamping in a large part of hammersmith and fulham <e> <s> tower hamlets and hackney wish to introduce clamping in parts of their boroughs and camden wishes to extend its approved clamping areas <e> <s> following consultations with the home office and the metropolitan police the department will consider their requests <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i can confirm that it is up to the local boroughs to ask for <e>", "<cs> my lords that is true but as i said where the car is in fact obstructing traffic the tendency is to have it towed away <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a point of view but i can tell the noble lord that clamping a vehicle on a parking space when it has overstayed its welcome will make sure that the driver of that car does not offend again <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the exchanges that we have had today to the attention of the metropolitan police <e> <s> i can tell the house that the average declamping time is two hours <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the whole house will be delighted to hear that <e>", "<cs> because my lords no one else has asked for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that that question is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> my noble friend who sits next to me will no doubt have heard it <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that in certain instances that is the case <e> <s> i believe that british rail are considering using them in some of their private car parks <e> <s> however i cannot give any firm details <e> <s> i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords british rails net proceeds were million <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the government approved the sale since they were satisfied that this was in brs best commercial interests <e> <s> the price was the best that could be obtained the market having been fully tested by open tender and genuine competition <e> <s> my honourable friend mr portillo told another place on th january that the contract of sale contains a clawback provision which ensures that british rail will benefit from any short-term sale or development of brel land <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be interested to hear that i too have too those press cuttings in my file <e> <s> as i said the net sale price amounted to million <e> <s> that appears in brs annual report and accounts for <e> <s> any queries with regard to figures which appear in the accounts for the brel group should be addressed to the group as it is a private company <e> <s> however i can tell both noble lords that there is an element of land and buildings in the sale price <e> <s> the br figure of million was made up as follows net assets of brel million sale of land and buildings for brel million sale of land and buildings for brel million <e> <s> net of br costs that came to million <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question as far removed from the question on the order paper as any i have ever known <e>", "<cs> my lords that is the purpose of the clawback provision which was agreed at the time of the sale

outside the bills purview <e> <s> nevertheless i shall try briefly to answer all the questions which have been put to me <e> <s> if i fail to do so i shall write to noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful indeed to the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for providing us with an opportunity today to debate a subject which is profoundly important and yet is one which is all too often overlooked in the public arena <e> <s> i am also most grateful to the noble lords who have contributed to the short debate this evening <e> <s> a great number of important points have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree entirely with the noble lord <e> <s> i do not have the answer to that query but i shall certainly find out whether that has been a factor in the costing <e> <s> i should imagine that that is a rather difficult arithmetical factor to work out <e> <s> however if i have any information on the point i shall certainly pass it on to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can do at this stage is to restate very briefly the governments view on this bill <e> <s> but first i wish to add my congratulations to those already given to my noble friend lord rockley on his excellent maiden speech <e>", "<cs> my lords london underground fares increased by an average of per cent on th february <e> <s> i am confident that the quality of service objectives set by my right honourable friend in december together with the significant increase in government funding announced in november will ensure that london underground delivers an improved service to the travelling public <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not clear where that statement came from <e> <s> however i can tell the house that the overall increase was per cent <e> <s> about per cent in real terms and that ordinary adult fares including those in the heavily congested central area have increased by an average of per cent <e> <s> i do not believe that that will have any bearing on road traffic in london <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord tordoff asked a question about escalators last november <e> <s> at the time i told him that per cent of escalators were available <e> <s> i can tell him and my noble friend that during the four-week period ending rd february escalators were available for per cent of the time <e> <s> there has therefore been a per cent increase in usage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested to hear that from the noble lord <e> <s> i can only tell him that i shall draw his remarks to the attention of lul <e> <s> perhaps he might volunteer to call such a meeting himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for showing me the card <e> <s> i am sure that the house will be pleased to know that lul is putting its customers requirements first and planning for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the second question first i understand that the london regional passengers committee was not consulted about the increased level of fares but has raised no complaint about them <e> <s> however it was consulted about the governments quality of service objectives with which it expressed satisfaction as well as lrts plans for increased investment <e> <s> so far as concerns the objectives announced on th december as the noble lord said they set performance targets <e> <s> they are to be in place by april <e> <s> clearly quite a lot of the improvements will take place much more quickly than that but i can tell him that luls performance record will be published regularly during this period <e>", "<cs> yes and no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the fire on the st columba occurred when fuel oil escaped from a pipe and sprayed on to a hot exhaust manifold causing the oil to ignite <e>", "<cs> my lords yes the government are satisfied with the situation <e> <s> this type of vessel is required to carry out a fire drill once a week <e> <s> that involves only the crew and not the passengers <e> <s> however on every voyage there is an announcement to passengers before they set off relaying instructions about what to do in case of emergency or fire <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the noble lord the leader of the opposition and praise the captain and his crew <e> <s> i also wish to inform your lordships that the co-ordination of the rescue services including preparation for a fullscale evacuation was carried out by coastguards and that great efficiency was shown by all the organisations involved <e> <s> the principal inspector has submitted his report to the department and there was good co-operation between the inspector and sealink <e> <s> i understand that sealink has already responded to the inspectors preliminary recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of transport is not aware of any suggestions to dispose of either an engineer or a radio operator <e> <s> there is a minimum requirement as to the number of crew on board which each owner must obey <e> <s> it is for the owner to decide whether to employ more than that requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am indeed grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for the remarks he has made <e> <s> he has made a valuable contribution to the debate <e> <s> i can confirm to him straight away that the government believe that the caa is doing a first-class job in a very difficult sphere of operation <e> <s> i should also like to pay tribute to the work carried out by the chairman of the caa <e> <s> i do not believe that these amendments reflect in any way upon the work of the authority <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of electric vehicles licensed in great britain and northern ireland fell from to between december and december that is a per cent drop <e>", "<cs> my lords a considerable amount of money was funded during the

afraid that i cannot but i shall try to find out and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords incentives such as free parking have a marginal effect on running costs and would not ease urban congestion <e> <s> there will be an indirect incentive for electric vehicles because of the extra costs incurred in meeting more stringent vehicle emission standards for other types of vehicles <e>",

technical for me to take on board immediately <e> <s> we welcome initiatives by individual companies <e> <s> the greatest incentive must be the production of vehicles which are attractive and which the public are willing to buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw my right honourable friends attention to what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships marpol / does require the ships of signatory states to report the loss of substances harmful to the marine environment including chemicals to the nearest coastal countries <e> <s> it is also strongly recommended for other dangerous goods <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have already asked the qatar authorities to investigate

loaded in accordance with our regulations <e> <s> meanwhile inquiries are being made in this country to establish how the goods were stowed <e> <s> the international maritime organisation is trying to obtain more signatures to the convention at the moment there are <e> <s> unfortunately there are one or two countries which have not yet signed <e> <s> this incident was made even more difficult due to the fact that it occurred in international waters <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i believe that the loss occurred in french territorial waters <e> <s> but if the noble lord cares to put down a question on that subject i shall try to find the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords under the international convention for the safety of life at sea hazardous substances are categorised as being dangerous to humans and under the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships hazardous substances are categorised as being harmful to the marine environment <e> <s> in the case of the former reporting is strongly recommended by the imo <e> <s> with respect to the latter reporting is a requirement under the marpol convention <e> <s> some substances fall into both categories <e> <s>

collision between the hydrofoil shearwater and the yacht amanda jane on th june was completed by the department of transport in july <e> <s> a summary report of the accident will be published but this is being delayed because a prosecution of the commander of the hydrofoil is still outstanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot assure my noble friend that a trial will take place before the date he mentions <e> <s> there is a certain jam in the crown court at the moment <e> <s> but i can assure him that the marine directorate surveyor recommended that a prosecution should be brought against the commander of the hydrofoil for offences under the merchant shipping legislation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> but i repeat that a prosecution is the best way to stop accidents happening in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to say a word about the two short debates standing in the names of the noble lord lord carter and the

little longer than noble lords opposite but i wish to give a general welcome to the bill and to explain its history <e>", "<cs> my lords we have just launched the summer phase of our year-round publicity campaign against drinking and driving <e> <s> the involvement of brewers and other private bodies is a continuing feature of the campaign <e> <s> earlier this month we extended the high risk offenders scheme for drivers whose alcohol dependency presents a road safety risk <e> <s> more offenders will now need to prove that they are medically fit to drive before their licences are returned <e> <s> we also aim to introduce at the earliest opportunity the law reforms outlined in our white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the feelings of the noble lord <e> <s> he has raised this matter before over the past year <e> <s> it is estimated that the number of people killed in drink related accidents last year was below compared with over two years ago <e> <s> considered in the light of the increase in traffic that shows the success of the continuing campaign against driving and drinking <e> <s> as to random testing my right honourable friend the home secretary recently announced the governments view that present police powers are wide enough and strike the right balance between effective enforcement of the law and freedom of the individual <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can give an opinion as to whether doctors are the right people to carry out an assessment <e> <s> i shall certainly draw that point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> as from st june this year on the recommendation of the blennerhassett committee regulations came into force so that those drivers who are disqualified once for driving while two and a half times or more over the legal limit are included in the categories of those disqualified twice within a -year period for any drink-driving offences and those disqualified for failing without reasonable cause to supply a specimen for analysis <e> <s> those drivers will have to pay the full cost of renewing a licence as well as the cost of the medical examination <e> <s> the regulations came into force on st june <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are spending million in the current year on advertising the dangers of drinking and driving <e> <s> paid advertising is not the only way to capture attention <e> <s> the same audience can be reached by other publicity <e> <s> the media have a key role to play in getting messages across for example through feature articles and programmes <e> <s> that is taking place at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend but i must point out that it is lawful for the police to stop vehicles at random for the purpose of investigating whether or not a driver has alcohol in his body <e> <s> the police are making full use of their powers <e> <s> over half a million tests were conducted in <e>", "<cs> my lords the european commission tabled a proposal to harmonise maximum blood alcohol levels of milligrams per millilitre <e> <s> however the proposal was shelved at the council meeting in december since there was no majority support for the communitys competence to legislate in the area <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that that will have the opposite effect to what the brewers are trying to achieve <e> <s> the government are delighted that the brewers society is relaunching its wheelwatch scheme <e> <s> we know that it will do its best to encourage landlords to take responsibility for their clientele <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the attention of my right honourable friend to what the noble lord says <e> <s> i can go no further than that <e> <s> however i agree as i am sure all noble lords agree that one death caused by driving and drinking is one too many <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i say a brief word about the length of speeches in todays debate standing in the name of my noble friend lord caldecote to which your lordships have agreed to apply a five-hour time limit <e> <s> the number of speakers is such that it is not necessary to apply a formal time limit but i am sure that noble lords would agree that it would conform with the spirit of these debates if they would keep their speeches within the minutes maximum time limit as recommended in the <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be helpful if i intervene to say a few words about the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness lady masham has explained the difference between this bill and the motor vehicle wearing of rear seat belts by children act <e> <s> as the noble baroness said legislation is carefully drafted to allow for defences where they are considered to be reasonable <e> <s> the advice of parliamentary counsel was taken in the drafting of the bill as in others <e> <s> there was lengthy correspondence on how cause or permit would be interpreted in the courts <e> <s> the matter was also debated in another place and examined again afterwards <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord monson will accept my assurance that cause or permit is the best form of words in this instance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house as this is a private members bill i cannot give any assurances as to what the government might or might not accept at another stage <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble baroness were to table such an amendment at third reading the government would support it <e>", "<cs> my lords the commissions package contains a number of proposals <e> <s> we are not convinced of the case for a community ship register but support those proposals linked to the single market objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support the proposals to ease the transfer of vessels from one ec register to another the proposals for the mutual recognition of seafarers certificates and <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a very interesting suggestion <e> <s> i was about to tell the house what your lordships european communities committee is doing at the moment <e> <s> it is holding an inquiry into the communitys proposals <e> <s> as the noble lord said it is now in the process of hearing oral evidence from interested parties <e> <s> i am sure that the house looks forward to reading its considered report and possibly debating it in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the sub-committee will be hearing evidence from all interested parties <e> <s> i should tell the house that the government consider the shipping industry to be an important contributor to the economy and to defence <e> <s> shipping related activities are a major part of londons financial strength <e> <s> the house will be aware of the joint working party which has recently been set up under the chairmanship of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport and sir jeffrey sterling <e> <s> this will establish a common understanding with the industry of the present position and options for improving its competitive position <e>", "<cs> my lords it is now generally accepted that cabotage should be liberalised <e> <s> the focus of discussion has moved from the question of whether to questions of how and when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite happy to give that assurance and to assure the noble lord that the government are doing everything they can <e> <s> but i cannot answer for any body other than the government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government have proposed amendments to the european standards for the installation of lights on cars <e> <s> if these amendments were agreed the additional stop lamp could be required by any member state choosing to do so <e> <s> unfortunately it has not so far been possible to obtain agreement in the european community to these amendments as some other member states have opposed them <e> <s> the subject is due to be discussed again at our instigation in brussels on th july <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal first with my noble friends second question <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> however as regards her first question i am not sure which organisations she has in mind but i can tell her that the british school of motoring has fitted a third brake light to the whole of its fleet of metros <e> <s> the school has found that such action has resulted in an per cent <e> <s> reduction in rear-end collisions <e> <s> the house can draw its own conclusions from that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> i can tell the house that the united states and canada require the additional brake light while the united kingdom denmark ireland and the other scandinavian countries allow it but all the other ec states prohibit its installation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a most interesting question <e> <s> however as he said it goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> nevertheless i shall write to him on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble lord lord airedale asked me specifically to make a considered reply if he were to put down this amendment on third reading <e> <s> i am now prepared to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are encouraging the private sector to come forward with new road-building proposals <e> <s> it is for them to judge what sort of roads would be financially viable <e> <s> lanes reserved for heavy goods vehicles might well be a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords the question was raised in the consultation paper published last year called <e>", "<cs> my lords i always listen to my right honourable friend with rapt attention <e> <s> other than that i cannot make any further comment <e>", "<cs> my lords that is outside the scope of the question <e> <s> however i shall write to the noble lord with a view on the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not reached that stage yet <e>", "<cs> my lords the prime minister of course <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state expects to receive the civil aviation authoritys report shortly <e> <s> i have as i promised made sure that the noble baroness will receive personal copy without delay and copies will be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted by the last part of the noble baronesss supplementary question and i thank her <e> <s> i regret that i cannot improve on shortly but i do not believe that the noble baroness will have to be patient for much longer <e>", "<cs> my lords on th may i replied to a similar question from the noble lord lord underhill whom i am sure the house will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on my noble friends remarks to my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am quite certain that he will find an opportunity for initiating a debate if he can do so before the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> the government take all these matters into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords that again is a matter that is being considered all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords at a convenient moment after pm my noble friend lady hooper will with the leave of the house repeat a statement on community care that is to be made in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house to know that the committee stage of the broadcasting bill will be adjourned at about pm for about one hour and that during this adjournment the meat and livestock commission levy variation scheme confirmation order the sea fish industry authority levy powers order and the air navigation noise certification order will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords when the extensions to bank and beckton are complete over million will have been spent on the docklands light railway <e>", "<cs> my lords the light railway is currently being upgraded and extended to the bank <e> <s> that will increase its carrying capacity to three times the present level <e> <s> in regard to my noble friends second question the developers of canary wharf olympia and york are contributing million to the city extension project in recognition of an improved service <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the extension to the bank the first tunnel will be completed by the end of this year and the second one by the end of next year <e>

question as i do not have the details at present <e> <s> however i should point out to him that the construction of the initial railway was something of an act of faith by the government <e> <s> the great success of the docklands regeneration was prompted in part by the dlr itself <e> <s> it could not have been foreseen at the time <e> <s> the original forecast of the number of passengers being carried every day was but as <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e> <s> in moving this motion perhaps i may suggest that the report stage begins
