["<cs> my lords i think i should begin by declaring a personal interest <e> <s> i do so because i have spent years in the education service <e> <s> in recent years i have a feeling that a number of people are losing faith in the importance of education <e> <s> therefore i start by making it quite clear that for myself i accept the words of disraeli and i believe in the decades that lie ahead <e>

<e> <s> i accept that it would be unreasonable that the education service should be exempt from cuts if in fact the national interest demands a decrease in public expenditure <e> <s> but this is not the way to do it <e>", "<cs> not at all my lords <e> <s> instead of that it would be a duty of the local authority to see that adequate provision was made and there is no reason why the secretary of state should not be able to supervise that that is done <e> <s> all i was suggesting was that it might be done in different ways in different areas <e> <s> where was i <e> <s> i was talking about transport and the falling school rolls particularly in the rural areas where the closure of schools will mean a greater number of children necessarily involved in transport and in many cases a greater distance to travel <e> <s> i find it very hard to accept a proposition which in my <e>", "<cs> i hope the government will accept this amendment <e> <s> it is more important to have a governing body constituted in this way in a special school than in an ordinary school <e> <s> therefore to leave out special schools is singularly unfortunate <e> <s> it may be that one can deal with this if one is dealing later with the warnock report <e> <s> i see no reason why it should not be done now <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will reject this amendment <e> <s> if this amendment is passed in many areas the effect will be that the only people who will wish to go on governing bodies will be members of the education committee <e> <s> the number of governing bodies that each of them will have to be a member of in order to meet this requirement will be considerable <e> <s> each will have to be the governor of perhaps schools <e> <s> whether a governor of schools can really fulfil the functions of a governor i greatly doubt <e> <s> it is very difficult as a governor to be interested in schools rather than in one <e> <s> i do not think that this is a practical proposition <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that i am unable to support this amendment <e> <s> i do not believe that uniformity is desirable <e> <s> the duties of governors in urban areas may necessarily be different from those exercised in a rural area <e> <s> let me take as an example the maintenance of school buildings and grounds <e> <s> in an urban area it may well he that the grounds are maintained by the parks department <e> <s> therefore governors are not held responsible for the maintenance of grounds <e> <s> this happens in a number of areas <e> <s> in a rural area this is properly and rightly a direct responsibility of the governors <e> <s> in relation to the supply of materials to a school again there are variations <e> <s> in certain areas there is a central supply department and the governors have no responsibility in respect of supplies <e> <s> in other cases the governors quite properly have such a responsibility <e> <s> therefore i cannot accept the proposition that there should be uniformity in these matters throughout the whole country <e>", "<cs> i do not dissent from the importance of encouraging parents to take the most active interest in the education of their children <e> <s> indeed before the war some years before the noble viscount lord eccles became minister i had a parents association in every school in the area which i then administered <e> <s> but i am concerned with the breadth of this clause <e> <s> unless i misread it as a parent i can choose ally school in the country and say that is my preference and i insist upon going before an appeals committee accompanied by a lawyer to defend my choice <e> <s> surely that is a little unrealistic <e> <s> i greatly fear as the noble lord lord hunt has suggested that parents may be encouraged to think that this is offering them what it cannot possibly offer and <e>", "<cs> one of the virtues of sitting on the cross-benches is the capacity to vote with the government and against the government from time to time as one may feel it reasonable <e> <s> i strongly supported the noble duke on his previous proposition <e> <s> i could not support him on this because i simply do not believe that it is necessary <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not press this amendment <e> <s> the position which this clause sets out is the position which has obtained for a very long while <e> <s> are local education authorities and schools not to he trusted in any way at all regarding these matters <e> <s> are we to give the secretary of state a power which has never been possessed by a secretary of state to interfere in this way <e> <s> i hope not <e> <s> the arrangements that have obtained have worked extraordinarily well and therefore i see no reason to extend the power of the secretary of state in this matter <e>", "<cs> surely there is a very good reason for singling out educational records that it is in the interests of parents to ensure that they are fully advised relating to the progress of their child in a particular school <e> <s> if that is not done the parents will have a real grouse <e> <s> it is perfectly reasonable to say that this must be done <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall accept that it is an anomaly <e> <s> for years i have tried to get free trade for the to year-olds but the authorities did not agree and there were cogent reasons why they would not agree in certain cases <e> <s> but i think the case cited by the noble viscount lord simon would probably be dealt with because in a situation of that kind the student would apply to the local authority for permission to attend the college near his place of work as being much more convenient and one would hope that in such a case the local authority would say that it was entirely reasonable and that they would pay recoupment though they did not have a general agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that those of us who were in the lobby against the government on this issue will not necessarily find any need to oppose the second part of the ministers statement <e> <s> for myself i wholly accept the need for the reduction in expenditure which the government have been seeking but i remind the house that there are more people who do not teach in the education service than there are who teach in the classroom and i am completely confident that savings can be made without detriment to the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this amendment matters one way or the other <e> <s> as to the effect it might have in preventing party political appointments to governing bodies i would remind your lordships that in the provision for co-opted members of education committees this provision relating to persons with knowledge of education has been in the statutes since and i can only assure you that it has had no such effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have been happier if the clause had had slightly different wording and had read to be accompanied by or represented by a friend <e> <s> the fact that the friend accompanies and that the representation is separate may well encourage a more official and authoritiative situation than i think should be the right atmosphere here <e> <s> however we cannot do that <e> <s> otherwise i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are not suggesting as i understand it that the government should say that they will provide boarding fees <e> <s> what this amendment does is to prevent the government from saying in no circumstances will we provide boarding fees <e> <s> as i understood the minister earlier the statement was made that the local authority would not be involved in expenditure for pupils who are given a place under this scheme <e> <s> what he is now saying is they may well be involved in certain cases in paying more than the cost that the government are bearing because the boarding cost if that is necessary full time will considerably exceed the cost of the day pupil <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister could clarify one particular point in my mind <e> <s> we all know that the nature of the rate support grant gives the government no control whatever on how rate support monies put into the grant for education are necessarily used <e> <s> there is no guarantee therefore that the provisions that the government intended to be made in this field will necessarily apply <e> <s> my concern however is with a particular issue of grants namely grants to bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the impact of the failure to make grants to bodies which would qualify for grant from the european communitys social fund if the grants were made in this country <e> <s> in other words the failure of local authorities to make grants for such projects means that we are not getting the use of the social fund which is available for us <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that since the situation which obtains as regards the relationship between central and local government is one in which the only matters over which central government have any influence are expenditure and the function of local authorities to provide services <e> <s> i can cite not one but many examples where the government of the day have deliberately provided moneys for a particular service but of course those moneys have been spent on other services <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene in this debate my lords for while i find myself in great sympathy with the purpose of the amendment i wonder whether it would be wise to write the proposed words into the bill <e> <s> my mind goes back to the preparation of the education act and the concern of the churches which caused us to put into that act a special emphasis on religious education and instruction <e> <s> i am bound to day that in my opinion the standards in that area of education have not improved as a result of that provision <e> <s> indeed i think on the contrary they are not nearly as effective as they were or years ago <e>", "<cs> that may well be true my lords but it does not alter the fact as to the effect of that provision being made in the education act and i fear that could happen in relation to international affairs if these words were included in this measure <e> <s> we are all agreed that education must be concerned with the affairs of the world and we always have been so agreed but to insert these words would not necessarily secure as effective a development of education for international understanding as to leave them out and allow education to be what education should be <e> <s> we have had special provision bodies set up to improve educational standards relating to the united nations to this and to that but none of them have been successful <e> <s> on balance i feel it would be better not to insert the proposed words although i am in support of the intention of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is tempting to go back to the debate on the education act <e> <s> i do not propose to do so although i <e>", "<cs> my lords having regard to the fact that we lag so seriously behind almost every other european country in this respect will the noble lord the minister tell the house whether her majestys government propose to undertake a serious examination of the problem of the education and training of the to age groups and if so when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to those who have taken part in this short debate and i am particularly grateful to the noble baroness lady young for the reply which she has made in considerable detail <e> <s> i venture to hope that there may be an opportunity at some time when these matters can be discussed at greater length <e> <s> i suggest therefore that when the report becomes available on the projects that arc taking place relating to the to year-olds from the community if this is brought before the house we should have an opportunity to discuss it at greater length <e> <s> i am most grateful for the support which i have received <e>", "<cs> my lords following the statement with which i personally find myself in very substantial agreement i merely wish to ask the minister whether the danger in the situation relates to a precepting authority <e> <s> is there any possibility of moving at some time if there are to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i come to this debate in a state of some confusion and uncertainty <e> <s> i am bound to say that when the noble lord lord kaldor was speaking my confusion became very much greater <e> <s> i did in fact accept the view that this nation has been spending substantially more than it has earned for a very long period of time and it seemed to me this offered us two alternatives either greatly to increase our earnings or substantially to reduce our expenditure <e> <s> but i gather from the noble lord lord kaldor that is infantile economics <e> <s> i would not know <e>", "<cs> i therefore accept that there is a case for economy and for cuts because i see little prospect of a substantial increase in earnings <e> <s> i am however very conscious that education looms very large in the costs of local authorities and therefore cuts by local authorities are inevitable <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord the minister will give some indication of when her majestys government will recognise that the unemployment of young people leaving school is not transient but long term and will give serious consideration to the education and training of young people aged from to in which we have lagged so badly behind every other european country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my privilege as well as my pleasure to convey the congratulations of the house to the noble baroness lady lane-fox for not only an interesting but a vitally important speech on this subject and to express the hope that we shall hear her on many future occasions <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> the definition as it stands would seem to me to be in danger of making per cent <e> <s> of the children suffer from special educational needs <e> <s> obviously a majority of the children of their age who have an iq of or below could be argued to have learning difficulty because they would not be learning as well as children of their age <e> <s> it seems to me the important thing here is omitted if the wordabilityis not included <e> <s> the educational needs problem surely arises at every level of ability whether low average or high <e> <s> lf compared to children of his age and ability a child has difficulty he is falling behind this applies whether he has limited ability or very high ability <e> <s> merely to take age seems to me to be omitting the much more important factor <e>", "<cs> l had not meant to speak to this amendment but what has just been said forces me to do so <e> <s> if amendments nos <e> <s> and are not accepted there will be a perfect excuse for a local education authority not to make schools suitable for physically handicapped children but to rely on special schools for handicapped children to come to its aid <e> <s> if the present amendment is not accepted it will enable local authorities to say that such children are suffering from a disability which makes it necessary so to provide for them <e> <s> in other words the simple absence of physical access would cause these children to be categorised as having special educational needs when in fact they do not have special educational needs <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness the minister will look at this point very carefully <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> there is a danger in the present situation <e> <s> i accept totally the ministers concern to keep definitions broad and to avoid rigidity or narrowness but the education act placed a duty on local education authorities to provide for the physically handicapped the deaf and the blind <e> <s> that duty under the act was in almost all cases fulfilled by the creation of special schools <e> <s> that was the method adopted <e> <s> the basic purpose of the warnock report is to get away from that concept to broaden the definition of children with educational need to make a major contribution to integration so that these children as far as possible can be educated in an ordinary school <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness considers the question of withdrawal i should like to ask the minister whether i have understood correctly what she has been saying because if i did she seems to have completely misunderstood the amendment <e> <s> the noble baroness seems to suggest that an ordinary school is to be equipped to meet the whole group of handicapped children <e> <s> this amendment does not suggest that <e> <s> it says that where a child is deemed tohave special educational needs because the ordinary school is not equipped to meet his needs at least one school in the area of the authority should be so equipped <e> <s> so you might have one school which was made suitable for physically handicapped children and there might be another which had some special equipment for this or for that purpose <e> <s> in other words what the minister was seeking units attached to ordinary schools that provided special facilities would emerge from that <e> <s> there is no question of one school trying to meet all the needs <e> <s> the amendment does not suggest that for a moment <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to oppose an amendment in this field but i wonder whether in fact a five-year plan is going to be helpful <e> <s> shall we know the resources available in five years time or not <e> <s> are we to guess at them <e> <s> the important thing for this bill is to alter the attitude of the local authorities and to use the resources as they emerge from year to year to the best advantage <e> <s> i do not believe that making a plan for five years ahead would help <e>", "<cs> it is obviously tempting to be utterly sympathetic to this amendment but i noticed that both those who have spoken in support used the phrasehandicapped children <e> <s> in fact this bill deals with a great deal more than handicapped children <e> <s> it deals with children with special educational needs that includes a wide range of maladjusted children with major problems of discipline <e> <s> this bill may cover one child in five according to all the estimates <e> <s> so what we are saying here is that for per cent <e> <s> of all children who may be or may not be in ordinary schools corporal punishment is to be barred but for the other per cent <e> <s> it remains in the discretion of the teaching profession <e> <s> i am not disagreeing with the intention that handicapped children as such should not be punished but i think that we should be a little careful in putting this into a bill which may cover per cent <e> <s> of the children in our schools <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble baroness lady david has decided that this amendment should not be moved at this stage <e> <s> i had hoped that it would be moved and discussed at some length <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i am prepared to move it if that is permissible <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i raised this question during the second reading debate <e> <s> most of this morning your lordships were conscious of the real problem of effective coordination and co-operation by the different services that would be involved in meeting the problems of the educational needs of these children <e> <s> frankly i know of no means unless a committee of this kind is set up in any way to monitor that co-ordination <e> <s> we are dealing with two services which in most cases are the responsibility of one local authority a third service which is not a responsibility of the local authority and probably a fourth service for which the local authority has no responsibility whatever <e> <s> i cannot find any person or group of persons who can effectively contribute in any way to this co-ordination <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the committee for allowing this matter to be raised today <e> <s> in view of the assurances which the minister has given i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that because of the nature of the society in which these young people will live the fundamental need rather than work experience is to raise their educational standards so that they can be trained for the kind of technological society in which they will live <e> <s> are the government not failing to recognise this problem and to make provision for it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that we have reached the point where there is general agreement that the unemployment of -year-olds leaving school is not transient but permanent and that therefore we should look in the long term to the need to recognise that the training that we are now providing which tends to be training for a specific job is an irrelevance <e> <s> what is needed is continued education and training to on a much broader basis such as is now operative in germany and training for specific jobs to follow that in the kind of society in which these young people will live their lives <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by making an apoiogy <e> <s> my name appeared yesterday on the list of speakers as being one who was to take part in that days debate but it was due to a misunderstanding between me and the whips office for which i apologise <e> <s> i did not intend to speak yesterday but i did intend to speak today <e> <s> i begin by saying that i wish no part of the party political give and take which opened this debate <e> <s> i make only one comment <e> <s> in my experience the introduction of party politics relating to the education service has done more damage to the education service than any other single factor in the last years <e> <s> i wish that we could get rid of it and face the fact that the problems now facing us are beyond party politics they are fundamental to the life of the nation <e>", "<cs> my lords if one deducts from the limit of hours five hours say for lunches and say hours for private study one is left talking about one hour of study a day that is what it reduces to and this makes a nonsense of it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister agree that having regard to the relationship between the targets set and the achievement in reaching those targets local government is very much more successful than central government <e> <s> would he not agree that the point of the question would be more appropriately addressed to central government than to local government <e>", "<cs> my lords this question seems to me to raise a matter of quite fundamental importance on which i would seek an assurance from the minister <e> <s> i wonder whether he would allow me to explain my concern <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise the impact of central control of the curriculum as it was in germany before the war and can he give an assurance to the house that any proposal which suggests that the curriculum in the schools of this country should he controlled by central government would be wholly unacceptable to her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time this question was before your lordships house i made an estimate of the effect of the ruling and was told i was wrong by the noble lord lord elton who was then replying <e> <s> i am bound to thank him for the fact that he was kind enough to write to me a few days later and agree that the answer was in error <e> <s> the effect of what the minister has now said is a reduction to per cent <e> <s> of the present rule <e> <s> my estimate was that the -hour rule <e>", "<cs> does the minister agree that under the present arrangements the -hour rule allows for precisely five to six hours of tuition and to call that full-time is manifest nonsense <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the figures relating to a particular service have no relevance since in the nature of the financial relationship between central and local government the local authority is free to spend money not on the service for which it was intended to be allocated <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the reality is that almost since the last war this nation has paid its workforce more than the workforce was earning and it is time we grew up to that reality and faced the fact that unless we earn enough to compete with other countries of the world we shall not survive <e>", "<cs> my lords am i correct in understanding that where a local authority provides these classes vat will not be charged but where pressures of an economic nature make it impossible to do so the government will gain by applying vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i joined sub-committee c which prepared this report because i had some experience and education <e> <s> i am bound to say that as a member of sub-committee c i have been better educated on things about which i had very little knowledge than i had expected <e> <s> my concern with this report is for the paramedicals and particularly the osteopaths <e> <s> unless i misunderstand it there is a danger as the directive is drafted that they would be debarred from what is now fairly regular practice <e> <s> it is argued that some of the people who call themselves osteopaths are not properly qualified and this is true <e> <s> anybody can put up a board and say that he is an osteopath <e> <s> but unless i am misinformed you can equally put up a board and say you are a doctor and nobody can stop you <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully accept that <e> <s> i did not say that he would claim to be a registered medical practitioner <e> <s> i said he could put up a board which says he is a doctor <e> <s> so can somebody put up a board and say that he is an osteopath and he has no right to claim it if he has no training any more than the other <e>", "<cs> my lords do i gather from the ministers reply that it has taken us nearly years to understand the meaning of the act which provided that every child should be educated according to his age ability and aptitude <e> <s> as the aptitude changes so should the educational provision <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand <e>", "<cs> my lords do i understand from the ministers reply that her majestys government no longer fully accept the quotation from disraeli that precedes the education act <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness the leader of the house to reassure me unless i am misinformed that political education is not within the terms of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the arrangements for students grants in this country are probably the most generous in the whole of the western world <e> <s> is it not also a fact that many european countries operate a system of a combination of grants and loans which has operated fairly satisfactorily for very long periods of time and that certainly the arrangements here are very much more favourable than those in the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a point on the bill <e> <s> i understand that the government have shown less than great enthusiasm for the bill because of the fear that it could involve a significant increase in public expenditure and i want to deal with this point because it is utterly untrue <e> <s> in evidence to the select committee the comptroller-general of patents said that he could see no reason for the bill causing increased public expenditure and experience in germany and australia would confirm that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would be kind enough to allow me to draw to his attention the report of the australian parliament the year before this became operative because of his emphasis on the staffing problem <e> <s> i quote <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that it is a comforting thought that the figure of which the noble baroness quoted represents one-sixteenth of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords as every school in england and wales provided religious instruction before the passing of the education act is it possible that compulsion may be negative rather than positive <e>", "<cs> my lords before the passing of the education act religious education was given in every school in england and wales <e> <s> if the names of the schools where religious education is not given were reported to the minister then quite clearly action could be taken but in the absence of the names i think it would be unsound to assume that the facts were necessarily valid <e>", "<cs> my lords in addition to drawing attention to anything that may be done in relation to the schools may i suggest to the minister that it would be much more important to be quite sure that the colleges of further education are fully apprised of the opportunities <e>", "<cs> i am no expert in the field of energy but i support this amendment in principle on the simple issue that i find it difficult to understand a government which with great regularity badgers local authorities to become more efficient to show more initiative and to become more cost-effective but seem to be discouraging rather than encouraging when they do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does it create difficulty in a local education authority if her majestys inspectors say you must spend more money on books or other equipment and the secretary of state says you must not do so <e>", "<cs> my lords when this debate started i began to wonder whether i would become involved in a party political debate which i always seek to avoid <e> <s> i recall the speech that i first made in your lordshipshouse some nine years ago and i feel that the essential point i made in that speech had some relevance to the debate which is taking place today <e> <s> naturally i made my maiden speech in a education debate and i contrasted the east and the west the east with over-central control and direction perhaps quite efficient but with no freedom and the west with over-devolution which had a great degree of freedom but which made educational opportunity dependent on place of birth or the length of a parents purse <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggest that we examine carefully the accounts of central government and of local government during the years of the present governments while in office <e> <s> in every year the increase in expenditure in local government is less than the increase in central government expenditure <e> <s> i take the education service whose accounts i study every year <e> <s> the transfer from taxes to rates over that period is million a year <e> <s> applied to the whole of local government it is probably of the order of million because education represents half the expenditure of local authorities <e> <s> you cannot carry out that operation without greatly increasing central control and direction in order to impose that policy <e> <s> let there be no mistake the increase in central control and direction over local government probably in every service but certainly in the education service is a matter of the gravest possible concern to those of us who are invoved in that service <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the minister will agree that the important point relating to this scheme is not so much how many take advantage of it but what proportion of those who do take part in the scheme get a job afterwards <e> <s> can he give the house any indication of the proportion of those completing their training who are in employment three months later <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by offering my congratulations to the noble earl lord swinton for the admirable way in which he introduced this bill on the first occasion on which he has had the opportunity to do so <e> <s> i rise in complete support of this bill <e> <s> i disagree with the noble baroness lady david when she says that this is the most important change in the relationship between central and local government this century <e> <s> she must have forgotten the small change to which the noble viscount lord ridley referred as a major step forward in <e> <s> the education service was funded by specific grants from until and showed the capacity for great development during that period <e> <s> but in the local authorities brought enough pressure on the government to have general grant introduced which in my judgment has been a tragedy for the education service <e> <s> i hope to set out the reasons why i reach that conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in the rate support grant for that purpose and the local authorities knew that <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely accept that <e> <s> the point i am making is that the effect of general grant is that national policy in education cannot necessarily be carried out <e> <s> the secretary of state has virtually conceded a complete alteration of section of the education act which provides for the education service to be administered by local authorities under his control and direction <e> <s> he has no power over local authorities at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene i may say that as secretary of the association of education committees he did in totally oppose general grant and so did the association <e> <s> it was largely because of that that the local authority associations made dead sure that after local government reorganisation in the association of education committees would not be able to continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord would make a request to those who produce these reports that they should take the trouble to parcel out the effect of exhaust fumes which they have never done in any report which they have yet produced <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the minister can help the house by telling members what marking according to absolute standards means because i do not understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister think it worthwhile making some inquiries as to why when teachers received two years training the standards of teaching were higher than they now seem to be when they receive four years training <e>", "<cs> i rise to oppose this amendment <e> <s> i was refreshing my memory this morning by reading a little book which was published in entitled <e>", "<cs> i find this discussion very difficult to follow <e> <s> at one stage i took a degree in mathematics but i found the arithmetic somewhat confusing <e> <s> it seemed to me that what we were discussing was a much simpler issue <e> <s> having lost the first amendment seeking that it would all be additional money we are now discussing how close we can get to its being all additional money <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble earl can tell us whether section of the education act has been abolished altogether <e> <s> that section provides for the administration of the education service by local education authorities under the ministers control and direction <e> <s> what i gather is now being proposed is that he has no right to have any control at all somebody else must have it <e>", "<cs> i think we should look at this very carefully <e> <s> if you are going to have a consultative body including local authorities teachers employers and a few other people the idea that you are leaving any discretion to the secretary of state seems to me nonsense <e> <s> after all all these people particularly the local authorities have control of all the other money that is provided in rate support grant for education <e> <s> any of the things they want to do they are free to do <e> <s> all the secretary of state is asking in this bill is that there should be just a little money petty cash relative to the totality of rate support grant which he can after listening to all the advice that can be offered to him decide to use on certain projects which in the national interest it is worth spending a little money on <e> <s> i hope this amendment will not be accepted <e>", "<cs> there is an important point that should be made <e> <s> i am not in any way criticising the need for a re-examination of the whole question of awards <e> <s> i accept that <e> <s> but there is a reason why not all courses have been approved for mandatory awards <e> <s> as i understand it mandatory awards were intended to be restricted to those courses where there were entrance examinations or requirements so that there was some assurance that the student could benefit from the course that was being pursued <e> <s> in the general range of other awards there was not necessarily any such evidence and therefore it was felt better that the local authorities should have the discretion to make or not make an award according to the circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords as a shareholder in the nationalised industries do i gather that it is an offence for a nationalised industry to make some return to its shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords i find some difficulty in accepting this amendment for a very simple reason <e> <s> so far as the education service is concerned the concept of partnership between central and local government was very greatly affected by what happened in <e> <s> in fact it was no longer a partnership it was complete control on the part of the local authorities <e> <s> that is the position which has obtained from until now <e>", "<cs> my lords as this debate has proceeded i have had serious doubts as to whether i should make any contibution to it at all because i find myself unhappy <e> <s> but i have been greatly encouraged by the speech of the noble lord lord todd who seemed to me to say some of the things that i would have wished to say <e> <s> i entirely accept the importance of a complete review of the structure and administration of higher education and in that term i include the polytechnics as well as the universities and other colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised that this matter should be pursued so strongly <e> <s> for myself i am very grateful for the fact that i went to a grammar school and i have a feeling that a good many noble lords who sit on these benches owe where they are a great deal to the fact that they went to grammar schools <e> <s> recently the opposition has been very strong in defence of the freedom of local authorities <e> <s> it is the freedom of local authorities to decide whether to have grammar schools and i am very sad that the opposition should seek to punish those who make that decision by moving an amendment of this kind <e> <s> surely if there are children in grammar schools <e>", "<cs> no my lords but what the opposition is suggesting in the amendment is that if there is in a grammar school a child who would benefit by a project which the local authority is undertaking for example relating to handicapped children or other similar purpose that child should be debarred from benefiting from the bill <e> <s> that i find deplorable <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that since the war there have never been in this country a government who commanded a majority opinion among the electorate <e> <s> is this a true reflection of democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we have not reached the stage where we would hope that the schools would not be used for party political issues <e> <s> the schools are there to educate children in the fundamentals which they require in order to make their contribution in due course and i would hope that we could trust the teaching profession to fulfil the obligations which they have always undertaken with reasonable satisfaction and ignore a minority who are only a nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords does that answer mean in simple terms that since the war all governments have represented a majority of people who did not vote for them <e>", "<cs> my lords is not that statement very inaccurate <e> <s> since the war there has never been a government which had a majority of those who voted in the election <e> <s> that is a statement of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl give the house an assurance that after the changes which have been announced are made it will still be true that the awards system in this country is more generous than that in any country in europe and very much more generous than that in the united states of america <e>", "<cs> my lords far from the point raised by the last questioner will the noble earl secure that the children in our schools reach an adequate personal standard in numeracy and literacy before they embark upon a course in computers <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot make any comment on the details of the white paper because i have not had the opportunity to see it <e> <s> in my maiden speech in your lordships house some years ago i referred to the east where central control and direction in education were effective and freedom was low and to the west where too much decentralisation gave maximum freedom but in fact made educational opportunity dependent on place of birth and the money that could be afforded <e> <s> during these past years i have watched with increasing concern the balance that we had at an earlier point of time in the distribution of power in education being steadily eroded towards central control and direction <e> <s> from what has been quoted in relation to the white paper it would appear to be a major step towards central control and direction in education almost in its detail <e> <s> in my opinion the distribution of power in education is absolutely essential to freedom in a democratic society <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> it may be of interest to the committee to recognise first that this is the creation of an <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> with respect i do not think that at any point in my speech i said what the noble lord is suggesting that i said <e> <s> what i said was this <e> <s> the policy of the department of education and science has consistently been a seamless garment <e> <s> in other words education from infants to further education should be administered as one <e> <s> i made no reference to the teachers <e>", "<cs> no i think one is more likely to obtain results if there is an <e>", "<cs> if i have to choose between the bill and abolishing corporal punishment i go for abolishing corporal punishment because the bill is in my judgment administratively impossible <e> <s> there is of course another solution which is to pay not the slightest attention to the european court <e> <s> i have great doubts about the increasing tendency to be so concerned with human rights that we are creating a society which is so permissive that it leads to the kind of situation that we saw in brussels last week <e>", "<cs> my lords would it help the noble lord <e> <s> lord boothby other members of this house and members of the other place and the police in facilitating access to the house or leaving it if we had labels on our windscreens so that the police could recognise where we were going and why <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister tell us whether in all the statistics which have been produced relating to tobacco there has been any attempt to assess the effect of carbon monoxide poisoning particularly in urban communities <e> <s> that factor would seem to explain the significant difference between the effect of smoking in the countryside and the effect of smoking in urban areas <e>", "<cs> my lords for years i had some responsibility for the negotiation of teachers salaries <e> <s> i am glad to say that we did not have a strike <e> <s> i accept that difficulties can arise indeed difficulties did arise <e> <s> they were precisely similar difficulties to those which have now arisen and they arose when the teachers salaries had fallen behind other peoples salaries for several years <e> <s> it was in that situation that the plowden committee was set up <e> <s> the teachers received an increase of per cent <e> <s> to try to restore the position to that which was appropriate <e> <s> however in the plowden report there was a recommendation which i regarded as being of great importance to try to secure that a similar situation would not occur again <e> <s> it was the establishment of an independent review body <e> <s> we have independent review bodies for nurses doctors dentists policemen the services and judges <e> <s> why not one for teachers <e> <s> that recommendation was rejected by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the secretary of state has an absolute power of veto in the burnham committee <e> <s> is it not a fact that the employers wished to make an offer which the secretary of state banned them from making and that that is what started the trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that an authority may be faced with the simple problem that if they allow children to be admitted to certain schools it could involve additional staffing whereas if children are sent to a neighbouring school with places available which would not involve additional staffing that is no more than efficient administration particularly when the authority is under very great financial pressure to exercise the maximum economy <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the stage long past when education to the age of or training to the age of should be not voluntary but compulsory <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has misunderstood my question <e> <s> when the european communities sub-committee took evidence in sweden we found that per cent <e> <s> of the children continued education or training to the age of and there was no unemployment among that group the remainder left at and there was per cent <e> <s> unemployment among that group <e> <s> the proposition i am putting to the house is that continued education or training to the age of should be compulsory as it is in so many other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord tell the house what is the percentage contribution to the education service by central government this year as compared with years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords when i started reading this bill i thought i had picked up a textbook on the details of administration <e> <s> it is totally over-simplistic to think that if you write down a mass of detail you will get the result that you are seeking <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i wonder if the noble earl the minister can help me on a very small point <e> <s> who is to supervise the activities of the teachers who supervise the better part of children at wembley attending the final of the schoolboys international <e> <s> would that be a function of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i am worried about the situation as it has emerged in the discussion <e> <s> if i follow the noble lord lord plowden correctly the concept of the secretary of state wanting a national system so to speak seems to suggest that the secretary of state is to become the employer of the teachers <e> <s> i know of no case where people who are not employees of the government are subject to such an appraisal <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i thought that that was what would happen <e> <s> i was quoting the noble lord lord houghton who said that that would have been the right thing to do <e> <s> i do not fear the secretary of state taking over the teachers in this country <e> <s> he would not be secretary of state very long if he did so <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i could ask the noble baroness the minister to reconsider this matter <e> <s> i think that adult education is excluded because it is not concerned with vocational training and that is true <e> <s> however if we look far enough into the future it could become an important sector of education <e> <s> the likelihood is that with the advance of technology the working week will become substantially reduced <e> <s> the idea that people will be utterly happy about that will depend entirely on their capacity to do things when they are not working <e> <s> it is years since i set up an adult education body because i was worried about that <e> <s> i am even more worried about it now because the prospect of what i am suggesting is much closer <e>", "<cs> my lords before embarking upon what i wish to say i want to assure the noble lord lord houghton that i agree entirely with everything he says <e> <s> i think indeed that he must have read a little book that i wrote in entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little puzzled about this question <e> <s> i may have misunderstood but i had the impression that the bill created a situation in which the local authority indicated its policy relating to the curriculum and the governing body could either agree or disagree and if they disagreed the head teacher was to be put in the impossible position of choosing between them <e> <s> i may have misunderstood the bill but that is how it seemed to me and that i think is putting head teachers in an impossible position <e>", "<cs> my lords in my opinion this is the most important issue that has come before parliament for a very long time <e> <s> i think it was disraeli who said that on the future of the education service depended the future of the nation <e> <s> that was <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble baroness agree that the tragedy for the education service started roughly years ago <e> <s> for years following the education act there were no party politics in education and the service made great progress <e> <s> the tragedy now is that party politics seems to be more important than the education of our children <e>", "<cs> my lords let me say at once that i am very strongly opposed to this bill <e> <s> recently i have been watching a series of programmes on television entitled domesday <e> <s> i was fascinated by the conclusion that was reached after a study of the history of this country over the past one thousand years <e> <s> it was quite simply that the great secret of the stability of this country and of its strength had been the partnership between central and local government <e>", "<cs> i served on the burnham committee for years <e> <s> let me say at once that i agree that the stage has been reached where it should be abolished <e> <s> i say this with some sadness <e> <s> the essential reason is i believe that over the last years party politics have destroyed the burnham committee and are now threatening to damage seriously the education service <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment for a very simple reason <e> <s> i have no doubt that this bill will go through <e> <s> that seems quite obvious to me <e> <s> perhaps the only issue on which there might be some movement is making sure that the temporary nature of the bill which so many members on this side of the committee have stressed is quite definitely temporary <e>", "<cs> as i understand it there is no question of opposition to teachers pay and conditions being negotiated together <e> <s> that has been agreed by the teachers and the local authorities <e> <s> i entirely agree that the teachers have not accepted it in earlier years as i know to my cost <e> <s> i tried years ago to get them to agree <e> <s> but they have now agreed <e> <s> therefore i cannot see that that constitutes a problem <e>", "<cs> there is one point which i think we should not miss <e> <s> this will be the first time for a hundred years that the secretary of state has imposed not merely an amount of money but also the salaries the detailed structure of those salaries and detailed conditions of service upon teachers <e> <s> this is a major event in the history of education <e> <s> i cannot believe that it does not justify the procedure which my noble friend lord henderson has suggested <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that the amendment would present any difficulties on the point raised by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment is merely saying that those bodies which are now represented on burnham shall be represented on a future body <e> <s> however it does not exclude the secretary of state making new arrangements for negotiations on salaries and conditions of service in further education which include bodies other than those now on the burnham committee <e> <s> therefore i cannot see objection to the amendment at all <e> <s> i do not think that it presents the problem feared by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> this is the most important subject that has come before the house during these two days <e> <s> i do not think the complexities of parliamentary procedure will be understood or appreciated by the teaching profession important as these are <e> <s> every spokesman for the government from both the front benches and back benches has stressed that this is an interim measure <e> <s> this taking of power is only justified in what is undoubtedly a difficult situation and it is only for a limited period until proper arrangements are made <e>", "<cs> i feel that what the noble lord has just said represents a very great danger <e> <s> i am certain that teachers would interpret what he has said as meaning that this is not a temporary measure and that it would be made permanent <e> <s> in other words it is possible to extend this same central control and direction by affirmative resolution thereafter and the teachers will feel that this is what they feared from the word go a central control and direction which is permanent and not temporary <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support these amendments <e> <s> i have a simple mind and i am bound to concede that i find the situation becoming more and more complicated <e> <s> it seems to me that there are certain simple issues on which the house should be clear <e> <s> the first issue is that the bill as it stands will not lead to peace of that i have no doubt whatever <e> <s> peace is what we are all seeking <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one comment on what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> i share his view that when i was young the teaching profession was regarded as an honourable profession and i offer no excuse for recent developments <e> <s> but what the secretary of state proposes is recognition of an honourable profession is offering a teacher at starting point just a year less than is offered to a bus driver <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much wish to support the amendment <e> <s> it is a major step to avoid the difficulties which might otherwise arise <e> <s> a week ago i met a head teacher who was an old colleague <e> <s> he asked me is this bill really temporary <e> <s> i so much wanted to say yes but i could not do so <e> <s> i explained to him the provision which enabled the bill to be extended from year to year <e> <s> his comment was well if both houses of parliament have approved the bill the chances are quite high that they will agree to its extension <e> <s> therefore it is not temporary <e>", "<cs> i was fascinated by the speech of the noble viscount lord eccles <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> i can tell the noble lord that the main objectors were rab butler and chuter ede <e> <s> they had a very good reason for objecting <e> <s> they were helping us to recover from a war which to a very large extent was the result of a rigid national curriculum <e>", "<cs> the national curriculum of germany in required every child in every school in germany to say every morning to live we must eat <e> <s> to eat we must fight <e> <s> heil hitler <e> <s> in four years nazism was firmly established <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind the noble and learned lord the former lord chancellor that mr ken livingstone came fourth in the election for the national executive of the labour party <e> <s> mrs margaret thatcher was at about the same level in the conservative party when she was appointed secretary of state for education <e> <s> i should not put too much money on the future when two out of five electors voted for the present government <e> <s> that is not a majority <e> <s> it is a minority government <e>", "<cs> i hope that when the minister replies she gives some indication of the targets which are to be set <e> <s> in earlier years i did a good deal of research in this field <e> <s> for example at the age of seven is the standard to be that which is suitable for a child with a mental age of four or one with a mental age of <e> <s> at the age of is the test to be for a child with a mental age of seven or eight or for a child with a mental age of or who will be preparing for the next examination at a fairly high standard <e> <s> a target for a given age seems to me a complete impossibility and a total denial of individual differences <e>", "<cs> i very much want to support the right reverend prelate especially on amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i suppose that i have longer experience of the education service than most members of the committee <e> <s> i spent years of my life in the service <e> <s> i have great experience of the reaction of parents <e> <s> i remember a school with pupils calling an important parents meeting <e> <s> twenty-five attended <e> <s> the most recent survey of attendance at parents meetings in the schools of our country showed an average of per cent <e> <s> members of the committee should combine that knowledge with the intention of the bill and ask how many more would vote and would take the trouble to attend an important meeting of parents <e> <s> i can find no evidence that the figure would exceed per cent <e> <s> anywhere <e> <s> therefore i very much hope that the committee will accept amendment
