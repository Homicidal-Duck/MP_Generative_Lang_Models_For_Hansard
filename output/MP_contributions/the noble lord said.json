["<cs> my lords at the outset i should like to say a few words of apology to the house <e> <s> the house will note a series of government amendments in the names of my noble friends lord trenchard and lord cullen of ashbourne and myself <e> <s> my noble friend lord trenchard is unavoidably prevented from assisting and partaking in your lordships deliberations because as noble lords may be aware he has responsibilities for one or two other matters besides the companies bill <e> <s> i hope that the house will accept his apology that he is unable to be here this afternoon to move some of the amendments standing in his name <e> <s> however he intends no discourtesy at all <e> <s> having said that i hope that the house will permit me to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was discussed in committee and i will go over the main points <e> <s> first it deals with an area in which there is some conflict of interest on the one hand the administrator of the law prefers a general and wide definition of anticompetitive practices <e> <s> he knows that circumstances and practices change he wants to be in a position to deal with any practices which in the particular circumstances could be anti-competitive <e> <s> on the other hand the trader dislikes uncertainty <e> <s> he feels that the law should be specific he feels that if certain practices are going to be outlawed they should be specified <e> <s> that is a view which i think should be respected <e> <s> for my part i accept the administrators view the view that there should be a general and wide definition so that anti-competitive practices can be caught even though circumstances might change and practices might change <e> <s> nevertheless i have sympathy and respect for the traders point of view <e> <s> i think at least he should be given some guidance <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my reason for moving this amendment which is the same as the one i moved in committee is to give the government an opportunity to enlarge upon the promise to help to resolve the problem of agricultural co-operatives trying to operate under the bill <e> <s> shall not bore the house by repeating all that i said in committee but would merely say that if the bill is left as it is agricultural co-operatives would be at a disadvantage compared to others <e> <s> i would also repeat that if any agricultural cooperative attempts any restrictive or uncompetitive action it can be controlled at present under the restrictive trade practices act and indeed by ministerial order <e> <s> therefore i hope that the govern-will feel inclined to accept my amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment is of such hideous minutiae that i feel rather ashamed to move it <e> <s> noble lords may recall that during the discussion of clause there was mention of a reference in the clause to section of the act <e> <s> this i looked at closely and as a result discovered that it was a reference to a definition and that it was not section <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the answer given by the government to amendment no <e> <s> a which was in somewhat similar terms to this one and intended to be an increase in the deterrent effect on insider dealers i do not propose to move this amendment <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment i do so with some diffidence in that it is precisely the same amendment that was set down in when we discussed car-sharing in principle <e> <s> in effect the argument i put forward today is almost the same as that which i put forward two years ago but it does have somewhat more meaning in that her majestys government by virtue of the provisions of this bill are to encourage a wider use of car-sharing <e> <s> they have also extended the number of people who may be taken into a motor car on a sharing basis <e> <s> nevertheless there are certain elements of confusion that arise <e>", "<cs> having made clear our viewpoint on the other issue i should like to follow my noble friend lord mishcon in thanking the two noble lords the ministers for carrying out their promises to write us on a number of matters which they have <e> <s> that is not to say that automatically we will do as they request us to do but we appreciate the fact that they have carried out their assurances <e> <s> my lords the purpose of this amendment is similar to that of the amendment which was proposed in committee although now as your lordships will see it is in a more simplified form <e> <s> the amendment in this simplified form is brought forward again firstly because there is a principle involved and secondly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in some difficulty here because this amendment proposes a new clause with the rubric signs on vehicles <e> <s> noble lords will have noted that there is a new clause put down in the name of the noble lord lord bellwin dealing with the same matter <e> <s> it would be wrong of me at this stage to comment upon the new clause proposed on behalf of the government <e> <s> it has not yet been moved and i should be out of order if i were to do so <e> <s> on the other hand i do not want to waste the time of the house in explaining why we have put down the amendment standing in my name and the names of my noble friends <e> <s> i would say that when this matter was first discussed in another place and during the committee stage both the secretary of state and the noble lord the minister expressed some sympathy for the general matter <e> <s> we now have their new clause on the marshalled list <e> <s> i think the best thing that i can do is not to move this particular amendment and to leave my remarks until we come to consider the governments own amendment at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is the same as one which was moved by the noble lord lord teviot in committee <e> <s> it might therefore be questioned why we move the amendment from this side of the house <e> <s> it will be recalled that another amendment which stood in the names of my noble friends and myself and which would have had the same effect dealt with precisely the same matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships will see the purpose of this amendment is to provide for independent arbitration if there is disagreement about the unfunded proportion of the british railways pension funds <e> <s> this amendment will not be necessary if the amendment immediately following it and an amendment to be put before the house by myself and my noble friends are successful because they seek a review of the unfunded proportion at future dates <e> <s> in order to save the time of the house i shall not move the amendment now but i reserve the right to bring it forward at third reading if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i have been left holding a baby <e> <s> it is not only both sensible and just but weighty <e> <s> i can only hope that with the help and the support of your lordships i shall not drop it <e> <s> my noble friend lord selsdon expresses his deep regret that he is unable to attend your lordships house today particularly as his amendment has no party political bias and seeks to ensure that there may be no inequity to either a pensioner of british rail or to the british taxpayer at a date in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall be brief <e> <s> unless this amendment is passed the pensioners position in my submission will be worse off than under the act <e> <s> this is because the funding debt created under the act could have taken account of surpluses existing at st december but there is no way it could have taken account of surpluses arising after that date <e> <s> if i may give a quick example suppose there is a surplus in the gwr widows and orphans pension society at a future date because mortality has been higher than expected <e> <s> under the bill per cent <e> <s> will be clawed back by the government whereas under the act the whole of the surplus would have been available to increase the small pensions provided for the widows and orphans concerned <e> <s> that is the purpose of this amendment and i beg to move it <e> <s> i hope it will be acceptable to the minister and to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this amendment and i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords happily i can be extremely brief because i can put this amendment very simply <e> <s> it has been the practice to offset about per cent <e> <s> of the surplus in the past and per cent <e> <s> is obviously a worsening of the position <e> <s> the figure of per cent <e> <s> has no known theoretical justification and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the governments no worsening promise is honoured <e> <s> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords having already spoken to this amendment i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords these are very minor amendments consequential on the repeal in part iv of schedule to the bill of section of the road traffic regulation act which deals with articulated vehicles <e> <s> as the provisions relating to articulated vehicles do not apply in northern ireland it is correct that part iv of schedule should be inserted in the list in clause of provisions not extending to northern ireland <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this amendment is consequential <e> <s> therefore having spoken to it i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords for the last time today may i say that having spoken before to this amendment i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords in this amendment and in the next two amendments we are dealing with a fairly narrow part of the bill <e> <s> we are dealing again with rental determination by an arbitrator and with the extent to which the arbitrator should take into account rentals of comparable holdings <e> <s> the bill as drafted says that the arbitrator in looking at this wider evidence of comparable holdings should disregard all elements of rent which show evidence of <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee and to the noble lord the minister for having been a few minutes late and not being in my place for the last amendment <e> <s> it seemed to me from what i heard the minister say in response to the noble lord <e> <s> lord melchett that he does understand the points which have been made and if there is any need for correction the minister will take an opportunity to consider that point before report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment seeks to clarify the circumstances in which copyright vests in an international organisation <e> <s> as drafted subsection of clause will apply if either paragraph a or paragraph b is satisfied even though the work may qualify by some other means <e> <s> the purpose of the amendment is to make clear that copyright vests in the international organisation only when it has commissioned made or published a work which would not otherwise qualify for protection either by reference to author or to country of first publication <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a purely drafting amendment that we missed at an earlier stage <e> <s> your lordships will see that clause renders the phrase <e>", "<cs> i beg to move this amendment standing in my name and that of my noble friend lord peston <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i also speak to amendments nos <e> <s> zd and j <e> <s> this group of amendments deals with what is known as the onus of proof <e> <s> perhaps i may remind the committee of the present situation <e> <s> when a company wishes to merge with another company the director general of fair trading has to use his own resources to find out whether the merger is taking place <e> <s> if the proposed merger comes within the scope of the fair trading act in other words it is more than a certain amount in value of net assets or a certain amount in terms of market share of the product the director general of fair trading may study the merger <e> <s> he then has the duty if he studies it to recommend to the secretary of state whether or not he thinks that the merger should be referred to the monopolies and mergers commission <e>", "<cs> a number of the considerations which applied to the previous amendment are relevant also to this one so i shall not delay the committee excessively especially given the division we have just had <e> <s> i am not full of confidence that i can sway any open minds assuming that there are any <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> zc standing in my name and that of my noble friend lord peston <e> <s> at this stage we come to the bill itself rather than discussing certain preliminaries that we were trying to put into the bill and we come to clause <e> <s> clause deals with the prenotification procedure that is suggested <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> a i hope that it will be convenient if i speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> d and e <e> <s> these are purely drafting amendments to replace a defined term which is used only once in new section a with the full definition <e> <s> the definition in section e can accordingly be dispensed with <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> b i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> b has been suggested by the law society of scotland <e>", "<cs> this again is an effort to try to improve the provisions of prenotification <e> <s> the amendment would give to the secretary of state the <e>", "<cs> this again is a scottish amendment <e> <s> the law society of scotland has a problem in that bank holidays in scotland do not necessarily fall on the same days as bank holidays in england and wales <e> <s> the director general being situated in london clearly does not work on bank holidays in england and wales but may work on scottish bank holidays and vice versa <e> <s> there does not seem to be any difficulty in making sure that the bank holiday exclusion is extended to scotland as well as to england and wales <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this modest amendment is an attempt to improve the bill and to probe my noble friend <e> <s> why is there a different test or arrangements whereby the director may at any time before the period for considering a merger notice expires reject the notice if he suspects that any information whether in the merger notice or otherwise is in any <e>", "<cs> this marks i am afraid the start of a series of amendments from these benches which will appear fairly regularly throughout our discussion of the bill <e> <s> the amendments are designed to try to ensure that as much goes into primary legislation as possible <e> <s> it should not be left to the secretary of state whoever the secretary of state may be at the time to make regulations to change the primary legislation which this place has approved or to make regulations which deal with matters which in our view should properly be in a schedule <e>", "<cs> i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> f <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> c adds to the power to make regulations for the purposes of the pre-notification system a standard formula which ensures that regulations may make different provisions for different cases <e> <s> one example is that in specifying time in which material information must be disclosed under new section c we might specify different times according to the location of the applicant which could affect how long it takes notices to reach him <e>", "<cs> with the committees permission i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> m <e> <s> the amendments are important <e> <s> they relate to matters raised on many occasions in this place <e> <s> they were raised on second reading <e> <s> i believe that i heard one or two european matters raised in our main debate on mergers earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> h in the names of the noble lord lord williams of elvel and myself concerns a matter which we have been discussing <e> <s> this is the amendment which raises a question about a point which the secretary of state has already raised <e> <s> we are committed to the treaty of rome <e> <s> the treaty is essentially a competition treaty it relates to free markets and the extension of competition <e> <s> whether or not it is written onto the face of the fair trading act what is set out here must be the case in any event <e>", "<cs> in moving this amendment i shall speak also to amendment no <e> <s> n <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for now introducing a rather controversial although important matter <e> <s> although it was dealt with peripherally when we discussed the burden of proof i believe that i should now deal with it much more explicitly <e> <s> it may demonstrate where we and the government are perhaps somewhat divided <e>", "<cs> the purpose of this amendment is to develop the principle behind clause which as the committee will be aware is making statutory what already is practised under the takeover rules <e> <s> it is a welcome change in the law <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would deal with the anomaly <e>", "<cs> this is a very simple amendment which asks the government whether or not there is a case and this is meant to be a helpful amendment for allowing the secretary of state to delegate his powers to the sib since these are controller market dealings <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this is in the nature of a probing amendment <e> <s> it seems to us that clause has similarities to section of the financial services act in the sense that anyone who provides false or misleading information under that act is subject to a penalty of seven years imprisonment and here we have provision for a term of two years imprisonment <e> <s> i certainly do not wish the amendment to be incorporated into the bill because it is not the function of the opposition to try to increase the prison population but i believe that there is a divergence between the provisions in the bill and those in the financial services act <e> <s> i should therefore be most grateful if the noble lord lord strathclyde could explain why that is the case <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> it is a rare occasion when the opposition can move for a negative procedure rather than an affirmative procedure as it is in the bill <e> <s> i am being helpful to the government in moving the amendment in the light of the fact of course that this afternoon the secretary of state was extremely helpful to us in accepting some of our amendments <e>", "<cs> i wish to move amendment no <e> <s> a and speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we are coming to a very interesting and important part of the bill <e>", "<cs> we now come to section intituled in the margin <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken to amendment no <e> <s> in connection with amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in moving amendment no <e> <s> a i should like to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e> <s> amendment no a is an amendment to section about which we have heard a great deal this evening dealing with the public interest <e> <s> the section sets out criteria for determining what constitutes the public interest <e> <s> the maintaining and promoting of effective competition is one of those criteria <e> <s> another important factor is the control of anti-competitive practices <e>", "<cs> we come to an important series of amendments <e> <s> this amendment is directed to improvements to section of the fair trading act in order to bring it up to date <e> <s> i can deal with the matter very quickly <e> <s> in section a i suggest that after united kingdom there should be inserted <e>", "<cs> this is a drafting amendment correcting a consequential amendment to section of the fair trading act which refers to the various sections of the act containing offences <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this amendment is directed at improving the competition act <e> <s> section of that act refers to restrictions on disclosure of information and subsection sets out a number of enactments referred to generally <e> <s> subsection cites enactments referred to in subsection and lists <e>", "<cs> in our view there is a certain inconsistency between clause and <e> <s> subsection refers to a relevant office-holder as defined in clause <e> <s> we believe that there is also an inconsistency with schedule <e> <s> i should be grateful if the noble lord could explain exactly where if we are wrong we are wrong <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> this is a probing amendment <e> <s> in the view of my advisers the costs of assisting the market in its default proceedings should be borne by the market itself <e> <s> clause appears to envisage <e>", "<cs> i am unclear as to whether original documents are to be provided and if they are not whether the copies of them will be in some sense certified copies <e> <s> the object of the amendment is to make sure that we have this point clear in our minds <e> <s> we want to know whether any originals held will be to the order of the relevant office-holder <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> subsection seems to us to remove the general bar on actions against an <e>", "<cs> it seems to us that subsection is not drawn tightly enough <e> <s> we accept that <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> h standing in my name and that of my noble friend lord peston i should also like to speak to amendments nos <e> <s> j and k <e>", "<cs> the aim of this amendment is to secure that the recreational duty now contained in section of the water act is also applicable to land which may be disposed of <e> <s> the boating interests share widespread concern a concern which has been expressed from all quarters of the house about the freedom which the private water companies will have to dispose of non-functional assets <e> <s> indeed there will be major pressures on the companies to do so and the wider exploitation of their assets by development can be regarded as inevitable <e>", "<cs> i seek to move amendment no <e> <s> with some degree of confidence that it should command support from all quarters of the committee <e> <s> i regret that i was not present on thursday when there was a considerable debate on energy conservation <e> <s> that was due to a long-term prior engagement <e>"]
