["<cs> my lords this amendment was discussed in committee and i will go over the main points <e> <s> first it deals with an area in which there is some conflict of interest on the one hand the administrator of the law prefers a general and wide definition of anticompetitive practices <e> <s> he knows that circumstances and practices change he wants to be in a position to deal with any practices which in the particular circumstances could be anti-competitive <e> <s> on the other hand the trader dislikes uncertainty <e> <s> he feels that the law should be specific he feels that if certain practices are going to be outlawed they should be specified <e> <s> that is a view which i think should be respected <e> <s> for my part i accept the administrators view the view that there should be a general and wide definition so that anti-competitive practices can be caught even though circumstances might change and practices might change <e> <s> nevertheless i have sympathy and respect for the traders point of view <e> <s> i think at least he should be given some guidance <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> my reason for moving this amendment which is the same as the one i moved in committee is to give the government an opportunity to enlarge upon the promise to help to resolve the problem of agricultural co-operatives trying to operate under the bill <e> <s> shall not bore the house by repeating all that i said in committee but would merely say that if the bill is left as it is agricultural co-operatives would be at a disadvantage compared to others <e> <s> i would also repeat that if any agricultural cooperative attempts any restrictive or uncompetitive action it can be controlled at present under the restrictive trade practices act and indeed by ministerial order <e> <s> therefore i hope that the govern-will feel inclined to accept my amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment is of such hideous minutiae that i feel rather ashamed to move it <e> <s> noble lords may recall that during the discussion of clause there was mention of a reference in the clause to section of the act <e> <s> this i looked at closely and as a result discovered that it was a reference to a definition and that it was not section <e>"]
