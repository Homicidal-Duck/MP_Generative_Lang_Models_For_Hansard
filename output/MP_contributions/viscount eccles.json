["<cs> my lords is it in order to ask the noble baroness a question before she resumes her seat <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lady young is speaking twice in this debate and according to custom she used her first speech to introduce the bill which i must say i find rather more simple than some noble lords opposite <e> <s> however of course behind the bill lies the question of the present state of comprehensive education how we should judge it and what we should do about it <e> <s> therefore i am extremely grateful to the noble baroness lady bacon with whom i have had many conversations and debates on education <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but this is true <e> <s> of course the party opposite will not agree <e> <s> it was said the other day in another place that the gap in standard between the best and the worst comprehensive schools was not a little but much wider than the gap between grammar schools and secondary moderns <e> <s> i have done my best to check that <e> <s> unfortunately it is only too true <e> <s> when the noble baroness lady david talks about a child moving from one area to another and moving from a comprehensive school and then having to go to a secondary modern i think with her experience she must know that there are many secondary moderns which are giving a far better education to their children than a good number of comprehensives <e>", "<cs> my lords i am going to come to the range of subjects in comprehensive schools a little later in my speech <e> <s> i should like to take your lordships back to the beginning of comprehensive schools <e> <s> when i went to the ministry of education in it was already clear that the tripartite system which was laid down in the act was not going to be carried out <e> <s> fresh ideas about secondary education were needed <e> <s> as i think the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill will remember i welcome a substantial experiment in comprehensive schools <e> <s> we hoped to get the best of both worlds the educational and the social by establishing comprehensives where the local people wanted them and where no grammar school had to be destroyed schools that were large enough to contain within them a sixth form equivalent to that in a good grammar school <e> <s> the whole range of ability and aptitude would be gathered under one roof and the able children would have all the options available in a grammar school <e> <s> the eleven-plus could be abolished with substantial advantages to children from all kinds of backgrounds <e>", "<cs> i am sorry did the noble lord ask whether the advice was right <e>", "<cs> my lords they could not give me advice on whether we could find the number of head teachers but it turned out that my fears were justified <e> <s> you cannot otherwise explain the enormous staff difficulties in many of the big comprehensives in the cities <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord is saying my lords and of course one of the difficulties about a debate on education is that one can pick out a good school here and a bad school there of every variety <e> <s> we tried very hard to raise let us say the chances of getting into a university i must produce some sort of measure for one school against another and it has been much improved but we have never got it far enough <e> <s> if we had we should not have oxford and cambridge now as a deliberate policy giving places to children from comprehensive schools who have one less a level than those who come from independent schools <e> <s> that is a most extraordinary thing to happen <e> <s> i was saying that the act was divisive and the part played by education in creating divisions in our society has been enlarged and sharpened and by whom <e> <s> the answer is by the labour party which so often accuses us of perpetuating class division <e>", "<cs> which you cannot now <e>", "<cs> i have great sympathy with consultation <e> <s> of course there should be consultation but the problem is this do you put it in a bill <e> <s> what is consultation with children <e> <s> you have a legal obligation to consult children in primary schools as to whether they want their school to be one way or the other <e>", "<cs> parents and children <e> <s> it is in the amendment <e>", "<cs> it is parents of children <e> <s> i take that back <e> <s> i do not read so well <e> <s> but even if it is parents then these things are done in all good authorities and i wonder whether we want to have a national obligation to have this consultation <e> <s> in my village school there was consultation with parents they were over-ruled and the school was closed <e> <s> we had wonderful consultations and it is going that way in the country <e> <s> do we really want to put it in a statute <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something about the constitutional position <e> <s> i cannot say that i have been here more than years or so but to move to leave out the first clause of a bill which contains the principle of the bill is what in the other place would be called a wrecking amendment <e> <s> so far as i know this house has not for some time moved wrecking amendments <e>", "<cs> i am just asking whether noble lords opposite can give us examples of amendments leaving out clause which destroy the bill as they know it does in this instance <e> <s> it is equivalent to saying that we entirely disagree with the other house <e> <s> that may be so but i think that it is very rare to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady bacon i also was caught out by the speed with which your lordships discussed the finance bill <e>", "<cs> i apologise for that my lords <e> <s> transfers have always been difficult for a variety of reasons <e> <s> of course in the first place the grammar schools were building up and they did not want to take a number of boys or girls from the secondary modern schools while it was not possible to shed from the grammar schools the corresponding number of children back to the secondary modern schools <e> <s> your lordships will surely know the ways of parents as well as i do <e> <s> parents rarely mind if their child is promoted but if their child is as it were demoted they object very much and that was one of the chief reasons why the number of transfers appeared to be unsatisfactorily low <e>", "<cs> my lords on previous occasions i have said that if all comprehensive schools were good schools i should be in favour of nothing but comprehensive schools <e> <s> i am taking the attitude on this bill that i did on the bill because unfortunately i know that a very large number of comprehensive schools are not as good as the good secondary modern schools and for that reason we have a serious problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i never said that lord alexander mentioned a number i was merely saying that is <e>", "<cs> my lords as other noble lords have said we are very grateful to my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu for drawing our attention to this working partys report <e> <s> my noble friend is the most popular and outstanding champion of private museums not only in this country but in all europe <e> <s> he has brought pleasure and some instruction to millions of people as the report now says at per head and the success with which he develops the motor museum is surely a lesson for everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend assure me that having cut down the form filling requirements better use will be made of the forms that we do fill in <e> <s> i filled in my livestock form and being completely fed up with it i put down one elephant and two giraffes and nobody took any notice <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend realise that there are a handful of ex-ministers who left the house of commons before and who get nothing <e> <s> this question has been raised over and over again sympathetic <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister enlighten me <e> <s> what does outward processing mean <e>", "<cs> my lords further to what the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts said may i ask the minister is not the most interesting thing at the moment the way in which the inhabitants of the ex-french colonies now want to <e>", "<cs> my lords because it has been suggested that those who have facilities to offer may not really want to offer them i feel that i must say something as chairman of the library committee <e> <s> that is not true of the library committee <e> <s> we were very sympathetic to the idea that members of the european parliament should be allowed to use some <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank the noble lord lord hatch for having introduced what has been already a very interesting debate and one which i am sure will continue to be interesting <e> <s> i should like also to associate myself with the messages of sympathy that have been extended to the noble lord lord ballantrae <e> <s> i had the great pleasure of staying with him in new zealand and i think it is true without question that he and his wife were more loved by the new zealanders than any other governor general and his wife since the war <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with what the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley said <e> <s> it is a fact that some local authorities especially when expenses were paid to governors tended to fill governorships with their own nominees without thinking enough about the interests of the neighbourhood <e> <s> it is that we no doubt want to get rid of and i am certain that my noble friends on the government front bench are as keen as any noble lord opposite that the interests of industry or agriculture for example should be represented <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord beaumont was right when he said that the wording of the amendment was not quite what one would like to see <e> <s> i therefore wonder whether my noble friend could look at the matter and perhaps reintroduce the amendment in a way which made the case for the children because after all that is what we are after <e> <s> this is something that has happened recently and the need to unify the community and its interests is much clearer to everybody today than it was five or years ago and i think this would be a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> i want to make only a short intervention <e> <s> this amendment and indeed the whole of this part of the bill carries my mind back years because of the attitude towards parents <e> <s> when i first went to the ministry of education in there were practically no parent-teacher associations <e> <s> one was formed in wiltshire and i attended a meeting and said a few words of encouragement <e> <s> i was immediately told by my local authority that these were the most dreadful thingsthat parents had nothing whatever to do with the schoolsthey were all ignorant and the teachers knew far better how to handle their children than they did <e>", "<cs> i am entirely against this amendment <e> <s> if its purpose is to give parents some guidance about examina <e>", "<cs> i think the whole committee would agree that the case put by the two noble baronesses in front of me i am sorry that i have to address them from behind is one with which we have the greatest sympathy <e> <s> i do not think there is any doubt about the issuewe should all like to have information about special schools and an admission procedure which was at least as good for the parents as that relating to ordinary maintained schools <e> <s> but there is a second issue here and it is a practical onenamely whether the arrangements in clauses to should here and now be extended to special schools <e> <s> the suggestion looks extremely attractive at first sight as the two noble baronesses have said but when one looks into it one sees that the administrative difficulties are so great that they really ought to be considered before the legislation is brought forward <e>", "<cs> because the parent of the handicapped child will not know where the rights of the appeal are unless there is a definition of both what is a special school and what are the qualifications for entry to that school <e>", "<cs> i have not had a chance <e>", "<cs> i wanted to continue the point raised by the noble lord lord james and the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> we are talking about a minority of children who in the judgment of those who know their abilities cannot get the education they need within the maintained system nor have their parents enough money to pay the full independent fees <e> <s> why is that the situation <e> <s> why is it that we have reached a point after all these years since the end of the war where we do not have a secondary school system that can cater for those children within the maintained system <e> <s> i am as disappointed and i have a little responsibility as any member of this house that our secondary schools are over a very large proportion of our secondary school system so weak in their sixth forms <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think the sum of for a licence is high enough for the time being may i ask my noble friend whether it is possible to ask those who are making a great deal of money out of north sea oil or whisky to pick up as the americans say this tab <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty over this clause <e> <s> four years ago my village school a church of england primary school was shut down against the wishes of the whole village <e> <s> we received verbal assurances that the children would travel free to ludgershall and i expect the wiltshire county council to remember that <e> <s> the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill has said that when i had the duty to push the reorganisation of elementary schools in rural areas as fast as i could we gave some assurances to the rural areas that as the new schools were built transport to them on the three-mile limit basis would be free <e> <s> i do not remember doing that but it is quite likely that we did so <e> <s> i doubt whether it could be found written down anywhere but it is quite likely that local authorities gave that sort of assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to look at what i think is the real problem here <e> <s> it is not vat <e> <s> the real problem is that smaller craftsmen do not have any working capital <e> <s> would the minister be kind enough to look into the possibility of some form of pool or bank of precious metals and for that matter rare woods which have gone up in price almost as much as silver <e> <s> without doubt the small craftsman is taken for a ride by the middleman when he buys very small quantities all he can afford of gold silver or rare woods <e> <s> i believe that if the minister would look into it that would be by far the most useful way to help those people <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord stewart of fulham is trying to obtain information about the grammar schools and compare it cost for cost with that for comprehensive schools <e> <s> that is not fair <e> <s> the sixth form students in the comprehensive schools cost as much as the students in the grammar school <e> <s> therefore we would be misleading the public they will not understand those things <e> <s> i am very much against the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether there is not another point that <e>", "<cs> my lords maybe in some places but it is not so in others if i heard the noble lord aright <e> <s> i do not hear very well at that distance <e> <s> one wants to encourage local authorities where a primary school has more space but perhaps not very much <e> <s> to take on a nursery class but if you say to them once you have taken it on you cannot close it without going to the minister a great many of them looking for economics will not do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to add only a few words <e> <s> of course these plans were very much to the fore under the act at the time when we were reorganising the old elementary schools <e> <s> we then had quite a lot of money never enough of course but quite a lot and the real problem was how to arrange the priorities between one local education authority and another and inside each local education authoritys capital programme to agree that it had something like a sensible order of new school building <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend this question <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble lords who want full information about the working of the assisted places schemes <e> <s> i believe also that my noble friend is right that the place in which to do that is in the annual review of the secretary of state <e> <s> but i think that what we want is an assurance that it will not be a perfunctory paragraph about this scheme <e> <s> it is a new scheme people are very interested in it <e> <s> can we have an assurance that the noble baroness will ask the secretary of state to give us full details at any rate in the early years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say one word <e> <s> i do not agree with my noble friend lord alexander of potter-hill <e> <s> in my opinion this scheme is needed not only for people who can be stretched to the very full but for those children for instance who cannot get good mathematics teaching <e> <s> i suppose they will be selected to go to direct schools which have received this grant and where there is good mathematics teaching <e> <s> we all know that in a great many of the secondary schools today you cannot get to a-level in maths <e> <s> therefore if the child appears to have a good chance to get to a-level in maths i hope that the minister will say that that will be a reason for finding a school under this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall leave it to your lordships to judge whether the speech that we have just heard of course the noble lord is always amusing has anything to do with either education or the bill <e> <s> education is as a matter of fact a very large subject <e> <s> this is a miscellaneous provisions bill which means that there are a number of very different questions raised by it and to which considerable study must be applied in order to discuss thoroughly whether the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house if i may answer the noble baroness lady gaitskell in some other debate in the course of the passage of this bill i suggested a large saving <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i think that there is <e> <s> there is a possibility that some special arrangement should be made for those of to years of age <e> <s> they are very much in the mind of lord alexander of potterhill and if he means to speak he will no doubt tell us about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord realises that i myself gave authority for comprehensive schools and wished them every success <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only a very short time ago that the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the fact of the matter is that as the noble lord lord balogh said quite rightly an incomes policy of the type he was advocating requires a bargain with the trade unions <e> <s> i agree but in the event the trade union leaders did not and very probably could not deliver their side of the bargain and they destroyed a government which had been financed by the subscriptions of their own members <e> <s> it is quite natural that a conservative administration should take note of that goal kicked against their own side especially as we have no financial dependence on the unions <e>", "<cs> my lords the british people at the election first and foremost wanted to get rid of the socialists <e> <s> secondly they thought that other leadership was necessary and they saw in mrs thatcher someone who knew her own mind and whom they thought would <e>", "<cs> my lords that is quite an interesting subject <e> <s> i happened to be in the united states when this great rise in interest rates occurred and it foxed a good many of them <e> <s> but the normal explanation was that property values had increased so sharply that everyone who was getting a hit short of money went and borrowed against the increased property values <e> <s> this being simultaneous with the squeeze of the governor of the federal reserve bank produced the higher rate <e> <s> that is what the new york banks said and so far as i know it is probably right <e>", "<cs> i do not think so my lords <e> <s> i really do not know <e> <s> i thought that private borrowings from the joint stock banks here had not shown the kind of astronomic rise which they showed in the united states <e> <s> the noble lord may know better than me <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the debate that we are going to have later this afternoon could the noble baroness tell me whether any time on the fourth channel is going to be used either for this adult literacy programme or for any other educational programme <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend must see that this decision is very disturbing to a lot of us <e> <s> the government cannot have come to it without having some idea of what are the basic beliefs of scientologists <e> <s> could the minister tell us what they are <e>", "<cs> i promise to be brief <e> <s> in the education act there is but one subject which it is a statutory obligation to teach <e> <s> that is religion <e> <s> whether or not your lordships think that that provision in the act has been well observed i have not the time to go into and will leave to your lordships but it is certainly not true that by putting a subject on the statute book you necessarily get it well taught <e>", "<cs> my lords i am quite willing not to speak if the front bench will adjourn otherwise there are a <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to speak because i agree with the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill that the principle of this was decided when the bill was before us and i did not have any useful comments to make on the details of the order which is before the house <e> <s> however it seems to me that the arguments of the opposition on the financial side need answering <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying the noble lord will quickly correct me if i am wrong that the noble lord lord kaldor has not read the list of the independent schools that have been selected for the places <e> <s> had he read the list he would have seen that some of the lite schools popping out of his head are not on it and that in fact that list which represents only a fraction of all the independent schools has been carefully drawn for the reason that the examination record of the schools is far better than the average of the maintained system <e>", "<cs> my lords given the questions and answers on this matter would it not be a good thing if my noble friend made better known in this country the extent to which the recession is hitting other countries as well as ours <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to join the noble lord lord jacques who always speaks with such charm in congratulating the noble lord lord weinstock on his maiden speech <e> <s> we very much looked forward to what the noble lord would say because success is not in over-supply in this country and we all recognise that the noble lord has made a great success in industry <e> <s>

council have given a per cent <e> <s> wage increase because they had so much money <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble and learned friend think that in the long term it might be possible to have a reading room in the new british library building <e> <s> that would be very helpful to scholars <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord alport for raising this subject which is very close to all of us <e> <s> we are prejudiced in favour of this house but our attachment is not irrational it is based on the knowledge which we gain day by day that a second chamber is a necessary part of our british parliamentary institutions <e> <s> i agree with the last speaker the noble lord lord mottistone that what we want is to go forward to an agreed character of this house whether changed or not still to be discussed but one which is accepted by the principal parties and then it would be possible to feel more secure about our future than perhaps some of us do now <e>", "<cs> my lords although i have a great respect for the director of the victoria and albert and i think that he is very good at his job none the less i wonder whether he has his priorities right <e> <s> now that we teach art in all the schools more and more education is needed in the national museums <e> <s> further anyone who has used that service knows that it is alongside the v and a library which is the best art library that one can use <e> <s> it is not right to divorce the slide service from the library <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the increases in the broadcasts that my noble friend has announced may i ask whether he can give an assurance that the bbcs broadcasts in english will not be reduced <e> <s> i have just come from south america and the need for english

know that the ministry of defence also own houses in andover which are occupied by military personnel and that the andover council would very much like those houses for housing their own people <e>

<s> it is interesting that the two noble lords who supported me the noble lord lord gibson and the noble earl lord perth both have had an extraordinarily wide experience of museums and other forms of administration <e> <s> this is simply because my experience of having been on the board of trustees of the british musuem and then chairman of the british museum and afterwards the chairman of the british library has taught me that there are two ways in which one can manage a modern institution of this kind <e> <s> there is no question of division of responsibilities <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi said that books in the british museum belong to the trustees in the same way as the objects will in the v and a all i want is to be sure how policy is going to be made <e> <s> one cannot be sure as the bill stands today <e>", "<cs> i was very glad to hear what my noble friend lord avon had to say <e> <s> these words were copied <e> <s> i believe from the british museum act <e> <s> there it says who appear to him <e> <s> being myself on the side of the ladies <e> <s> i thought it was only fair as we have a lady for prime minister that i should alter to him to to her <e> <s> if the committee wishes to take it out altogether because it is too big a step towards the new world i will be quite content to leave that to the government to decide <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i suppose i should declare an interest in that i am a senior fellow of the royal college of art <e> <s> i entirely agree with what has been said by the noble lord lord strabolgi about close ties between the two bodies <e> <s> however i believe it would be better to leave it to my noble friend lord avon to consider this when he is considering amendment no <e> <s> because it will be there if anywhere that the royal college of art is recognised <e> <s> i rather hope the noble lord lord strabolgi knowing that i support him and that the college is the closest institution to the v and a will let the government take another look at this <e>", "<cs> i have some sympathy with this amendment but i must say that all trustees like all other people differ one from the other <e> <s> it is awfully hard if one cannot have an exception <e> <s> i ask your lordships to think what the british museum would have been like when i arrived and sir mortimer wheeler had been a trustee for about years he then was a trustee for all the time i was there and he was worth a guinea a minute <e> <s> that could also be true of lord crawford the grandfather of the present earl i am not sure whether it was he to whom the noble lord lord strabolgi was referring <e> <s> he was there for years and years and he had more knowledge about the british museum in his little finger than i ever did notwithstanding all the time i was there <e> <s> i think somehow we ought to fit in an exception for someone of real quality <e> <s> if the government like to accept this amendment i shall not be too unhappy <e>", "<cs> while i support the idea of recycling coming to an end i think that it is coming to an end for example it is nothing like it was before the war <e> <s> in my view there are exceptions and it would be very sad if we ruled them out <e> <s> my memory is not as good as it was but i think that the noble viscount <e> <s> lord boyd of merton was a trustee of both the british museum and the natural history museum <e> <s> he had expert knowledge of both <e> <s> it was extremely useful to both museums that he should be on both boards <e> <s> the same was true of a very distinguished man from fleet street sir denis hamilton <e> <s> sir denis hamilton became a trustee of the british museum at my invitation because there was nobody looking after our publications <e> <s> he did it brilliantly <e> <s> then i found that he was nominated later on to be a member of my board at the british library <e> <s> it was of enormous assistance to have somebody who overlapped those two bodies <e> <s> there may be other examples i do not know <e> <s> but i do not think that we should exclude because those of which i have had experience have been really useful <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear what my noble friend means <e> <s> we now have sir roy strong who could stay until he is if he wanted to <e> <s> i did not know that but i can understand that if it is true that the whole of the staff are now under civil service rules <e> <s> if that is so <e> <s> it is very important to be quite clear that it does not happen again <e> <s> it is really not right that the trustees should have to consider the age of a person they are thinking of <e> <s> they are almost driven then in most cases i should have thought to say well the man must be <e> <s> we have got to have him until he is <e> <s> yet you may want a young man <e> <s> everybody wanted sir roy strong of course <e> <s> he was very good at the job <e> <s> to give him years or maybe years is really a bit too much <e> <s> i am not quite clear whether my noble friend is saying that if we overlook the present position the bill itself will allow the trustees to make agreements for a limited period of years with perhaps the possibility of reappointment <e> <s> is that what the noble earl is saying <e>", "<cs> i find this very difficult because i do not think that we should leave the trustees in the position i envisage <e> <s> they are going to be a new body <e> <s> they ought to have and i think will have much more power than the advisory body that is there now <e> <s> if they are not able to make any changes in the staff until all of those now employed reach the age of this will be very hampering <e> <s> we ought to consider this again <e> <s> possibly i can talk to my noble friend and see what we can do on report <e> <s> it is not right to leave them in that position <e>", "<cs> i shall withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i shall think about it and see whether anything should be done at report stage <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord perth <e> <s> it is important to realise that the trustees have to be a good deal stronger than the advisory body that the museum has had up to now <e> <s> of course one fears about this when as i quoted before the staff of the museum recommend to us that in normal circumstances the trustees should meet four times a year on the model of the present advisory council <e> <s> that simply will not do because it means that there is no clear place where the policy of the museum is going to be made <e> <s> i suggest that the policy must be clearly in the hands of the trustees or else we are giving a director licence to do pretty well what he likes <e> <s> he may be a marvellous director he may be a good director for years or so <e> <s> i am not talking about personalities i am talking about the fact that there will be half a dozen directors before the year let us say <e> <s> we are passing an act of parliament for all those directors <e> <s> we must be clearer than we are in the bill as to who makes the policy <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble earl lord <e>", "<cs> i cannot see why we must have the same for every trustee institution <e> <s> i quoted the fact that in this very bill the commission has this power to pay such remuneration as the secretary of state agrees to <e> <s> i can only say that i have watched the way in which trustees were looked for for the british museum also for the british library and of course for a long time for the victoria and albert when i was for many years the minister responsible <e> <s> i wish that we could have gone a bit wider <e> <s> i have particularly in mind the education services <e> <s> one wants to have headmasters or headmistresses who really have had a knowledge of how visiting exhibitions and that sort of thing can help in the teaching of art in their schools <e> <s> those sort of people need some remuneration <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> when we were drafting the british library bill i put in i think it was clause <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> this is the first time for many a year that i have been lucky <e>", "<cs> i would like to ask one question <e> <s> the amendment refers to <e>", "<cs> i have a short question to ask about subsection which says that the board may sell exchange or give away <e> <s> i do not think that question of exchange is properly dealt with in the bill <e> <s> the antiques market is drying up <e> <s> not only are certain objects very difficult to acquire but when they come forward the prices are astronomic <e> <s> that means that in the future national museums if they wish to complete certain blocks of material will be able to do so only by exchange <e>", "<cs> they are all unique <e>", "<cs> my lords i intervene in the debate for only a few moments because i want to support the noble lord lord lever in his campaign for international action to try to get out of the exchange mess and the mountain of international debt <e> <s> like other noble lords i was glad to see that mr regan the secretary of the united states treasury appeared to be making a move in the direction which some of us in the debate a month ago on the humble address hoped he would <e> <s> i only hope that our prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer are urging him forward <e> <s> it is quite obvious as the noble lord lord obrien said and i agree with so much of all he said that there is hardly anything left for me to say that since bretton woods the floating exchange rates have led to a volume of speculation that has been the enemy of steady growth right throughout the world <e>", "<cs> is there an amendment to bring the tower of london within the purview of the commission <e> <s> i do not think that there is but i thought that some people wanted it <e> <s> in that case i support the government because the departments knowledge of the tower is tremendous and if it is to remain with the department then we must remember that the armouries are part of it <e> <s> it seems rather difficult to say to the secretary of state you are responsible for the whole of the fabric of all these buildings but not for appointing the museum trustees <e> <s> i do not feel very strongly about this <e> <s> as regards all the appointments with which i have been concerned which were finally in the gift of the prime minister the prime minister <e>", "<cs> i cannot understand why the minister has this faith in the minister of agriculture <e> <s> i ask your lordships to look at what happened to the charges at the tower <e> <s> there is no museum in the whole country where the charges have been increased more often and to a larger extent <e> <s> the labour party increased them far more than the conservative government <e> <s> i beg your lordships put no faith in ministers where charges are concerned <e>", "<cs> this is a very serious matter <e> <s> unless we settle where the money is to come from we shall not know whether the commission will be a success <e> <s> the question of taxation might very much change the amount of money which the government have to provide <e> <s> since i am told that the report stage will be within a week of our return after the christmas recess can my noble friend give us an assurance that we shall have the amendments relating to finance when we come back on th or january not a day or two before the report stage <e>", "<cs> i would like to support the point about education because i agree entirely with what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i also think that nowadays one should have somebody who knows something about the media and publications <e> <s> it is clear to me from experience of the british museum that someone who knows about publishing and who could advise not only on scholarly but also on popular publications as well is a great advantage <e>", "<cs> i want to ask only one question of my noble friend <e> <s> can a member be reappointed after five years <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would it not be wise to hear discussion on amendment no <e> <s> rather than to divide the committee on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> seldom have i been more interested in a debate which i think has brought out the experience in your lordships house where many members have served on museum and on other grant-aided bodies as trustees or as chairmen <e> <s> i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords the arguments are pretty balanced but i come down on the side of the government <e> <s> what i have in mind is another point <e> <s> let us take the arts council as an example <e> <s> does the house really think that the last two or three appointments to chair the arts council would have been better if they had been made by the members of the council rather than by someone brought in from outside <e> <s> one could have that situation and consequently would be in great trouble if there was nobody on the board who fits the office <e> <s> i know that does not happen always but it is a worse possibility than the other way round <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for what he has said and for the assurance which i find satisfactory <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i find this a very difficult situation because i do not like having to divide the house against the advice of the minister but i really think he is wrong <e> <s> i believe we have reached a period when to get the best of bodies of trustees the option must be there to provide some form of remuneration <e> <s> it is noticeable that every single speaker before my noble friend lord avon rose spoke in support of this amendment <e> <s> i am particular grateful to the noble lord lord hutchinson of lullington who was quite right about artists <e> <s> here we have not only artists but also craftsmen to consider because the victoria and albert museum is one that represents crafts as well <e> <s> craftsmen are essentially self-employed people and if one asks them to spend time on any form of committee or public duty they will in effect be producing fewer objects of their craft <e> <s> therefore i feel i cannot withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too have much sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> in the course of my connection with those museums i always tried to bring the provincial needs home to the metropolitan museums <e> <s> indeed i think i reminded your lordships at one time that i used to think that the national museums in london should assume the same sort of status as teaching hospitals <e> <s> they should have an obligation to a large number of smaller museums <e> <s> that is one point and i support very much what the noble and learned lord has just said with all his legal knowledge <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> because it is already in the schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support what the noble lord lord donaldson has said <e> <s> i do not believe in insular culture <e> <s> we live in a narrow damp island and we very much need injections of the culture of other countries in order that we may be a civilised nation <e> <s> if one walks through the galleries of the victoria and albert how poor they would be if there were nothing there but objects that had been made in the united kingdom <e> <s> we learn about the decorative arts because we compare one school with another <e> <s> i do not know how one would ever pick out this or that object and say that that contributes more to somebody elses culture than it does to ours <e> <s> we need culture very badly in this country and we have profited enormously by its import by one means or another by hook or by crook and sometimes by crook so that we have these thing in our museums <e> <s> the less we talk about it the better <e>", "<cs> my lords further to that supplementary from the noble lord lord glenamara and while i agree with him that when the act was passed we all thought of christian education may i ask my noble friend to say what happens when there is no teacher on the staff who feels competent to teach christian education <e> <s> is the law then allowed to lapse <e>", "<cs> my lords if my memory serves me aright nearly years ago when i became responsible for education there were approximately teachers in post <e> <s> we now hear that there are over two and a half times as many <e> <s> does my noble friend think that education has improved anything like two and a half times <e> <s> was not the real trouble that the expansion of the teacher training colleges was much too fast that the selection of the students was not well done and that when they got there they were allowed to choose what they studied with the result that the core subjects were not taught to a proportion of teachers which meant that in the primary schools subjects like mathematics went down like a stone <e>", "<cs> my lords once again my noble friend lord soames has called our attention to the world economy and i am looking forward to the remarks of the noble lord lord lever of manchester always pungent and always interesting <e> <s> i want to say only a word or two about the debts which latin america owes to the international banks <e> <s> those who know well that fascinating part of the world always warn us not to lump together the -odd countries in latin america <e> <s> they differ widely <e> <s> they differ in their social mix in their natural resources and in their forms of government <e> <s> however extraordinary to say during the last few years international finance has largely submerged those differences and made possible a single pattern of financial crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me what will happen if the imf and these institutions lend more money to these third world debtors and all they do is to waste it as they have wasted the money before <e>", "<cs> my lords do not the figures given by the minister mean that the cost of administering this scheme will be much more than the wretched amounts which a few authors receive <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the result of the election showed in no uncertain terms that the people of this country want expenditure controlled whereas the arguments put forward by the noble lord lord hatch and his friends were for more and more expenditure and they were rejected by a very large proportion of the voters <e> <s> i am entirely for restricting expenditure and i am very glad that the new chancellor of the exchequer has taken a firm grip on it <e> <s> but may i ask whether there is any information about what is happening to the revenue because those of us who know a little about business do not take the gloomy view of noble lords opposite as we know that our businesses are picking up and therefore the revenue must be picking up <e> <s> how is that going <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend give us just one reason why an american bid for sothebys should be referred to the monopolies commission <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend tell me what proportion of the total vote must the alliance get for it to be sensible for them to abandon pr and rally to our single constituency members <e>", "<cs> my lords as a former chairman of the trustees of the british museum i have an interest to declare and i am very glad of it because it enables me to say with special warmth to the noble lord lord trend that we found his speech moving and entirely convincing <e> <s> the noble lord described himself as a trappist <e> <s> he was secretary of the cabinet when i had the honour of sitting there <e> <s> he was not always a trappist <e> <s> but he rendered great service to his country in administration afterwards at lincoln college and at the british museum <e> <s> for all those reasons we do not wish him to look upon himself as a trappist but to come here rather more often and make many more speeches like he made today <e>", "<cs> my lords as has already been said parliament has treated the arts council well <e> <s> its budget has risen significantly over the years but as the grants increased a flaw of some social importance appeared <e> <s> too much was being spent on too narrow a range of activities <e> <s> in the early s some modest steps were taken to change course but now the recession has aggravated that flaw and in the foreseeable future we shall have more people with time on their hands whether they are employed or unemployed <e> <s> for them the spread of the arts widely and at a rather different level than that with which the arts council has been preoccupied is necessary <e> <s> i therefore feel that i must urge upon the minister a major shift in policy <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the price of books journals and newspapers has actually gone up faster than the price of other things and that of course has made a big difference <e> <s> will my noble friend inquire whether the inter-library lending is as good as it might be and will he also consider whether more newspapers could he put on to microfilm and therefore not have the cost of storing and buying them <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday during the second reading debate on the cable and wireless bill we heard that the policy of her majestys government is to give the people what they want <e> <s> is my noble friend quite sure that they want this coin <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord vaizey has raised a very sad question <e> <s> anyone who cares for education and culture must regret that unesco has been so great a failure <e> <s> the rot set in long ago and it has really become intolerable <e> <s> the united states having lost patience has given notice to withdraw and i am going to urge upon the government that we do the same and withdraw and then rejoin when the organisation has accepted a root and branch reform <e> <s> so what are the prospects of such a reform <e>", "<cs> the noble lord who has just spoken reminds me of the time when i was minister of education <e> <s> i held that post off and on for eight years for longer than anybody else has ever held it <e> <s> as a result of that experience i agree entirely with the government <e> <s> we do not want any of this money to be earmarked <e> <s> the emergency which keeps cropping up is the shortage of teachers in one subject or another <e> <s> it is not always the same teachers who are in short supply <e> <s> sometimes there is a surplus of arts teachers while there are no mathematics teachers <e> <s> i hope therefore that there will be no question of money being earmarked <e> <s> the secretary of state must be trusted to spend the money where it is most needed <e> <s> and these needs are going to change <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree very much with the minister that the arts councils new policy is right but does he think we can go much further in that desirable direction unless the great national companies covent garden and the national theatre are directly funded and taken off the back of the arts council <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the decision <e> <s> when the glc was formed my colleagues in the government wanted to break up the ilea <e> <s> i refused and the ilea went on <e> <s> but at that time we said that the ilea would be a success only if the interests of the children were put in front of politics <e> <s> i am afraid that that has not always been the case since those days <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a privilege to be the first to congratulate the noble earl on his maiden speech <e> <s> we shall listen to him with great interest on future occasions <e> <s> i think that we all know what expert knowledge he has on stained glass and that and other subjects in the arts field greatly appeal to this house <e> <s> i hope that he will make many contributions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord jenkins of putney has said some very kind things about me <e> <s> i hope that they are true <e> <s> anyhow it is very agreeable to hear them and i thank him <e> <s> the noble lord reminded us that when he was minister he wanted the arts council to be more democratic <e> <s> i am bound to say that i took that to mean that he wanted his political friends to get on to the council <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been my view that one should not try to persuade any artist to play politics <e> <s> on the other hand i agree with him i think that we ought to be much clearer than we are as to what is really the role of the arts in british life and for this reason <e> <s> any society will go to pieces if all values and all forms of art are held to be equally important or equally unimportant <e> <s> in art as in everything else we must distinguish between the good and the bad <e> <s> holding that view i should like our public policy for the arts to be based on what history has taught us about human nature <e> <s> what sort of creatures are we <e> <s> what part can the arts play in making life better for everyone <e> <s> we know that we are all different <e> <s> so we all need ladders of artistic experience some short some long but suited to our very various capacities and tastes <e>", "<cs> my lords having lived for the best part of the last three months in or around new york i should like to ask my noble friend whether he is aware how they look at sterling from that end <e> <s> first of all they say that the dollar has risen against all currencies but a little more against sterling than against the other major currencies <e> <s> when they ask why that is it always comes down to the miners strike <e> <s> they are

at the time of the enactment of the act we thought that there would be a teacher in every school who could take an act of worship in the morning and believe what he or she was saying <e> <s> at that time too there was none of these enormous secondary comprehensive schools which make it extremely difficult to get the children together in the morning <e> <s> would the government consider having some form of high-powered inquiry as to whether we should not change that part of an act which honestly is not now possible in practice in all the schools <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to accept that i entirely support the case which he has made on all grounds <e>", "<cs> as an englishman perhaps i may say just a few words <e> <s> i went through this business of national or not national in the title when the british museum library was split off from the british museum <e> <s> a great bulk of opinion said that we ought to set up a national library which of course we need <e> <s> but i would not have it called a national library because i thought british library was much better <e> <s> one does not want to be confined to one national outlook now one

first to apologise to my noble leader that tonight i have to attend an annual dinner the date of which was fixed a long time ago <e> <s> i do not intend to follow those who are really expert in weapon systems but if we are to have the best chance of preventing a war with russia our strategy must embrace assets beyond weapons and armed forces <e> <s> that is acknowledged in a very few words in

viscount lord chandos is right we cannot rely on subsidies all the time <e> <s> subsidies to artistic bodies tend to create either elites or small political groups <e> <s> what we want is the

out the concertina of the teachers salaries and link pay with conditions of work is the best news that has come from the department of education for a very long time <e> <s> sad to say the reputation of the maintained schools at this moment is very low and in contrast to those high hopes that we entertained at the time of the education act <e> <s> at that time we thought that everything was set fair and the main reason was that that measure was an all-party measure <e> <s> rab butler and chuter ede had the full support of both houses of parliament <e> <s> the first ministers of education ellen wilkinson and george tomlinson put the act into practice with no political bias <e> <s> florence horsbrugh and i followed their example <e> <s> we worked in complete partnership with the local authorities and the nut <e> <s> sir william alexander as he was then and sir ronald gould general secretary of the nut were our firm and constant allies <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very serious day for british education <e> <s> it is immensely important that the local authorities should remain in the full sense the employers of the teachers <e> <s> still more important is the education of our children and for that we must have a structure of pay and conditions which will attract and retain men and women of the quality needed as education becomes more complicated and encompasses new subjects <e> <s> when i look at the difference between the proposal of the local authorities and that of my right honourable friend i have no doubt that the proposal of my right honourable friend takes the longer view and is firmly more in the interests of the children <e> <s> therefore i should like to ask the minister whether talks will take place to try to persuade the local authorities that it is not worth sacrificing their position in relation to the teachers when such a good offer is on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble baroness agree that two years ago the situation in many schools was so bad the lack of confidence so great dislocation so frequent and the problems besides pay and conditions so many that it is a marvel the secretary of state has been able to produce so generous a package with such widespread support <e> <s> ought not we to encourage anybody we know in the education service whether parents or teachers to take this package and work on it in the future because there are many other reforms which are very badly needed by the children in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord home of the hirsel for giving us such an interesting speech the kind of speech which confirms the value of your lordships house in public debate <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble and gallant lord lord bramall on a forthright speech about defence the kind of speech that i think we need very much to hear because defence is now a political <e>", "<cs> my lords it is no surprise that education figures so prominently in the gracious speech <e> <s> great changes are very overdue <e> <s> how are our children to be taught <e> <s> what are they to be taught <e> <s> i do not know how many noble lords were present when mr r a butler moved the second reading of the act <e> <s> it was an occasion that i shall never forget and our hopes then were very high <e> <s> but by the end of the s or the beginning of the s the act was already faltering and very soon after that large parts of it were a dead letter <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend mentioned kew gardens <e> <s> those gardens are a special case because they are the best botanic gardens in the world <e> <s> they have lost trees many of which were very rare specimens <e> <s> it will cost a great deal of money to find trees of equal importance and i ask my noble friend to ensure that the minister of agriculture realises that when he considers the amount of money which they are to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am delighted to hear the encouraging news of the economy and while i agree that it will enable us to weather i think that was the word the international storm does it not enable us to do rather more than just weather it <e> <s> could we not use our stronger position to take a strong lead <e> <s> the americans and the other countries and we are all in it together need an example and we can give them an example <e> <s> i should have thought that we could put on the table a substantial reduction in our interest rates if they would do likewise <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been a pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead <e> <s> he has done more for the british cinema industry than any other man i know of and one must always listen to him when he is speaking about pictures in any form <e> <s> having said that i do not quite agree with his remarks but that is no matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that that part of the act was never capable of being carried out <e> <s> from off and on for eight years i had to try to apply it but it proved quite impossible <e> <s> a teacher who is not a practising christian can teach religion but it is not reasonable to ask someone who is not a practising christian to hold an act of christian worship <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from what the noble lord has just said does it really matter <e> <s> clause a says <e>", "<cs> my lords my experience of british education makes me a convinced supporter of this bill <e> <s> that experience goes back a long time because i took part in all stages of the act in another place <e> <s> the war was still on <e> <s> no one then foresaw how knowledge would sprout in every direction or that there would be such big changes in morals <e> <s> therefore it is not enough today for the schools to do better what they have been doing since the war they have to do it differently <e> <s> they have to do both new and old things differently <e> <s> it will not be easy because the way that young people think and behave has been transformed by such inventions as television and the pill <e> <s> the schools find themselves in the thick of the confusion about what is right and what is wrong <e> <s> liberty has much increased and authority has declined <e>", "<cs> this is a very important amendment because it strikes at the purpose of the first part of the bill <e> <s> at present there is no authority strong enough to see that the subjects that should be in the national curriculum are taught and well taught in all schools except for a very few <e> <s> therefore clauses to are designed to fill that vacuum in authority and the full powers are shifted to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord allow me to intervene <e> <s> i said that the main objectors were those who were weakest <e> <s> i never said that they were the only objectors <e>", "<cs> i shall keep members of the committee for about two minutes <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord peston that the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i have not been in the other place for years but i am told by those who are there that ministers are now questioned both on the floor of the house and in committee to an extent that did not exist in my day <e> <s> i was allowed to do practically what i wanted to do which one cannot do now <e> <s> i think that if one wants efficient administration one not only looks for a fair government but a good government and a good government is one which has the power to act <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments direct our attention to the question of whether or not children should be taught the foundation subjects as well as the core subjects <e> <s> i believe that there are two ways of looking at that question <e> <s> i should call one of them internal and the other external <e>", "<cs> my lords if children are not to be tested how can we test the teachers <e> <s> surely that is part of the whole process <e> <s> secondly what happens if a little rascal organises a gang of boys to go to their parents and say lets get out of this <e> <s> very serious disciplinary problems might result <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall keep the house only a minute or two <e> <s> i have had some experience with this question of daily worship <e> <s> i helped mr butler before the act came in and when it was introduced those religious clauses were put in as part of a bargain of which the larger part was the transfer of church schools to controlled status <e> <s> we never expected much to happen <e> <s> i did not become a minister until and then for eight years off and on not one single protest was made to the effect that there was no carrying out of the religious clauses <e> <s> i did not hear from a layman a clergyman a teacher or a bishop <e> <s> nobody ever protested at what i told everybody namely that less than per cent <e> <s> of schools held a daily act of worship <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words about the past <e> <s> your lordships will remember that in the act there were to be three kinds of secondary school grammar schools secondary moderns and technical schools <e> <s> why did the technical schools fail <e> <s> i had a great deal to do with that subject in my day and i was unable to persuade the bulk of local authorities that there was any necessity to have a secondary school primarily to teach technology and so on <e> <s> we were in advance of our time <e> <s> we thought even then that there ought to be special schools for this purpose but the majority of the people who were in charge of educational planning thought otherwise <e> <s> now in a sense the need is far greater <e> <s> the advance of technology all round the world is tremendous <e> <s> if we do not keep up with technology we shall lag behind <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister how much support the government are thinking of giving to adult education <e> <s> the worst mistake i made during my long stint at the ministry was my failure to give adult education the support it ought to have had <e> <s> if we could start the education system again with the billion billion or whatever the figure may be and lay it all out from nursery schools right through to courses for senior citizens and then allocate the money according to the importance of the stages in that long journey from birth to death i am quite certain that we should find that adult education is the least well served over the whole of life <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house and if the noble baroness will permit me does she not realise that outside this house and outside the department most people think that adult education is quite different from further education <e> <s> experience shows that unless the words adult education are in the bill the treasury will not give people any money <e>", "<cs> my lords while i have the greatest sympathy with the amendment and would be inclined to vote for it i should like to point out that there is another side to this issue <e> <s> when i was minister for education i went around all the universities and asked whether they would help me in researching how to teach mathematics for instance and other subjects connected with children <e> <s> i received no response whatsoever except from professor thwaites at the university of southampton <e> <s> he was the only person who helped me <e>", "<cs> my lords i said nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind your lordships that in the days when i was minister the lcc would not accept a candidate to be director of education in london unless he was a member of the labour party <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the usual channels that we are able to have the closing stages of the bill at a reasonable hour <e> <s> the debates very ably conducted by my noble friend lady hooper have been interesting <e> <s> i should like to add my tribute to all sides of the house for the way this great case has been argued <e> <s> in my opinion the worse thing about our debates is that it has not been realised how important is this bill and why we must have it <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can explain something to me <e> <s> i know that i am not very good at these things but if the economy and finances are as bad as he says they are and have been for the past eight years or so why do the british people continue to support the conservative party <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord glenarthur opened this debate with a very fine speech <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him <e> <s> he went round the horizon in a very comprehensive way and showed that there are real reasons for optimism if we choose to work with other countries as we should <e> <s> after his speech it became clear that noble lords are concerned about and the question of what we are going to do when we have as we all want a free market in goods and services <e> <s> do we go beyond that market <e> <s> ought we then to subscribe to a single social and financial policy a common currency and a single central hank which the noble earl lord attlee wants very much and i think would not do much good <e> <s> do we want harmonised tax laws <e> <s> do we want <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a good conservative principle properly to look after the property one has before one acquires any more <e> <s> if there is any money going i believe that it should go to conserving displaying and making accessible in new ways the treasures that we already have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness be kind enough to tell me the difference between a moral and an ethical issue <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> can my noble friend tell me how the per cent <e> <s> is divided as between boys and girls <e> <s> is it not true that girls are more sensible than boys about such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords so far in the debate there has been much talk about under-funding <e> <s> i agree entirely with that <e> <s> i know from experience that without more money one cannot establish the facilities needed for a growing public but that is not <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in the united states particularly in new york the spread has been so great that television pictures have shown children selling crack to other children <e> <s> that has made a great impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i am strongly in favour of joining the ems but we ought to congratulate the prime minister on providing time and space to discuss the two further stages because what the world wants now is not a european currency and a european central bank but a world bank <e> <s> we want the dollar and the yen where we can have a reserve currency again <e> <s> the european currency would not be anchored to anything <e> <s> i hope that what we shall do with our european allies now is to work with the americans the japanese and others to establish a world currency and if you like a world bank <e> <s> trade is not now continental <e> <s> it has become global <e> <s> there is a great difference today from what existed years ago when i was very keen on this european unity <e> <s> i think now that it is not enough <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not impossible to conceive of a social charter which is not based on political and economic principles <e> <s> is it not a fact that the economic and political principles of the governments of europe differ very much some are socialist some are not socialist <e> <s> surely therefore it is impossible to reform a charter <e> <s> we ought to pursue our own ideas on how to treat our own people in industry and not try to borrow ideas from people whose basic views are different to ours <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the attitude of the teachers unions to the return of retired teachers to the schools and more particularly for part-time service <e>", "<cs> my lords if the government are to reconsider the position of these elderly widows will they also please remember members of parliament who retired from the other place before <e> <s> we receive a pension that is a minute fraction of the pension received by those who retired after <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no one in your lordships house who knows more about nuclear weapons than my noble friend lord zuckerman and probably no one who knows less than i do <e> <s> i hope therefore he will excuse me if i do not follow him but return to europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew lord stewart for very many years <e> <s> we sat on opposite sides of another place and of your lordships house <e> <s> i admired his judgment and his honesty <e> <s> i shall miss him <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord jenkins of hillhead and the noble earl lord russell have had very bad luck <e> <s> if their amendment had come first there might have been some reason to approve it <e> <s> the first amendment gave us the assurance that the governments plan would be subject to the affirmative procedure <e> <s> therefore we will see what they propose to do and will have a chance to discuss it <e>", "<cs> unless we bring part-time students into the bill we shall simply show that we do not know the way that the world is going <e> <s> more and more people especially women have two jobs one full-time and one half-time <e> <s> but some people have only one job which is half-time <e> <s> why is that <e> <s> it is simply the result of technology <e> <s> the advance in technology means that one must use modern equipment right round the clock otherwise one makes no profit <e> <s> to make a profit one has to operate a shift system and thus create a great many more part-time jobs <e>", "<cs> i beg the ministers pardon <e> <s> he works all the time but he gets better pay <e> <s> for well over a century parliament has started at half-past two in the afternoon <e> <s> it did so in order that members should have the morning in which to gain experience that was very important and some money on which to live <e> <s> when i entered the other place i was paid a year <e> <s> i could not live on that so i earned some money in the mornings <e> <s> it was a very good balanced life <e> <s> i believe that such a balanced life will come back in our society as a result of advances in knowledge <e>", "<cs> i was at oxford the other day and i spoke to the heads of two colleges <e> <s> they both said that removal of the housing benefit was the one black spot in the whole of this loan scheme <e> <s> i do not know what it costs but if a student can obtain a room in college it seems that the difference between that and probably a rather bad room from a landlady in oxford is a year <e> <s> if nothing is done about that one is creating a disabled class namely those who cannot get rooms in college <e>", "<cs> if my noble friend is right that from next autumn students who are not living in college accommodation will get enough money to live quite well outside college then those who are living inside college are getting too much money and we ought to take some away <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend lord home for introducing the debate in a speech to which we all listened and from which we all learnt something <e> <s> i am also pleased to follow the noble lord lord greenhill because his knowledge of foreign affairs is unsurpassed in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in favour of part-time students as i said at committee stage <e> <s> i should like the minister to tell me one thing <e> <s> are the government against them because they cost money or because they do not think much of part-time courses <e>", "<cs> my lords is it really worth worrying about the privatisation point <e> <s> here is a company which is going to make loans without inquiring into the financial status of the borrowers <e> <s> it is bound to become insolvent <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want the universities to divert money to this scheme which they would otherwise spend on other forms of education <e> <s> however i do not see why they should be given a blank cheque to hire as many people as they like in order to administer it <e> <s> therefore what should one do <e> <s> i believe the answer is simple <e> <s> the money should come from the access fund <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the government are willing to pay the costs but they wish to know what scheme will be brought in <e> <s> it is no good saying that all schemes cost the same money <e> <s> the scheme might be computerised it might not <e> <s> one must find that out first <e> <s> if i were minister i should not be willing to trust all the universities to produce a good efficient economic scheme <e> <s> we wish to know that factor before the taxpayer is asked to pay the money <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by echoing what the noble baroness lady seear said about my noble friend lord caithness <e> <s> he has managed a difficult situation extremely well <e> <s> i have taken a good many education bills i do not <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend think that the way in which credit cards are advertised and pressed upon the public has something to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords if an object is exported without a licence is there any way in which we can recover it <e> <s> recently a valuable early map of louisiana appeared on the new york market <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a few words to what the noble lord lord annan said <e> <s> twenty years ago i had a striking lesson in the power of international news services <e> <s> at a unesco conference in helsinki the russians asked for powers to stop ideas crossing their borders <e> <s> their minister of culture a beautiful and able woman ekaterina <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment for a different reason that is because the power of television has been increasing is increasing and is going to increase so enormously that it must play a different and greater part in the life not only of this country but of the whole world <e> <s> governments will have to address themselves to the limits to which a giant adolescent of this kind can be allowed to go <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady dunn will have been aware how many of your lordships were eagerly looking forward to her speech <e> <s> i am very fortunate that it falls to me to tell her on <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> in those days i thought that we could run the show <e> <s> i do not believe that we can do
