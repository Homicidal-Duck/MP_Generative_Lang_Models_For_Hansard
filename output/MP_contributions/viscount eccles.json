["<cs> i have sympathy with what the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley said <e> <s> it is a fact that some local authorities especially when expenses were paid to governors tended to fill governorships with their own nominees without thinking enough about the interests of the neighbourhood <e> <s> it is that we no doubt want to get rid of and i am certain that my noble friends on the government front bench are as keen as any noble lord opposite that the interests of industry or agriculture for example should be represented <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord beaumont was right when he said that the wording of the amendment was not quite what one would like to see <e> <s> i therefore wonder whether my noble friend could look at the matter and perhaps reintroduce the amendment in a way which made the case for the children because after all that is what we are after <e> <s> this is something that has happened recently and the need to unify the community and its interests is much clearer to everybody today than it was five or years ago and i think this would be a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> i want to make only a short intervention <e> <s> this amendment and indeed the whole of this part of the bill carries my mind back years because of the attitude towards parents <e> <s> when i first went to the ministry of education in there were practically no parent-teacher associations <e> <s> one was formed in wiltshire and i attended a meeting and said a few words of encouragement <e> <s> i was immediately told by my local authority that these were the most dreadful thingsthat parents had nothing whatever to do with the schoolsthey were all ignorant and the teachers knew far better how to handle their children than they did <e>", "<cs> i am entirely against this amendment <e> <s> if its purpose is to give parents some guidance about examina <e>", "<cs> i think the whole committee would agree that the case put by the two noble baronesses in front of me i am sorry that i have to address them from behind is one with which we have the greatest sympathy <e> <s> i do not think there is any doubt about the issuewe should all like to have information about special schools and an admission procedure which was at least as good for the parents as that relating to ordinary maintained schools <e> <s> but there is a second issue here and it is a practical onenamely whether the arrangements in clauses to should here and now be extended to special schools <e> <s> the suggestion looks extremely attractive at first sight as the two noble baronesses have said but when one looks into it one sees that the administrative difficulties are so great that they really ought to be considered before the legislation is brought forward <e>", "<cs> because the parent of the handicapped child will not know where the rights of the appeal are unless there is a definition of both what is a special school and what are the qualifications for entry to that school <e>", "<cs> i have not had a chance <e>", "<cs> i wanted to continue the point raised by the noble lord lord james and the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> we are talking about a minority of children who in the judgment of those who know their abilities cannot get the education they need within the maintained system nor have their parents enough money to pay the full independent fees <e> <s> why is that the situation <e> <s> why is it that we have reached a point after all these years since the end of the war where we do not have a secondary school system that can cater for those children within the maintained system <e> <s> i am as disappointed and i have a little responsibility as any member of this house that our secondary schools are over a very large proportion of our secondary school system so weak in their sixth forms <e>", "<cs> my lords while i think the sum of for a licence is high enough for the time being may i ask my noble friend whether it is possible to ask those who are making a great deal of money out of north sea oil or whisky to pick up as the americans say this tab <e>", "<cs> i am in some difficulty over this clause <e> <s> four years ago my village school a church of england primary school was shut down against the wishes of the whole village <e> <s> we received verbal assurances that the children would travel free to ludgershall and i expect the wiltshire county council to remember that <e> <s> the noble lord lord alexander of potterhill has said that when i had the duty to push the reorganisation of elementary schools in rural areas as fast as i could we gave some assurances to the rural areas that as the new schools were built transport to them on the three-mile limit basis would be free <e> <s> i do not remember doing that but it is quite likely that we did so <e> <s> i doubt whether it could be found written down anywhere but it is quite likely that local authorities gave that sort of assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to look at what i think is the real problem here <e> <s> it is not vat <e> <s> the real problem is that smaller craftsmen do not have any working capital <e> <s> would the minister be kind enough to look into the possibility of some form of pool or bank of precious metals and for that matter rare woods which have gone up in price almost as much as silver <e> <s> without doubt the small craftsman is taken for a ride by the middleman when he buys very small quantities all he can afford of gold silver or rare woods <e> <s> i believe that if the minister would look into it that would be by far the most useful way to help those people <e>"]
