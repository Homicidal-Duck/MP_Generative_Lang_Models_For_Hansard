["<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am grateful to be able to speak on the worthy motion proposed by my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal <e> <s> defence is a field in which people are involved in many ways the family the clubs the different groups within society for example the consumers groups <e> <s> each feels the need for safeguards to protect its interests <e> <s> naturally we will not belong to all groups but any decent person will honour those groups of individuals <e> <s> there is another defence that involves all and brings all together <e> <s> this defence is necessary if full liberty and freedom are to he present for every man woman and child <e> <s> such liberty enables people to feel that they can go about their business in peace without fear as decent and honest citizens who wish to do their particular work in life for family and country <e> <s> this defence of liberty involves cost and sacrifice if we wish to have it as it does for any group within society <e> <s> there is the need of the element of understanding respect and honour <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not true to say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that i heartily agree with the words of the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> from the angle of my church the church of england i am sure we agree with what he has said one is playing with something which could be dangerous fire as well as something which could be very good <e> <s> what he said was very sound <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say how much i agree with those who have expressed their concern <e> <s> many church people and others would be most concerned if overseas aid was likely to become less in any way weaker or not so effective <e> <s> the people of chippenham the area in which i live sent a petition asking that if anything overseas aid should be increased <e> <s> many of us believe that we can give moral and spiritual aid and we must presumably trust that so far as possible overseas aid will be used for good rather than shall i say <e> <s> not good things <e> <s> as the noble lord lord soper and the right reverend prelate have said many church people will be concerned if this link because that is what it is becomes weaker and less <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his answer <e> <s> however is it not possible that in ones zealousness to get the economic situation right one can overcut or overcut too quickly in much the same way as one can overspend and that the problem has a greater dimension than economics <e> <s> therefore through the economic wizards could the government give a little encouragement to the ordinary people of this land <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord strauss on his maiden speech and as many other have done to thank my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my lords the leading article of <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is considered right and proper to compete in sport against the russians and even possibly in moscow would the minister not consider that it is about time that we let ourselves and the rest of the world compete with the south africans in sport <e>", "<cs> i support the minister in opposing the amendment <e> <s> so far as primary schools are concerned from my experience of being a manager of church-controlled primary schools i would say that the system for appointing managers works very well <e> <s> they are known and in my view those appointed <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord in asking whether these amendments are really necessary because there are handbooks which are given out to one when one becomes a governor <e> <s> wiltshire do as inner london education do and give you a handbook more than onethey run courses and are planning to do more and more for governors and managers <e> <s> so i should have thought that if my noble friend the minister could just hint to all local education authorities that they should do this sort of thing the necessity of an amendment could be avoided <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness and the other noble lords who have supported this amendment <e> <s> i myself and indeed all clergy have sent to us yearly at least all church of england clergy do the pamphlet which deals with all these things <e> <s> but i must admit that i am inclined to say to people that they will get expert advice if they go to an advice bureau <e> <s> i know that it would not he expert advice that i would give even with the use of the pamphlet <e> <s> i support the noble baronesss amendment wholeheartedly and i hope the government will be able somehow to see their way to implementing her suggestion <e>", "<cs> i would like to support lord wells-pestell which may surprise some of my noble friends on this side <e> <s> on reading a different matter on this subject i can only say that there is a sense in which in spirit i have felt a little disturbed and unhappy <e> <s> i think my noble friends here and the noble baroness lady young know that as far as possible i do my best to support her majestys government but on this occasion i have an uneasy conscience and i do not think i really can <e> <s> i have to be truthful and say that if i had been able to be here yesterday i most probably would have found myself supporting noble lords opposite on most of the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords no matter how distasteful it may be i believe it is necessary that we and our friends be prepared to defend ourselves and in my view the first prupose of the present government and of previous <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his answer may i ask whether he does not agree that for the health of soul and mind it is not right that there should be unemployment <e> <s> would he agree that it is not right to be satisfied just to check unemployment and would he give an assurance that no stone will be left unturned and that every effort will be put into finding a way of creating work so that unemployment is not just checked but it is slowly brought down <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer but would he not agree that as well as hearing about whether there is racial equality or inequality it would be good if we could hear from the government not only this government but other governments that we are working for the dignity honour and respect of all peoples both men and women <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that it would be good if those words were heard more from governments and if governments gave a lead in that respect <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord hylton and the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> looking ahead i shall also support the amendment of the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale though whether it is moved will depend on what happens to this amendment <e> <s> as certain other noble lords have said i feel that we may forget about caring properly for some old people <e> <s> quite a few old people like to look after themselves and are quite capable of doing so but there are others who need our help <e> <s> i agree with those who have said that small places and villages need to have some bungalows for old people <e> <s> it is good for the place and for the people as well as for the old people <e> <s> therefore i support the amendment and later i shall support wholeheartedly the amendment of the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale <e>", "<cs> my lords there are some of us on this side of the house who are not completely happy with this bill <e> <s> i believe that it was on the second day of the committee stage that i said that i was not completely happy and i was sorry that i had not been able to be present on the first day of the committee when i would not have been able to support the government <e> <s> there are those of us on this side who are not happy and i know that some on the other side are aware of that <e> <s> it may need courage to stand up and say this but i hope that there are some on this side who still if necessary can have the moral and spiritual courage so to do <e> <s> if you hold dear to anything and if you really are a friend of a friend you are prepared sometimes to say that you do not quite agree <e> <s> on the whole i hold dear to my party i have not always and as its friend once again i am bound to say that i hope this time it will be able to show that it has other matters to think about besides just cuts and that it is also dealing with people human beings a man a woman and a child who have a soul and a spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel highly honoured to be able to speak in a debate in which noble lords such as the noble earl lord longford the noble lord lord hooson and the noble lord lord hunt have taken part <e> <s> possibly the only criterion i have for saying anything in a debate like this is that i have always been interested in the subject and also that as a priest one does have ex-prisoners appearing on ones doorstep or even those who have absconded either from prison or from borstal <e> <s> the impression which is left on one so far as i am concerned is this how can we help these people to find a place a meaning in life <e> <s> that is the great majority who one feels sure would want to deep down <e> <s> therefore i would agree with other speakers who have said that no time and no energy would be wasted or could be wasted in finding out the most effective and best parole system a system which would really help the man or woman to re-find life again especially those who are not so strong-minded as others those who are easily led astray to re-find what perhaps they had earlier in their lives a meaning a hope and also moral and spiritual purpose <e>", "<cs> i would ask my noble friend the minister to accept the amendment <e> <s> as i understand it it seems to be reasonably sound and fair <e> <s> there are many cases where the question has been raised whether it is right that the secretary of state should have so much power <e> <s> i believe that we must be careful that too much overriding power is not given to the secretary of state <e> <s> it could be dangerous for whoever the secretary of state is and of whatever party <e>", "<cs> i hope her majestys government and the noble earl lord mansfield will be able to accept the amendment of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> if there is a division and if i am still able to be here probably i shall compel myself to be here i feel i would wish to support the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> possibly that may not be a surprise to noble lords <e> <s> if i remember aright i was one of those who helped to achieve that majority of which was mentioned by the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i hope the government will be able to accept this amendment <e> <s> if they cannot then presumably the noble earl will have to give a very good reason why they cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to support my noble friend opposite <e> <s> i think there are some good educational programmes of various sorts on bbc and itv but and it is a large but there are many of us i for one who would like more programmes of really good educational content <e> <s> as i say there are some on bbc and itv but we could certainly do with some more <e> <s> that is why at this time i will support the amendment of the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> i hope this fourth channel will give us more educational content programmes from which we really can receive knowledge <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to say how good it is to hear the intention expressed in her majestys most gracious speech that her majestys government intend to bring before your lordships legislation to <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i rise to support the noble baroness lady masham of ilton in respect of her motion <e>", "<cs> i have my name down on this amendment <e> <s> i hope the government will consider it and if they cannot accept it then come back to it at report stage <e> <s> having read the different matter on it i should like to support the noble lord lord donaldson that it seems sensible that the nature conservancy council should be given this task <e> <s> it is appropriate and i cannot see why it should cause any ill-feeling in any way <e> <s> in reading all the matter which i have read about it from different bodies i would have thought that they should not be afraid to take this on <e> <s> if they need more money surely that is one body for which the government should try to find a means of supplying the necessary finance <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will be able to accept this amendment but if they cannot accept it i hope that they will look into the amendment of the noble lord lord melchett because as the noble lord lord underhill has just said are the government really taking note of the information coming to them as regards the sad fact that our countryside is being spoiled <e>", "<cs> in view of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord avebury and the noble lord lord underhill because i also have had quite a reasonable amount of information given to me which clearly suggests that you cannot just say that it is only the recognised dairy breed bulls that are dangerous <e> <s> all bulls are dangerous <e> <s> if we are talking about anything like cows with their calves that is a different matter <e> <s> in fact i was thrown by a cow when i was <e>", "<cs> presumably as the noble lord lord avebury said and as my information shows farmers would not lose much land and it would surely still be feasible <e> <s> there would still be the land for that to be done <e> <s> i really cannot see how that can be put forward as a reason <e>", "<cs> on this occasion i would support my noble friends the right reverend prelates in their amendment <e> <s> i was not able to be here during the second reading of the noble baronesss bill but reading it and listening carefully on other occasions when this subject has been discussed and listening carefully today i too feel as one who would support it we are not wanting to be holier than thou we are wanting to safeguard as the right reverend prelate the bishop of winchester said the holiness and the loveliness of marriage <e> <s> there can be openness of affection without it being felt that that affection has got to lead to a man and woman becoming husband and wife where there can just be that loving open affection in a household between men and women who can feel they have an affection without having to go to the extent of marriage to the physical side <e> <s> surely in having that feeling we are not wanting to keep outdated taboos <e> <s> we have the greatest feeling for men and women and the greatest feeling that young girls should be able to be brought up to realise that and to realise that men have respect for them <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in sympathetic support of my noble friend lord sudeley and also to say how grateful we are for the two fine maiden speeches we have had on this subject <e> <s> first of all i should like to say that i appreciate the work and intention of those who have been responsible for giving us the the alternative service book <e> <s> the concern of those of us who feel that the book of common prayer is still relevant for our present time comes from many deeply-felt convictions <e> <s> these convictions are held in sincerity as much as are the convictions of those who <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his answer which perhaps affords some glimmer of hope <e> <s> will he agree that the lebanese christians will not become as i believe they could become the forgotten people or people whose existence could be overrun by we know who <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i shall simply say that i hope my noble friend the minister will feel able to accept it <e> <s> i was not able to be present in your lordships house at the second reading but in a previous debate which dealt with the disabled i did make the point that so far as possible buildings should be suitable for the disabled in addition to any aids or equipment <e> <s> i hope the noble baroness the minister will support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord spens in his amendment <e> <s> it seems to me a very reasonable one and i think that the noble lords opposite who have spoken in his support have made their position clear <e> <s> it is complicated like many others one finds it very complicated but i believe they have a point concerning the children of whom they are thinking <e> <s> i hope that her majestys government will give earnest consideration to this amendment moved by the noble lord lord spens and to what has been said in support of it by the other peers who have so far spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i basically support the amendment and i agree with the noble lord who has just spoken that it would probably be more sensible to have a report every two or three years <e> <s> the secretary of state whoever he or she was would still have to make the report <e> <s> if the noble baroness would agree to alter the amendment so as to provide for a report every two or three years it would have my full support <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> parents would be able to help far more if they had these reports <e> <s> you can get a far better idea by reading a report than by just listening to the professionals <e> <s> if one has in any way been associated with anybody who has a child with any kind of disability as has been said already one knows that all the help possible is needed for those parents <e> <s> i am sure that the majority of parents would be helped in this way <e> <s> therefore i fully support the amendment of my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like the government to give this some consideration and to accept the amendment moved by my noble friend lord geddes and after having heard the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and others i find myself supporting the amendment which seems sound and appropriate <e>", "<cs> i have been doing my best to support the government my lords <e> <s> i did not vote in the first division and in the second one i voted for the government <e> <s> this time however for the sake of conscience i must support the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> one cannot have strong enough safeguards on weapons whatever their use or purpose and therefore i shall support lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend the minister not agree that it is unfair <e> <s> can he not give some assurance that this test can be stopped as soon as possible because so far as i can gather it puts the people who have to apply in a very awkward situation <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i would like as others have done to congratulate the maiden speakers <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to give support to my noble friend lord nugent <e> <s> lord nugent has prepared this bill in a very thorough and reasonable way <e> <s> the voice of concern over the effect and influence of the dissemination of pornography needs every so often to be clearly heard in fact has the right to be heard to balance the arguments expressed as a result of opposing views <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord underhill that if the amendment moved by the noble lord lord jacques cannot be agreed to we should oppose the bill for the reasons which the noble lord lord underhill gave <e> <s> surely there ought to be one day in the week when a man and a woman need not think of money-making <e> <s> that is one reason why i support the noble lord lord jacques <e> <s> as the noble lord lord underhill said unless we are careful sunday will become just another money-making day <e> <s> i know that there have to be gas and electricity but surely one ought to try to keep to a minimum the supply of such necessary services <e> <s> this is one day in the week which ought to be kept apart for worship and for healthy recreation <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with pleasure that i rise to support lady stedmans motion regarding the department of transport report <e>", "<cs> my lords i too will support this amendment <e> <s> i hope her majestys government and my noble friend lord elton will be able to say that they will find a way to agree to this <e> <s> as has been said it is not nice for the young who are fit to have to stand up to our prisons but for those who are not fit in any way it is even worse <e> <s> so i do hope her majestys government will be able to respond <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me great pleasure to join in with all the previous speakers <e> <s> first i must give my apologies because as soon as i have finished speaking i shall have to dash to catch a train <e> <s> in my conscience i feel that when i come to your lordships house i ought to be back at home not too late so that if anyone rings me up i shall be there to answer him <e> <s> listening to this debate and other similar previous debates the word which comes to my mind is participation <e> <s> to me it seems that the public are made more aware of the need of the disabled to take a full part in life be it work life or social life including pleasure and recreation by the way that the voluntary and statutory bodies and her majestys government are seen to be working together <e> <s> i believe that that is happening <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment which seems a very reasonable one <e> <s> i hope that her majestys government will be able to accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor for his useful reply <e> <s> may i ask whether it is not right that we should try to bring back to marriage all the moral and spiritual incentives so that the health of mind and body of our children and also of us men and women is restored and we are saved from the great sadness wretchedness and unhappiness which we know exists and which people like myself come across so often <e> <s> is there not a probability that in the next decade if things go on as they are there could be five million children of one-parent families rather than the present one million <e> <s> is it right that the present system contributes to the maintenance of that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for his answer <e> <s> may i ask him whether he thinks it proper that pua should have only one welfare officer for the whole of britain <e> <s> may i also ask him whether he has an answer to the two supplementary questions of which i gave him notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord the minister for that reply <e> <s> i put my question very shortly because a short time ago i apparently spent rather too long on a previous question <e> <s> i will give the noble lords answer due consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that i will give his answer due consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say that i shall be voting for the bill of the noble lord lord molloy unless the speaker who is to wind up can persuade me otherwise <e> <s> i shall do so on the principle that we must do all we can to prevent men or women from feeling that they are not human <e> <s> if that means sacrifice for the rest of us we must be prepared for it <e> <s> as another speaker has already pointed out any defects which there may be in this short bill could be ironed out and put right at committee stage <e> <s> let us give some hope to the unemployed <e> <s> those of us who live in rural areas know how costly travelling can be if we are lucky enough to be in a job and for those in rural areas who are out of a job travelling can be very costly indeed <e> <s> let us therefore try not only to reason with the head but also to have a little warmth heart and spirit <e> <s> surely it would not mean any doubling up with anything which will be in the transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to speak because i share the concern of the associations and other bodies of people who are unhappy about certain provisions of the housing and building control bill <e> <s> i should like to confine my comments to two points <e> <s> first however may i congratulate my noble friend lord broxbourne on his excellent maiden speech and also thank the minister for the very regular and nice way that he always presents a bill for which he has responsibility <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the spirit of the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord bruce of donington <e> <s> if one is living in a rural area and has been for any amount of time one knows that there is a need for these call boxes <e> <s> there are people who need them because they do not have a private telephone <e> <s> my noble friend spoke as if the fact that they were vandalised was a reason for not having them <e> <s> the fact that they are vandalised is not the fault of british telecom <e> <s> that is no reason to stop having them <e> <s> they should be available because there are people who need them in rural areas and no doubt in urban or built-up <e>", "<cs> i support my noble and learned friend the minister and the government <e> <s> i think the clause is satisfactory as it is now <e> <s> if the amendment were pushed to a division i should support her majestys government <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friends amendment and i hope that her majestys government will be able to accept it or as my noble friend lord de la warr has just said give us an assurance that the principles behind it will be included in the bill <e> <s> i hope that the government will either accept my noble friends amendment or give an assurance that the principles behind it will be brought into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords why is it that some of us are still prepared to speak for the prayer book and even for the service which as all noble lords <e>", "<cs> i too feel i could not support this amendment <e> <s> it must be made clear to all people whatever their creed whatever their colour whatever their group whatever their culture that we do not have any time for any person who carries an offensive weapon <e> <s> if a person is carrying an offensive weapon the question is why <e> <s> invariably it will be because he is prepared to use it <e> <s> no i could not go along with this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the arguments <e> <s> with due respect to the noble lords who put forward the amendment i believe that i shall support the government because i feel confident enough with the governments proclaimed intentions and with what has already been written into this bill that fairness will be done <e> <s> i also have confidence enough in the police to believe that the majority of them wish fairness to be done <e> <s> if on any occasion it does not happen i feel confident enough that there are the measures available and that the police authorities will bring to court as you may say any member of their police force who committed a misdemeanour of the kind indicated by the amendment <e> <s> therefore i shall support her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords what are we doing with life in our present day <e> <s> this is the vitally important question in respect of human beings as it is to a lesser degree in respect of other aspects of creation <e> <s> how we treat ourselves will determine how we treat life <e> <s> disturbing and frightening aspects are placed before us in the warnock committee report <e> <s> this report together with other factors of modern life must cause many men women boys and girls to think deeply about values in regard to human life <e> <s> we must consider life not only when the child has been born but we must value human life from the moment of conception thinking of the potential of each unique unborn child <e> <s> we are dealing with that which has the substance of all

whims of any kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment of my noble friend lady faithfull <e> <s> i am sure that it is right to say that by cautioning young people can be made to feel

her majestys government will be able to give their approval and my noble friend the minister lord elton will be able to give his approval to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope her majestys government will be able to support the amendments of the noble lord lord bruce of donington and his new clause <e> <s> i shall be very happy to support them <e> <s> this is human and decent showing compassion for persons including dependants who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in that position <e> <s> i wholeheartedly support these amendments and the new clause and i hope her majestys government will be able to see their way to do so as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for her reply <e> <s> does she consider it absolutely essential that a nursery teacher for children under five should have a degree <e> <s> would she not consider it desirable that those who have the nneb qualification should be able to exercise their responsibility to which their training has fitted and suited them and to have charge of children under five rather than as at present just to be assistants <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can support the amendment because i rather agree with my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls in asking why if we are to do this type of thing for one group it should not be done for others <e> <s> as my noble friend has said there are many other people who have to work on sundays <e> <s> one of the noble lords opposite raised the question of noise <e> <s> there are plenty of activities which occur throughout the country on sundays which involve noise <e> <s> for example there are motor-car rallies <e> <s> some people may like them but some may find them a dashed nuisance <e> <s> therefore i do not think that the point about noise being a nuisance is very relevant <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to accept either the amendment of the noble lord lord mccarthy or the amendment of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> i have listened to the different arguments and am prepared to support either of the amendments because i think it is thoroughly disgraceful that as has been suggested young people who do not have the means the power or the strength to insist on fair play can be taken advantage of <e> <s> that is why i am prepared to support either of the amendments <e> <s> i do not think it can be too strongly emphasised how thoroughly disgraceful it is if young people are being taken advantage of and how essential it is that it should be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with pleasure that i rise to support the measure before us <e> <s> we are acknowledging the fact that the order of deaconesses has for a long time been exercising the ministry of the order of the diocanate in its fullest sense <e> <s> the days of deaconesses having a limited role within the church of england of a ministry just to women and children are over <e> <s> their ministry has extended to the fuller field of pastoral work for example visiting the sick helping those in any need or adversity or assisting in public worship <e>", "<cs> in principle it seems only right and proper that somehow this amendment should be made right even if noble lords suggest that it has some flaws <e> <s> i hope it will be possible to make the amendment workable <e>

should not be unnecessarily disturbed by those wishing to play sport <e> <s> where this concerns horseracing or sports where there is gaining and getting of money one cannot help asking whether it is really necessary on seven days of the week to think just of gaining and getting <e>", "<cs> having heard the different arguments and points of view i would certainly still be happy to support this amendment <e> <s> even if the movers of the amendment are told that as it is it cannot be accepted i would hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor would be able to say that he would be able to work at it and be able to find a way to bring in the important principle of this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal briefly with one aspect of religious education the importance of regarding religious studies as a subject requiring intellectual effort <e> <s> i am aware that spiritual truth may be discerned in many ways and that the possession of a brilliant intellect is not a necessary requirement for experiencing christian truth <e> <s> nevertheless the whole weight of christian tradition shows that religious experience must involve the mind as well as the heart <e> <s> for this reason i am thankful that religious education is to be statutorily identified as part of the basic curriculum for all pupils in all maintained schools and that it takes its place before the core and foundation subjects <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will be able to accept the amendment <e> <s> i say that for the reasons that others have given and also because i think that my noble friend lady faithfull has a very good basis and very good material from different sources for putting forward the amendment <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will be able to accept the amendment but if she cannot do so i hope that she will be able to give some hope and encouragement to my noble friend lady faithfull that the government will be able to put forward something better if they think that this amendment is not good enough <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendments <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend on the front bench will feel able to accept them <e> <s> i feel sure that they are deserving amendments and that it is right and proper that they should be accepted <e> <s> i say that as a result of attending meetings of the all-party disablement group and being able to hear and absorb information from many others who know far more about this subject than i do <e> <s> as one learns about the needs of the disabled one realises how important it is for those with expertise to do all they can to see that those needs are catered for <e> <s> i sincerely hope that her <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> however have he or his department studied the paper of the royal national institute for the deaf on hearing aids entitled <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that

believe that the amendment is right good and proper and i sincerely hope that the government can accept it <e> <s> as the noble lord opposite said the movers have covered all the points <e> <s> i hope that this time her majestys government will be able to be flexible and not just say that it is a good idea but that they accept it <e>", "<cs> i wish to support my noble friend lord ashbourne <e> <s> as a result of the bill one hopes to see what is lovely noble beautiful and true maintained <e> <s> that is the reason why i support my noble friend and why i have great reservations about the issue <e> <s> one wonders whether in the end what is noble beautiful and of worth in a human being will be kept unless there is great spiritual insight among men and women <e>", "<cs> i have no shame about having put my name to the amendment of my noble friend lord ashbourne <e> <s> i am grateful to the right reverend prelate because his remarks were very much on the nail <e> <s> they reflect the reason why i put my name to the amendment and why i have in a sense come full circle and have come to have a very strong feeling of distaste for the bill as the noble baroness lady phillips has <e>", "<cs> my lords are my noble friend and her majestys government aware that there are many people who are deeply worried about how they will manage to pay the community charge the poll tax <e> <s> i say that because several people have mentioned it to me <e> <s> i refer to old and young people <e> <s> are the government aware of the position <e> <s> i must admit that i rather wish i had had the courage to vote against it when it was first introduced <e>", "<cs> i shall support the amendments unless her majestys government can give a more satisfactory answer and assurance <e> <s> morally speaking the question of student loans is a dangerous one <e> <s> it is perhaps a case of taking advantage of young people who as the noble lord lord peston said rightly see not only what their higher education will gain them but the importance of taking part in learning at that high standard <e>", "<cs> i too should like to add my support to these two amendments and also to amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord henderson <e> <s> i hope that her majestys <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not far more interesting and in a way more fun for us that easter is movable <e> <s> further is it not far better that easter is distinctly a christian day of festival not tied up with a secular one so that it can be seen by all and for christians to show that it is a day to revere respect and honour <e> <s> i believe that it is far better that easter is movable <e> <s> i hope that it stays that way and the christians will show that it is a day to respect and observe not tied up with any secular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend saying that the government are aware of a need for far more low cost housing <e> <s> there are many people like myself and others have also said this who see such a need <e> <s> are her majestys government awake to the necessity to meet the need for low cost housing for the many people who desperately require and wish for it <e>", "<cs> my lords my wife teaches and i have come into contact with many teachers <e> <s> does my noble friend agree i think she already has agreed that one has the impression that teachers are dedicated and concerned for the children <e>", "<cs> on previous occasions i have supported members on the opposite side of the committee <e> <s> i have supported the

mentioned by the noble earl lord russell <e> <s> i am sure that there are many young people who as the noble lord lord hylton said do not wish to be out on the streets but who desperately want to find employment <e> <s> the thing which has struck me in recent years and which endlessly makes me ask why it occurs is the sight of young people begging <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel sympathetic to the amendment <e> <s> i received some material on the matter and taking into account what has been said today and at different times on the subject i am happy to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to support the amendment which appears to be practical and reasonable <e> <s> the government should be able to accept it or if it does not meet their wishes find a way of accepting it in principle and
