["<cs> my lords first may i thank my noble friend lord orr-ewing for starting this debate and congratulate the previous maiden speakers upon having successfully survived their ordeal <e> <s> i hope i can do the same <e> <s> i should also like with your lordships usual indulgence to offer an explanation if not an apology for my behaviour <e> <s> i have been a member of your lordships house for years yet am only now making my maiden speech <e> <s> after years in the royal navy i have been endeavouring to earn my living and i retired at the beginning of the year as managing director of a small telecommunications company <e> <s> although i carried the title of managing director a more accurate description of my function would have been chief telephonist and assistant packer <e> <s> this meant that i did not have the time to attend your lordships house on anything like a regular basis <e> <s> i felt it was better to apply for leave of absence rather than to appear to be using the facilities of the house as an exclusive and inexpensive club <e> <s> i feel certain that other hereditary peers particularly the younger ones find themselves in similar circumstances possibly to the detriment of the composition of your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first declare an interest in that i am the chairman of a small telecommunications company whose main customers are british telecom and their suppliers <e> <s> i rise to add my support to this bill although i have some reservations on some of its detail which i will come to shortly <e> <s> some years ago we undoubtedly had one of the best telephone systems in the world and for some time we managed to maintain this position <e> <s> but slowly in subsequent years the quality of the system started to decline and an air of lethargy or complacency crept in within both what was then the gpo and their industrial suppliers <e> <s> there was a noticeable lack of innovation and marketing enterprise and the customer was left to accept whatever was offered to him <e> <s> consequently our export markets declined disastrously <e> <s> meanwhile overseas and particularly in the usa the opposite was happening <e> <s> a somewhat fragmented and haphazard national system rapidly developed into the finest in the world with a thriving development programme keeping pace in turn with the introduction of the transistor the computer the chip and the microcomputer <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike the noble lord lord hill of luton who came in like a battleship with all guns firing <e> <s> i also am in agreement with the principles of the bill not because i believe that there is a serious need for more entertainment in the home and nor do i believe that there is a great fund of new worthwhile material waiting to be launched on the public <e> <s> but i do believe that in the next decade or so a large number of advantages will appear over the medium of cable some of which are hard to visualise at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should perhaps first declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman but not a shareholder of a small telecommunications company <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with what my noble friend lord mottistone has said <e> <s> is it not possible to take this a stage further <e> <s> if a satisfactory offer from a reliable contractor has been submitted is it reasonable that the authority should within the space of perhaps six months be forced to advertise that area for a new applicant <e>", "<cs> may i say this in defence of the amendment <e> <s> we have given the contractor a fairly rough ride so far <e> <s> we have said to him you can have a licence <e> <s> it will have lots of conditions attached <e> <s> none <e>", "<cs> i think i recognise when my noble friend on the front bench has turned his toes in and i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we have heard from my noble friend the minister twice earlier this evening about the advisability of sticking to the generality and avoiding the specific <e> <s> here in this clause the government are doing exactly that trying to be specific and leaving out a very large number of possibly undesirable shareholders who by omission may be allowed in <e> <s> otherwise i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> as i read this it definitely says after consultation with the iba full stop <e> <s> surely had it said after consultation with suitable bodies it would have been quite all right but to leave the iba as the only name is nonsense and it will not necessarily give the authority the best advice available <e>", "<cs> can the minister tell us what <e>", "<cs> did i understand the deputy chairman correctly <e> <s> did he say that if this amendment is passed we cannot take and <e>", "<cs> may i possibly speak on amendment no <e> <s> now <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble baroness for that statement but she seems to be trying to have it both ways <e> <s> normally the front bench is always telling us that legislation must last indefinitely or for years or more <e> <s> now it seems to be telling us forget about the future it will all sort itself out <e> <s> the techniques will change and no doubt you will be able to cope with more than five channels <e> <s> i find that a slightly poor argument but in view of the lateness of the hour i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> no thank you <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> he has gone a long way to meet us and i think in view of his assurances i am more than willing to withdraw amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i think that my noble friend on the front bench said that there will always be consultation between the two authorities <e> <s> if that is so why can we not put that in the telecommunications bill and make it quite clear to the director general that he must consult <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to all members of the committee who have supported me so nobly and rather surprisingly <e> <s> i do not agree with my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i cannot see really why this cannot be put into the telecommunications bill via this clause <e> <s> but i would rather read what has been said this evening and reserve the right to come back at the report stage <e> <s> meanwhile i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may return to what the noble lord lord buce of donington was saying may i suggest that the travels around the country and see how many strowger exchanges are still in daily use <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord mottistone was not referring to the staff of engineers and technicians who maintain those strowger exchanges <e> <s> but we do maintain that those strowger exchanges should have been replaced years ago when they were already redundant <e>", "<cs> i certainly was not <e> <s> i was doing exactly the opposite <e> <s> i was saying that the staff who maintain strowger exchanges are first-class but the strowger exchanges should not be there in the first place <e> <s> they should have been replaced many many years ago <e>", "<cs> the cable companies and the telecommunications companies will both need frequencies for microwave links and it is therefore essential that the duration of these licences should be co-ordinated with the telecommunications licence or with the cable licence <e> <s> i therefore also support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced by what my noble friend has said but in view of the fact that it is in the interests of my company that test equipment should not have to obtain approval i shall gladly withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i tried to speak earlier on this clause in connection with meters <e> <s> can we possibly have the definition of this clause improved <e> <s> meters is a generic term for a large range of measuring equipment including avos voltmeters ammeters selective-level meters some of which cost tens of thousands of pounds <e> <s> i do not think that this clause is meant to refer to them <e> <s> if we mean customer-charging meters can we please say so in the clause and call them toll meters or charging meters <e>", "<cs> may i say that i think that that definition is a little bit woolly to put it mildly <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> i shall wait to see the final version of the amendment and meanwhile withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend <e> <s> obviously it is essential that during the period of installation the cable operator should be able thoroughly to test the entire system from head end to customer <e> <s> the government may believe that this is a method of extending the licence time or the operating time of the operator but this could be avoided if a third paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those remarks <e> <s> the people i was thinking of in my catch-all question were overseas companies and overseas governments which are not on the present list and which might possibly create a threat at a later date <e> <s> but in view of my noble friends encouraging remarks and his agreement to review the situation i think that we can leave this at the moment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too believe that it is essential for the cable authority and oftel to get together <e> <s> i repeat what i said at second reading and hope that the minister will do what he can to help that these two authorities at least should be housed in the same building so that there is a reasonable chance that they may meet in the corridors or the lavatories and intercommunicate <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am most grateful to my noble friend for tabling this amendment <e> <s> as he says this is a matter which i raised at the committee stage and this amendment will now mean that i shall not have to move my amendment no <e> <s> which is almost identical to this one <e>", "<cs> my lords this matter too relates to one of my committee stage amendments <e> <s> i am not quite clear as to when the authority intends to serve such a notice <e> <s> will the operator have to keep the recordings at all times in case a notice is issued or need he not keep the recordings until he is notified <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot agree with my noble friend lord morris <e> <s> for the past years i have been a salesman in the telecommunications industry <e> <s> as such i have been responsible for submitting several thousand tenders in my time <e> <s> time and again i have met examples of extremely unfair if not to say dishonest opposition in the form of other tenderers but that has been extremely effective tendering in that they won the tender from me <e> <s> however it was certainly not fair and reasonable <e> <s> i sincerely hope that we do not intend to instruct the director to carry out effective competition as opposed to fair competition <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down there is one question that i should like to ask him <e> <s> it is said that the complexity of the issues means that the government bt and mercury must consider what is to be done with care <e> <s> is there no opportunity for the businesses involved in these paragraphs of which there are several hundred being involved in those talks <e> <s> it will seriously affect them and to have just three very biased people talking together seems unreasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords my name was associated with that of my noble friend lord trenchard at the committee stage <e> <s> in his unavoidable absence may i thank very sincerely my noble friend lord glenarthur for moving this new clause which fully covers the amendments which we tabled <e> <s> in subsection we should perhaps have liked to see the word shall rather than the word may but i do not think that we shall argue over it <e> <s> i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend and his colleagues in another place for moving these amendments for us <e> <s> even after these amendments it will still mean that virtually all the original shareholders in the licensed operating companies will be subject to immediate scrutiny by the authority because they hold more than per cent <e> <s> of the shareholding <e> <s> we still believe that the companies and bodies listed in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your pardon i was speaking on behalf of my noble friends who took part in the earlier debates <e> <s> i personally did not take part in all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first declare an interest as i am chairman of an instrument company per cent <e> <s> of whose output is normally sold to bt in any one year <e> <s> while i am in favour of this order and would not wish to see it annulled there are in the licence a number of points of detail some of which have already been mentioned which are most unsatisfactory <e> <s> i am in full agreement with the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree that it is more important that british telecom should talk to the cable companies and give us a co-ordinated telecommunications system which could also do away with the delivery of letters by hand <e>"]
