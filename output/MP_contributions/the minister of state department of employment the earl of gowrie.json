schemes <e> <s> however as there is little evidence that these smaller component schemes could in their own right produce major economic and energy savings it would be inappropriate for the government to concentrate their own efforts on them <e> <s> we would of course welcome any economically worthwhile small schemes that were self-financing <e>", "<cs> my lords in december the national coal board

friend lord renton for giving us this chance to debate the green paper on trade union immunities <e> <s> this is an excellent time to hold such a debate because we are now well into the consultative

house a wealth of experience of industry the trade unions and industrial relations <e> <s> in sheer empirical day-to-day experience i would say that we did rather better than another place in that regard <e> <s> i am therefore looking forward to the rest of this debate which up to now has been interesting and constructive and which i am sure will continue to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand from the corporation that they have not placed a contract for the construction of a rig but have chartered one from dyvi drilling of norway <e> <s> the details are a matter for the management of the corporation and are commercially confidential <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe there are a number of advantages in non-cash payment of wages and are aware of international comparisons <e> <s> the central policy review staff have prepared a discussion document on the subject which is due to be published in the summer <e> <s> a copy will be placed in the library <e> <s> we will of course carefully consider the future of the truck acts in the light of the response to the document <e>", "<cs> my lords i will admit to mistakes and one mistake that the government should admit to is that our cuts in public spending were not fiercer and earlier <e> <s> however we can come back to that at a later stage <e> <s> in response to what the noble lord lord bruce said about economic arrogance and i must be careful because i confess to a weakness for macroeconomic debate a weakness that is shared by about per cent <e> <s> of the citizenry of this country at the moment the trouble with life is not so much economic arrogance as the arrogance of the laws of arithmetic <e> <s> those are what drive various administrations ministers and indeed citizens to drink <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the community enterprise programme replaced the special temporary employment programme on st april <e> <s> i am informed by the manpower services commission which administers the programme that potential sponsors of schemes are showing great interest and the commission is well set to double the number of temporary employment opportunities during this financial year <e> <s> the commission also informs me that although the new programme has been running for only six weeks the signs are that private sector employers do wish to help the long-term unemployed and many inquiries about scheme sponsorship are being received from them <e>", "<cs> my lords current plans for cater for some school-leavers to enter the youth opportunities programme <e> <s> that would represent about per cent <e> <s> of those leaving school for employment in the academic year <e> <s> plans provide for young people to

and steel bill was introduced into your lordships house shortly before the recess having spent some three months under consideration in another place <e> <s> the bill has two distinct purposes <e> <s> the first is to make extensive changes in the duties and powers of the british steel corporation and in the powers of the secretary of state to give directions to the corporation <e> <s> the second purpose is to effect a capital reconstruction of the corporation to revise their borrowing limits and to reduce their interest burden <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not at present considering any new proposal for community service by school-leavers although we have welcomed the discussion generated by the recent publication of youth calls debating document <e> <s> there are national

lord kearton on his maiden speech which came as a surprise to me too because once when from the opposition benches i was making a speech about the british national oil corporation i think the noble lord almost got to his feet but on that occasion he contained himself to our benefit today <e> <s> i may say in retrospect looking back i think it will be no surprise to the house that he was right on that occasion and i was wrong and i am sure that will occur again <e> <s> it seems to me that it is typical of the noble lord that he is associated so strongly in our minds with energy issues atomic energy and of course oil but that he reserves his fire so to speak not for a present and past success but for what we all hope will be a future success and he looks ahead as we would always expect of him <e> <s> i hope he will not wait a further years before he contributes to us again if only to keep us on our toes on the development of this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are determined to provide a lasting solution to unemployment by persevering in our efforts to create a stable economic and financial climate where more resources may be released for industry to generate wealth and jobs and by giving substantial aid to individuals and industries caught in the painful machinery of an economy changing gear <e> <s> this solution cannot be achieved by the proposals put forward by the leader of the opposition <e> <s> the proposals include a substantial increase in public expenditure financed by increased borrowing which could not be reconciled with the lower interest
