join in <e> <s> as my noble friend lord belhaven and stenton said it proves that in this house we are not prepared to sweep under the carpet this very important subject which i believe has to be debated at very regular intervals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the house is grateful to the noble lord lord moran for giving us the opportunity to discuss the implementation of the salmon act which came into force just over a year ago and various related matters <e> <s> the questions that have been asked in this debate are fairly lengthy but i should like to go through as many of them as possible so that we can deal with them this evening if that meets with your lordships wishes <e> <s> all the matters that have been raised are integrated and are important as far as the salmon species is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to join other noble lords in thanking the noble earl lord perth for initiating a wideranging and constructive debate <e> <s> i am perhaps the only person who cannot choose what i am going to speak about <e> <s> i have to try to pick up the points that have been made during this valuable debate <e> <s> i would say to my noble friend lady elliot and to the noble earl lord perth that a scottish debate is a good thing to have in this house and that from the wideranging subject matter we on the government front bench have learnt a great deal about what concerns noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great care to the points which my noble friends lord campbell of croy with his special knowledge of the islands

caithness will wind up at the end and deal with the general and main issues that arise in the debate <e> <s> we also look forward very much to the maiden speech of the noble earl lord granville later today <e> <s> my purpose in speaking at this stage in the debate is because of the importance of the nature conservancy councils operations in scotland and because of my responsibilities at the scottish office for agriculture and forestry and in particular for the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state has given local authorities additional capital expenditure consent of million in the current year in respect of preparations for the implementation of the community charge and proposes to allocate a further million next year <e>

march that a new woodland grant scheme offering higher rates of grant would come into operation on th april <e> <s> clearly the industry will have to adjust to changes <e> <s> but with the transitional arrangements announced we hope to sustain planting at a reasonable level until planting under the new grant scheme gets into its stride <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the housing

down a marker to have a debate on forestry before the budget and obviously he had second sight knowing that this was going to be a very interesting debate when it came along <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the national curriculum proposed in the education reform bill applies only to england and wales <e> <s> the governments proposals for curricular reform in scotland are contained in the consultation paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords any illegal activity affecting scottish salmon stocks wherever it be carried out is a matter of concern to the government <e> <s> as in previous years fishery protection vessels will be deployed within the scottish sector of the uk fishery limits with a view to maintaining the effort towards enforcing fisheries legislation at sea with particular problems targeted for special attention <e> <s> additionally aerial surveillance will be undertaken by fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters in order to curb the activities of those who fish illegally <e>", "<cs> my lords the local government finance bill provides for the introduction of uniform business rates in england and in wales from but we have always made clear that the extension of a uniform business rate to

desired levels of planting <e> <s> so far as the next decade and immediately beyond is concerned it is the ever-increasing volume of wood from existing forests which will help to stimulate further investment in wood-processing plants <e> <s> new planting carried out today will allow the continuing development of the wood-processing industry well into the next century <e>", "<cs> my lords the regulations prescribe a standard canvass form for use both initially and once the system is running <e> <s> it is made clear in the notes to the form that the information in question is only to be supplied when the form is issued after st april <e> <s> it will be necessary for registration officers to have the information in respect of people becoming resident after st april since their

valuation <e> <s> as i shall explain in a moment much of what the amendments contain is of an essentially technical nature <e> <s> it is convenient that the first three amendments in the group deal with what i think we would all agree is the most important matter namely the power of the secretary of state to prescribe principles of valuation <e>", "<cs> the amendment raises the question of the form of privatisation which is most appropriate for the british steel corporation <e> <s> as the committee would expect when we started to consider how best to privatise british steel we had an open mind on the best way of doing so and in particular on the form a single entity or two or more smaller companies in which we could best return its activities to the private sector <e> <s> in examining the options we considered not just the future of the british steel corporation as an organisation but also the interests of its employees its customers and the taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords before

he moved his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords it is impossible to predict with any certainty future levels of fish stocks since these depend on many factors such as the <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland published in november were his estimates of the community charge that each local authority would require if it increased its spending next year only so far as was necessary to take account of inflation and of unavoidable extra expenditure on school boards and on community charge collection <e> <s> the details of local authority budgets have still to be analysed but in general where authorities have fixed charges higher than my right honourable friends estimates it is simply because they are increasing the volume of their spending <e>", "<cs> my lords between and output per head in manufacturing industry is estimated to have risen by per cent <e> <s> per annum in both scotland and wales and by per cent <e> <s> per annum in northern ireland <e> <s> the estimated increase was per cent <e> <s> per annum for the uk as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords in our november announcement we indicated that the forestry commissions disposals programme would be extended to st march and that its main purpose would be the rationalisation of the commissions estate <e> <s> we are nearly at the end of this period and the programme is now being reviewed by the government <e> <s> the house will be informed of the outcome of the review when it has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e> <s> it has been the subject of much debate and scrutiny in another place and i am sure that it will be the subject of useful debate here <e> <s> the purpose of the bill is to make provision for the privatisation of the scottish bus group to transfer the ownership of caledonian macbrayne to the secretary of state and to provide for the scottish transport group to be dissolved <e> <s> the three parts of the bill deal with those three aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords the government consider that the resources which are being spent in support of newbattle abbey college could be used to better effect by helping more people into higher education through initiatives such as the scottish wider access programme <e> <s> consultations undertaken by the governors of the college showed that education authorities and other institutions did not see a significant part for newbattle within their own activities to encourage wider access to higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords from information recently submitted by local authorities the estimated cost of administering the community charge and non-domestic rating system in scotland in is million <e> <s> the cost of administering the rating system in was million <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting and very wide-ranging debate on this electricity bill <e> <s> i should like to thank all those who have taken part in it <e> <s> like my noble friend lord gray of contin i am gratified that this bill was not guillotined in another place <e> <s> it has therefore received many hours of scrutiny there <e> <s> i am sure that it will receive the same here <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this stage in this interesting debate and at the outset ask the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove whether he is also speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> this has been a most useful debate <e> <s> i shall perhaps take a little longer to reply to it than the committee may expect <e> <s> i wish to cover this matter rather fully because it is a crucial part of the privatisation of the scottish electricity industry <e>", "<cs> i am well aware that many members of the committee would like to see public electricity suppliers under an obligation to operate a system of common tariffs within their area <e> <s> however i have to point out that it is important that we recognise that the provisions in clause do not impose a requirement on public electricity suppliers to charge differential tariffs but merely allow the possibility of their development at some time in the future <e> <s> that is no different from the position which applies in england and wales under the existing law as set out in the electricity act <e> <s> the provisions of that act neither require nor prohibit area boards from operating different tariffs in different areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that our new planting objective is still hectares per annum <e> <s> the total area of new planting in the year to st march was about hectares made up of some hectares of planting by the private sector for which grants were paid during the year and some hectares undertaken directly by the forestry commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the fact that my noble friend lord caldecote has taken part in a matter of great interest to scotland and indeed has moved an amendment which is concerned

taylor of gryfe rightly said is something which concerns very many people in scotland <e>", "<cs> even though the noble lord has not moved amendment no <e> <s> zk i shall say a few words on this matter because i think that it is important to understand this section <e> <s> the amendment would result in the application of section of the income and corporation taxes act and could both place the scottish electricity supply industry in an uncompetitive position and disturb the necessary balance between the north of scotland and the south of scotland companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the private planting grant-aided in the year to st march included a substantial amount undertaken before the budget or subsequently with the benefit of transitional tax reliefs it is too early to say what impact the new forestry tax and grant regime will have on planting levels <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord peston raised the question of the mirroring of what he saw in clause in the amendment that he proposes <e> <s> it seems to me that clauses and are directed to different circumstances <e> <s> therefore it may be helpful if i attempt to outline why the provisions in these clauses have been framed in the way in which they have <e> <s> ensuring the security of supply to electricity consumers

lords as announced by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland in another place on th june we have asked the forestry commission to sell a further hectares of forestry land in

shows that there are genetic differences between farmed strains of salmon and the wild populations from which they are drawn <e> <s> the genetic consequences of introducing cultured fish to a wild stock are unknown but are likely to be complex <e> <s> so far there is no direct evidence of adverse effects or of actual damage to any wild stocks in scotland <e> <s> further studies by my department

shall now repeat a statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that discarding fish is wasteful <e> <s> we are working with the fishing industry to develop technical conservation measures which minimise the number of undersized fish which are caught in nets and then have to be discarded <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i may say to the noble lord lord john-mackie that i am pleased to answer this short but very important question on the future of the agricultural colleges in scotland <e> <s> i know that he and other members of his family in particular his father had an important role to play in the agricultural scene in scotland in particular in aberdeen <e> <s> i shall address most of my remarks to that subject which has exercised me and the secretary of state over the williams report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very much aware of the serious difficulties which some fishermen could face during this year because of the reductions particularly of haddock and cod in the north sea were essential in order to prevent further reductions particularly of haddock and cod in the north sea were essential in order to prevent further deterioration in stocks which are vital to the long-term future of the fishing industry <e>", "<cs> my lords while no overall figure is yet available it would appear that the proportion of people in arrears with their community charge payments is broadly the same as under the rating system last year <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have decided that the scottish successor companies will begin operating on st march when they inherit the assets and liabilities of the two scottish electricity boards <e>", "<cs> my lords none <e>

intends to set up a temporary scheme outside the social security system to provide for special payments to those in scotland who came into entitlement to community charge benefit as a result of the change in the rules <e> <s> such a scheme will require financial provision of up to million to cover the cost of payments and administration costs <e>", "<cs> i follow what the noble lord lord

assure him and other noble lords and the national health service staff that that is not the intention <e> <s> the new paragraphs which the schedule seeks to insert into schedule of the national health service scotland act are simply designed to bring scottish legislation into line with that of england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has today designated a further eight sites <e> <s> four of those are special protection areas one is a ramsar site and three sites have dual designation <e> <s> there is now a total of special protection areas and ramsar sites in scotland <e> <s> details of the new sites designated have been placed in the library <e>", "<cs> i think that it would be for the convenience of the committee if we considered not only the noble lords amendment but also amendments nos <e> <s> ah and aj <e> <s> if the committee will forgive me i shall cover all three amendments because the other two throw a slightly different light on the problems that have been raised by the noble lord lord walton <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for moving the amendment and i gather speaking also to

is in the correct place in the bill <e> <s> however we believe that the attempt to clarify for the purposes of local authority powers to provide residential nursing care the term disabled as extending to both physical and mental disablement is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael is quite right to stress the importance of health boards making community care plans which tie in with those which local authorities will be required to make under clause <e> <s> planning for community care requires the close collaboration of all agencies concerned and that is a matter fully recognised
