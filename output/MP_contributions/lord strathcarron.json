["<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that if we cannot afford to complete the m this section of road might be made into a dual carriage-way <e> <s> it is well suited to that purpose with wide grass verges nearly all the way <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank the noble lord lord gregson for initiating this debate on such an important subject <e> <s> i have always been interested in all forms of transport and have driven various types of electric vehicles over the years but i have to admit that the only one i have ever owned was an electrically driven golf trolley driven by a volt car battery <e> <s> i walked beside it but the awful groans it made spoilt the tranquility of the golf course and its reliability left much to be desired <e> <s> if it broke down on the far side of the course it was far too heavy to pull along unaided <e> <s> i do not hold this against the modern electrical vehicle <e>", "<cs> my lords being number on a long list of speakers makes it very difficult for one to think of points which have not already been made <e> <s> i have long been a believer in wearing seat belts in fact years ago i had seat belts fitted to my car when they were virtually unheard of <e> <s> the effect on the passenger was really startling because if you said would you kindly fasten your seat belt <e> <s> he would say what on earth are you going to do <e> <s> and nearly got out of the car <e> <s> obviously people are more kindly disposed towards them now <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his reply and very pleased to hear that meetings are taking place <e> <s> will he confirm that the february meeting would be of an interim nature and that it is essential that in the march meeting we come to some firm and positive action <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i am relieved and i am sure that all motor-cyclists will be relieved to know there is no fixed period arranged at the present time though two years have been mentioned <e> <s> i like the idea of all the on periods i am not so keen on these off periods <e> <s> so i hope that the government will be able to think again on this matter <e> <s> i therefore beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes that is right <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i should like an answer if he can give it to the question that i put about the two-part test being due to start on st january although i think it is generally agreed that the facilities just will not be available <e> <s> would it not then be sensible to put it back until at least october or perhaps even to january of the following year <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord once again for his reply of which i did not understand a word <e> <s> i should like to thank him none the less <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will not introduce two-part testing until facilities are available <e> <s> in my view that is a very important point and i hope that the government will consider it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the two-part test you would first have to get a certificate for having passed the initial training and then you would have to take that certificate along to get your major test <e> <s> so in actual fact it is two tests <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for the assurance that he has given that there will as necessary be a degree of flexibility in the time period <e> <s> therefore i am pleased to beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this training aspect is of the utmost importance and it is essential that the training facilities are a ailable at the start <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the price of aviation petrol in most countries in western europe is approximately a gallon compared with over in this country and does he agree that this is a scandalous situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very helpful reply <e> <s> it will be a comfort to those motorists who are constantly blinded by what amounts to the anti-social behaviour of drivers who leave these lights on when visibility is good <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply but would be not agree that the filing of a flight plan is sufficient security in itself bearing in mind that the progress of the aircraft is monitored through various control zones and there is a security check at ronaldsway at the other end in any case <e> <s> may i further ask my noble friend whether he does not agree that a pilot indulging in some nefarious deed would not file a flight plan and would not go and inform security but would just fly at feet under the radar cover to his designation <e> <s> therefore does my noble friend not consider the security arrangements at this end to be superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> would he please bear in mind that it is possible to fly in a private aircraft with passengers all over western europe and you merely present the passengers passports at the other end you do not have to notify anybody as to their identity before you leave <e> <s> and would be bear in mind that the isle of man is not exactly ireland it is an independent island on the way so to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply and i am pleased to hear that provision is being made for cases such as i have described <e> <s> this will be welcomed by the many hundreds of thousands of learner motor-cyclists on the road and i think that they will feel happier as a result of my noble friends statement <e> <s> therefore with that assurance i beg leave to withdraw my amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that a simple reflective belt and shoulder strap such as that worn by the police makes the rider very conspicuous by both day and night and that it has the further advantage that the strap is cheap to buy and is also suitable for the safety of pedal cyclists and aged or infirm pedestrians <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend not agree that it is a waste of money to pay extra for club-class on trident aircraft where one is herded together with other passengers in exactly the same way as with eurobudget-class and it is impossible to drink the difference in fare in the time available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> however it would be nice to know how long shortly will be <e> <s> can my noble friend say whether the governments measures on training are having any noticeable effect on road safety <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend agree that provided a year-old moped rider has undertaken a recognised course of training and passed a test of competence he should be allowed to ride a restricted performance cc machine displaying l-plates and then take the second part of the test when he is years old <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord nathan for initiating this debate on what is a complex subject on which many points have still to be decided <e> <s> while fully appreciating the need to reduce harmful emissions i feel that the damage caused should be put in proper perspective <e> <s> last month the bureau permanent international des constructeurs dautomobiles held a meeting in paris and issued a full report on their findings <e> <s> i shall not read from it but their conclusion was that motor vehicles are only responsible for about per cent <e> <s> of acid rain <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove mentioned motor-cycles weaving in and out and frightening everybody <e> <s> i do so agree with him <e> <s> i think they are mostly despatch riders and what is worse they have blaring radios as well and often they ride worn out motor cycles emitting clouds of blue smoke <e> <s> they are rather anti-social and though i have been a supporter of motor cyclists all my life there are ways and means of getting to the front of the traffic quite quietly without frightening everybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> is he aware that most bus lanes that i have seen throughout the country are for buses taxis and pedal cyclists <e> <s> would he not agree that a motor cyclist is less likely to impede the progress of a bus than a pedal cyclist <e> <s> furthermore would he not agree that it is safer for a motorcyclist to ride in a bus lane than to weave in and out of motor cars in a traffic jam <e>", "<cs> my lords as a further question i should like to ask my noble friend whether the reason that local authorities have not applied is that no one has asked them to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that new motor cycle exhausts are already commendably quiet and that the difficulty lies with the replacement <e> <s> the difficulty is that motor cyclists often cannot afford the very high prices charged by manufacturers for the official exhausts and have therefore to go to other sources <e> <s> those are the noisy exhausts <e> <s> i am very pleased to hear that legislation is being prepared to make it illegal to sell an exhaust system that does not come up to the required standard <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> does he agree that when motorists have saved up their vouchers for a particular item only to be told that the promotion ended yesterday they feel they have been unfairly treated <e> <s> that would not be the case if the completion date was clearly displayed preferably on the poster itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support this bill wholeheartedly <e> <s> i have been riding motor cycles for years and i normally come to your lordships house on two wheels <e> <s> motor cycling is the last freedom of the road traffic and parking problems disappear like magic journeys take a fraction of the time that they do by any other form of transport and i believe that motor cyclists should be appreciated by other road users for taking up so little space on our crowded roads <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend recall the question i asked some time ago when i suggested that nearside rearview mirrors on motor-cycles should be made compulsory <e> <s> the gist of his reply then was that motor-cyclists should look where they were going and not worry about a rearview mirror <e> <s> that strange argument could perhaps apply to all road vehicles <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to declare an interest as chairman of kent international airport which may be better known to your lordships as manston <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that kent international has a foot runway which is partly for the use of nato as an emergency field <e> <s> brand new passenger terminal buildings are being erected and will be in operation next year <e> <s> therefore the airport will not only ease the congestion of airport space in the south-east but will also reduce the high rate of unemployment in the thanet area <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend the minister for introducing this very interesting bill <e> <s> i have been a keen motor cyclist for years and i still come to your lordships house on my motor cycle <e> <s> i have long since ceased to be competitive on the roads <e> <s> i now ride defensively and by so doing i hope to continue to ride here for some considerable time longer <e> <s> i should like to confine the major part of my speech to the motor cycle section of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord underhill for his support <e> <s> in view of the reassurance given by the minister i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> as the secretary of state is prepared to make regulations i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> in considering this matter we must realise that there will be training centres keen to offer wider and more extensive training which will clearly cost more so they ought to have the commercial freedom to charge accordingly <e> <s> indeed it may be for the benefit of the rider being trained because he may get an attractive deal as a result <e> <s> that possibility might be affected if there is a set charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord brougham and vaux for initiating the debate <e> <s> it is an important subject and one about which people often have biased and preconceived ideas <e> <s> i welcome the white paper as a whole although i was disappointed that it did not mention bad eyesight as being a major cause of road accidents and fatalities <e>", "<cs> my lords before asking a supplementary question i ought to declare an interest <e> <s> i am chairman of kent international airport <e> <s> it may be better known to your lordships as manston airport in kent <e> <s> is the minister aware that kent international airport has a runway long enough to take the largest aircraft new passenger terminal buildings and is outside the london control zone <e> <s> it is therefore ideal for easing congestion in the south-east <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that when the motorway is crowded and a driver moves over to the nearside lane he is stuck there forever <e> <s> he can never come out again <e> <s> that is one of the reasons why the nearside lane is not more generally used <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that of the fatal road deaths per year only one-quarter are drink related and of those one-third are drunken pedestrians <e> <s> does he further agree that more accidents are caused by people who cannot see properly than by drink-driving <e> <s> i should like to know what the government intend to do about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in america the system works with great success <e> <s> americans turn right because they drive on the right and obviously we would turn left <e> <s> the only disadvantage might be at pedestrian crossings <e> <s> in that situation in america there is a sign which says no turn on red light <e> <s> does the minister agree that such a system would be a very simple and cheap way of easing traffic congestion which concerns us all <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend confirm that the cromwell road will be a red route thereby preventing the ice cream vans from parking on double white lines for long periods without anybody seeming to care about them <e> <s> with any luck they will not be able to do so in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that of the fatal accidents only one-quarter are drink related and one-third of those are drunken pedestrians <e> <s> does my noble friend agree that more people are killed or injured on the road through defective vision than through drink-driving <e> <s> eyesight should be taken more seriously but because it is respectable to have faulty eyesight and not respectable to have one drink too many her majestys government do not appear to be doing anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that in new york an experiment was carried out whereby half the cabs were fitted with an additional high rear light while the others were not <e> <s> is he further aware that the accident rate for the ones fitted with the extra light at the rear was very much lower than that for those cabs which were not so equipped <e>"]
