["<cs> failing a wish on the part of any other member of the committee to speak i will be as brief as possible <e> <s> i noticed that the eloquence of the noble lord lord mishcon was in its usual flowing state but that he appeared to be a little more cautious and to be sticking fairly closely to the subject <e> <s> i hope that he and the committee will allow me to stick equally closely to the fairly lengthy amendment he has just moved <e>", "<cs> we discussed t his amendment at an earlier stage and i gave the assurance that we would take this amendment away and look at the clause <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will feel free in the light of my assurance to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord lord mishcon for reminding us again of the levity of the day of the second reading <e> <s> there is one error that the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey made that he should never take or need to take smelling salts <e> <s> i believe they are permitted under the bill at present as a medicinal product <e> <s> the noble and learned lord should know that scotland have scored try for try in all their matches but they have still contrived to lose <e> <s> if scotland win at murrayfield then the noble and learned lord may need his smelling salts but possibly he may need something stronger at the game or outside since it is not envisaged at the moment that murrayfield would as yet be a designated ground but that may come further on <e>", "<cs> it seems that this amendment wishes to introduce into the provisions of this part of the bill applying to the offences of being drunk at a designated sporting event or in a coach travelling to or from an event the additional requirement that the individual concerned was not only drunk but also incapable of looking after himself <e> <s> i do not think that this would be helpful because the term being drunk is not synonymous with the expression being drunk and incapable <e> <s> it is the intention of the provision to deal not merely with those who have consumed so much that they are falling about and are liable to cause themselves injury but also with people who are drunk but whose state is more likely to result in their causing injury to others by their violent behaviour rather than to themselves <e> <s> the term drunk does not require further definition because it will apply simply to a person whose appearance and behaviour is reasonably interpreted as that of a drunken person <e> <s> the noble lord may know that the term drunk is already used and applied in the licensing act to which i referred earlier <e> <s> i think that the reference was to carrying crates on board a bus <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon has set out his case with great clarity and as he promised with commendable brevity <e> <s> i admit that i was not aware of his question for written answer of april <e> <s> i was somewhat apprehensive that i might have replied but i did not recall that such a question had crossed my desk <e> <s> i was therefore delighted when the noble lord confirmed that that was a matter dealt with by my noble friend lord glenarthur <e>"]
