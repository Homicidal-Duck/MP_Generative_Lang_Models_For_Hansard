["<cs> i should like to make it clear that i do not understand the noble lords argument when he says that he is concerned that those democratically elected should be responsible but then proposes that a whole lot of people who have not been democratically elected should be the governors having merely been nominated by those who are elected <e> <s> i find that very difficult to understand <e> <s> if his principle is right then inevitably it will fall on the members of the education committee or the education authority <e>", "<cs> i think we are missing what is the simple and essential point <e> <s> there is no question of abolishing selection <e> <s> any authority that did that would be in breach of the act <e> <s> they arc under a legal obligation to educate children according to their age ability and aptitudeand if they do not take steps to ascertain their-ability and aptitude they are clearly in breach of the act <e> <s> what we arc discussing is whether that should be done within one school so that each child gets the opportunities appropriate to his ability and aptitude or whether we should do it in separate schools <e> <s> that is what we are discussing not the issue of whether or not there shall be due care taken to have regard to the abilities and aptitudes of children <e> <s> that surely is a fundamental requirement <e> <s> i should not like to see a school which ignored these factors and tried to educate children <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall return to discuss clause <e> <s> if i believed as apparently the noble lord lord thorneycroft believes that this clause would cure inflation i would support it most wholeheartedly but i do not think it will <e> <s> i do not think we are discussing merely the problem of the voluntary schools <e> <s> i do not think we are even discussing merely the problems of education <e> <s> i believe we are discussing the future of rural england <e>", "<cs> i am worried about this amendment because i do not think i can support it much as i support nursery education <e> <s> this amendment imposes the duty to provide nursery schools <e> <s> i think the future development of nursery education will lie not in the provision of nursery schools but in the provision of nursery classes attached to infants schools <e> <s> as the school rolls drop and we know they will drop and in fact have started dropping accommodation will become available in all the infants schools in the country where provision could be made for a nursery class at very much less cost which i think would do a perfectly good job <e> <s> unless i misunderstand the position this amendment would make the statutory duty the provision of nursery schools not nursery classes <e>", "<cs> i find myself very much in support of the purpose of the amendment but i walk with the noble lord lord wellspestell on procedure <e> <s> it seems to me that this is an area very much like religion and what happened there was the gradual emergence of agreed syllabuses prepared carefully with appropriate groups of people involved <e> <s> frankly i should have thought that local education authorities and the schools themselves would greatly welcome the emergence of some kind of agreed syllabus in an approach to this problem <e> <s> if therefore the noble baroness the minister finds it possible to initiate anything of that kind i am certain she will have a very great measure of support <e>"]
