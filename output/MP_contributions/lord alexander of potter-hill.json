["<cs> my lords when i came to your lordships house this morning in order to look at the bill i intended to make a speech of very considerable length and i might do so yet <e> <s> my concern was that i believe that we have reached a point of time in relation to the education service when there are vital problems which must be faced and resolved <e> <s> i do not believe that the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not dissent from that but it is equally true that there were areas where every change of party political control which very often happened every two years meant a new scheme for the reorganisation of their secondary schools <e> <s> have a look at the record of birmingham and you will find the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure i understand the noble lord but then he knows that i never have really understood him even when he was my president <e> <s> i am stating a simple fact that the average size of a sixth form in a comprehensive school of reasonable size and i go up as far as is neither educationally viable nor economically viable <e> <s> it requires a staffing ratio of probably about one to four or five if you are going to cover the necessary range of subjects and that is a very expensive process <e> <s> that being so we must look at that as a problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i would agree <e> <s> this seems to me to be not an unreasonable proposition <e> <s> what am i asking <e> <s> i am asking the present government to accept the general principle of comprehensive education <e> <s> i am asking the opposition to accept the logic the reasonableness of providing specially for the top per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of ability just as they provide for the bottom per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> of ability <e> <s> this is not an unreasonable thing to suggest <e> <s> let us not under-rate it <e> <s> the special needs of the top per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> are no less difficult than those of the bottom per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> and are no less important to the welfare of the nation <e> <s> nor is this a new idea <e> <s> russia does it china does it almost every country that has had long enough experience of the comprehensive system has come to this conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords there were two points with which i found myself in full agreement with him <e> <s> one was that there had been a period when he and i had occasion to work together when there was consensus opinion at national level and this led to a very real success in the development of schools <e> <s> there is another point that he made with which i would agree <e> <s> he said that we had reached a stage where we desparately needed a new education act which could embody consensus of opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that apart from short-term measures as things are developing and as the nature of industry is emerging adult education will become the most important sector of the education service in to years time <e> <s> retirement will take place at an earlier age that is inevitable <e> <s> is it not a fact that if there is one sector that has never been taken very seriously in this country it is adult education <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that it is a convention of your lordships house never to reject a bill at second reading <e> <s> i know that there are very strong reasons for that convention and i would not wish to depart from it but i must say to your lordships that if there were to be a division on this bill i should be happy to go into the division lobby in order to send it back so that the government could think again <e> <s> in fact my lords i think that the word again is redundant so that the government could think about what they are doing to the education service <e>", "<cs> my lords i suggested two things <e> <s> one is the reorganisation of the - to -year-olds <e> <s> the other is the pupil-teacher ratio <e> <s> i can only say to your lordships that when the pupil-teacher ratio was three points higher than it is now the standards of education were higher than they are now <e> <s> i can only tell your lordships that as long ago as when i was in america and carlton washbourne was superintendent of education in winetka he did very careful research <e> <s> winetka had plenty of money money was no object <e> <s> the size of classes for junior school pupils varied from every number from to and he got the best results at <e> <s> i am not suggesting by any means that that is the right answer but i am reminding your lordships that where groups fall below the evidence is that the results are less satisfactory than they are when the numbers are between and <e> <s> that is quite recent research <e> <s> however the essential point is what i have said that what we want is not more teachers but better teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness would give way <e> <s> i accept that you are reluctant to face the teacher unions in this matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to make it clear that i do not understand the noble lords argument when he says that he is concerned that those democratically elected should be responsible but then proposes that a whole lot of people who have not been democratically elected should be the governors having merely been nominated by those who are elected <e> <s> i find that very difficult to understand <e> <s> if his principle is right then inevitably it will fall on the members of the education committee or the education authority <e>", "<cs> i think we are missing what is the simple and essential point <e> <s> there is no question of abolishing selection <e> <s> any authority that did that would be in breach of the act <e> <s> they arc under a legal obligation to educate children according to their age ability and aptitudeand if they do not take steps to ascertain their-ability and aptitude they are clearly in breach of the act <e> <s> what we arc discussing is whether that should be done within one school so that each child gets the opportunities appropriate to his ability and aptitude or whether we should do it in separate schools <e> <s> that is what we are discussing not the issue of whether or not there shall be due care taken to have regard to the abilities and aptitudes of children <e> <s> that surely is a fundamental requirement <e> <s> i should not like to see a school which ignored these factors and tried to educate children <e>", "<cs> i hope we shall return to discuss clause <e> <s> if i believed as apparently the noble lord lord thorneycroft believes that this clause would cure inflation i would support it most wholeheartedly but i do not think it will <e> <s> i do not think we are discussing merely the problem of the voluntary schools <e> <s> i do not think we are even discussing merely the problems of education <e> <s> i believe we are discussing the future of rural england <e>", "<cs> i am worried about this amendment because i do not think i can support it much as i support nursery education <e> <s> this amendment imposes the duty to provide nursery schools <e> <s> i think the future development of nursery education will lie not in the provision of nursery schools but in the provision of nursery classes attached to infants schools <e> <s> as the school rolls drop and we know they will drop and in fact have started dropping accommodation will become available in all the infants schools in the country where provision could be made for a nursery class at very much less cost which i think would do a perfectly good job <e> <s> unless i misunderstand the position this amendment would make the statutory duty the provision of nursery schools not nursery classes <e>", "<cs> i find myself very much in support of the purpose of the amendment but i walk with the noble lord lord wellspestell on procedure <e> <s> it seems to me that this is an area very much like religion and what happened there was the gradual emergence of agreed syllabuses prepared carefully with appropriate groups of people involved <e> <s> frankly i should have thought that local education authorities and the schools themselves would greatly welcome the emergence of some kind of agreed syllabus in an approach to this problem <e> <s> if therefore the noble baroness the minister finds it possible to initiate anything of that kind i am certain she will have a very great measure of support <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that this is complicated <e> <s> i think it is probably true that to apply the whole of section to special schools would in fact do less for special schools than the act already provides because under the act certain special provisions are made <e> <s> as i understand it what is being sought and i would strongly support it is that the parents of children should have information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry but i find myself in total opposition to this amendment <e> <s> a wise administrator dealing for example with capitation allowances undoubtedly with the approval of his authority normally fixes capitation allowances either on age ranges or on a basis <e>", "<cs> my lords yes but the important point is that it is not necessarily what any particular school gets <e> <s> a wise administration normally holds monies in reserve against capitation allowances so that if in any particular school there is a special need or a special reason it can be provided <e> <s> for example new staff appointments may be made and as a result an additional supply of text books may be required in order to meet the needs which are being pursued and additional money is made available <e> <s> alternatively it may be that a school is relatively new which means that increases are necessary in order to set it off on a proper footing <e> <s> therefore even if the allowances were published it would not necessarily mean that the actual information in relation to a particular school was given <e> <s> i do not think that the amendment would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we are moving on to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> it looks very like it to me <e> <s> if the minister is making any reference to that under this amendment perhaps she would make it clear whether or not the effect of the clause excludes boarding education from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment strongly and i hope that the government will look at it and not because i expect that there will be a wide demand for places in boarding school <e> <s> perhaps i should begin by making it clear that at second reading i opposed this scheme altogether <e> <s> i still do so <e> <s> but if it is to operate then it must surely be enabled to fulfil its purpose <e> <s> there are two aspects as i see it <e> <s> first i do not believe that if you are really picking with care the schools that are adequate to do this job you will find a school which can cover the whole of the country to be attended by day pupils <e> <s> there will be areas where boarding is necessary whether weekly boarding or not <e> <s> this is true <e> <s> more importantly if you are concerned to give an opportunity to the very bright child from a home of limited means and it may be a home of very limited means then providing a good school as a day school may not be the right answer <e> <s> the right answer might be to send it to a boarding school so that the child can have the full opportunity that the boarding school offers <e> <s> it may not have the adequate support at home for studying <e> <s> if there is substantial travelling the childs opportunities will be reduced <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an invitation that i could not possibly refuse <e> <s> as i indicated on the second reading of this bill i found myself almost totally opposed to almost all of its provisions and i still find myself greatly regretting that the bill is to find its way on to the statute book <e> <s> having said that however may i join the the noble lord lord shinwell and the noble viscount lord eccles in congratulating the noble baroness lady young on her wonderful performance in negotiating a bill with so much opposition and so much criticism so successfully <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the impact that the failure of the government to implement their first intended promise has had on the education service <e> <s> we made a definite switch to metrication in primary schools preparing children to live in what was to be a metric world and the effect of the retreat is that the children who are now coming into industry and commerce have been prepared for a metric system but are having to operate a dual system with very great difficulty <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that if in the future a commission is set up to examine teachers salaries it might be desirable that one of the officers advising the commission should know the burnham report <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister would be kind enough to forgive me for interrupting her <e> <s> is this not more than satisfying the requirement of the eec <e>", "<cs> lords i am most grateful to the minister <e> <s> it is because t doubt whether the provision has not gone beyond that requirement that i raise the question <e> <s> as i understand it the requirement of the treaty of rome is that the children of eec nationals coming here should be treated the same as our children and that to me would mean that they were required to be in residence for three years before they qualified for the scheme which is the requirement for our own children <e> <s> but i should be perfectly happy to leave it to be looked at again <e>"]
