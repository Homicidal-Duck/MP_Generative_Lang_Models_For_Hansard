["<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the fact that there are more than half a million citizens of british descent living in argentina who are all god-fearing citizens and the fact that there is great opportunity for trade and investment in the revived economic climate give added reason to have an ambassador at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords may i tell my noble friend how much this statement will be welcomed by british industry commerce and banking <e> <s> it will be a great stimulus to those of us who are desirous that we should increase trade and investment with that country which has been one of our oldest and longest-standing trading partners <e>", "<cs> my lords my thanks are first due to my noble friend lord kinnoull for introducing this subject <e> <s> quite apart from anything else it is very refreshing to talk of something more esoteric than the deluge of legislation which has been the fare of late <e> <s> it is also a great privilege to follow the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones <e> <s> he said that he was not a man of the theatre but from what he has said it is clear that he is <e> <s> i must start by declaring an interest a double interest <e> <s> first i am the president of the redgrave theatre trust <e> <s> the redgrave theatre is a provincial theatre in farnham named after the distinguished actor sir michael redgrave <e> <s> we are a very small part of the subsidised theatre and i will not refer to it again because we receive subsidy from the arts council for which we are grateful and which enables us to put on a great variety of different types of production <e> <s> if we did not have that subsidy we should have a more straightforward commercial type of production in the catchment area that we serve and that would be a loss to the community <e> <s> secondly i am what has already been referred to in the theatrical parlance by several noble lords as an angel sometimes referred to nowadays as a saint <e> <s> perhaps other people with a more economic frame of mind might refer <e>", "<cs> unlike my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter and the noble lord lord mishcon i was not able to be present during the second reading debate <e> <s> however i have some sympathy with what they have both said <e> <s> i ask my noble friends in the government whether we are not making too much of an issue of the whole business of business names at this particular stage of the committee proceedings <e> <s> it may be that this came out earlier and that my noble friend will be able to say that the register of companies and the register of business names are two distinct issues <e> <s> are we not allowing ourselves to get bogged down on an issue which is really less important than the objectives of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot attempt to follow the noble lord lord avebury precisely <e> <s> in any event he was mostly talking about the next-door country guatemala although it of course has a great deal of relevance to this issue <e> <s> our thanks must be due to the noble lord lord chitnis for introducing this subject at such a timely moment <e> <s> i should probably declare an interest as i think i am the only member of your lordships house who has actually lived in el salvador <e> <s> i lived there some years ago for nearly three years <e> <s> although this gives me only a little knowledge which has been helpful it has given me above all a great feeling for the people who live there <e> <s> many of my friends have in fact been killed in the present and recent troubles <e>", "<cs> may i also support the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> i spend a lot of time travelling overseas on business and there is much concern by businessmen resident overseas for whatever reason and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones has pointed out several reasons that their progeny may be in difficulties and could lose their entitlement to citizenship <e> <s> the noble lord lord avebury took up a point made earlier this afternoon by my noble and learned friend the lord advocate <e> <s> i would ask the noble and learned lord the lord advocate when he comes to reply to go back to amendment no <e> <s> which was argued earlier this afternoon and perhaps confirm that the registration requirement in clause does not in any way mean that the citizenship is inferior in quality to that provided by clause because this seems to me to be the nub of the matter <e> <s> if it is not even though it may be onerous to have to register it is the quality of citizenship which concerns these people resident overseas and there are very large numbers of them as there will continue to be at least we hope so in order that our trade may prosper <e>", "<cs> may i follow my noble friend lord renton supporting his suggestion about the problems of britons living abroad <e> <s> we have been dealing with this point earlier i know but it is a very real question <e> <s> if i may take issue with my noble friend lord belstead on the matter of britons being born abroad the fact that they are so born does not in any way diminish their britishness in fact it may often enhance it because they feel for reasons of their descent that they have great ties with this country <e> <s> several noble lords have been pressing the point that it is desirable for our trade to continue to encourage britons to live abroad and indeed this was the main thrust of lord boyd-carpenters suggestions earlier this afternoon <e>", "<cs> i also should like to intervene very briefly <e> <s> i go back to the original introduction by the noble lord lord taylor when he said that the question of the independence of belize had been accompanied by scuffles <e> <s> i think he would agree that this country has brought independence to many nations and they have rarely not been accompanied by scuffles of one kind or another <e> <s> that does not seem to me to be a very good reason to delay the independence of belize <e>", "<cs> i intervene briefly to follow up the words of my noble friend lord beloff because i think he made a very important point <e> <s> my noble friend lady vickers argued her case very cogently but it is important that at this delicate stage of the negotiations with argentina is is no good your lordships supposing that the argentine claim will go away for better or for worse there it is and it has a wide measure of international support <e> <s> it is important that we should not do anything in this house which would in any way exacerbate the situation or in any way impede a solution which might be more beneficial to the islanders in other circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords all the major points of principle have been made by distinguished speakers from all parts of the house and therefore i shall confine my remarks to brazil <e> <s> it would be superfluous to remind your lordships that my infrequent interventions in this house have nearly always been confined to matters which impinge on britains relations in latin america <e> <s> in this context it behoves us to look a little at the brazilian service which has been in existence continuously since <e> <s> the bbc service to brazil speaks to a vast population in a huge territory and is very widely respected <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend a question about the timetable <e> <s> restructuring of the domestic rating system is widely welcomed and all those of us concerned with local government in any way will read the green paper with great interest <e> <s> but it is a very complex subject <e> <s> is the noble lord confident that the timetable allowing for full consultation and reporting back by st march is sufficient <e>", "<cs> my lords i too <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his compliment in that respect if i may take it as such but i am not sure that that is quite correct either because i think we are probably very much on the same side in this issue <e>", "<cs> i have never actually asked them that question my lords so i do <e>", "<cs> my lords i said that was how they saw the issue <e> <s> i did not say that they were necessarily right <e> <s> i said that was how it was perceived in that country <e> <s> it is important to realise that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> he took me to task <e> <s> i was not suggesting in any way that there should be a trade-off <e> <s> what i was suggesting and if he reads my remarks he will see what i said was that there are three parties to this problem of developing the south-west atlantic all of whom have interests the islanders argentina and britain <e> <s> it behoves us to work together to the same end and not to take sides in the issue <e> <s> it is only by working together that a solution will be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the house will show the same indulgence to me as they have to the noble lord lord george-brown because i feel that what i am going to say may also be somewhat out of tune with the general feelings in the house <e> <s> it may be for slightly different reasons <e> <s> as your lordships know i have been concerned for some years in promoting british interests in latin america in general and in argentina among other countries in particular <e> <s> it therefore might be useful if i made one or two observations from as it were the other end of the telescope which has not really been very much considered <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just say to the noble lord that when hitler invaded czechoslovakia it has never been suggested that that country had always been part of germany whereas the argentines who took this aggressive action have always rightly or wrongly suggested that the falkland islands were their property <e>", "<cs> my lords would my noble friend agree while recognising that the views of the islanders are certainly very important that british views in general may not always coincide with the views of the islanders and that british long-term considerations and our overall policy not only in the south atlantic but in latin america as a whole should be taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord lord paget will forgive me if i do not follow his line of argument <e> <s> i spoke in the last debate on this subject two weeks ago and tonight i wish to make only two points <e> <s> the first concerns the question of the submission of the case to the international court a subject mentioned in some detail by the noble lords lord mishcon and lord kennet and i dare say by others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has commented on the technicalities of the electoral procedure as he is indeed well qualified to do <e> <s> but i hope that he will forgive me if i return to the general aspects of the problem and the implications of the recent election on the lines of the motion drawn by the noble lord lord chitnis <e> <s> although the motion put down by the noble lord lord chitnis is on rather narrow lines he has fortunately amplified the scope in his remarks and i find this helpful and would like to take up the more general aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords as british technology is an important export earner for this country may i ask my noble friend what is being done to promote british technology overseas in this important endeavour <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that most interesting answer may i say that it does not quite answer the question <e> <s> therefore i would like to ask him two supplementary questions <e> <s> first is he aware that the heavy goods manufacturing industry and related ancillary support industries are suffering from what is in effect a planning blight by the lack of decision in this matter <e> <s> is he further aware that the european competition is growing and suffers no such disadvantage and is in fact making inroads into an area of activity which has formerly been dominated largely by domestic manufacturers <e> <s> secondly may i ask my noble friend if he remembers that in june this year in answer to a written question he stated that an announcement would be made very shortly <e> <s> what does that now mean <e> <s> in the light of the imminent decline of this very important industry would he not agree that a decision and an announcement is really very essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble lord lord underhill for not being in my place when the debate started <e> <s> i understand there was a somewhat rapid change in the tempo of the previous debate and my intelligence on the subject was clearly quite inadequate <e> <s> that is by way of explanation rather than being an excuse but it means that i did not hear all that he said and i shall naturally read it tomorrow with interest <e>", "<cs> that may be my lords but it does not mean that there could not be in the future <e> <s> as to the other point which the noble lord made and i think that perhaps this is a personal matter it may be he should take to flying <e> <s> i appreciate of course that if he does take to flying at <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the importance of communications which is so <e>", "<cs> my lords like all noble lords who have spoken i too should like to thank the noble lord lord franks and his team for this fascinating report and to say that i agree totally with the conclusions <e> <s> i should also like to say to the noble lord lord molloy who has just spoken that i find myself in quite some measure of agreement with much of what he has said although not with all of it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady fisher thought that this bill was a halfway house to privatisation <e> <s> unfortunately would that it were so <e> <s> it seems to me to be quite the reverse as my noble friend lord ridley pointed out <e> <s> the bill as it stands at the moment replaces many large flabby quangos with fewer small sharp ones <e> <s> whether this will improve the management of water affairs is a question that will need a lot further analysis <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran in the amendment he has moved in his name and to which mine is joined <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble lord lord skelmersdale for his help in this matter <e> <s> i hope that it will not embarrass him unduly if i add my thanks to those already expressed for the most helpful co-operation that has been experienced by the bodies <e> <s> so far as the consulting engineering industry is concerned these have been principally the association of consulting engineers and the british consulting bureau both of which have been involved in discussions with his department <e> <s> these have been extremely helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord lord lloyd asking that amendment no <e> <s> is moved now jointly with amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome the appointment of my noble friend lady young whose concern for international affairs and whose good judgment will be very valuable at the foreign office <e> <s> likewise i welcome back my noble friend lord trefgarne who now appears to be doubling on defence and foreign affairs to which he has contributed so much in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i welcome this report on engineering research and development <e> <s> this afternoon the noble lord lord gregson gave us a splendid summary of his recommendations and made some interesting proposals <e> <s> i am glad to say that i agreed with everything he said <e> <s> i also agreed very much with the remarks made by the noble viscount lord hanworth and my short intervention will very much echo his observations <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that any settlement in the falkland islands must present a very uncertain future unless we are able to normalise relations with argentina <e> <s> can he therefore say when that process might start <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow those noble lords who have spoken about the theatre and more specifically i should like to make two points on the subject of the problems of the regional repertory theatres <e> <s> i have to declare an interest in that like the noble earl lord bessborough i am president of the redgrave theatre trust <e> <s> the redgrave is a small provincial theatre at farnham in surrey <e> <s> it has a resident company mounts productions each year and plays to an average per cent <e> <s> audience for weeks a year <e> <s> it is a very imaginative theatre <e> <s> for instance two years ago the redgrave staged the first professional production of cavalcade since the original to coincide with the th anniversary <e> <s> this production included some amateurs in addition to the resident company drawn from amateur dramatic societies within the catchment area <e> <s> in fact it put the redgrave theatre not only on the national scene but on the international scene <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to follow the noble lord <e> <s> lord annan because i find myself in such a large measure of agreement with what he said <e> <s> i wish however to follow a slightly different line <e> <s> my thanks like those of others are due to the noble lord lord buxton who presented such a comprehensive survey <e> <s> i welcomed his cautious optimism but thought that he might have been unduly harsh on argentina <e> <s> i should like to concentrate my few remarks on that aspect <e> <s> in this context i want to pick up something that the noble lord lord kennet said and take a look from the other end of the tunnel <e>", "<cs> my lords having listened very carefully to what my noble friend has said would he not agree that having won the conflict what is now much more important is to win the peace <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend confirm whether the very sad news which has appeared on the tape in the last few hours concerning a very serious fire at port stanley hospital is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate the noble viscount lord falkland on his maiden speech <e> <s> the noble viscount is clearly an expert on african affairs as was evidenced by the extremely sensitive nature of his remarks <e> <s> i hope he will forgive me if i say that i perceive him as a relatively young member of a new party in this house and indeed in the country and as such i think that he will be in great demand as a speaker <e> <s> we on this side certainly look forward to hearing him frequently in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords in the context of central america would my noble friend not agree that it gives considerable reassurance that elections have recently taken place in el salvador with some success <e> <s> secondly would she agree that the report produced by the british observers who attended the election in el salvador is worthy of study by noble lords <e> <s> i hope that the government will be able to give encouraging signs that they very much approve and that the british observers did a very fine job in el salvador <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a far-ranging debate and i hope that the noble lord lord jenkins of putney will forgive me if i do not follow him down the route of the complexities of the rules of war <e> <s> i want to concentrate very briefly on four points in the gracious speech which concern latin america <e> <s> first perhaps i may say how much i welcome the announcement of the forthcoming visit by the president of mexico <e> <s> mexico is a most important country in latin america strategically located on the southern united states border <e> <s> during <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who has been involved in promoting exports for a very long time may i ask my noble friend whether he does not agree with me that predicting the trend of any specific type of sale from one month to another is an almost impossible task for any kind of industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to follow my noble friend lady vickers down her detailed path because she obviously has great knowledge of st helena and spoke with authority but i should like to say to her how much we all welcome her return to the house after her recent illness <e> <s> she seems to have lost none of her powers of oratory during her absence and therein has become fortified with her usual ability to question the government in great detail <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord shackleton i would say that it is much too early to consider that point <e> <s> what i mean by solving the problem is conforming at this stage to the edict of the united nations that we should be talking to each other about the issue <e> <s> what the long-term solution is i do not know yet and i do not think that anybody in this chamber can give that answer <e> <s> what i do say however is that if we do not talk to each other if we do not have a discussion if we do not again make friends with this country with whom we have had a friendship for years it is not satisfactory for any of the parties concerned <e> <s> how we achieve that i do not know because there are various alternative solutions <e> <s> the fact of the matter is however that the population of the falkland islands can never have a secure future if we are not working together with their closest neighbours <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point may i remind him that that particular government has been despatched altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords what i said was that the government which conducted that action has been despatched by its own fellow citizens <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend appreciate that before the recent tragic conflict anglo-argentine two-way trade exceeded some million in total <e> <s> does he further appreciate that the argentine economy is in some difficulty that we are currently in the process of debt renegotiations and that everything should be done to stimulate their foreign trade <e> <s> moreover does he also appreciate that we as one of their previous strong partners would be well advised to make some type of magnanimous gesture particularly as we were the victors in the unfortunate conflict to stimulate this trade and thereby encourage the argentine economy to recover to the benefit of all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say what is her attitude to the united nations resolutions that negotiations should be resumed bearing in mind that there is a considerable balance of opinion in the world that negotiations on this issue are desirable especially in view of the fact that argentina now has a democratically elected government and is extremely favourable to western influence <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that this decision will be very widely welcomed by those of us who labour in the field of the promotion of anglo-brazilian trade <e> <s> is he aware that this trade has been somewhat in the doldrums lately due to difficult circumstances <e> <s> in the light of brazils return to civilian government and in the light of the economic recovery there this decision will provide a very welcome stimulus of which we should all in this country be able to take very considerable advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to follow the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> many years ago i accompanied him on two trade missions overseas from which we undoubtedly learned a good many useful things and i hope achieved some useful objectives <e> <s> the noble lord confined his remarks to his experiences in africa <e> <s> by the same token my illustrations will have to do with latin america a continent with which i have had some experience <e>", "<cs> my lords he was a man of great vision and enterprise and i was very privileged to work with him indeed i worked with him until his untimely death <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned in the earlier part of his interesting remarks that he recognised that there were certain anomalies <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that the anomaly of the licensing situation in the restaurant trade particularly is rather exceptional and that this might perhaps fit into the pattern to which he referred <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down can he be a little more specific about the date for the publication of the full report on the scottish experiment <e> <s> he said later in the year <e> <s> i wonder whether he can explain precisely what that means <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say something about wind power <e> <s> there is almost an equal and perhaps a greater field for endeavour in power generation from wind sources <e> <s> is this receiving equal attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first apologise to the noble lord lord kennet and to my noble friend the minister <e> <s> unfortunately this debate has clashed with another latin american function namely the national day reception of the anglo-peruvian society which is taking place in another part of your lordships house and which i had undertaken to host some six months ago long before this debate was tabled <e> <s> therefore my apologies are due because obviously i shall be unable to listen to all the speeches which are to be made tonight much as i should have liked to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot quote the actual authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i have papers with me <e> <s> there are authorities and they have been mentioned <e> <s> people make speeches and one reads about them and they appear in the newspapers <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will bear with me <e> <s> what i call the trappings of the state are the establishment of the central committee system the <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very far-ranging debate which has covered east-west and north-south <e> <s> it has been most instructive and i am struck by the fact that many references have been made to the importance of our united states ally <e> <s> but i am also struck by the fact that there seem to be a large number of people who apparently doubt the wisdom of staying very close to that ally and that is surprising <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that catering is one industry which works very closely with schools in disseminating information <e> <s> furthermore is she aware that the catering industry represents vast opportunities for jobs and presents an enormous number of opportunities for the future <e>", "<cs> my lords every year at the anglo-swiss parliamentary ski meeting i have the pleasure of following the noble lord <e> <s> lord grantchester down the ski slopes <e> <s> he always wins <e> <s> however i must say to him this evening that i cannot follow him do not agree with his argument and hope that he does not win <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by congratulating my noble friend lord aldington <e> <s> i find his report stimulating and interesting <e> <s> i thought that the governments initial reaction was rather surprising and i was therefore particularly glad to hear the more mature and balanced comments made this afternoon by my noble friend lord young <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that one of the few people to emerge with dignity out of this whole affair is sir john cuckney the chairman of westland and that the company would probably recover much more quickly if it was less beleaguered by politicians and press than has been the case heretofore <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to intervene and disagree with my noble friend lord renton but i hope he will not mind my pointing out to him that there is no such thing as a simple lawyer <e> <s> it seems to me that in itself is a contradiction in terms <e> <s> i wanted to ask the noble baroness lady turner a question concerning voluntary work on sundays <e> <s> if i understood her amendment correctly she is proposing that sunday workers should be on a voluntary basis <e> <s> can she please advise the committee what would be the circumstances for a retail organisation when the workers for some reason or another did not volunteer and whether that organisation therefore would be able to obtain workers from elsewhere without any prejudice to their activities <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the fashion industry of which i was once a member of an ancillary part embraces a large number of activities other than those connected directly with textiles <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that all these activities with regard to a number of different industries probably benefit by the minimum of interference from government <e>", "<cs> my lords this debate so ably initiated by my noble friend lord campbell of croy has ranged over a wide variety of different aspects of tourism and there are many more on which we could touch <e> <s> i wish to mention one specific aspect of tourism namely catering <e> <s> i shall refer specifically to catering in the restaurant trade <e> <s> thirty years ago food in england was a joke a rather poor joke as very few people would think of coming to england wales or scotland to enjoy food <e> <s> all that has changed <e> <s> it has changed out of all recognition <e> <s> not least among the reasons is the major contribution made by people like my noble friend lord forte in this area <e> <s> the standard of service to which many noble lords have referred is much more respectable <e> <s> like other speakers i was sorry to see service being denigrated in newspaper articles by those who should know better <e>", "<cs> my lords following on from what the noble lord lord cledwyn has said will my noble friend not agree that there can be no long-term solution to the very vexed fisheries problem in this area unless argentina agrees <e> <s> will she therefore not consider that this is a very worthwhile opportunity for the resumption of a more direct dialogue with argentina on a subject on which we probably all agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to remove the restrictions concerning the hours during which intoxicating liquor may be served with meals in restaurants and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the right reverend prelate the bishop of leicester will forgive me if i do not follow him down the course he took of aid in africa however important that subject may be <e> <s> in my brief intervention i want to take my cue from the sentence in the gracious speech in which it is stated that her majestys government intend <e>", "<cs> i of course accept the facts as given by my noble friend <e> <s> however desirable an ultimate multilateral solution may be it will not work <e> <s> we have taken interim action but the two parties to the dispute will still have to resolve the problems between them <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i thought it might be helpful if i started by giving some background as to why this measure has been brought before your lordships <e> <s> as on past occasions i must begin by declaring an interest as i am the honorary president of the restaurateurs association of great britain <e> <s> the ragb as it is generally known is a trade association concerned with safeguarding the interests of independent restaurants and promoting the highest standards of catering <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in rather a difficult position on the back benches trying to sum up this very wide-ranging debate although it is on a narrow subject if that is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just thank those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i am very grateful for the support that i have received from all quarters of the committee <e> <s> perhaps i may also mention that i had a telephone message from the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran to say that had he been here and he is very sorry not to be here he also would have supported these amendments <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken about this clause and argued that it should be deleted from the bill <e> <s> therefore i think i shall be voting not-content <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords in conclusion perhaps i may thank my noble friend for those words of encouragement and reassure the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs that i do not think that any of the preoccupations that she has expressed and they are very genuine ones will in any way be prejudiced by the passage of this bill <e> <s> with those few words i commend the bill to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords in the light of the comments made by several noble lords is there not a good case for privatising the passport office <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first time that i have intervened in a matter concerning northern ireland and i do so for two reasons <e> <s> first as my noble friend knows for several years i have been campaigning for reform in the licensing laws and in my humble belief this forms part of that general reform <e> <s> the second reason is hereditary in as much as my great great great grandfather samuel montgomery a direct ancestor was a wine merchant in londonderry in the th century <e> <s> i may say that he prospered in that profession <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that recent press reports concerning the possible talks between the sandinista government and the contras give rise to some cautious optimism <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that a much greater risk to the ozone layer exists as a result of the destruction of the amazon rain forest <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord whaddon and other noble lords i congratulate the noble viscount lord falkland on bringing the subject forward for discussion this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the old adage that trade follows <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend say what her majestys government are doing in order to accelerate the progress of metrication in order that we shall be compatible competitive and not out of step when the single market becomes effective <e>", "<cs> my lords it will come as no surprise to noble lords to hear that i warmly welcome the bill <e> <s> i am therefore profoundly in disagreement with the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby and by extension with the noble lord lord ardwick and the noble viscount lord buckmaster <e> <s> it remains to be seen whether we are able to convince the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby who has listened to the debate with devotion <e>", "<cs> my lords i also rise to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that when shops stores or any retail outlets are open everything that is available inside those stores should be for sale <e> <s> to have certain items available only at certain times is quite illogical and makes no sense whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to disagree wholly with the noble lord lord ardwick <e> <s> this matter was discussed in committee <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord kaberry is quite right and i hope that he will pursue his amendment vigorously <e> <s> perhaps i may go back to what my noble friend lord arran said in committee as my name was coupled with the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls which was passed by the committee <e> <s> this matter touches on the need for us to move forward <e> <s> the intention of many of those in favour of liberalisation was that sunday should be the same day as every other day which is wholly logical <e> <s> however as only one hour could be obtained that was the best we could do for the time being <e> <s> however it is wholly illogical <e> <s> my noble friend lord rippon put his finger right on the button as usual when he said that the government having accepted the argument would be proceeding very illogically if they did not allow this amendment to proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords in the ordinary way i have spoken consistently in past debates in favour of liberation <e> <s> this amendment is a restrictive one <e> <s> however there are some rather special circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support my noble friend lord lucas who has moved this amendment very comprehensively <e> <s> it is a technical matter but i think that the noble baroness lady ewart-biggs need not be unduly worried <e> <s> throughout this legislation she has been concerned about alcohol abuse and quite rightly <e> <s> by and large alcohol is measured as a percentage of net pure alcohol by volume whereas some of the archaic methods to which my noble friend referred go back to the measurement by fermentation and gravity in which sugar is re-added in order to give some substance and body so that it is palatable <e>", "<cs> my lords i also support the amendment from the back-benches <e> <s> this is the first time that i have intervened in this whole bill and it will be the last <e> <s> the importance of the amendment is considerable <e> <s> it has wide support from british industry commerce and banking <e> <s> as my noble friend lady young has pointed out two of the noble lords whose names are on the amendment represent industry and banking in no mean measure <e> <s> i believe that they if they had been present would have spoken very widely about the importance of the measure to our nation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord ennals said that several noble lords had spoken from personal experience and without regard to the consumer <e> <s> i disagree with him <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord and his supporters it seems to me that they have the consumer in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord cullen asked why the government have changed their mind <e> <s> i hope the minister will say that the government have changed their mind because they have listened to the very good sense and extremely cogent arguments which have been produced over a very long time by the noble lords lord rugby lord winstanley and many others supporting them in this cause of freedom to purchase spectacles over the counter <e> <s> i hope the government will say that they intend to stand firm on this matter and not be persuaded by what my noble friend lord cullen has said because it is a very great move forward and much to be welcomed <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend reassure the house that the expression water undertakers that he has continually used has no conection with the providers of funeral services <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the recent plebiscite in chile was conducted on the most impeccable lines and that even the most prejudiced of observers agree that there were no improprieties whatever <e> <s> is my noble friend also aware that the course is now set for the return of chile to full democratic procedures which will be welcomed by both friend and foe of chile alike <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that great britain has had an extraordinarily long-standing relationship it has lasted years with the chilean navy <e> <s> indeed it was a british admiral who participated in the formation of this great service <e> <s> it can hardly be the case in a country with over miles of coastline that the navy which operates on the sea has oppressed the natives <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the fact that shops may be allowed to open on sundays does not mean that they will all be open <e> <s> does he agree that the question of choice which is so rightly favoured by this government should apply both to traders and consumers alike <e>", "<cs> my lords as one would have expected this has been a wide-ranging debate concentrating on the high point of foreign policy east-west relations and europe <e> <s> but like my noble friend lord birdwood and indeed like my late father i propose to advance on a very narrow front and confine my remarks to latin america where some very positive things are happening <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the autorefractors to which he referred in his earlier statement are in fact extremely accurate and can he easily used following simple training <e> <s> therefore that should preclude the necessity in due course for every reading glass prescription to he signed by a qualified optician <e> <s> however <e> <s> that will require a slight modification of the present law <e> <s> will the noble lord be prepared to consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that the great dynamo for development in the developing world historically has been the private sector and that the essence of the private sector is that it does not need advice <e> <s> it dynamises itself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to speak after the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and today is no exception <e> <s> on this occasion he made some important and useful suggestions although i do not always agree with him <e> <s> nearly four hours ago my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter introduced the debate with his usual clarity and vigour <e> <s> i am glad to speak in the debate and to say how much i agree with what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the periodic injunctions from high places about getting on bicycles can my noble friend say whether he will give further consideration to the proposal made yesterday by the noble lord lord dormand of easington to provide increased cycle lanes <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the indiscriminate cutting of the amazon rain forest may be causing an ecological disaster of almost equal proportions to that caused by the depletion of the ozone layer <e> <s> do the government have any plans for an international conference on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords will the proposals that my noble friend has received be treated as licence applications <e> <s> that might have the effect of ensuring a british lead in the next generation of mobile telephony <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the second most widely spoken international language in the world is spanish <e> <s> is he further aware that a great deal of work has been undertaken by the hispanic and luso-brazilian council which was incidentally founded by my noble friends father to promote the teaching of spanish and portuguese <e> <s> will the government recognise that this work and the teaching of these languages is of vital importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn and the noble baroness lady david very much for what they said <e> <s> i was particularly interested in the remarks of the noble baroness about the cpa with which she is much more familiar than i having had the pleasure of travelling with her on an overseas delegation to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn and my noble friend lord glenarthur for their support in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware of the damage done not to but on the pavements by dogs which defecate indiscriminately and over which there is no control either by licensing or by registering <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this report be now received <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend throw any light on the suggestion that was made some weeks ago about a possible chemical warfare capability being produced in libya <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend have any information as to the number of retail outlets that are now selling reading glasses without prescription since the government so wisely allowed them to be sold without prescription <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say how many people receive satellite broadcasting and whether he knows anybody who has ever seen a satellite broadcast privately <e>", "<cs> my lords i warmly welcome the modest improvements that my noble friend has made in the licensing regime <e> <s> does he agree that ultimately the best interests of both consumers and retailers would be served by the total abolition of licensing <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that the royal mail operates a special priority delivery service called swiftair which so far as concerns france unfortunately takes three days normally and frequently four days <e> <s> does he consider that that will be good enough in when we have a single european market <e>", "<cs> i rise to support the remarks made by the noble lords lord rugby and lord northfield <e> <s> both noble lords have carried out valiant work over a long period to try to eliminate the iniquitous monopoly which has been enjoyed by opticians in general <e> <s> it seems to me that their work is worthy of enormous support by the present government <e> <s> hitherto support has been given only in a somewhat half-hearted manner <e> <s> i hope that my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor will be able to say something constructive on this issue today <e>", "<cs> my lords in contrast to what several noble lords have said does my noble friend not agree that in a free enterprise society it is in fact the marketplace which will decide what ultimately takes place <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which indicates some progress <e> <s> is he aware that the step-by-step approach which has been adopted by her majestys government and the progress made in madrid have been very widely welcomed by people in the uk and in the international community <e> <s> further could he possibly convey our congratulations to the negotiators on the extremely prudent and sensible way they have conducted these matters so far <e> <s> long may they continue <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that so much media coverage on the commonwealth conference has concerned south africa can my noble friend assure me that attention wil be paid to the very important aspect of rain-forests <e> <s> it is an aspect of the commonwealth conference that has received very little attention and it is of great importance to humanity as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords can my noble friend say whether she considers that the general optical council serves any useful purpose especially as it seems to be comprised almost entirely of opticians and has almost no representation of the interests of consumers <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree in those circumstances that a review of the opticians practices by the general optical council might be considered a review of poachers undertaken by poachers <e>", "<cs> my lords on a matter to which i do not know the answer does my noble friend agree that it would be a great simplification of procedures if persons over whose appearance regrettably is subject in photographic terms only to progressive decline could receive passports for life <e>", "<cs> i support my noble friend lord mottistone in inquiring a little further concerning the procedures which will be adopted for the regulations that will be introduced because one has the impression from the second reading debate that this being an enabling bill there will be sweeping regulations which may affect the retailers of food and will certainly widely affect those purveyors of food in the restaurant trade <e>", "<cs> before we leave clause perhaps i may intervene briefly to ask a question of general interpretation which i indicated to the noble baroness that i wished to raise at this stage <e> <s> however i appreciate that she may not be able to give me an immediate reply <e> <s> my question concerns the bill in general as it affects the restaurant trade which has some relevance to consumer protection <e> <s> these two clauses are concerned with consumer protection and as the bill is a catch-all bill <e>", "<cs> before we leave what is desirable and expedient in connection with food sources perhaps i may ask my noble friend a further question again concerning the catering industry <e> <s> in the bill there appears to be a possibility that food sources will have to be designated on menus and other places where food is processed and served to the public <e> <s> if that is the case restaurants cafes coffee shops public houses and other such institutions will be required to say how food had been processed <e> <s> as it is when you enter a restaurant or even a sandwich bar you obviously take on trust the source of that food <e> <s> the ingredients may well <e>", "<cs> first even if some of these ingredients or additives were mentioned on wine bottles i do not believe that most consumers would be any the wiser <e> <s> secondly i should be happy to advise the noble viscount lord falkland outside the chamber on his wine consumption so that he can improve his habits <e>", "<cs> in supporting my noble friend lord stanley perhaps i may ask that the proposed consultation process be extended from hoteliers to include restaurants and all representative catering organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady phillips mentioned the national consumer council <e> <s> however i find myself very much in agreement with the remarks made by my noble friend lady carnegy of lour <e> <s> she referred to the need to protect the interests of consumers <e> <s> but i wonder and i hope that my noble friend the minister can enlighten us upon this in greater detail why it is that the national consumer council cannot do exactly what is proposed in the amendment <e> <s> surely the interests of consumers are important <e> <s> moreover there is an existing quango which does precisely what is set out under the terms of the amendment <e> <s> therefore we do not need any duplication in the matter because that would only add immeasurably to the cost of such exercises <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising to support my noble friend lord stanley i should like to approach the problem from a slightly different angle <e> <s> the matter was raised in committee and my noble friend on the front bench responded as always with great courtesy <e> <s> she was kind enough to write to me after the debate <e> <s> unfortunately i am sorry to say her reply courteous though it was did not entirely answer the question <e>", "<cs> my lords given that all new cars are manufactured to operate on unleaded petrol will my noble friend say what percentage of the existing vehicle fleet in this country is capable of being altered to take unleaded petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that quite a number of rivers in england and wales are seriously depleted for a variety of reasons <e> <s> is he satisfied that the national rivers authority has sufficient teeth to grip that problem <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have spoken on the bill even those who spoke spontaneously towards the end of the proceedings <e> <s> i am particularly grateful to my noble friend lord lucas who reminded us that he has been a pioneer for the proposals over many years <e> <s> his support is very gratifying <e> <s> likewise the noble lord lord graham the noble viscount lord falkland and i have all been involved in the subject for some years it is gratifying to see progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i regret to tell the noble lord that he is wrong because his amendment seeks to change the strength in question from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e>", "<cs> i have listened with considerable interest to my noble friends speech <e> <s> the first point that i want to make is that he must not confuse levels of attendance with levels of alcohol <e> <s> there is very wide concern about the issue and that is one of the reasons why the bill has been brought before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords is my noble friend aware that most of our distinguished actors started life in the repertory theatre <e> <s> throughout this country the large number of provincial repertory theatres are the nursery of the acting profession <e> <s> those theatres are just as worthy of support as the royal shakespeare company <e> <s> in view of its fame the company is quite capable of standing on its feet <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extremely grateful to the noble lord for his kind remarks and to all those who supported the bill <e> <s> it is as he said a modest measure <e> <s> we wish it a speedy passage on to the statute book and hope that it will be implemented at an early date <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords turning to the original question in view of the very high demand for office space in london surely it must be evident that the services cannot be that inefficient otherwise the demand would not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the french are now building nuclear power stations in series and have therefore reduced the cost of the construction process <e> <s> is the minister able to reassure the house that we have good arrangements with the french for using that technology as and when we require it <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend not agree that the overall state of the nation so far as concerns economic development is not wholly dependent upon manufacturing industry but is also dependent on the considerable contribution from the service industries and from the invisible sector to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that interesting piece of information <e> <s> is he aware that the flag carriers of france spain holland and germany all have direct flights to mexico <e> <s> furthermore is he aware that britain is now the second largest investor in mexico after the usa but that the lack of any direct flights is an impediment to the development of trade in an economy which is showing a remarkable state of rapid recovery <e> <s> therefore will he do his utmost and use his best offices to lean on the airlines in question and inform them that direct flights would be of great benefit to this country and indeed to mexico <e>", "<cs> my lords if british airways is showing reluctance on this issue is the minister prepared to encourage regional airlines in the united kingdom to fly from different airports because there are a very large number of efficient airports all over the country <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a debate which has ranged widely over many parts of the globe europe hong kong the gulf northern ireland and many different places <e> <s> but at this late hour i propose to return to the very beginning of this debate and speak to your lordships about latin america as i have done on many occasions in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords does my noble friend agree that in the unfortunate event of hostilities breaking out the successful outcome will depend very much on having one commander-in-chief of all forces whomsoever he shall be <e>"]
