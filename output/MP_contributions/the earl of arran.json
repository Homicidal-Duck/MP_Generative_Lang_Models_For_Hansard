["<cs> my lords since these are my first words in your lordships house i have particular apprehension this evening knowing so well the great understanding and compassion that my father showed in this house not only for his fellow humans but also for members of the animal kingdom whom he loved so much <e>", "<cs> my lords having been beaten at school i shall no doubt be under deep suspicion in this house before i say anything <e> <s> i scarcely thought that some years after having been beaten for listening to a state funeral on a crystal set i should be in your lordships house discussing the merits of whether beating should be allowed at all <e> <s> i have the feeling that many of your lordships would agree that in those years most of the western world has become a considerably softer place in its attitude towards discipline <e> <s> i dare to suggest furthermore that many of your lordships will consider that to be not a good thing <e> <s> perhaps like myself and it would appear others some of your lordships have experienced a beating and found that it did no harm and indeed on reflection did some good <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord norrie has stolen some of my thunder this evening <e> <s> nevertheless i hope to have a few claps left in my quiver <e> <s> in the eyes of the law i too have transgressed and in the eyes of the church i have sinned for i have done that which i ought not to have done i have traded on a sunday <e> <s> although i may be a miserable offender and although there may be no health in me i fear that i must ask fellow miserable offenders to link arms and accompany me along the paths of the unrighteous <e>", "<cs> my lords when any road is to be built of whatever length or breadth by its very nature it is inevitably going to cause deep resentment very often fearsome anger sometimes great sadness and unfailingly severe disruption not only to those who find themselves alongside it but also to those who live nearby <e> <s> a road is an immensely unattractive object with yard after yard of grey tarmac layed by man across gods country <e> <s> but in accepting that we have to have them i decided the day before yesterday to see for myself just why so much controversy has raged for so long over the road scheduled to bypass the town of okehampton to the south <e>", "<cs> i have great confidence that noble lords will deem this to be a really extraordinarily complicated and i believe confusing amendment for it abounds with anomalies similar to those which already exist under the present law <e> <s> once again we note with interest that it permits the deans and chapters to open their cathedral shops to sell books <e> <s> why i pray should books not be allowed to be sold in our group of book shops on sundays <e> <s> why should the church the railway stations and civil airports have such a divine monopoly <e>", "<cs> if this amendment were to become law and that law were to be effectively enforced the position would be a great deal worse than it is today <e> <s> i should like to comment on its effect on london where i am a retailer <e> <s> just consider for a moment the vast number of visitors who come to london each year from other parts of the kingdom and overseas <e> <s> what sort of impression do you imagine that we shall create on the person hoping to spend an enjoyable weekend here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for his kind and <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we are breaking the law <e> <s> i think that one is allowed to trade until midnight <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i am wrong in this respect <e> <s> i thought i was right but i am sure we can find out at a later date <e> <s> but i can assure your lordships that we do not stay open until half-past ten at night purely because it is nice to see the lights twinkling in our bookshops <e> <s> furthermore i predict that it will not be too long before we have -hour trading in london and we really ought to get used to that strong likelihood <e> <s> i just wonder if the noble lord has taken that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that i can be forgiven for my observation that at times during the various stages of this bill it has seemed as if st paul himself had ridden on a white charger through your lordships chamber causing in his wake the cupboard doors to fly open and to fall out what might only be described as a host of dormant devouts or sudden sabbatarians for such has been the newly awakened passion and fervour for the sanctity of sunday <e> <s> it has at times been i feel just a little overdone <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord stallard for having entered the list of speakers so late but i assure the noble lord and your lordships house that i shall make up for it by being the briefest speaker here tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords you will probably by now appreciate that piracy is not dead for although the traditional form of maritime piracy has gradually faded as this century has progressed a new form of piracy called publishing piracy has now sprung up to take its place <e> <s> as yet and as far as we know flashing sabres in the hands of ferocious swashbucklers are not in order but the loot the treasure is even allowing for inflation just as great and is most certainly much easier to come by <e> <s> perhaps at this juncture i should decare an interest not your lordships will be relieved to learn one of a piratical nature but rather as a director of a united kingdom bookselling organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to second my noble friends motion for a humble address in reply to her majestys most gracious speech <e>", "<cs> my lords we also regard with great pleasure the continual care and concern of the prince of wales for the problems confronting the many and varied sections of society in this country <e> <s> similarly his sister the princess anne whom we never cease to admire for her tireless efforts in her work for save the children in so many other parts of the world is an ambassadress of the highest essence and quality <e>", "<cs> my lords the tone and tenor of this debate introduced by the noble lord lord molloy are such that he would have us believe that we are a nation wracked by social and economic disparities a nation divided by class and by money the poverty of the north for ever at odds with the affluence of the south a nation stricken down by the ugliness of unemployment envy warring with greed a nation heading for ruin and ultimate disintegration <e> <s> these really are rather emotive provocative and in my opinion highly exaggerated sentiments <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to consider for a few minutes whether there is any validity whatsoever in the noble lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are acutely conscious that the standard of service at some of the regional passport offices is unsatisfactory due to industrial action <e> <s> however work is well advanced on a computerised passport-issuing system intended to provide a faster and more efficient service to the public <e> <s> the system is due for introduction in glasgow in july extending to all passport offices hopefully by the end of <e> <s> as a part of the process work on postal applications now done in london is to be dispersed to glasgow following which the london office will deal with personal callers only <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for his kind remarks <e> <s> this is an occasion not lacking in some anxiety for me <e> <s> as regards his question everything is being done to facilitate the service as it stands and to improve it in particular through computerisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord mishcon for his kind remarks <e> <s> i cannot guarantee that i shall continue to do in the future as much as i have done today but i shall do my best <e> <s> of course i shall pass on his remarks concerning the european passport situation and see that matters improve <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord grimond for his question <e> <s> it is hoped that computerisation will streamline the passport issuing and record-keeping processes by eliminating many tedious and repetitive tasks <e> <s> the main advantage will be automation of the issuing process and improved facilities for monitoring the progress of applications through the system <e>", "<cs> my lords may i once again thank the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> frequent situation reports are being provided to the association of british travel agents for the information of its members and clients <e> <s> the passport department has its own entry on prestel which gives delay times and other information which is repeated in recorded telephone messages from the london <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her kind remarks <e> <s> i hope that the public are aware of that possibility <e> <s> every step is being taken to make them fully aware of how to go about the procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> he is quite correct <e> <s> each passport has to be reissued every years i believe <e> <s> obviously passports have to be reissued as a form of identification for people travelling abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i hope very much that that will be the case and that for all our lordships sakes the noble lords passport will be issued well before the end of <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i cannot regrettably answer the technicalities on the point that he makes <e> <s> i apologise for being negative but perhaps the noble lord will allow me to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness and i take note of her comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that question <e> <s> a passport is a uniquely important document providing evidence of a persons identity and national status and it must be internationally acceptable <e> <s> there is reason to believe that other countries would be reluctant to accept such a document issued other than by a government agency <e> <s> there are also objections on security grounds <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that i am very aware of the deep interest of the noble lord in this subject which dates back to his participation in the pearson commission <e> <s> we have no specific plans in respect of medical accidents but the civil justice review has put forward proposals which aim to improve the machinery of civil justice by means of reforms in jurisdiction procedure and court administration and in particular to reduce delay cost and complexity <e> <s> the review has examined arrangements for five classes of civil business including personal injuries <e> <s> a consultation paper on personal injuries was issued in february <e> <s> the question of an insurance-based compensation scheme was raised by those responding to the paper and will be considered along with the other responses <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be entirely wrong and improper to prejudge any of the recommendations of the review until it is completed at the end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat to the noble and learned lord that it would be wrong and out of place to prejudge the results of the civil justice review <e>", "<cs> my lords a working party established by the british medical association has produced a report on no fault compensation <e> <s> i understand that it was submitted to the associations annual representative meeting at bristol only last week <e> <s> any representations from the british medical association on this subject will be given very careful consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for the points he makes <e> <s> they are indeed taken to heart <e>", "<cs> my lords wth respect i can only repeat my original answer to the question on the order paper <e> <s> the government currently have no specific plans in respect of medical accidents but they are of course at all times keeping a very careful watch on what is happening in this and in other countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the point that he makes <e> <s> i repeat that the government are very much aware of the problems in other countries both in the united states and again the additional example of sweden <e> <s> that country has a patient insurance scheme negotiated between the county councils and the main insurance companies which provides no-fault compensation for medical accidents <e> <s> the basic rule in sweden is that compensation is payable if injury could have been avoided <e> <s> there arc i understand problems already arising in sweden with the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i can only take note of the noble viscounts comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for the point which he has so clearly illustrated <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i accept that the patient is of extreme and dire importance in these circumstances <e> <s> patients pursuing negligence claims need to obtain independent legal and medical advice <e> <s> action for victims of medical accidents is an independent organisation run by a lawyer <e> <s> it helps people to contact suitable lawyers and holds a list of medical experts willing to advise in litigation cases <e> <s> the organisation is independent and it is not funded by the department <e>", "<cs> my lords i stress once again that the government take this matter seriously have always taken it seriously and will continue to take it very seriously <e> <s> the government will also keep abreast of what is happening in other countries as well as this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it somewhat distressing and it now appears to have become traditional that noble lords opposite criticise such regulations <e> <s> i must express disappointment that they continue their opposition to this obviously successful and popular scheme which is now in its sixth year <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can now repeat a statement on polytechnics and inner london which has been made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for education and science <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey as regards evidence my right honourable friend the secretary of state has evidence in the form of reports from the polytechnics and colleges themselves and from local authority documents that several authorities are actively considering or taking steps to avoid polytechnic and college assets being transferred <e>", "<cs> on the second point made by the noble lord regarding ilea the inner london boroughs must obviously be given the opportunity to decide for themselves whether to take on education functions <e> <s> i believe that many will be keen to do so <e> <s> however if some wish education to be administered within their areas by a unitary authority albeit one that may be reduced in size by the decisions of other boroughs that is not a possibility that we should rule out <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his remarks and it goes without saying that i agree with them <e>", "<cs> my lords the interests of present and future students must be paramount <e> <s> it is the governments duty to take whatever action is necessary to prevent damage to the quality and effectiveness of this key sector of higher education <e> <s> my right honourable friend must act to prevent the threat posed by a small number of irresponsible authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances i shall pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend for that interruption <e>", "<cs> my lords i must repeat that i shall pass on the concerns anxieties and questions of noble lords to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is <e> <s> these decisions were taken by my right honourable friend the secretary of state in view of the circumstances he had at hand and particularly in view of the fact there was about to be a three months recess <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i agree and i am grateful to my noble and learned friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord i confess that i understand that nottinghamshire was one of the areas <e> <s> i know of no others <e>", "<cs> my lords it is easier for the opposition to have an idea of anticipated questions than ones own benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with that remark <e> <s> this subject needed mentioning and mentioning urgently <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to tell my noble friend lord mersey how grateful i am to him for introducing this debate tonight in your lordships house <e> <s> equally i express my thanks to all other noble lords all of whom have made a very valuable contribution and who in doing so now enable me to update your lordships on the governments current situation concerning civil protection <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess straightaway that i am not absolutely certain <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend will allow me to write to him on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i particularly thank the noble lord lord mishcon for those remarks <e> <s> of course i shall answer those questions in writing <e> <s> i most earnestly thank him for the courteous way he has put those questions this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords phoenix house local projects have already been allocated over million from the centrally-funded drugs initiative in recognition of the valuable work they do <e> <s> we have also given very careful consideration to phoenix houses application for a grant towards its headquarters costs <e> <s> however we were not convinced that a grant would secure improvements in the units which it is running or represent value for money in comparison with competing bids for funding <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully acknowledge the substantial contribution which phoenix house is making to the development of services for drug misusers across the country <e> <s> we are recognising this by allocating it grants totalling over million over the period under the central funding initiative <e> <s> indeed it is receiving more funds under the initiative than any other single voluntary organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should particularly like to thank the noble baroness for her most sensitive and sensible remarks <e> <s> of course the government always keep a very strict eye on core funding <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the visit of my right honourable friend to phoenix <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that that question is somewhat wide of the mark <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that i cannot answer that question <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient moment for the committee to adjourn <e> <s> i suggest that the committee stage begins again at pm <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> before moving that the house do now resume perhaps i may suggest that we return to the committee stage at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first of all to congratulate the noble lord lord carter on his choice of subject for todays debate namely the needs and problems of people with disabilities <e> <s> it is of course far from being a subject new to your lordships house <e> <s> there have been a number of excellent debates on various aspects of disability over recent years <e> <s> todays debate has at least matched the quality of its predecessors and as usual noble lords <e>", "<cs> in moving that the house do now resume i suggest that we return to the committee stage at five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the comments of the noble lords lord wigoder and lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> in the circumstances i think that they would not expect me to comment upon this myself but i shall of course refer it to my noble friend lord caithness <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised interesting questions about the procedures for obtaining restraint and charging orders <e> <s> before i reply in some detail to the amendments it may help if i just remind the committee of the purpose and nature of these powers <e> <s> under the bill the perpetrators of highly profitable serious crimes will become liable to confiscation of the value of their unlawful proceeds <e> <s> but the confiscation powers will not become effective unless there is also power at an early stage in the proceedings to freeze assets so that they cannot be dissipated before the case comes to trial <e> <s> thus the bill gives powers to the high court to make restraint and charging orders <e>", "<cs> these provisions ensure that a restraint or charging order may only be made on good grounds and that there is ample opportunity for challenge by the affected parties <e> <s> to incorporate more hurdles into the procedure as the noble lord has suggested would risk defeating the whole purpose of these confiscation powers by allowing sophisticated and experienced criminals to move their assets out of reach of the courts while the prosecution sought to marshall their case <e> <s> i really believe that the balance in the bill is right as it stands <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask the noble lord not to press these amendments <e>", "<cs> i recognise that the noble lords concern in this amendment is partly to avoid undue burdens on the sentencing court in trying to assess precisely the available property <e> <s> however i do not think that those burdens will be as great as he fears <e> <s> in the more complex cases involving substantial assets a great deal of investigative work will have been done in gathering evidence and securing restraint of assets before the trial <e> <s> the procedure in clause enables the necessary information to be put before the court and in disputed matters determined in an orderly way <e>", "<cs> i must begin by saying that there is nothing new in the provision in clause <e> <s> it has never been accepted that compensation should he payable simply because the prosecution has been unable to discharge the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the specific charge that was brought <e> <s> the circumstances in which compensation may be paid under clause are broadly those in which successive governments have paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the committee may feel that we have reached a suitable moment to break <e> <s> we shall return to the subject in one hours time at <e> <s> beg to move that the committee do now adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> this may be a convenient moment for the committee to adjourn <e> <s> i suggest that the committee stage begins again at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the committee do now adjourn during pleasure <e>", "<cs> my lords the responsibility for enforcing speed limits rests with individual chief officers of police and we are satisfied that the police give a proper degree of attention to the performance of this duty <e> <s> nevertheless the government and the police arc at all times looking for ways of improving enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to tell my noble friend that i did not see that programme on television last week <e> <s> however police cars are deployed whether it be on bridges on motorways themselves or on certain roads their purpose is the same to apprehend any culprit and indeed to try to deter any would-be culprit <e>", "<cs> my lords there are currently no plans to alter the motorway speed limit <e> <s> reviews of the speed limit in concluded that the present limit gives the correct balance between the need for safe travel and convenient travel <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the methods adopted in america <e> <s> i think it really is up to each individual chief constable in his particular area to decide how to go about enforcing the law <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am delighted to know that that may possibly be true i cannot actually confirm that <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord however that motorways are seven times safer than urban roads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to hear that that is true <e> <s> obviously the reason why we keep to the present speed limits in this country is so that the law can be enforceable <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lord is that the road traffic law reviews report is expected to be published in the early part of next year <e> <s> it is expected that it will take account of all the forms that the noble lord has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i was under the impression that i had just answered my noble friend on that very point <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the first question of the noble lord the leader of the opposition on speed limits for cars and light vehicles the limit is miles an hour on single lane carriageways unless otherwise marked or lined with street lamps <e> <s> the speed limit is miles an hour on dual carriageways and motorways <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to have more data on those vehicles which exceed tonnes i can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that <e> <s> i am very aware that obviously the more police cars there can be on motorways or indeed on ordinary roads the better <e> <s> as i said originally as much as possible is being done to find ways and means of improving safety on roads <e> <s> it is regrettable but nevertheless a fact that many of the accidents that occur on our roads are due to either foolishness or selfishness <e> <s> both show scant regard for the safety of fellow motorists and can often result in tragic circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are always looking at improvements and particularly at the moment at technological improvements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of the two noble lords on this directive <e> <s> i take first the points raised by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> the noble lord lord ennals was courteous enough to warn me that he was going to ask about the number of pharmacists practising abroad and vice versa <e> <s> in spite of his warning i have not been able to find out the exact and accurate answer <e> <s> in those circumstances perhaps the noble lord will allow me to write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess to some trepidation in addressing your lordships house this evening <e> <s> i hasten to mention that this is not because of any deficiencies in the governments position on the issue in question <e> <s> on the contrary we have a good story to tell which i shall shortly unfold <e> <s> my trepidation arises from having to talk on a subject the welfare of animals on which the noble lord lord houghton has a fund of experience and wisdom which is quite unique <e> <s> on the more personal note however i am proud of my paternal credentials so far as animals are concerned for as some of your lordships will remember it was my father who was responsible for putting on the statute book the badgers act of which sought to protect those delightful creatures <e> <s> it was kind and thoughtful of the noble lord to mention that <e>", "<cs> my lords our continued determination to pursue our drive for significant improvements in waiting times backed by additional funding has not lessened <e> <s> most of the projects currently being supported from the first million allocation of the waiting list fund are now under way <e> <s> these projects involve the treatment of some additional patients from the waiting list <e> <s> many have already been treated <e> <s> for next year we have increased the waiting list fund to million <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall never be satisfied with the numbers on the waiting lists until we have been successful in reducing them further <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is that among the regional health authorities there is a competitive spirit from the point of view of tendering and where the money would be most appropriately spent <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only take note of the noble lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords we are funding a number of projects proposed by regions involved in the private sector <e> <s> the cost-effective use of private facilities will allow nhs patients to be treated more quickly than would otherwise be the case <e> <s> that clearly makes sense <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that is somewhat wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of the particular circumstances to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> of course the situation is regrettable <e> <s> each <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect because i deemed it to be so <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret i do not know the exact and precise circumstances of the case which is mentioned <e> <s> of course it is regrettable but once again i must repeat that there are regrettable circumstances across the country <e> <s> each district authority is aware of them and is doing its best to put them right <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is clearly understood that everyone is aware of the nurses situation <e> <s> at all times my right honourable friend the secretary of state is looking at those particular circumstances to see whether and if so what improvements can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is this <e> <s> of those who require admission into hospital per cent <e> <s> are admitted immediately and the remaining per cent <e> <s> are admitted within eight weeks <e> <s> it is the final per cent <e> <s> to which we are giving special attention <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> if such a proposal comes to be decided by ministers it would only be endorsed after the most careful scrutiny <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of the great contribution that the westminster hospital makes to london <e> <s> the simple point is that no decision has yet been made about the closure of the hospital and in those circumstances i think it is difficult to answer more questions on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indebted to the noble lord and i am very much aware of the great services that the westminster hospital gives to the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of many wonderful similar cases such as my noble friend has mentioned and i hear of circumstances the whole time which bear out precisely what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect the question on the order paper relates to the possible closure of the westminster hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of what the noble lord lord grimond has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing on the order paper in the name of my noble friend lord caithness <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take note of the noble lords comments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the comments of the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> i agree that it is extremely useful and important that reports are published in both english and welsh <e> <s> that must be to the pleasure and use of both countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that on th september central birmingham health authority decided for financial reasons not to accept new patients for renal dialysis for the remainder of the financial year <e> <s> however following discussions with my honourable friend the minister for health the chairman of the west midlands regional health authority announced on th october that an additional would be earmarked this year for the renal units in central and east birmingham health authorities to enable them to continue to take on new patients <e> <s> this has come out of the waiting list money that the department has already allocated to the west midlands region <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that was a somewhat long question <e> <s> i shall just answer one of the points raised by the noble countess on the basis as i interpret it of robbing peter to pay paul <e> <s> any increase in funding for one specialty must mean less for another <e> <s> this year however the west midlands is receiving over million from the national waiting list fund <e> <s> even by diverting some money to renal services i am confident that west midlands will build on its record of reducing waiting lists <e> <s> good progress has been made here with a per cent <e> <s> reduction since in the number of patients waiting for treatment and a per cent <e> <s> reduction over the same period in the numbers waiting for over a year <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords but i am not too aware of the question that the noble lord put <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble lord lord ennals i feel that the noble lord forecasts a somewhat alarmist situation <e> <s> all these considerations if indeed they happen will be taken into account at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware of the comments of the noble baroness <e> <s> indeed i shall write to her along those lines <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i am still not totally clear about the question <e>", "<cs> once again my lords i am not sure of the question posed <e>", "<cs> my lords to make a decision now based on next year and the year after is a little too early <e> <s> if any problems that have been outlined do arise they will be considered at the correct moment in time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her question <e> <s> i am just as sensitive and as deeply aware of the deep misfortune that such patients suffer <e> <s> during the time of the ban patients were referred to one of the other six centres in the region at east birmingham stoke coventry dudley luckfield and wolverhampton <e> <s> the regional health authority is keen to develop other renal centres in the region so as to relieve pressure on the queen elizabeth unit <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government propose to help the west midlands health authority at all times like all other health authorities <e> <s> if such fearful problems pose themselves they will be looked at immediately and the correct remedies taken <e>", "<cs> my lords the unit which the noble lord lord prys-davies mentions is only one of seven in the region <e> <s> it is for the regional health authority to determine how much money to invest in each unit <e> <s> the authority is investing of new money in its renal programme this year <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be the appropriate time to adjourn the report stage <e> <s> i suggest that we do not resume before pm <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords proposition is that anyone who is acquitted and has suffered loss as a result of the processes of justice should be entitled to the opportunity of seeking compensation <e> <s> but the government do not believe it would be in the best interests of justice to adopt this radically new approach to the issue of compensation <e> <s> the noble lord is saying that any acquitted person <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for clarifying that point <e> <s> but we do not accept the proposition that all acquitted persons should be able to secure compensation from public funds <e> <s> we do not think it right that the person whose prosecution failed on a technicality should be entitled to benefit in this way nor the person who by his actions brought prosecution upon himself <e> <s> this is why clause like the drug trafficking offences act before it establishes the test of serious default <e>", "<cs> my lords the government support the work of the five research councils <e> <s> the medical research council does research into human genetic disorders <e> <s> all research councils maintain contact with and sometimes collaborate with

breaching that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the question posed by the noble lord the leader of the opposition i shall be as brief but as succinct as possible <e> <s> as regards composition the council will consist of a chairman and six members <e> <s> the home secretary hopes to announce the appointment of a chairman in the near future <e> <s> as regards the date the council will be put on a statutory basis but it will be established initially in advance of legislation <e> <s> i understand that good progress is being made on the administrative arrangements and we hope to

front bench for fielding the fourth question <e>", "<cs> my lords it is as yet too early to know what will be the precise powers of the bsc <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that i am well aware of the feelings not only in this house but outside it concerning the public distaste for many programmes which appear on radio and television <e> <s> a debate was recently initiated in your lordships house about the possibility of setting some form of statutory control on the press but it was thought that for the time being that would be most unwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his generosity <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may advise the noble lord that the bsc will not be a regulatory body and will reinforce not hijack the responsibilities of the broadcasting authorities <e> <s> however it will be influential and will be able to consider and analyse complaints initiate discussion and research and where necessary express and publicise views on individual programmes without waiting for its annual report <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give my noble friend an answer but i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords there are other matters of considerable distaste besides violence and sex <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe my noble friend is rather wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the question posed by the noble lord is wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that demonstrates the wisdom and independence of the chairman of the bbc <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i have said quite enough about what we hope the bsc will do <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will understand my point <e>", "<cs> my lords the government welcome this opportunity to debate an important subject and are grateful to my noble friend lady cox for raising it for discussion <e> <s> the serious contributions made by your lordships have served to emphasise the importance with which we regard this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept and understand the point that the noble earl makes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously grateful that the noble lord is in full agreement with the order <e> <s> i should just like to conclude by saying that the chances of defeating the menace of drug trafficking can only be improved by the order in council <e> <s> it will ensure that measures to deprive the traffickers of their proceeds are effective throughout england wales and scotland <e> <s> that is a most important objective <e> <s> therefore i am sure that your lordships will give it your full assent <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord newall has explained at present bookmakers pay voluntary contributions to the management of greyhound tracks in addition to the charges made under section of the betting gaming and lotteries act

charge which bookmakers may be required to pay by order than by primary legislation <e> <s> we do not believe that to be so <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has suggested that there is a precedent for an order-making power contained in schedule to the betting gaming and lotteries act <e> <s> with respect i do not think that the analogy holds <e> <s> schedule enables my right honourable friend the secretary of state by order to vary the percentage which tote operators may deduct from bets laid with them <e> <s> that power has been exercised following representations from the track operators but

bets laid with their competitors <e> <s> in contrast bookmakers could be expected to want and deserve an explicit say in charges levied on them <e> <s> i must repeat that if my noble friend wishes to propose a power the exercise of which was explicitly contingent upon the prior arrangement of the interested parties we should be ready to consider that and give our views by the report stage <e>",

has been said <e> <s> i may have received a brief on the matter but it happens to be what both i and the government believe to be true <e> <s> in those circumstances i cannot recommend the amendment

alcohol-related health problems <e> <s> my own department maintains records of public order offences and of offences in which alcohol is the primary cause for example drunkenness <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to clarify the definition of intoxicating liquor found in section of the licensing act to remove any doubt about the status of low-alcohol and no-alcohol beers and wines <e>", "<cs> the licensing law enables off-licensed premises to operate longer hours than public houses on weekdays in that they may sell alcohol from am <e> <s> the new clause seeks to extend those hours so that they may begin at am this being the time when many shops and supermarkets now open <e> <s> i am not persuaded that the present restrictions seriously hamper the right of people to buy alcohol when they choose but i believe that it is important that we maintain a meaningful limit on the hours when alcohol may be bought <e>", "<cs> at present the licensing law permits off-licensed outlets and most on-licensed premises only very restricted hours on sundays christmas day and good friday <e> <s> the shops act however which in many respects imposes an even more restrictive regime on sundays does not impose any restrictions on good friday trading <e>", "<cs> i can understand that many in the retail trade particularly the representatives of large companies may feel that a requirement to attend licensing sessions each time a named licence holder moves from one set of premises to another is unduly onerous <e> <s> in many cases the nature of the new store will not be significantly different and the fitness <e>", "<cs> i can only listen and take note of the comments of the noble lord on this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot commend the new clause to the house <e> <s> as my noble friend has explained it would confer on my right honourable friend the home secretary a power to vary by order the figure in section of the betting gaming and lotteries

a power the exercise of which was explicitly contingent upon a prior agreement between the interested parties <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me on this occasion to compliment my noble friend lord newall on steering his bill thus far <e> <s> i am grateful to him for withdrawing at report stage his proposed amendment that my right honourable friend the home secretary should be empowered by order further to vary the amount which the operators of greyhound tracks may charge bookmakers <e> <s> the bill is itself now confined as introduced to varying that amount <e> <s> on second reading and in committee i explained that we are not opposed in principle to such a measure <e> <s> for completeness i had to add that we understand that the bill does not enjoy the agreement of the bookmakers which may be thought to be a necessary ingredient <e> <s> but it does address a real issue <e> <s> whether the solution it proposes is the right one is a question for parliament to judge <e> <s> we will watch its progress in another place with interest <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords both demand and provision are discretionary in nursery education and the

of evidence <e> <s> that is in active preparation <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must repeat that education for the under-s is not a part of compulsory schooling but it is up to the local education

conservative and labour in the face of economic restraints <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards resources that the government give to the education authorities they will continue to give the same resources in real terms <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord would like to become more involved in this particular <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i shall <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the point made by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point of the noble lord <e> <s> the government have expressed concern that some of the provision may be inappropriate for year-olds and they are watching the situation closely <e> <s> shortages of experienced teachers and appropriate equipment are the major constraints <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it would be helpful at this stage if i

stedman <e> <s> in particular i should pay tribute to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords it is entirely for the independent broadcasting authority to determine the way it discharges its

proper balance and a wide range in their subject matter <e> <s> if the authority should conclude that a particular contractor was not fulfilling his contract it would be open to the authority to take such steps as are necessary to secure compliance with the contract or to terminate the contract <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> but i must again repeat that it is ultimately the responsibility of the iba to see that its contractors carry out its wishes as laid down in the contract <e>", "<cs> my lords one of the fundamental principles of our system of public service broadcasting is that the broadcasting authority should be free from government interference in its day-to-day affairs <e> <s> i am sure noble lords agree that it would be a sad day if this important principle were to be jeopardised <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat the statement on prisons which is being made in another place by my right honourable

estate under review we currently have no plans to change the role of grendon <e>", "<cs> my lords when i first spoke in response to the statement i said that this was a sombre and serious occasion <e>

accusation from the noble lord that the crime record under this government is worse than it would have been under any other government <e> <s> it does not matter which government are in power <e> <s>

our proposals <e> <s> i have explained how we intend to do that and i take particular note of the comments of the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have said if a debate is required to be

the noble baroness will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> to clarify that point it is only certain foundation subjects <e>", "<cs> in this particular discussion we are talking about both core and foundation subjects <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back on this and say that the programmes of study will not be syllabuses <e> <s> they will set out certain important matters skills and processes to

requires the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i shall heed the advice of my noble friend and examine this point <e> <s> i shall take it away and hope to come back with a clearer

circular that where a hospice provides a service which forms part of the health authoritys overall strategy for terminal care that health authority should agree with the hospice an appropriate contribution towards its running costs <e> <s> the circular also requested health authorities to provide information on their arrangements for financial support of hospices in their integrated planning statements which are due this summer <e> <s> we shall of course be critically examining the information that they provide <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> however i can only repeat that if the government funded hospices as they fund local authorities they would cease to be voluntary organisations and would lose the appeal which makes them so special <e> <s> i say again the responsibility for funding hospices belongs to the health authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the question posed by the noble lord and of the feelings of the house i shall certainly pass on the comments and concerns about the hospice movement to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only say to my noble and learned friend that that point of view is certainly appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords this is not a measure that the government would have initiated but equally it is not one which we oppose <e> <s> community health councils are small bodies typically with two or three staff <e> <s> they exist to represent the interest of local people in health service matters and have no executive responsibilities <e> <s> access to their meetings is already assured by the public bodies admission to meetings act <e> <s> however because chcs exist solely to represent the public we see no reason why they should be anything but open with the public <e> <s> there is no reason for them to conduct their business behind closed doors nor to deny copies of their papers to the small number of people who may be moved to want to see them <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have welcomed the advice on aids and drug misuse contained in the report of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs <e> <s> we have responded to a number of its recommendations and are looking in detail at others <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is quite correct in that we have not received a reply to our response to the report of the advisory committee on the misuse of drugs <e> <s> if we do so we shall look at it carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to say precisely what the governments action will be until we have received a reply to our response <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may just clear up the situation with regard to the acmd report on aids and drugs misuse <e> <s> the report was published on th march and copies of it have been <e>", "<cs> my lords the latest stage of the governments drugs prevention campaign which was launched last september in conjunction with anti-injecting publicity was largely heroin specific and was aimed at young people who might be tempted to use drugs <e> <s> it warned them that doing so might well start a process of decline which could result in crime deteriorating health and even injecting drug use and aids <e> <s> independent evaluation shows that negative beliefs about heroin identified in previous stages have been consolidated and resistance to trial remains high <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the points he has made on the matter <e> <s> it is something that i shall be obliged to refer to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it quite clear that the government have already published the acmds report and their response to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this is a suitable moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby accused me of having uttered the words in committee in pious hope or at least of having used the word pious <e> <s> i may have used that word but the piety with which i spoke or the manner in which i spoke at that time i happened to feel was correct and i considered it to be totally accurate and truthful <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in reply to the point raised by the noble baroness lady seear i have already said that that point is covered on the face of the bill as it stands which is extremely comprehensive and all-embracing <e> <s> to add anything further would be completely pointless and would destroy the meaning <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think one can get much more explicit than what is on the face of the bill <e> <s> subsection b states <e>", "<cs> my lords while we are grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for moving this amendment in the name of his noble friend lady lockwood i have to tell him straight off that the governments attitude towards this amendment is very similar to their attitude towards the previous amendment <e> <s> as stated in committee and indeed in relation to the previous amendment the wording of clause of the bill is designed to be very general <e>", "<cs> my lords i am truly grateful to my noble friend lord craigton for his genuine desire to improve clause which i know he does with feeling and with compassion <e> <s> but despite the governments firm commitment to his worthy objectives nonetheless we must once again disappoint him by speaking against his amendment <e> <s> in doing so i hope albeit briefly to be developing a somewhat different argument <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can go no further than to repeat the arguments which i put forward in respect of this amendment and the previous amendment tabled by the noble lord lord hatch <e> <s> the bill stands as it does at the moment and there is no going back on that there is no change <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may be forgiven for interrupting at this point <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that that is correct but only the mover of the amendment can do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we have reached an appropriate moment at which to take a break in these proceedings <e> <s> i therefore beg to move that further consideration on report be adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> i crave the indulgence of the committee because we are not aware of the existence of amendments nos <e> <s> and as apparently tabled by the noble lord lord kilbracken <e>", "<cs> i am not aware of that and i apologise if i should be aware of it <e> <s> perhaps we may come back to the point on report <e> <s> we may be able to satisfy everybody concerned in writing before report <e>", "<cs> my lords we have made some concessions on this point and that is as far as we are prepared to go on this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take all amendments very seriously and consider them in considerable depth <e> <s> sometimes they accept them and sometimes they reject them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether that is correct concerning this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it would be appropriate for me to make quite clear that regarding accepting or rejecting amendments i can say categorically that in relation to financial delegation there are three concessions which were made in committee which have resulted in amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for making those points <e> <s> i can confirm that she is quite right in what she says <e>", "<cs> my lords let me see if i can assist the noble lord by summarising the main changes made by the amendments <e> <s> i hope that the points he made on some of these amendments are incorporated in the summary <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be an appropriate moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords in committee one or two points were made which suggested that the bill as drafted could be further improved <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord tordoff for his willingness yet again to consider these points <e> <s> as a result the amendments which have been put down for third reading meet with the governments approval <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has expressed concern that the framework set out in the draft guidance issued in april may be too demanding for some leas <e> <s> in particular the amendment is directed at two key elements of that framework <e> <s> paragraph of the guidance provides that discretionary exceptions other than school meals should account for no more than per cent <e> <s> of the leas general schools budget initially and no more than per cent <e> <s> after three years <e> <s> paragraph provides that the total amount of resources allocated on the basis of the number of pupils weighted by age and subject should account for at least per cent <e> <s> of the aggregated schools budget <e>", "<cs> my lords concern has rightly been expressed that facilities for pupils with special educational needs should be safeguarded under schemes of financial delegation <e> <s> as my noble friend made clear in committee the government fully share that aim <e> <s> the draft guidance issued by my right honourable friend makes it clear that leas will be expected to take account of special needs in their formula for allocating resources between schools <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord lord peston is being obtuse about the matter <e> <s> however i hoped that i had made it quite clear that we do not think that the amendment is necessary and that what he is after is already covered <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the noble earl lord russell is quite right <e> <s> indeed that fact has come to the governments attention <e>", "<cs> my lords yes we can <e>", "<cs> my lords they are purely tidying-up amendments to make quite sure that the bill is as comprehensive as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of time and clarification perhaps i may write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the anxieties behind this amendment and we are pleased to be able to allay them <e> <s> the purpose of requiring that a proposal for grant-maintained status contains the names and addresses of the proposed governors of the grant-maintained school is simply precautionary it will ensure that they are real people <e> <s> all that matters is that each governor should give an address where he or she may be contacted if necessary <e> <s> there is therefore nothing in the bill which would prevent the head teacher if he or she wished from giving the address of the school itself rather than the home address and we shall make that clear in the guidance which we shall issue in due course <e> <s> in the light of this reassurance i invite my noble friend to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this might be an appropriate moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised an important issue in tabling this amendment and we are grateful to her for that <e> <s> perhaps i may set out the governments thinking on the matter in a little more detail <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the noble baroness is correct <e> <s> this is a government inspired and also an approved amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for moving this amendment to clause which the government are pleased to accept <e> <s> the purpose is to ensure that in the event of a change of government policy any student could continue his or her education in a ctc at least until the statutory minimum school-leaving age <e> <s> ctcs are new types of institution outside the lea system <e> <s> this is a necessary safeguard therefore for students considering taking up ctc places <e> <s> it is also a safeguard for those in industry who are coming forward to establish and run ctcs <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the first point made by the noble lord concerning clause this refers to education which is neither primary nor secondary <e> <s> in relation to the other technical amendments i have stated that they are technical and the noble lord opposite has accepted that they are <e> <s> however i shall make sure that he receives a reply setting out quite clearly all the technicalities in the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords to the best of my knowledge nursery education is not involved <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> p and t go together <e> <s> subsection b explains that the parent will pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has the noble earl replying again <e> <s> the noble baroness lady hart of south lanark is concerned to protect ileas child guidance service and other linked parts of the ilea health service <e> <s> as i made clear in committee we sympathise with that concern <e> <s> the ilea child guidance service has a good reputation <e> <s> its units are spread throughout the ilea but i accept that some boroughs have none and that there is a cross-borough flow of traffic <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we recognise the concern of the noble lord lord ritchie of dundee and the concern of others who have spoken in tabling an amendment which seeks to secure the future of the residential special schools maintained by ilea <e> <s> of course the government recognise the important work they do and the contribution they have made over the years to the education of inner london children with special educational needs <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope i have already made clear that the government recognise the importance of special education and of assisting the london councils to secure adequate and appropriate provision for children and young people with special educational needs within their area <e>", "<cs> my lords i am under the strong impression that it has already been spoken to <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service is undergoing its largest ever sustained capital programme <e> <s> in england there are currently schemes in planning under design and under construction each costing over million <e> <s> in all the programme currently comprises schemes at a total value of over billion and total capital investment in the national health service in all four home counties is at present running at over billion a year <e>", "<cs> my lords any hospital which opens ahead of schedule is nothing but good news for those living in the community <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the point made by the noble viscount <e> <s> however it is for regional health authorities to decide upon the appropriate mix of facilities in their area <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed they are taken into account <e> <s> of the health building schemes which have been completed since included facilities for the mentally ill or mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords bed numbers reduced by in the period and by a further to date <e> <s> of those beds were mental health beds which were closed as a result of the care in the community policy <e> <s> the remaining closures result from the replacement of obsolete usually th century hospital stock by new hospitals capable of greater efficiency <e> <s> this is demonstrated by the increase in activity since <e> <s> for example inpatient treatments have increased by per cent <e> <s> out-patient treatments have increased by per cent <e> <s> day-care treatments have increased by per cent <e> <s> those are the telling facts <e>", "<cs> my lords i take on board the point made by my noble friend about cottage hospitals <e> <s> i can confirm that schemes costing over million have been completed since compared with completions from <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of prime consideration <e> <s> i hope i have stressed that it is a matter for each individual health authority to decide what is appropriate for that authority <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i am aware of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the first question relates more to the treasury and its particular policy on that matter <e>", "<cs> my lords officials and representatives of the association of chief police officers are now examining together the problems which are faced by the police in tackling the kind of disorder highlighted in the report and how best to overcome them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount is right there is a common-law order whereby each and every citizen should go to the help of a police officer if he sees that that police officer is in trouble <e> <s> however i believe that i am right in saying that that <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe i am right in saying that that point has been discussed previously both privately and publicly <e> <s> i can make no comment other than to say that i shall bring that point to the attention of my right honourable friend the home secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can make any particular apposite comment with <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble

answer to the supplementary question of the noble viscount lord falkland i believe that the answer simply lies in christian beliefs and christian teaching as the noble lord pointed out <e>", "<cs> my

all agree that the bill now is as we want it to be <e> <s> that applies especially to amendment no <e> <s> which is under consideration at the moment <e> <s> i should briefly say that since the matter was raised at an early stage of the bills proceedings we have looked carefully at the proposed amendment <e> <s> bearing in mind the kinds of animals with which the bill is essentially concerned

bill so that it refers to the purpose of the bill rather than the animals which are to be affected by its provisions <e> <s> ponies and donkeys are no longer referred to as such in the bill but in any case it is not necessary to list all the affected animals <e> <s> the application of the bill to animals is implicit in the term tethering <e> <s> we support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have

protection to people who share accommodation with a resident landlord if they work for them so that it would be necessary to get a court order to evict someone who worked for you if you shared accommodation with them <e> <s> with respect to the noble lord <e> <s> we think that <e>", "<cs> my lords let us see whether we can reassure the noble lord lord meston on this amendment <e> <s> this is a subject that the noble lord lord ross raised at committee stage <e> <s> we fully appreciate his argument that the landlord or licensor who out of the kindness of his heart lets a friend live in accommodation he has spare might be rather shocked to find that if the friend repays his kindness by refusing to go he has to obtain a court order to evict him <e> <s> we put it to the noble lord that in the majority of cases we are talking about resident landlords letting their spare rooms to their friends and of course if they share accommodation no court order is necessary <e> <s> not many people have spare properties they can afford to let entirely rent free even to friends out of the kindness of their hearts <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall acccept the invitation of the noble lord lord mcintosh to demonstrate the consideration that we have given to the amendments <e> <s> noble lords will forgive me but it will take a short time to do that because they are somewhat diverse <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say at the outset that we have no doubt that the amendment has the best interests of the ethnic community at heart <e> <s> the government and the housing corporation also recognise the special housing needs of people with an ethnic minority background and the desirability of housing associations being set up and run by groups from those minorities <e> <s> however the powers already available to the corporation seem to us to be sufficient for the purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i am most grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for giving me considerable time for a measured response to his very penetrating question <e> <s> as regards the funds there are always more demands on any programme of public expenditure than available resources can meet <e> <s> the sums available to the housing corporation for the section grants and other revenue purposes are carefully considered each year in discussion with the corporation <e> <s> i hope that that answer will satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am once again grateful for the assistance of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton <e> <s> we can answer his question <e> <s> he has referred to amendment no <e> <s> which provides that new arrangements under clause for the treatment of associations surplus income shall apply for accounting years which end after enactment of the clause which will be on st april <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may slightly expand my previous answer <e> <s> while we cannot go as far as the noble lord would wish we are well aware that there are strict limits to the amount of charge which associations can absorb in relation to years which have already begun on the commencement date <e> <s> we will take that fully into account in our discussions with the nfha <e>", "<cs> my lords this may be a suitable moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords if noble lords will allow it i shall come straight to the point <e> <s> we debated in committee at some length a still more far-reaching amendment on this very theme <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh gave us notice at the time that he would be likely to come back with amendments at a later stage designed to set at rest some of the fears expressed by his bench <e> <s> my noble friend lord brabazon of tara undertook that we would look at any less draconian amendment on its merits but said that he could not give any assurance that we would look at it any more favourably <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to take a short time in pointing out to your lordships why we believe that the amendment has no purpose in practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey says that there is no threat in these amendments but we are not too convinced of their validity <e> <s> we understand the concern of the noble lord in introducing these amendments <e> <s> we too recognise the desirability of appointing people who live in or have special knowledge of the hat area <e> <s> however i do not think that it is appropriate to try to tighten the present requirement <e> <s> as my noble friend lord hesketh pointed out in committee hats will be temporary bodies charged with carrying out the difficult tasks in a short time <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state must be able to appoint to the board the best combination of people he can find <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the governments responsibility to try to persuade the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that both amendments are not necessary <e> <s> we have already announced our intention to issue and publish hat management guidance which will cover many issues <e> <s> perhaps i may return to that at a later stage because the noble lord asked especially about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state has discretionary powers under clause <e> <s> hat management guidance will include matters such as the powers available to hats the way that they should have the estates transferred the interaction with other agencies and the way that they should undertake the disposal of their property <e> <s> i hope that that helps the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords my natural reaction to that question is that my right honourable friend the secretary of state is the very source and soul of democracy and fully intends to see that the full play is enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords as your lordships know we moved amendments in committee to ensure that as far as possible the tenants choice procedures cannot cut across the boundaries of an existing tenant management co-operative <e> <s> the noble lord expressed concern that this protection would not cover emergent co-ops and we agreed to consider that point further as he said <e>", "<cs> it would work like this before a tenant management co-op can be created the local authority is required by section a of the housing act to consult the tenants <e> <s> there will be an identifiable point where the authority resolves to put that consultation in hand <e> <s> where a resolution of that kind about a proposed management co-op had been made the corporation would be able to say this resolution has been passed it is a genuine proposal which is being taken forward promptly <e> <s> although the statutory arrangements in clause do not bite because the co-op does not yet legally exist it would be sensible to make sure that broadly the same rule applies <e> <s> if a tenants choice applicant applies for some of the tenanted property where tenants are being consulted about devolution to a co-op therefore he must apply for all of it <e> <s> and he cannot add into his application tenanted property whose tenants are not being so consulted <e>", "<cs> my lords let us take each of the elements in the amendment of the noble lord in turn <e> <s> first however we should repeat the general point that we made in committee that although all potential applicants must be prepared as a condition of their approval to take part in a preliminary competition when requested to do so by the housing corporation there will not be a competition in each and every case <e> <s> sometimes only one potential applicant despite the best endeavours of the housing corporation will be interested <e> <s> sometimes it will be so clear what the tenants want where there is strong local pressure for a co-operative for example that a preliminary competition is not appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords in principle means what it says <e> <s> it means that that is the principal point involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i retract that <e> <s> i mean in principle <e> <s> i must now continue with the brief <e> <s> ten per cent <e> <s> is a reasonable initial hurdle given first that the prospective applicant will have some way to go to present his case to the tenant secondly that there may have been several competing potential applicants in the preliminary competition and thirdly that the tenants cannot yet have seen a binding offer of terms on which to judge <e> <s> we also <e>", "<cs> my lords we understand the points made by the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> applicants will be obliged by regulations under clause supplemented as necessary by conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords we oppose the amendment because at best it is unnecessary and at worst it is not acceptable <e> <s> as the noble lord made clear the objective of the amendment is to extend the category of tenants who on the face of the bill are given the right to be consulted under clause <e> <s> it would extend that category provided for in subsection a to cover qualifying tenants or long leaseholders who had not been in occupation on the relevant date or if appropriate the date on which their home was added to the application under clause d <e> <s> we have made it clear all along that we recognise the need to adjust at the margins the range of tenants who are to be consulted under clause and within that group those whose vote would determine whether or not their home was to transfer <e> <s> following the amendment to which your lordships agreed in committee subsection of clause now enables precisely that to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords given what we said in committee when moving the amendments which added subsection to clause it will come as no surprise to your lordships if we say that we must oppose amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> subsection provides that rent arrears built up under the management of existing landlords shall remain debts owed to that landlord for it to recover in the usual way for civil debt <e> <s> it does not let the tenant off the hook he is still liable to pay that debt <e> <s> the subsection we readily concede removes from that landlords armoury of weapons for debt recovery the threat of eviction <e> <s> but where a landlord has convinced a court before the relevant date that possession is the only answer that tenant is excluded from tenants choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay tribute to the noble lord lord mcintosh for moving these amendments to which i am happy to give the governments support <e> <s> as the noble lord said they have the same effect in scotland as amendments moved at committee stage for england by the noble lord namely to ensure that a tenant who becomes bankrupt does not lose his tenancy because of that unfortunate circumstance where the tenancy is of no value to the trustee <e>", "<cs> my lords we fully understand the concern behind this amendment and we have a very great deal of sympathy with some of its objectives <e> <s> indeed our track record on this is good since our rent act booklets were translated into five ethnic minority languages <e> <s> we have already stated in committee our intention to ensure that sufficient information is available to people affected by the bill <e> <s> we have also said in committee that we would expect hats to ensure that their publicity material was in a form understandable by local people <e> <s> this applies equally to any information we disseminate about the secretary of states proposals for hat designation <e>", "<cs> my lords while i cannot give the noble lord complete assurance on the matter i can assure him that every effort will be made to give the information where required <e>", "<cs> my lords i can give the noble lord assurance about that which i have said already <e> <s> every possible effort and means will be directed to carry information to the applicant landlord or tenant in the circumstances that happen to arise at any particular time <e>", "<cs> my lords section of the race relations act at present applies only to local authorities and requires them to carry out their various duties with a view to ensuring that unlawful discrimination is eliminated and that equal opportunity and good race relations are promoted in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the noble baroness is well known for her sympathy for and understanding of racial equality <e> <s> that also is the governments point of view <e> <s> i listened carefully to what she said <e> <s> of course i take much interest in the matter and consideration will be given to it <e>", "<cs> my lords no discourtesy whatever was meant to the noble baroness and i am sure she will appreciate that <e> <s> i understand the point she made <e> <s> she suggested that the government should think again <e> <s> however perhaps i may answer the question slightly more deeply and say that we have taken the view that the responsibilities of section should be taken on board not only by local authorities but by other bodies with the responsibility for overseeing the provision of housing <e> <s> that is why we have incorporated clauses and in the bill which apply section to the housing corporation and housing action trusts respectively <e>", "<cs> my lords far from giving up hope we have increased financial support for the tidy britain group <e> <s> it is carrying out a range of experimental projects <e> <s> the group envisages a major drive based on the results of these projects for tidy britain year <e>", "<cs> my lords the projects to which i have referred obviously cost money <e> <s> while it is too soon to reach conclusions the tidy britain group reports that it is receiving enthusiastic support from many major organisations as well as from local authorities and voluntary groups <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the point that the right reverend prelate makes but it is up to each individual local authority to decide what priority it wishes to give to keeping its area including its highways tidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point my noble friend makes <e> <s> we are not necessarily convinced that changes in the law would be effective <e> <s> there are always difficulties with enforcement and we prefer solutions which enlist the community and civic pride though we do not rule out the option of law enforcement <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree to some extent not with the remedy but with the point the noble viscount makes <e> <s> however children are considerably encouraged at school during their education hours to understand the problems of litter <e>", "<cs> my lords the keeping tidy of motorways is the responsibility of the department of transport <e> <s> highways are the responsibility of local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a rather diffuse question <e> <s> i shall certainly look at it and reply to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be entirely inappropriate for her majestys government to answer on behalf of the royal family <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to my noble friend we have considered the possibility of making people responsible for keeping the pavements etc <e> <s> clean outside their own premises <e> <s> however it would be difficult to enforce that as a householder accused of not discharging his obligation could always argue that he had done his cleaning and the litter had blown over from another frontage <e> <s> for the present we believe this to be an area where voluntary efforts will he much more effective than laws and regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i cannot answer that particular question but of course i shall correspond with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is very sensible <e> <s> however i note that when the house gets up each night there seems to me to be remarkably little litter around the place <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carter is a little pre-emptive on this matter and he has some reason to be so <e> <s> noble lords will recall that <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly wales has been mentioned because i referred to the principality <e> <s> we are not absolutely certain whether scotland is included <e> <s> i understand that we may bring this matter forward as a commons amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great attention and not inconsiderable interest to the debate that has taken place this evening <e> <s> i know that the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord ezra for providing an opportunity to examine carefully one of the central issues of the coming privatisation of the water industry <e> <s> there have been expert contributions from all sides of the house <e> <s> as a newcomer to the topic i reply with some diffidence and a consciousness of the long experience in the water industry of some noble lords who have spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall come to deal with that point in a moment <e> <s> returning to the argument with which i was dealing perhaps i may pick a hole in it by pointing out what has happened to the level of investment in the water industry over the past years <e> <s> since my right honourable friend and his predecessors have fought the industrys corner pretty well <e> <s> investment by the water authorities in england and wales has already grown by per cent <e> <s> since - <e> <s> plans for a further per cent <e> <s> increase were announced by my right honourable friend the chancellor in the autumn statement last week <e> <s> noble lords opposite may wish to know how this compares with the preceding five years <e> <s> i shall tell them <e> <s> there was a per cent <e> <s> decline in capital spending in real terms from to <e> <s> so much for putting the treasury in its place <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the land which is transferred to the new water utility companies will continue to be required for operational purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords from an environmental viewpoint the government have continually exhibited a mindful attitude to areas of outstanding natural beauty and national parks <e> <s> the privatised companies must be free to dispose of any land that they no longer require for operational purposes <e> <s> land in national parks and areas of outstanding beauty is subject i repeat to stringent planning controls which would prevent an unsuitable use of agricultural or forestry land disposed of by a new water plc <e>", "<cs> my lords whether to dispose of land surplus to requirements will be entirely a decision for the new water plcs in conjunction with my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mason mentioned the recent french dealings in water company shares <e> <s> as i am sure he realises the french companies have long experience of operating a privatised water industry <e> <s> they can extend and diversify their operations <e> <s> privatisation will lift legal restrictions and give english water authorities and companies a strong base to develop similar international interests <e> <s> we do not discriminate against international investment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the lake district and other areas which the noble lord mentioned are extremely sensitive but as i said in my original answer the same vigorous and rigorous planning restrictions will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question i cannot answer at this moment but in the interests of your lordships house i shall reply to the noble lord in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i have been to france many times and i have enjoyed both their wine and their water <e>", "<cs> my lords forgive me but i did not quite get my noble friends question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i see the constructive point that my noble friend is trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is correct on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be wrong and improper were i to give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> areas such as those mentioned by the noble lord may or may not become vacant for planning permission but at the moment it is impossible to say <e>", "<cs> my lords to answer the noble lord the prospectuses of the successor companies will contain sufficient information to enable investors to take proper account of land holdings and value in deciding whether to apply for shares <e> <s> the price for the shares will therefore properly reflect the value likely to be placed on the land <e> <s> there are important constraints on the ability of a water company to realise the value underlying operational land there are legal obligations to maintain services and there <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord lord molloy the government are never short of courage <e> <s> perhaps i may suggest that many of the points which the noble lord lord molloy is making might be better discussed at the stage of second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is currently considering the proposal to build a new teaching hospital on the site of st stephens hospital in fulham and to close the westminster westminster childrens st mary abbotts and west london hospitals <e> <s> he is examining the implications for patients and giving a thorough assessment to all aspects of the scheme including financial issues <e> <s> a decision will be announced when this consideration is complete <e> <s> i regret that i cannot give a date today <e>", "<cs> my lords i take seriously the remarks and comments of the noble earl lord halsbury <e> <s> at the same time i say unequivocally that the department of health is well aware of the need to make a decision as soon as possible <e> <s> any change has major implications for patients and staff <e> <s> we want to keep to a minimum the uncertainty for everyone involved but this is a major scheme and it is important that it should be carefully considered <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state is considering all the views given about the proposals <e> <s> your lordships will be aware that although the media concentrate on opposition to them there is also very considerable support for the scheme for example from the <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i am very pleased to take my noble friends point as mentioned in the first part of her question <e> <s> however i should also like to point out that there is always st thomass hospital just across the river thames <e>", "<cs> my lords the brief and scope of the examination that is currently being undertaken by my right honourable friend the secretary of state are very intense and very profound <e> <s> he will certainly take into account every aspect of this proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that i had already given a reply to that question <e> <s> i say again that although fulham is some way off it is the responsibility of the ambulance driver and his decision <e> <s> once again i repeat that st thomass is only a minute from your lordships house or the palace of westminster <e>", "<cs> my lords that may be the case but once again i am sure that that is well understood and perceived by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are doing a considerable disservice to st thomass hospital <e> <s> obviously it is hoped that nothing of the magnitude proposed by the noble lord will happen at the palace of westminster <e> <s> if so however there is st thomass and there is also the journey to fulham <e>", "<cs> my lords we are truly grateful to the noble lord lord carter for raising this important subject <e> <s> it is important and will always remain so <e> <s> those are not vacuous and idle words <e> <s> the title of the debate is significant because it calls attention to the level of assistance available to people with mental illness or mental handicap moved from residential care i assume that the noble lord lord carter is referring to hospitals into the community <e> <s> the debate as i had suspected has been wide-ranging and there are many important points to cover <e> <s> i shall do my best to deal with as many as is possible but perhaps at speed now and then <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that would be unwise because i cannot say with absolute assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble baronesss point <e> <s> i am not certain whether the specific category of people she mentions is included in the exemptions <e> <s> i undertake to find out and let her know in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord lord mccluskey will realise that we are very short of time <e> <s> i shall respond to his point but i am equally anxious that the noble lord lord carter should also be able to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of this evenings debate i think it would be most right and proper if before taking individual points especially the points made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick i were to express on behalf of your lordships house our great gratitude once again to those noble lords who sat on the select committee <e> <s> in particular we should like to express our gratitude to the chairman of the select committee the noble and learned lord lord brightman who obviously put an enormous amount of toil good sense and hard <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear the point made by the noble lord <e> <s> secondly i remind the noble lord lord dean that udc members are not elected but neither were the members of the highly successful new town corporations which were invented by the labour government <e> <s> udcs exist to get the job done <e> <s> their members all have local connections with the private and public sector <e> <s> where local authorities have agreed local councillors have been appointed <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that eight appointments have already been made and that three places remain to be filled <e>", "<cs> my lords to be best of my knowledge none of them has yet been appointed <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords beauty is in the eye of the beholder <e> <s> the governments advice stresses that local planning authorities should not impose their own tastes on developers simply because they believe them to be superior <e> <s> local planning authorities should not seek to control the external appearance of new developments except where there is a clear justification for example because the development is out of scale or out of character with its surroundings <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obviously grateful for

greek scholar but i take the point that my noble and learned friend has made <e>", "<cs> my lords if beauty is in the eye of the beholder then ugliness too is in the eye of the beholder <e> <s> although i understand what the noble lord lord grimond has said i can assure him that it is a comfortable and convenient building in which to work <e>", "<cs> my lords the best way forward for good design is to have close co-operation and understanding between planner and developer <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may remind the noble lord that we are dealing with aesthetic considerations <e> <s> the type of building materials to be used externally are of interest to both the planning authority and the developer it is the buildings eventual use which is important to the client <e>", "<cs> my

honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of the day that will not necessarily be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be a convenient moment at which

now adjourn during pleasure until five minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords in most areas of england and wales groundwater and storage reservoir levels were close to normal in early january <e> <s> however in the drier southern half of the country they tended to be slightly below normal for the time of year <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend who has very considerable experience in this industry is quite correct <e> <s> the months of november and december were exceptionally dry particularly in southern areas <e> <s> the total rainfall during those months over england and wales as a whole was only half the long-term average <e> <s> in the southern wessex and thames water authority areas it was less than one third of the average <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that my noble friend is quite correct in saying that there has been less than average snowfall <e> <s> however on average about half the total rainfall over england and wales is lost in evaporation <e> <s> most of this occurs during the summer resulting in relatively little run-off and recharge of aquafers during these months <e> <s> replenishment of reservoirs and aquafers takes place mostly during the winter months when evaporation losses are small <e> <s> winter rainfall is therefore of significant importance <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be a matter of speculation as to whether a drought occurs <e> <s>

chief officers will continue to have access to their authority and of course applications for appointment as a non-executive member will continue to be welcomed from all quarters <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the best way of answering the supplementary question of the noble lord lord molloy is to quote directly from my right honourable friend the secretary of state in another place on st november <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that conditions and in particular the recruitment of staff are vital to the nhs <e> <s> as already appreciated i believe we are intending to move much more towards negotiation at local level <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards places on a health authority we expect the district general managers and the directors of finance to fill two places <e> <s> it will

care <e> <s> the government believe that it is essential that they fulfil their duties in the most effective way <e> <s> the changes proposed in the white paper will ensure that the smaller and more action-orientated membership of authorities will have a crisper decision-making process leading to more effective management which is more responsive to the needs of the consumer <e> <s> the result would he a better more flexible service and even higher standards of care <e> <s> finally i point out to the noble lord that community health councils on which local authorities remain strongly represented will continue to monitor consumer interests <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that question may best be brought out in a forthcoming debate to be initiated by the noble lord lord hunter of newington on nd february in which all aspects of the national health service review will be looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords when change is on the cards there is always concern and there is always suspicion <e> <s> the whole point of the white paper is that flexibility should abound <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to mislead the house on this point <e> <s> it is not a question i can answer directly but i shall ensure that the noble lord has a proper and correct answer in writing <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and our future purpose is to return the national health service genuinely to

possibility of a third <e> <s> the negotiations are conducted between the manufacturer and the relative health <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the interests of everybody that the cost of each dose

combined vaccine last autumn we recommended that it should be given to two groups of children those aged months as i mentioned to replace the measles-only vaccine and those aged four to five years

lords question <e> <s> the ec directive on environmental assessments does not apply to projects approved by british rail but british rail has made clear that before it introduces a private bill it will be carrying out a full environmental impact assessment of its chosen route as if the directive did apply <e> <s> it has appointed independent environmental consultants to advise <e> <s> on the first part of the noble lords question once british rail has made known its preferred route there will be ample time for people to write to british rail if they do not like that route and naturally

recognise that it is absolutely impossible to build a new line without some impact on the environment <e> <s> it is therefore important that in developing the proposal the closest attention should be given to minimising and mitigating the environmental impact <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i understand that my noble and learned friend is quite correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may take that view but it has been decided to go ahead and not to progress in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite certain that i understand my noble friends point though i am sure that it was meant to be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords in no way will british rail necessarily take the cheapest route <e> <s> in deciding on the preferred corridor it will take into account commercial social environmental and economic considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend be that as it may <e> <s> the railway line from london to the channel will still have to pass through kent <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather hoped that i had just answered that question <e> <s> when british rail publishes its preferred route there will be considerable time in which to go into the whole matter <e> <s> as i said there will be considerable press comment and as my noble and learned friend said there will be a private bill which will pass through parliament in the normal manner <e>", "<cs> my lords the government will need to be convinced that it is the best route <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government are totally and completely sensitive to the beauties which kent holds <e> <s> they are aware of the environmental impact that the rail link will make on kent <e> <s> however as i just said at the same time they will take into account all considerations <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a technical question which i cannot answer at present <e> <s> however as regards compensation i can say that people whose property is not required but who are adversely affected by the use of the line

litter/or dumping <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not quite sure whether the noble lord said legally responsible or illegally responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obviously the duty of the person whose premises are affected by rats to get in touch with his or her local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly have a look at that event but i cannot promise that it will be revived <e>", "<cs>

special fostering schemes group homes drop-in centres sheltered workshops social clubs and self-help groups as well as education training and employment services <e>", "<cs> my lords as part of the discussions on the implementation of the act officials from the department met with local authority representatives last november and a further meeting has been arranged for march this year <e> <s> the timetable for implementation will depend upon the outcome of discussions with local authority and health authority representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords i regret that i do not think that i can give the undertaking that the noble lord seeks <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the closure of hospitals i can place in the library a list of the particular hospitals due for closure in the south-east thames regional health authority area <e> <s> as regards the other part of the noble lords question the department continues to emphasise that no closure of a mental hospital should proceed until a careful assessment of all existing patients needs has been made and alternative services appropriate to those needs have been provided <e> <s> as a consequence of the development of comprehensive locally based psychiatric services and only as better alternative services are provided will those mental illness hospitals close which are not needed as part of the developing pattern of district services <e> <s> the closure of hospitals is not a primary aim <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> it is of prime importance to see that the services in the community are

and our willingness to amend the bill to meet the noble lords concerns will persuade the noble lord lord graham of edmonton to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the effect would be to limit the appointment of the football membership authority to a three-year period <e> <s> we take it that the thought behind the amendment is that if the football authorities do not take the role of the football membership authority at once they should have another chance <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> no my

council for advice on conservation matters <e> <s> the ncc advises that it has expertise on bats within its own organisation but that it will continue to consider dr stebbings as a potential consultant for bat work whether as an employee of the institute of terrestrial ecology or indeed as an independent consultant <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is perhaps better informed than the department of the environment concerning the actual number of bats in existence <e> <s> however it is estimated that as many as bats were saved as a result of guidance by the ncc in

bats is indeed of predominant importance especially as regards echo location <e> <s> it is feasible that such studies could be of benefit to man <e> <s> however that is not a factor which is taken into account when determining the protection offered under the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point my noble friend makes <e> <s> however i am not aware of all the cases which have been brought against particular individuals over the past few years <e> <s> nevertheless he is right that under section of and the listing contained in schedule to the wildlife and countryside act all bats are protected from <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a difficult point upon which to make a sensible comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> in addition the nature conservancy council is involved in a partnership with the vincent wildlife trust and the flora and fauna preservation society which support a full-time bat conservation officer and assistant <e>",

the noble lord lord mishcon would let me write to him giving him some detail as to why we are not keen to carry on in the way that he suggests <e> <s> that might be appropriate at this time <e> <s> there is of course the committee stage of the bill if the noble lord wants to take this matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords at this late stage of the winter there is cause for some concern about the

current situation regarding some shortage of water in the southern half of the country <e> <s> we have so far received applications for three drought orders <e> <s> we are informed that some water undertakers are embarking upon publicity campaigns to encourage economy in water use <e> <s> a few undertakers are carrying out work such as drilling of new bore holes to augment their water resources

on the levels of service provided by the water supply companies <e> <s> that information will show whether it is necessary to augment sources <e> <s> the provisions of the water bill currently before parliament will enable the director general to protect the interests of consumers by ensuring that adequate water resources are provided <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that scotland does not present a serious problem at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly not to the best of my knowledge <e>", "<cs> i suggest that the committee stage be now adjourned and begin again at pm <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham suggested that the minister might look on this amendment in a kind way <e> <s> i hope to demonstrate that we look on it in a kind practical and sensible way <e> <s> as the committee already knows my noble friend has explained the governments general position on exemptions and why we accept that there should be mandatory provision for exemptions in the scheme <e> <s> we have undertaken to consider placing specific categories of exempted spectators on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> i firmly understand that that is the view of the police <e> <s> perhaps i may continue with the points that i wish to make <e>", "<cs> to take the point made by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon he is of <e>", "<cs> the answer is that it would not be as great as the discouragement of violence <e> <s> as i said originally the cost of taking a family into a designated football ground might be helped by some relaxation of the club rules <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may specifically answer the question put to me by the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> we see the bill as offering a prospect of reducing the amount of police time and effort devoted to policing football matches <e>", "<cs> the reservations concern the ability to move people through turnstiles without risk of congestion and disorder outside <e> <s> the police are happy to be consulted about the mechanics of the scheme so that these concerns are addressed <e>", "<cs> i understand that the only other reservation that the association has is the possibility of the scheme being abused <e>", "<cs> that stands for itself <e> <s> the abuse refers to people trying to get into grounds when they are not legally entitled to do so <e>", "<cs> i am disappointed that the noble lord takes such a pessimistic view about this matter <e> <s> if the legislation is to work properly one of its byproducts will be that eventually and hopefully in not too long a time the number of police deployed on a saturday at a designated football match will decrease <e> <s> hopefully the figure of will come down <e>", "<cs> i understand that discussions are taking place with the association of chief police officers through the home office on the whole problem <e> <s> it is hoped that those discussions will produce sensible ideas <e> <s> discussions are currently under way

the noble lord lord harris <e> <s> furthermore i shall place a copy of my letter in the library <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord lord graham will find the government in a somewhat more conciliatory mood on this amendment purely because we think it is a sensible amendment <e> <s> i should make it quite clear why we believe this is a sensible amendment <e>", "<cs> we have already made that particular commitment in case there is doubt in the noble lords mind <e>", "<cs> as i have already said they will be fitted into the framework of the scheme <e>", "<cs> i should like to make absolutely clear what was said by my noble friend on the first date as regards exemptions <e> <s> he said that the scheme should provide for school parties as guests of the club <e> <s> the government will consider an amendment to refer specifically to guests of the club to be tabled at report stage <e> <s> by that means we propose to deal with school parties <e> <s> i hope that the issue is now clear to the noble lord lord harris <e>", "<cs> we are not speaking of guests <e>", "<cs> as i believe my noble friend said on previous occasions we want the scheme to be run by football for football <e> <s> this amendment concerns schoolchildren and therefore will not be under the aegis of the secretary of state <e> <s> as the noble lord lord graham of edmonton says this matter is to be in the gift of the fma <e> <s> as regards the technical points and details he mentioned those will be for the fma to decide <e>", "<cs> i believe that it is highly unlikely that the secretary of state will disagree because here we are dealing with schoolchildren <e>", "<cs> the fma will present the scheme for the secretary of states approval <e> <s> i repeat that it is highly unlikely that the secretary of state will involve himself in this particular recommendation <e>", "<cs> this amendment would mean that the scheme must provide for representation of club members on bodies or groups established within football clubs to administer and run membership arrangements <e> <s> as with the suggested bodies and committees proposed in the previous amendment concerning members rights we are not sure whether it is the noble lords intention that football clubs should be compelled to establish the bodies or groups envisaged in this amendment but that is what the amendment would appear to attempt to achieve and i cannot commend it to the committee <e> <s> however i shall come to the hope and aspirations that the noble lord mentioned <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e> <s> i

risley <e> <s> at present the incident is being handled quite properly as an operational matter and it would not be helpful at this stage to comment upon the circumstances surrounding those

need for specific provisions in the bill <e>", "<cs> yes i believe that to be the situation <e>", "<cs> the purpose of amendment no <e> <s> proposed by the noble lord lord graham is as he says to require a condition in the instrument of appointment obliging appointed companies to publish annual and three-yearly financial plans <e> <s> the requirement to publish such plans is not appropriate to

not too well informed about the state of california <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i think i can be of some partial help to the noble lord lord addington <e> <s> his amendment would require that bodies subject to the duties in clause in considering proposals related to their functions should have regard for the desirability of preventing conifer afforestation

pointed out can damage traditional and cherished landscape <e> <s> it can contribute to soil erosion <e> <s> and most important for our present purposes it can contribute to the acidification as the noble lord lord addington pointed out of rivers and lakes potentially harming water supplies and damaging the local ecology <e>", "<cs> i am sure that what my noble friend lord renton says will be

practicable to put their lands and waters to best use for recreation <e> <s> if that is literally what is intended then it should not be accepted <e> <s> it would be quite inappropriate since the secretary of state and director have no special rights to land or water on which in the context of water legislation the duty could bite and to go wider would of course be quite absurd <e> <s> but if the proposal is that the secretary of state and director should have the duty to take such steps as are reasonably practicable for securing that the companies put their land and water to best use for recreation then maybe there is something in it <e> <s> from what the proposer the noble lord lord greenway said i think that he intends that second approach <e>", "<cs> these two amendments seek to widen in geographical terms the scope of the general promotional duty in clause <e> <s> their effect would be to extend the nras general duty for promotion of conservation and amenity of rivers to cover tidal coastal and estuarine waters <e> <s> the provision as drafted applies this duty simply in respect of inland waters <e>", "<cs> we believe that there are three reasons why the amendment tabled in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh should not be accepted <e> <s> first the duties touch every aspect of the performance of the undertakers duties <e> <s> given that this is so the burden of consultation becomes formidable in itself <e> <s> secondly this is rendered even more onerous by the quite prohibitively wide scope of the bodies which it is said should be consulted <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments seeks to extend the range of relevant bodies to which the duties in clause are to apply <e> <s> amendments nos <e> <s> and would extend the term to any subsidiary companies of an undertaker <e> <s> at this point i ask the noble lord lord graham whether he is speaking among this group of amendments to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord graham for that explanation <e> <s> amendment no <e>", "<cs> very simply as i understand it the functions will relate only to the operation lands that is how it will stand <e>", "<cs> the provision is

discharge the functions given it in the bill <e> <s> the director general requires that the core companies have the assets <e>", "<cs> to use the words of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey i

that we shall do our best to achieve the <e>", "<cs> i fear that we shall have to disappoint the noble lord as regards these two amendments <e> <s> perhaps i may briefly explain why <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can bring much succour to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i may make one overriding point namely that the legislation is designed to meet all circumstances as the noble lord has himself said <e> <s> that is why the bill must not anticipate that conditions of the type set out in clause will always be needed <e> <s> that is the point that we are trying to make <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can elaborate a little <e> <s> we on these benches frequently have to suffer the accusation that this government are too rigid <e> <s> i have tried to demonstrate the reasons why in these particular circumstances it is thought that flexibility is the best way to proceed <e> <s> let me expand a little on that point <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will agree that this is a suitable moment to break for dinner and i suggest that we return to the committee stage of the bill at pm <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord brooks of tremorfa has explained very well that the purpose of this bill is to extend registered clubs the extra hours opening time on sunday that was at the wish of your lordships granted to licensed premises in the licensing act <e>", "<cs> with the agreement

if required on the request of the appointee or at the directors discretion within not less than five years <e>", "<cs> again this is an amendment on which i hope we can put the mind of the noble lord lord graham at rest because the point which he makes is already covered in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope to be able to satisfy the concern of my noble friend on this amendment <e> <s> subsection sets out what the mmc must specify in its report and this includes definite conclusions on the questions in the reference <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be that the mmcs conclusions need not be definite <e>", "<cs> once again i hope to be able to put my noble friends mind at rest <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be that a report of the monopolies commission on a reference under clause would be sent directly to both the director and the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may be so bold as to attempt a hat-trick with my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> this is a technical amendment which is intended to clarify clause b where a <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> this amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mcintosh is concerned as he <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that most people have a very good commonsense understanding of the word trivial <e>", "<cs> the interpretation of trivial is ultimately a matter for the courts <e> <s> the decision of the secretary of state or the director general that contraventions are of a trivial nature could be a matter for an application for judicial review <e> <s> i repeat that anything to do with health is never regarded as a trivial matter <e> <s> it is regarded as a very serious matter <e>", "<cs> i am going to have to disappoint my noble friend regarding words of encouragement on the amendment for reasons which i hope briefly to outline <e> <s> we certainly agree that it is very important to inform those who have an interest in any enforcement action to be taken <e> <s> we are aware that in the majority of cases local authorities will have sewerage agency arrangements with the sewerage undertaker <e> <s> we are aware of the role of local authorities in regard to public health to give just two examples of when the local authority should and under the bill as it stands would be informed <e> <s> however we still consider the proposed amendment to be unnecessary for reasons that i shall now explain <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add very much which will help the noble lord lord mcintosh other than to repeat the key point <e> <s> as the bill already makes provision for these occasions the notice must be published in a manner which will bring the matters to which the notice relates to the attention of people likely to be affected by it <e> <s> i should have thought that in these circumstances there is plenty of information which the local authorities need to have <e>", "<cs> clause places a duty on the director general to keep himself informed about how both the appointed companies and water and sewerage undertakers abroad carry out their functions <e> <s> the director also has a duty to collect information about the carrying out of the functions of the water and sewerage undertakers and about <e>", "<cs> clause requires the director general to maintain a register of key documents and decisions relating to the appointments of water and sewerage undertakers

consents and determinations given by the director and details of enforcement orders made by the director and undertakings given by the appointed companies under clause <e> <s> subsection of the clause empowers the secretary of state to direct the director in certain circumstances not to include a particular entry if he considers it to be against the public interest or against the commercial interest of any person <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a seeks to exclude this latter consideration <e>", "<cs> with regard to the exclusion of information from the register i can tell the noble lord

beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> with a few more words i hope to be of assistance to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> the effect of my noble friends amendment would be to prevent the owners or occupiers of parts of existing buildings from requisitioning a mains supply of water <e> <s> this could adversely affect for example the owners or occupiers of flats where a house has been converted or of rooms above a shop or office adapted for residential use <e>", "<cs> if my noble friends amendment is passed it will negate the desired effect and i shall take a short time explaining why <e> <s> an undertakers stopcock will normally be located in the street <e> <s> this provision addresses the particular case where a water undertaker is required by the owner or occupier to connect premises which abut on a street with a main running through the street <e> <s> the service pipe enters the building other than through an outer wall of a building abutting on the street and the stopcock on the service pipe is to be located in the garden <e> <s> the committee will be aware that the provision has now been amended to clarify that the term premises as used here is to be taken to include a building and the land occupied with a building normally the garden <e> <s> the undertaker is to be empowered to lay as much of the service pipe as is necessary in the garden between the boundary of the street and the stopcock in the garden <e> <s> if accepted this amendment would effectively remove this power <e> <s> where the stopcock is situated in the street outside the premises

be required to provide a supply of water for non-domestic purposes <e> <s> water is supplied for non-domestic purposes on terms agreed between the person requiring the supply and the undertaker or where agreement cannot be reached on terms determined by the director <e>", "<cs> i cannot answer that question at the moment <e> <s> i hope that with the leave of the committee my noble friend will allow me to write to him on that technical point <e>", "<cs> i have already said to my noble friend that i shall write to him <e> <s> in the circumstances i ask him to allow that to happen <e>", "<cs>

noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord graham suggested that the government should consider this issue particularly carefully <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that the government have considered the issue extremely carefully <e> <s> these amendments seek to introduce a system of statutory registration of plumbers <e> <s> as the noble lord knows very well this issue has been raised

my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment proposed by the noble lord lord addington seeks very wide powers indeed <e> <s> no limit is placed upon the regulatory content of the regulations that could be made <e> <s> there is no distinction drawn between regulations applying when initial appointments are made and subsequent regulations amending the framework of charging for existing appointees <e> <s> the amendment ignores the role of conditions of appointment which we debated during consideration of part i of chapter ii of the bill regulations would in fact cut across the role of the director general in regulating charges <e>", "<cs> if it will help the committee further i shall expand on the provision of information which the noble lord lord mcintosh seeks <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i can add to what i have said that is that the need for a specific provision in the bill to provide information is not necessary because there will be a requirement under condition f of the instrument of appointment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can encapsulate this matter and say that the code of practice must be approved by the director general <e>", "<cs> obviously as much information as possible for customers is a necessary state of affairs but the point is that we feel that sufficient information is

fisheries <e> <s> however i understand my noble friend to have in mind also the offence in the same cause relating to cutting of vegetation and my remarks will cover that also <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends point but we consider that it is within the good sense of the nra to regulate in such matters <e> <s> i should like to answer the point of the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> i can tell

it will always be an offence under clause to discharge polluting matter such as soapy water from a sink or bath into a river or other controlled waters <e> <s> the by-law-making power must be restricted to lavatories because it is only in respect of lavatories that such by-laws can play a role <e>", "<cs> i can i believe offer my noble friend reassurance on the grounds that the amendment is not necessary <e>", "<cs> this amendment if passed would impose upon the nra the enormous administrative burden of reviewing every five years all the several tens of thousands of existing abstraction licences and moreover involving two other outside bodies as well as two of its own advisory committees in each such review <e>", "<cs> the first three subsections of this amendment attempt to give local authorities a particular locus in the determination of river flows and i suspect the noble lord proposing it will assume that it is for that reason alone that i oppose it <e> <s> that is not true <e> <s> although we do indeed oppose it it is because it is unnecessary <e> <s> local authorities like all other parties with an interest in water and the environment already have access to

demands for water while amendment no <e> <s> g would subject those loans to the direct scrutiny of the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> i need hardly say that i could not agree more with the spirit of these amendments which my noble friend lady blatch has moved <e> <s> it would of course be wholly unacceptable for the nra to go about seeking orders to suspend abstraction from particular sources of supply or to stop discharge to a particular outfall without being quite clear what the effects would be on the ability of the undertakers to fulfil their vital duties <e> <s> but i do not agree that these amendments are necessary to prevent this kind of situation arising <e>", "<cs> i begin with amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> the nras powers to undertake work in on or under the highway

be able to replace defective private water supplies with public ones and complete major sewerage schemes including those required to comply with ec standards for bathing water quickly and without the delays that would be involved in seeking the consent of every landowner involved and where consent was not forthcoming referring the matter to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> this amendment would place an unnecessary burden on local authorities and it could also make legal searches even more time consuming and costly <e> <s> the effect would be that notices served under schedule to inspect maintain adjust repair or alter pipes as well as those concerned with laying pipes would all require to be registered <e>", "<cs> this amendment would have the seemingly entirely innocuous effect of ensuring that an intention to promote a by-law should be advertised in the local area affected by it via local newspapers <e> <s> there is a technical objection to accepting the amendment as it stands namely that some areas do not have local newspapers <e> <s> that is why provisions aimed at local publicity generally refer only to newspapers circulating within the area affected <e>", "<cs> first i should like to take note of and give considerable observance to the points made by the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones and in particular to the point made by the noble lord lord mishcon concerning the convention of the house <e> <s> we know that the noble lord lord mishcon however deeply and strongly he feels about a matter such as this by convention does not divide the house <e> <s> however i shall endeavour to make some points against the issues that the noble lord lord mishcon and the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones have raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report now be adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord gallacher has pointed out this amendment and the principles and policies behind it were very well aired in committee by my noble friend lord hesketh who said that the nra will be a public sector body exercising monopoly powers in respect of some of its functions <e> <s> it must therefore be subject to the financial controls appropriate to a body responsible for voted expenditure <e> <s> these controls do not allow the carrying over of large surpluses or deficits from one year to the next <e> <s> we have made clear that the right way for a national body like the nra to be funded is by grant-in-aid from the exchequer <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey pointed out the substance of the amendments had a good airing in your lordships house during the committee stage <e> <s> they were given a somewhat draughty reception by my noble friend lord caithness <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships agreement this may be an appropriate stage at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we return to the report stage at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords on this amendment i make it quite clear from the outset that the regional rivers advisory committees will be important committees advising the nra on its river basin management function <e> <s> in the december policy statement and repeatedly since we made it clear that the committees will need to have members representative of all the main interests concerned in using and conserving the rivers including the environmental recreation and local government interests identified in this amendment and also industry and agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular policy document is all-embracing <e> <s> i can assure the noble baroness that the membership will be selected from both statutory and voluntary bodies as is clearly laid out in annex c the noble baroness has my assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already discussed at some length this evening the composition of the nra regional advisory committees in the context of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord crickhowell and his colleagues on the nra advisory committee are fully persuaded of the important role not only of the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission but also of the voluntary environmental bodies in relation to the nra regional committees <e> <s> this is a point on which my noble friend lord crickhowell has elaborated <e> <s> it is very helpful and useful for all sides of your lordships house to have my noble friends advice and the information and assurance on various aspects of the nra <e> <s> the nra advisory committees consultative document makes it quite clear that some members of the regional rivers advisory committees will be selected from conservation and landscape interests including statutory and voluntary bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords first on the numbering point i confess that there is an error in numbering and it should be subsection <e> <s> as regards further elaboration the proposed amendment is one of practicality and will allow the secretary of state to make an order for the transfer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am of course a little disappointed that the noble lord lord mcintosh did not find my answer in committee a little more than just promising <e> <s> i hope i can be a little more convincing this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord caithness i beg to move that the bill be now further considered on report <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me for asking but is she moving all the other amendments in the group that starts with amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for giving way <e> <s> i understand what she says but the amendments are all grouped together on the list <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we are very grateful for the clear and concise explanation of the amendments in this group to which the noble baroness lady birk has spoken <e> <s> i hope to be equally clear and concise in stating the governments reaction and attitude to them <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may agree that this is a suitable moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we return to further consideration on report at pm <e> <s> in the meantime i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether i may try to put over the governments view on this amendment <e> <s> clause is an important new provision and i should remind the house of the governments intentions <e> <s> it removes in respect of the nra two significant constraints on the present water authorities in relation to conservation works and recreation provision <e>", "<cs> my lords clauses and already impose formidable duties on the new companies in respect of the conservation and recreational use of their land <e> <s> the question is whether it is sensible to extend those obligations still further with a consultation duty which goes beyond what attaches to any other bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords we accept the logic of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> the functions of the bodies are closely related and many of the practices relevant to one body will be relevant to the others <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the previous amendment i made it clear that the government fully accepted the arguments for extending the scope of the code to the nra <e> <s> this further amendment would seek to extend it a little further to cover all relevant bodies that is taking in the internal drainage boards <e>", "<cs> my lords as we acknowledged in committee this amendment raises an important issue and draws to our attention an important consideration <e> <s> as we say in the code of practice it is important that the bodies should report regularly and publicly on their performance in these areas <e> <s> the question is whether the particular statutory arrangements proposed here are appropriate <e> <s> we do not believe that they are <e>", "<cs> my lords we may have used the same words <e> <s> however that shows that we have not changed our thinking on this <e> <s> the point is that the code at the present moment is still being re-examined and revised <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> i should indeed have sought the leave of the house and i now do so <e> <s> i shall just repeat that the code of practice is being re-examined and revised <e> <s> as i said when responding to the amendment the worries and concerns that the noble baroness has expressed are being taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am not in a position to give the precise date by which the revision of the code will be completed <e> <s> however i am in a position to say that the code is currently being re-examined and revised and many of the points that have been made this evening have been taken on board <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is indeed the feeling of your lordships that negative resolution would as the noble lord lord greenway suggests be appropriate it will receive our full support <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise that consultation is an essential element of the full discharge of the relevant bodies environmental duties <e> <s> the draft code already makes this clear and states that regular liaison and consultation should be established <e> <s> the code already meets the concern of the first part of the amendment <e> <s> as for the circumstances in which the consultation should take place this is precisely what the main body of the code establishes <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> e deals with the question of reporting on the fulfilment of the clause duties <e> <s> in addition to companies being required to report in their annual report on the performance of their clause duties they would also have to report to the secretary of state on how their activities in the previous year would have complied with the duties before they receive any appointment as an undertaker <e>", "<cs> my lords clause is drafted to ensure that all local authorities are notified as authorities about variations or appointments which affect their areas <e> <s> we accept that there is a need to ensure that all local authorities are notified even though they may not be the agents for their particular areas <e> <s> it is not the purpose of the clause that authorities should be notified by virtue of any responsibility which they may have as sewerage agents <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords the code of conservation access and recreation will give practical guidance on how the undertakers should carry out their statutory environmental duties in clauses and <e> <s> such guidance cannot be couched in the precise legalistic terms which would be required if the substance of the code were to give rise to legal obligations enforceable by the secretary of state <e> <s> for those noble lords who wish to check this for themselves there is a draft copy of the code in the library of the house <e> <s> it is some -odd pages long and consists more of suggestions than prescriptions <e> <s> that does not of course mean that it is not important guidance and the house has decided with the governments full agreement that it should be subject to negative resolution of both houses <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may just repeat that as a consequence of clause the secretary of state must take into account breaches or likely breaches of the code in the exercise of these enforcement powers <e> <s> my point about the draft code is that the provisions should not be too rigid too limiting and imprisoning rather they should be flexible and sensitive to any new requirements that may be needed <e> <s> it is a draft for practical guidance <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh said we debated a similar amendment in committee when indeed i undertook to reconsider the ambit of the subsection <e> <s> the noble lord lord mcintosh agreed to withdraw his amendment to allow the government to reconsider the provisions of the subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has explained the intention behind this amendment is to enable an undertaker to refuse to provide an increased supply of water for non-domestic purposes in cases where the clause currently provides for it to refuse a new supply <e> <s> as my noble friend said we discussed this issue at length in committee <e> <s> i have since written to my noble friend lord cranbrook on the subject <e> <s> while i must admire my noble friends persistence in pursuing this matter i am afraid there is little further of substance i can add to what has been said previously <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lady blatch has said we discussed this issue in committee and i have since written to her in an effort to put her mind at rest <e> <s> however i apologise because it appears that i have failed to do so <e> <s> i admire her persistence in returning to the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i do not have that number in my head at the moment but if it is helpful to her i undertake to write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships may feel that this is an appropriate moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we return to the report stage of this bill at five minutes past eight <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now adjourn during pleasure until pm <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may expand upon the background relating to this amendment <e> <s> clause provides that in certain cases where it is not practicable at reasonable cost for a water undertaker to provide or maintain a sufficient supply of wholesome water for domestic purposes to particular premises through its pipes it may be obliged to provide a supply of water by alternative means <e> <s> this would normally mean providing a supply of water by means of a tanker or standpipe <e> <s> a local authority is required to notify the undertaker of premises in its area where the insufficiency or unwholesomeness of the existing water supply is such as to be a danger to health <e> <s> the local authority would be liable to meet the undertakers charges for providing an alternative supply but would be able to recover them from the owner or occupier provided with the supply of water <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may continue with my response and return later to the point made by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords there is provision in subsection la <e> <s> it lists the alternatives as provision or maintenance <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i must say that i do not think the noble lord lord mcintosh is quite correct when he talks about obscurity here <e> <s> however in the circumstances i undertake to write to him on the matter between now and third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords we feel that the amendment tabled in the name of the noble earl lord shannon more clearly defines the general duties under this clause and adds to the provisions concerning trade effluents elsewhere in the bill in particular in schedules and <e> <s> in the light of my noble friends undertaking therefore i am pleased to commend the amendment to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can tell the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that in general we expect industry to bear its own costs <e> <s> i cannot comment on grants by maff but i undertake to write to the noble lord lord graham <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to say that following the undertaking given by my noble friend lord hesketh during the committee stage of this bill the government accept these amendments which extend the prohibition on charging for water for fire-fighting to include that taken for fire-fighting training and for other emergency purposes provided by a fire authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord balfour was good enough to let me have in writing both the points that he has raised in the past two or three minutes <e> <s> we too do not wish there to be any doubt about this provision <e> <s> my noble friend asked why the amendment is necessary when there is in schedule a comparable provision applying to the secretary of state <e> <s> the point is that clause applies the duty to have regard to scottish river quality objectives to the nra which is not covered by the schedule scottish provisions <e> <s> my noble friend also asked why we are repealing the provision in the border rivers prevention of pollution act for joint boards of pollution control officials <e> <s> the fact is that no such board has ever been established so there is no evidence of a need for the provision <e> <s> the english and scottish authorities fully consult each other on matters of common interest despite the absence of any formal consultation mechanism <e> <s> i hope that both those explanations satisfy my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult area to which many noble lords have drawn our attention <e> <s> however my first observation must be to draw noble lords attention to the terms of the exclusion in particular the reference to committing <e> <s> it does not cover cases where a person may have caused such a discharge which remains an offence <e> <s> secondly it should be recognised that the number of persons who might in the absence of this exclusion be liable under clause is potentially wide and includes a variety of persons with rights over land who nonetheless could not reasonably be expected to take positive action to prevent the minewater discharges in question <e> <s> it is broadly for those reasons that these exclusions have been on the face of legislation for some considerable time and why we believe it would be inappropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend lord radnor explained very fully to your lordships in committee this can be a matter of concern in particular to those involved in agriculture in certain of the chalkland areas of southern england <e> <s> my noble friend has again outlined his worries and concerns this afternoon <e> <s> while we cannot accept the amendment i hope that what i am able to say can offer noble lords some reassurance <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness has pointed out this amendment concerns the limitation placed upon the time at which the nra may seek to gain admission to premises for the purpose of the pollution control responsibilities <e> <s> clause says that it must be a reasonable time and the amendment seeks to make clear that this can be interpreted as reasonable in terms of the nra function and the purpose for which it is seeking entry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the house may feel that this is a convenient moment at which to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we return to the report stage of the bill at pm <e> <s> i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the local authorities will not have any powers in respect of enforcement <e> <s> i hope that that answers the question put to me by my noble friend lady blatch <e>", "<cs> my lords with the agreement of the house and in particular my noble friend perhaps we may look at that point again and come back to it later <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the simple answer to the noble lords question is that if the person produces a medical certificate in the event of illness that is perfectly all right <e>", "<cs> my lords passport applications are processed according to the applicants travel requirements with priority being given to urgent cases <e> <s> as a result delay times in a given period vary considerably and averages are not recorded <e> <s> the maximum processing time at present for straightforward non-urgent postal application at the london passport office is working days and at glasgow working days <e> <s> most applications are processed well within these periods <e>", "<cs> my lords the government wish to apologise for any inconvenience caused to those who wish to travel abroad but who have been delayed by not receiving a passport <e> <s> it is not easy to answer precisely my noble friends question but an offer has been put to the unions and we hope that a settlement will be achieved shortly <e> <s> however i am bound to say that even if the present industrial action is immediately called off there is little prospect of a return to a normal passport issuing service until the end of the summer peak <e>", "<cs> my lords the passport department managers have proposed to the unions an increase of permanent staff compared with the union claim for <e> <s> that is on condition that the unions co-operate with a number of measures aimed at improving the future handling of the work <e> <s> the cpsa staff at the liverpool passport office have voted to accept the offer <e> <s> however demand so far this year has risen by per cent <e> <s> on last years record levels <e> <s> the manual system of passport production is outdated <e> <s> teething troubles with computer systems at glasgow and liverpool mean that it is not yet working to full capacity <e> <s> as all noble lords know we are at the peak period for passport applications and we hope that normal service will be resumed as quickly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords naturally i was unaware of the circumstances of my noble and learned friends family <e> <s> however as he will appreciate times have moved on since then <e>", "<cs> my lords i advise the noble lord to send his passport for renewal as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords a passport must be renewed after a -year period for a simple reason <e> <s> i dare venture to say that during the passage of time even the face of my noble friend has changed and will continue to do so <e> <s> that must be reflected in the form of a new photograph at regular intervals in other words every years <e>", "<cs> my lords sadly my current passport photograph in no way compares favourably with the photograph taken years ago <e> <s> for that reason they must be renewed every years <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a novel idea of which i had not previously heard <e> <s> i cannot answer my noble friend at present because the details are probably too complicated <e> <s> however i shall consider the question and at a later date i may be able to answer him <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible to retain the traditional passport <e> <s> it will end only when computerisation is reached in all six offices throughout the united kingdom <e> <s> however once the new passport is totally established that is the limp passport to which my noble friend unfairly referred it will remain a united kingdom passport <e> <s> however the cover will readily identify my noble friend as a citizen of a european community country <e> <s> we shall benefit from moves towards easing frontier formalities in the community <e> <s> most important when computerised production is fully established there should be a more efficient issuing system <e>", "<cs> my lords i have seen those queues myself <e> <s> delay in postal applications naturally increases the number of personal callers who may be inquiring about delayed applications lodging applications or indeed collecting passports <e> <s> the london office deals with about personal callers per day <e> <s> it may also interest your lordships to know that fire regulations limit the numbers in the hall to <e> <s> obviously any excess must wait outside for safety reasons <e> <s> queues mainly form before the office opens at nine oclock <e>", "<cs> my lords it is possible to go to a post office and there to obtain a british visitors passport <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of amendments nos <e> <s> and would be to extend the access duty under clause to include maintaining facilities for visiting or inspecting buildings sites and objects of archeological architectural or historic interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that noble lords will agree that the amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e> <s> to continue on report we listened carefully to the noble baronesss arguments about the importance of public access to our man-made heritage <e> <s> we concluded that it would be both reasonable and sensible to extend the duty to have regard to the desirability of preserving public access in this manner <e> <s> as the noble baroness reminded the house there is considerable public interest in our man-made heritage and it is right that we should facilitate access to historic buildings and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to elaborate on the point made by the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> in response to amendments proposed by the noble lord on report we made clear that it was our intention that dams pumping engines aquaducts and other fixed structures should indeed be covered by the duty to have regard to the desirability of protecting and conserving buildings sites and objects of archaeological architectural or historic interest <e> <s> this amendment serves to make clear on the face of the bill that such structures are covered and i commend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is quite correct and i did refer to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> however on reflection i feel that that is not correct and i apologise for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to agree with the noble lord lord mcintosh that amendment no <e> <s> should not be moved in these circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i have moved amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house in response to the noble lord lord mcintosh it is up to the director general to make the order and to provide the explanatory material <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will find this an appropriate moment to break for dinner <e> <s> i suggest that we return to third reading at pm <e>", "<cs> my lords we cannot imagine a person being prosecuted convicted and fined for disturbing mud while saving life <e> <s> if the amendment is needed here it is needed throughout the statute book but it is not needed <e> <s> i am sure that we can instead rely on the good sense and humanity of the nra and the courts <e> <s> it is for those reasons that i ask the noble lord lord addington to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments would seem to address two separate issues the first concerns the power of the nra to charge for the use <e>", "<cs> my lords crime levels are falling in non-metropolitan police force areas but outbreaks of particular types of crime occur in various places from time to time <e> <s> to counter this we have increased police manpower for non-metropolitan forces <e> <s> we are introducing a new training programme for their officers and we are encouraging the development of farm watch and other crime prevention schemes <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately and sadly that is the case in some circumstances <e> <s> the police are obviously aware of the position and do everything in their power to see that the goods are returned to their rightful owners <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is right <e> <s> insurance companies reflect their clients awareness in their premiums <e> <s> it is the job and responsibility of good sensible insurance companies to ensure that clients are always advised how best to protect their property <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the recent report on rural violence we have strengthened the law relating to the sales of alcohol to under-age drinkers and have increased the penalties available to the courts <e> <s> advice has been issued to the police and courts about the powers available to deal with outbreaks of disorder <e> <s> we have encouraged the drinks industry to increase the production and promotion of low and no alcohol drinks <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that your lordships will all agree with what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the point that the noble lord makes <e> <s> with regard to the theft of animals and stock in their farm watch scheme the police encourage people to have markings on their property or animals <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the police gave extremely good advice <e> <s> farm watch schemes now operate in counties <e>", "<cs> my lords the sensible advice is to keep a good watch for that type of activity <e> <s> my noble friend will no doubt be aware from when he visits car boot sales that the items in the backs of cars tend to be of low value <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot answer that question without notice <e> <s> i can tell the noble baroness about the general decrease in crime during the past months <e> <s> for example until the end of april this year recorded crime fell by nearly per cent <e> <s> in non-metropolitan police rural areas and by per cent <e> <s> in north yorkshire <e>", "<cs> my lords such action is at the discretion of and is the responsibility of the chief officer of the county but helicopters are extremely expensive to run <e>", "<cs> my lords what teachers can do to help is slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i shall send to the noble baroness the imformation she seeks <e> <s> as regards the first part of the question i believe that the sensible course would be to spell out the answer in writing <e>", "<cs> my lords unfortunately that is quite accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his comments <e> <s> i should like to join with the noble lord lord lyell in congratulating him not only on his stamina but also on his versatility having just dealt with the northern ireland orders <e>", "<cs> my

questions that the noble baroness put to me <e> <s> first the misuse of buprenorphine is not quantifiable because the drug is not yet controlled but our contacts with the medical <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the initiative of the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby in introducing this bill this evening <e> <s> this is a measure which has all-party support <e> <s> the government certainly

public concern a point mentioned by many noble lords this evening <e> <s> your lordships will need no reminding of lord houghtons expertise in this field and he introduced the bill this evening in a

pm <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> the effect of these amendments would be to make the introduction of the ban on twin-tracking conditional upon a draft order having

face of the bill <e> <s> these amendments seek to delay the introduction of clause and and bring them back for consideration by both houses at a later date <e> <s> now is the occasion for the chamber

noble friend that following the uks decision to withdraw from the nfr project the company has been advised of the termination of its appointment as the uk nominee in the international joint venture <e> <s> it will now be for supermarine consortium limited and the international nfr project office in hamburg to decide whether scl should take any further part in the nfr programme <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer just a few of the noble lords questions <e> <s> we made it clear at the outset of project definition that continued participation beyond the first base line review depended upon agreement of a realistic timetable properly aligned with timetables for the ships major weapon system <e> <s> following the base line review we considered the programme very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that all that the noble lord says is incorrect <e> <s> this countrys defence policy has never been regarded as a shambles <e> <s> i cannot say more than i have already said in answer to my noble friends supplementary question about our reasons for withdrawing from the project <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is not right in one respect <e> <s> he is correct when he says that the total number has always been around <e> <s> there are currently frigates and destroyers of which are immediately or shortly will be operational <e> <s> the five remaining are up for refit or repair or are undergoing sea trials <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not a question of harping on what is on paper <e> <s> i am telling your lordships the current state of play as regards operational ships available at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said originally the way forward is not totally clear <e> <s> the point referred to by the noble lord lord molloy as regards a collaborative effort by all nato countries is very much a possibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear clearly what my noble friend is saying but it is up to the supermarine consortium to decide for itself the way ahead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that that is very much a high priority for the royal navy and that an effective carrier force will always exist and will meet its nato requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i did not quite catch the noble viscounts question <e> <s> i can once again reassure him that the figure is of which are currently operational <e>", "<cs> my lords that is probably another question but i shall write to the noble viscount and tell him whether the figure of includes corvettes <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may immediately say that all members of your lordships house and the whole of this country are always aware of the immense and enduring debt of gratitude that we owe to those who laid down their lives during the two world wars and indeed afterwards <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness the government consider that that debt of gratitude is very adequately reflected in the preferential treatment that is given to war widows under the dss scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords this question has been examined on many previous occasions <e> <s> i understand what my noble friend is saying but the government have an excellent record of provision for the more elderly war widows <e> <s> first the basic dss war widows pension is around per cent <e> <s> higher than that for widows on the basic state pension <e> <s> secondly it is tax-free <e> <s> thirdly there are special age allowances <e> <s> fourthly those allowances are now also tax-free <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord is talking about the occupational pension scheme the cost is thought to be in the region of million <e> <s> one would also have to associate it with the war disabled which would bring it up to a further million making million in all <e> <s> furthermore if that were done such retrospection would also have to apply to other public sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not certain whether such a table of the specific kind of people the noble lady mentions exists <e> <s> if i find it does exist i will gladly impart that knowledge to her <e>", "<cs> my lords i can understand the point made by the noble lord lord callaghan but at the same time i ask the noble lord to accept that this case has been examined in very great depth by the govenment on many previous occasions and will continue to be examined by the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord molloy that representations are made quite regularly by the royal british legion and that consultation does take place <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said before i ask the noble lord to appreciate and understand that there are many priorities <e> <s> this particular priority has been looked at but in the light of circumstances other priorities have taken precedence <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the position of the noble lord lord callaghan and the question that he asks <e> <s> i appreciate the feelings of your lordships house <e> <s> in the circumstances <e> <s> i shall draw to the attention of my right honourable friend the secretary of state the points that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords that really is another question <e>", "<cs> my lords before i begin my winding up your lordships would wish to know that we have heard since the beginning of this debate of the death of president moawab of the lebanon who was tragically killed while leaving an independence day reception this afternoon <e> <s> we send our sympathy to his family and to the lebanese people <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have always recognised and continue to recognise the special position of those whose husbands died in defence of freedom <e> <s> perhaps i may repeat very clearly that that is why the pensions paid to war widows under the dss scheme and the extra allowances are much more generous than the state pension for other widows <e> <s> they are between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> higher according to age and i repeat all payments are tax free <e> <s> furthermore about per cent <e> <s> of war widows of retirement age also receive a state retirement pension as a result of contributions made during their own employment <e> <s> i believe that that is very generous and substantiates the preferential treatment given in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords any form of free vote would have to be arranged through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may point out to my noble friend that the war pensions scheme is administered by the department of social security <e> <s> it is not confined to members of the armed forces and their dependants <e> <s> it provides pensions and other special payments to anyone suffering disabilities or to the dependants of anyone who has died as a result of war injuries or in the case of the armed forces from any cause attributable to service in the forces whether or not in time of war <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not necessarily accept that argument <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the point which has been made by the noble and gallant lord lord carver <e> <s> i am aware of the public feeling on this special case <e> <s> however perhaps i may give a further example <e> <s> a war widow who receives age allowance and the full rate of retirement pension could receive up to a week which in april of next year will rise to whereas the normal state widows pension is rising to in april next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not seek to escape that comparision <e> <s> the governments record as regards improvements on the dss side is second to none <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat that i am aware of the feelings in your lordships house <e> <s> in answer to a question from the noble lord lord callaghan on the last occasion on which this issue was raised i assured him that i would report the feelings of the house to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> i can always say that my right honourable friend the secretary of state takes very due notice of what your lordships say <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend is referring to the occupational pension scheme administered under the ministry of defence the argument in that case is that it would cost million to accommodate the war widows <e> <s> one could not possibly leave out the war disabled and that would cost a further million making million in all <e> <s> your lordships are very well aware of the knock-on effect that that would probably have in other public service sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord molloy fully appreciates as i pointed out on the last occasion that we are always in touch with the royal british legion and other similar bodies to review pensions on an annual basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i particularly wish to point out to my noble friend that her majestys government on this particular occasion are not insensitive to the special case of war widows <e> <s> my noble friend knows very well the problems in trying to accommodate the pre- pensions as regards the occupational pension scheme and the dangerous implications that are involved <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord callaghan is quite right <e> <s> parliament has from time to time taken the bit between its teeth <e> <s> his party has done something to that effect <e> <s> it introduced the per cent <e> <s> tax allowance and the conservative party made it per cent <e> <s> at all times particularly on the dss side we are steadily trying to improve the lot of war widows <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is trying to suggest that the case for war widows under the ministry of defence occupational scheme could be ring-fenced and therefore that it would cost only million <e> <s> it is unlikely that it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that many people feel that war widows should be a special case <e> <s> i hope that the noble and gallant lord lord carver recognised that when he was a service chief <e> <s> but in spite of the argument for a special case i have tried to do my best to point out where the problems are and what they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i can answer the noble lord on that point very simply <e> <s> valid comparisons are difficult to make <e> <s> it is not simply a matter of converting pension rates <e> <s> availability of schemes differs <e> <s> conditions of entitlement of allowances and use of means testing are relevant factors <e> <s> social and health service provisions and costs of living must also be considered <e> <s> it is therefore difficult to make a comparison on a like-for-like basis <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend always adds a nice attractive touch but i think that even she understands the problems of all governments on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords it is considered that at the turn of the century there will still be approximately war widows remaining <e> <s> furthermore i can tell the noble lord that compared with million extra was spent on war widows in <e>", "<cs> my lords first i can assure the noble lord lord molloy as i have done on several previous occasions that the interest of the royal british legion concerning war widows is always kept very closely in mind and will continue to be kept closely in mind <e> <s> as regards the unfairness of which the noble lord spoke for the third time in three weeks perhaps i may remind your lordships that the government are not insensitive to the case of war widows <e> <s> but at the same time i must make it clear that that is why the pensions paid to war widows under the dss scheme and the extra allowances are much more generous than the state pension for other widows <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have tried to point out in the past i understand the argument put forward by the noble and gallant lord lord carver with regard to this problem <e> <s> but i hope that as i have endeavoured to do in the past i have pointed out the difficulties on the occupational scheme side of trying to make equal pre war widows and post war widows <e> <s> i have endeavoured to point out first the considerable cost of million <e> <s> secondly it would be impossible to leave out the war disabled costing a further million <e> <s> obviously there would also be the knock-on effect of taking into account all the other public services <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friend i can say that there is a statutory disregard of per week set against war widows where claims for income-related benefits are made <e> <s> that disregard is to be increased to from april next year <e> <s> furthermore war widows are also able to receive state retirement pension in addition to their war widows pension if they have worked and paid contributions <e> <s> it is estimated that about per cent <e> <s> of those who are of retirement age receive extra pension <e> <s> finally i can also say in rejoinder to my noble friend that my right honourable friend the minister for social security has said in committee in another place that he would be content to consider cases of hardship to see what further assistance might be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i have made it clear on two previous occasions that i have informed my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> on both previous occasions i have been able to inform your lordships that my right honourable friend pays great attention to the feelings of noble lords and what they say in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is another question for another day <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation as regards war widows is always kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i do not think that the noble lord heard my previous answer correctly <e> <s> it was perhaps my fault for which i apologise <e> <s> the total combination of war widows pensions and the war disability situation would amount to some million <e> <s> the further point that i want to stress is that the knock-on effect would cost billions of pounds in the public services <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i have anything further to add to what i have already said on this particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords the whole point of any occupational pension scheme is that it is forward-looking and futuristic <e> <s> the noble lord knows very well that occupational pension schemes were not made to be retrospective <e>", "<cs> my lords i have explained on previous occasions the problem about ring-fencing <e> <s> this would be a very difficult situation in which to ring-fence <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords for their questions <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asked about full contractorisation <e> <s> a further consultative document is likely to be issued in due course outlining our legislative proposals for the proposed method of contractor operation and the implications for the awes existing workforce <e> <s> it is likely that the workforce will be transferred into contractors employment under the terms of the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations <e> <s> the workforce will be fully consulted at the appropriate time on the implications of the transfer for their conditions of service and in particular for their superannuation rights <e>", "<cs> my lords having to respond to market forces does not necessarily mean that the operation will cost more <e> <s> with the natural efficiency of market forces it is to be hoped that it will not cost any more <e>", "<cs> my lords it goes without saying that safety and security will be of paramount importance when the contractor is chosen <e> <s> it will be made clear that they are of paramount importance <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord is saying about gchq but i do not believe that the situation is related to what is proposed <e> <s> on the question of whether there is a need for the trident programme the noble lord is aware of the joint nato communiqu of june of this year in which it was agreed that there is no alternative to the alliance deterrence strategy based on an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces <e> <s> the honourable gentleman the shadow defence spokesman in another place in october of this year said that the next labour government would accept the responsibilities both financial and strategic of inheriting the trident programme <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord had better ask his honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords they will undergo the normal vetting which is standard for civil servants <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the leader of the opposition asked about contractorisation and said that he had never heard of the phrase in that context <e> <s> i must make it clear that we must ensure that scarce manpower resources are managed effectively and that strong production management expertise exists in view of the increased production requirements from <e> <s> it is the governments view that that can best be achieved by a full government-owned contractor-operated management <e> <s> that requires legislation <e> <s> in the meantime as a first step we are introducing a management contractor who will concentrate initially on manufacturing and supporting activity at awe sites <e> <s> the noble lord also asked whether the operation would be open to foreign firms <e> <s> the answer is no <e> <s> we can ensure that through the application of article of the ec treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both the noble lord lord irving of dartford and the noble lord lord mayhew for their partial welcome of what the government feel is a considerably improved scheme to negate the difference between pre- and post- war widows <e> <s> i shall deal with both the points made by the noble lords in common because i believe they are common to each other <e> <s> our intention is to increase the additional pension annually in line with inflation <e> <s> i would point out to the noble lord lord irving of dartford that when these proposals are introduced no pre- war widow should receive less than a week minimum and most will receive considerably more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his generous comments in your lordships house <e> <s> i fully recognise that at all times there was very great pressure from your lordships to improve the situation <e> <s> i hope that the government have done their very best in the particular circumstances <e> <s> at all times i did my best to confirm to your lordships that i would make the strength of your feelings known to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> he has taken very due note of the feelings of your lordships and the strength of your convictions in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords again i say to the noble lord lord molloy that what has happened is in the past and that we must look forward to the future particularly the future for the pre- war widows <e> <s> regarding implementation i repeat that it is a generous scheme and it is not possible to bring the scheme into operation until th april next year in view of the need to ensure that all the proper procedures are in hand for doing so <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble baroness lady jeger i do not believe that her argument is a fitting one because as i have said we should be looking to the state of play in the future rather than dwelling on the past <e> <s> on the matter of timing i say again that proper arrangements have to be made <e> <s> it is important to ensure that we are able to introduce the scheme as quickly as sensibly and as reasonably as possible <e> <s> that is what we are currently doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the pre- war widows pension scheme currently administered by the dss is tax free <e> <s> the post- scheme administered by the ministry of defence is taxable <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already answered that question <e> <s> i made it quite clear to your lordships why that is not being done and the need for time to get the scheme right <e> <s> i hope that i have your lordships agreement as to the generosity of the scheme which provides an extra a week which is non taxable <e> <s> that is due to be paid from th april next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend lady blatch for her comments regarding parity between pre- and post- widows <e> <s> i am also delighted to hear of her forthcoming appointment <e> <s> i believe that your lordships would wish me to express our sorrow at the illness of the noble baroness lady vickers <e> <s> we wish her a speedy recovery and i am delighted to know that she also gives her backing to the removal of the disparity between the two pensions <e> <s> i think that my noble friend lady blatch will agree that the government have gone a very substantial way towards removing that disparity <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i must point out to the noble lord lord molloy that for the last or years all governments of whatever colour have had problems with these circumstances <e> <s> they have fully understood the case for special treatment of pre- war widows <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that the present government have decided to endeavour to do something about it and to decrease the disparity between the two groups <e> <s> but that will not take place until april of next year <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may be allowed to say initially that i welcome the kindly comments of the noble lord lord callaghan on the warm experiences he has had at the school in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inform my noble friend that the soviet union is currently engaged in major combatant and submarine construction programmes in all major categories of naval vessels <e> <s> the bulk of those programmes has been established in production well in excess of five years <e> <s> the trend is downward with some of the more mature among them but among the more recent classes the position is unchanged or the trend is upward <e> <s> those on a rising trend we judge in terms of annual completions are in surface ships a new class of frigate and the sovremennyy guided missile destroyer and in the submarine area the oscar anti-ship cruise missile platform and the akula nuclear powered attack submarine <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make quite clear to the noble lord that it is because of our defence in conjunction with our allies over the past years that we are where we are at this very moment in time <e> <s> there is no greater moment of uncertainty and concern in the transcaucasus than at the moment <e> <s> we must always consider their position of capability rather than intention <e> <s> as your lordships will know their capability is still immeasurably greater than that of our nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows the problem is that naval forces are not included in the current conventional force reduction negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope and trust that all noble lords will agree with my noble friends comments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can make it perfectly clear to the noble lord <e> <s> naval forces are included in the current round of csbm talks the confidence and security building measures mandate which are going on at this very moment <e> <s> the wests proposals seek to encourage openness and predictability in military activities but the soviet proposals for constraints on size and duration of exercises are not acceptable to the west <e> <s> we have to exercise our deterrent posture <e>", "<cs> my lords as an aside to my noble friends point no doubt your lordships are aware that nato and her allies have surface ships and the warsaw pact <e> <s> our superiority is of course for supply and protection of the north atlantic routes <e>", "<cs> my lords in numerical terms it is not easy to answer the noble viscount <e> <s> however the only sectors that are showing any signs of long-term reductions are missile control boats minor combatants in other words minor warfare and patrol craft and auxiliaries <e> <s> the former two categories are highly dependent on export orders <e>", "<cs> my lords if the british merchant fleet continued to decline our defence capability could be affected <e> <s> but there is certainly no serious cause for concern that the needs of our armed forces could not be met <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord lord molloy that my right honourable friend the secretary of state did have useful and constructive discussions on many issues with his german counterpart when he was here last week <e> <s> these naturally included the european fighter aircraft <e> <s> both gentleman agreed that the efa is the best solution to meet the requirements of their airforces in the second half of the s and beyond <e> <s> there was also a useful exchange of views on the efa radar upon which contrary to speculation no decisions were made <e>", "<cs> my lords i must correct the noble lord lord dean on that point <e> <s> it is not a monopoly situation indeed the decision has not yet been decided <e> <s> the competition implications will be examined by the director general of fair trading and considered by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry <e> <s> the important point i wish to make is that no decision has as yet been made <e> <s> moreover if the matter is referred to the monopolies and mergers commission the decision will be made at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords i have just given an answer to the second part of the noble lords question <e> <s> i repeat again as regards the workforce it is a commercial judgment as to where the supply contractor deploys his workforce in the event of the prize being given <e> <s> that is all that i can say on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords in the cirumstances it seems a sensible decision <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked a long question which is based on speculation <e> <s> i am not at the dispatch box to answer speculative questions on behalf of her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords again that question is based on speculation <e> <s> if the outcome is successful it will be for the commercial judgment of the supply contractor who wins the prize as i have said to decide obviously in conjunction with its trade unions where its workforce will go <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a reasonable point <e> <s> of course at the end of the day it is for the commercial decision of the supply contractors and indeed of the government as to where they obtain their procurement <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall at all times continue to provide the resources necessary to maintain our security and to maintain our responsibilities within the alliance <e> <s> at the same time we shall continue to pursue arms control agreements which enable our security to be maintained at less cost <e> <s> furthermore we shall not take any steps which could prejudice the prospects for a cfe accord <e> <s> at a time of heightened uncertainty in europe any budgetary decisions which had the effect of narrowing our options for the future would be very unwise <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend speaks wise words <e> <s> it is with those recollections firmly in mind that we shall not reduce our defence budget <e> <s> the right answers should only emerge after clear and rational thought not as a series of knee-jerk reactions from those who do not carry the responsibility for the defence of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords i regard that as a somewhat facile remark in these circumstances <e> <s> i should make it quite clear that we support the proposals of president bush for further defence reductions in the united states and in soviet stationed forces in europe as part of the agreement being negotiated in vienna at this time <e> <s> the proposals were discussed with us in advance and we indicated our support <e> <s> i should remind noble lords that the united states spends a higher proportion of its national income on defence than any other major european country <e> <s> naturally it wants to make some reductions <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is most certainly not the case <e> <s> i hope that i have made the reasons why the government are not reducing the defence budget extremely clear in the past few minutes <e> <s> furthermore at the last meeting of the defence planning committee in november all nato defence ministers committed themselves not to make unilateral reductions in their force levels that would undermine the prospects of a cfe accord <e> <s> that is the position we shall maintain <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes the case for exactly what i have just said <e> <s> as he pointed out because things are moving with such speed and with such uncertainty in the rest of the world particularly in the ussr we shall continue to maintain our guard and keep it up until and if things improve <e> <s> certainly under previous labour governments defence reviews meant defence cuts whatever the consequences for national security <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is of course right on that point <e> <s> the production of submarines is still increasing at a considerable rate <e> <s> i also agree with my noble friend that we must keep up our guard until and if things improve considerably in that part of the world <e>", "<cs> my lords we should all like to share in the benefits which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> however for the time being they will not come from a lowering of our defences in this country <e> <s> i want to make that quite clear to the noble lord <e> <s> regarding his point about flexible response a flexible response is the best means of deterring aggression in a nuclear age <e> <s> at all times it ensures that any aggressor would face the risk of unacceptable consequences <e> <s> that is the best guarantee of effective security <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall respond to that particular point when we think it appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence in another place about the case of mr colin wallace <e> <s> the statement is as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their comments and questions on the statement <e> <s> ministers were made aware in september last that inaccurate statements may have been made <e> <s> since then an extensive review of papers has been conducted in preparation for a statement to the house <e> <s> the matter was decided by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence concerning mr wallace <e> <s> i think noble lords will agree that the government have acted promptly and with great candour and honesty <e> <s> they have come forward as soon as possible in a positive manner <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the noble lord lord jenkins if i did not answer one of his questions <e> <s> official researches have been very extensive and it is believed that the main facts of mr wallaces case as disclosed by the available papers have now been established and that the record has been set straight <e> <s> the government have been extremely open in volunteering this information to the house <e> <s> again no one could argue that ministers have sought to cover up anything at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend on the particular points that he made <e> <s> i can say that disinformation in the early s seems to have been aimed at paramilitaries and consisted mainly of attempts to show terrorists in their true light initiatives by mr wallace and others to counter terrorism at the peak of pira attacks when there was a lack of experience in dealing with them <e> <s> no evidence i repeat no evidence has been found that such campaigns were aimed at politicians or at government <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord on the particular point that he raises i can tell him that mr calcutts conclusions and recommendations and the governments decision will be made known to parliament by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord lord jenkins is trying to imply that there should be a public inquiry about the whole situation <e> <s> as i said before it is most regrettable that some inaccurate information should have been given to parliament and to mr wallace and this may call for departmental action <e> <s> however it is the governments view that no purpose would be served by holding a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the second part of my noble friends question has not much to do with the matter under discussion if i may say so <e> <s> as regards his investigations and the inquiry and the length of it it is hoped that it will be conducted as soon as is possible once all the evidence has been taken into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully realise that this is a sensitive problem and that is why they have acted in a proper way <e> <s> that is why they have brought forward the present solution <e> <s> they have reviewed the problems <e> <s> they have decided what to do in the circumstances <e> <s> i can only repeat that they have acted in a responsible and proper way as they should have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the last point made by my noble friend regarding the privacy of such a case and its conduct <e> <s> i can also tell my noble friend that ministers necessarily have to rely on the advice given to them by their officials in a case of this kind <e> <s> it would not be proper for them to see papers recording the advice given to or the views expressed by ministers of a different party <e>", "<cs> my lords on the second point made by the noble lord i do not believe that would be right because the government i repeat have acted in a proper sensible and responsible way <e> <s> i do not believe that what he envisages will actually happen <e> <s> as regards parliament being misled for many years over this particular question to the best of my knowledge that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only thank my noble friend for that particluar piece of information that he brings us hot from the press <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that all your lordships would recognise the very good service that the security service has performed and continues to perform in this country in spite of all the prevailing conditions <e> <s> i believe that the other point made by the noble lord lord diamond is unwarranted and unjustified for the reasons i have already given in other words i repeat that the government have been frank and candid about this case and have brought it into the open so that it may be discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards a further and wider inquiry that may or may not be necessary <e> <s> i believe i said may before but equally it may not be <e> <s> concerning the need for a public inquiry with respect to the noble lord the leader of the opposition i have very firmly given the reasons why we consider that a public inquiry is not necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords most certainly it is not a lunatic policy <e> <s> the noble lord lord mayhew knows very well that the situation in europe is uncertain and potentially unstable <e> <s> we must always move with caution as long as a capability exists for aggression we must maintain a defence which is able to deter it <e>", "<cs> my lords those words are almost precisely the same as those used by my noble friend about a week ago concerning this question <e> <s> the points that my noble friend makes today still hold good <e>", "<cs> my lords i say to the noble lord that we shall continue to examine our options <e>", "<cs> my lords i say to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that the position of the united kingdom on trident is well known in that superpower arsenals would have to be reduced substantially below per cent <e> <s> with no significant change to the soviet defence capability before we could consider how best to contribute towards arms control in the light of a reduced threat <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> at all times we must be fully aware of the capabilities of the warsaw pact <e>", "<cs> my lords i should have thought that the answer to that is very obvious namely that we should continue to watch very carefully the developments between east and west and to take decisions if and when necessary according to circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inform my noble friend that as regards the soviet navy the soviet government are currently engaged in major combatant and submarine construction programmes in all major categories of naval vessels <e> <s> the only sectors showing any sign of long-term reduction are those concerning missile patrol boats minor combatant and auxiliary vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords the defence budget and expenditure is always used with strategy and care particularly in the long-term costing operations <e> <s> i point out to the noble lord that it is the strength and cohesion of the alliance together with a willingness for dialogue which has helped to bring about the present much improved international situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to make the same remarks to the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> we must not undermine the prospects for a cfe accord by making unilateral reductions in our force levels <e> <s> the british government will not be stampeded into hasty reductions which we would later regret <e> <s> we must always ensure that our security is never jeopardised <e>", "<cs> my lords the decisions thoughts and procedures taking place between those two superpowers are well known to your lordships house <e> <s> allies were consulted and they have agreed <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that your lordships would do well to pay heed to the remarks of my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i can inform my noble friend that the national rivers <e> <s> authority is committed to a policy of providing and operating flood warning systems and that it keeps them under constant review <e> <s> moreover as new technologies such as rainfall radar are developed they are incorporated into those systems <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that the bbc and itn along with the meteorological office are considering ways of reinforcing procedures in order to enhance the impact of broadcast information in severe weather conditions <e> <s> as regards the particular points he raised i shall ensure that these are brought to the attention of those concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords international co-operation in meteorology is very extensive ranging from meteorological research to the exchange of observations and forecasts several times every day <e> <s> the wmos global telecommunications system connects the national meteorological services of some member states <e> <s> moreover where services are required on an international basis current procedures and agreements work well <e>", "<cs> my lords with great respect to the noble lord i think that we have been successful in updating a more reliable system since that time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a shame when my noble friend is not present in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that the government are fully committed to the strong defence of the united kingdom and to meeting nato and out-of-area obligations <e> <s> that therefore necessitates an effective and professional royal navy <e>", "<cs> my lords to take first the noble lords second question as i have frequently made clear in your lordships house my right honourable friend the secretary of state has always said that he will continue to examine the options for change <e> <s> with regard to the number of type frigates now on order i can tell the noble lord that a total of nine are on order five from yarrow shipbuilders and four from swan hunter shipbuilders <e> <s> those are being built to a phased build programme with the next two due for delivery in and the others following at approximately six-monthly intervals <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards costs they are always treated as commercially in confidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not totally clear as to the point that my noble friend is trying to make <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall do my best to make clear to the house that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has always said and continues to say that as regards the future of the defence industry and the future of resources he is continuing to examine all options for change <e>", "<cs> no my lords that is not the case <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet threat is not expected to diminish despite the soviet unions announced intentions to cut defence expenditure <e> <s> the likely naval cuts are probably to be in the form of scrapping obsolete and aged combatants with small net reductions in numbers but there will be an improvement in capability due to their replacement by modern and better equipped units <e>", "<cs> my lords the reason why they have not gone ahead was that it was agreed before the cfe talks by the two superpowers that talks concerning the possibility of naval reductions would not be among the cfe negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble and learned friend but at the same time i am trying to be helpful to your lordships even though we may have strayed slightly off the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the programme of inspections will progress as soon as possible <e> <s> as regards the <e>", "<cs> my lords that question is rather wide of the question on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i can reassure my noble and learned friend that the programme of inspections will be completed as soon as possible <e> <s> as regards publication of the results that will be a decision for my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise i did not get the gist of the noble earls question <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question of high hypothesis <e> <s> it is total speculation <e> <s> there is no truth in what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i believe he is trying to conjure up a host of nuclear nasties which do not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord hatch of lusby is dwelling on too much hypothesis here <e> <s> it is a mask for speculation <e> <s> the situation described by the noble lord does not exist <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is not quite right <e> <s> the words i previously used were <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships know of the very long association which the noble and gallant lord lord bramall has had with the gurkhas <e> <s> your lordships are also aware of the great and glorious deeds that the gurkhas have performed in the past years <e> <s> they fought as your lordshiips well know in two world wars in the malaya campaign and more recently in the falklands campaign <e>", "<cs> my lords the situation is different with visiting american forces in that they make a contribution towards this country when they are here <e>", "<cs> my lords i also point out to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton that gurkha soldiers are eligible for the mod accommodation charge rebate which will ensure that they pay no more than a week more than the average service community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a similar position to the one i was in during the war widows campaign <e> <s> it would be folly and insensitive not the appreciate your lordships feelings in this matter <e> <s> i have made my arguments but in the light of the feelings in your lordships house i will communicate them to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the possible use of gurkhas in northern ireland has never before been taken into account and i seriously doubt that it will be considered now <e> <s> last may we announced that although it was not possible to be definite we should plan on a future for the gurkhas after based on a viable brigade structure <e>", "<cs> my lords that is wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> the question specifically relates to gurkhas and the community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot prejudge the outcome of my session with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for defence <e> <s> i should point out to the noble and gallant lord lord carver that gurkhas have their accommodation and food charges waived and they also do not contribute to ernic the earnings related national insurance charge <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to my noble friend that in any particular circumstances optimism is always speculative <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct in being cautious because the soviet union has the worlds largest and most sophisticated chemical weapon capability <e> <s> we continue to have doubts about soviet claims about their chemical weapon capability but we hope that bilateral soviet/us contacts will resolve the concerns <e>", "<cs> my lords no chemical weapons have been produced in this country since the late s <e> <s> our current estimate of the stock of chemical weapons in russia is about tonnes <e> <s> however the americans say that they are not optimistic about that and believe that the russians could hold far more stocks <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct in saying that it is extremely difficult to produce a true and authentic figure about the amount of chemical weapons stocks in the world <e> <s> however i assure him that good progress has been made in the recent bilateral discussions on chemical weapons <e> <s> the memorandum of understanding which was agreed in september last year at wyoming provided for a two-year experiment in data exchange and verification <e> <s> the first exchange of information took place in december last year <e> <s> however in february the two nations agreed in principle to the destruction of chemical weapon stocks reducing them to per cent <e> <s> of current us levels <e> <s> her majestys government fully endorse and support those initiatives <e>", "<cs> my lords if i knew the exact answer i could say whether it related to this question <e> <s> however i am not certain of the answer and therefore it could be another question <e> <s> in the circumstances i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords assumption is correct <e> <s> chemical warfare has a far-reaching and lethal potential <e>", "<cs> my lords the point made by the noble lord is being discussed under the confidence and security building measures which are taking place <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell my noble friend that the chief of defence procurement wrote to the trade associations in both january and february advising them of our plans and giving details of them <e> <s> they are aimed so far as is possible at minimising the effects of the freeze <e> <s> further details will be sent to all individual contractors later this month <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord lord graham of edmonton the exact number of small contractors who will be affected by these particular circumstances <e>

in accordance with a specified timetable during the freeze period <e> <s> these will be paid on th november <e> <s> the four-weekly cycle will then be restored for all contractors immediately thereafter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot agree with the noble lord on the point that he makes <e> <s> contractors working for the ministry of defence normally receive a very speedy and reliable payment service from the liverpool office <e> <s> indeed i understand that bills are normally paid within one week of receipt <e> <s> we have done our best to limit the effects of the payment freeze and to maintain an acceptable level of service during this difficult month of conversion <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot comment on specific circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i had already made clear that if there are circumstances in which it is thought that there is justification for giving sympathetic consideration especially to small contractors then such consideration will be given <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to be able to say that i can reassure the noble lord on those points <e> <s> we are sensitive to the objections concerning national parks <e> <s> we are committed to consulting very fully the local planning authority and the countryside commission over any significant development within a national park <e> <s> st davids airfield was selected as the

estimated at about million <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite correct <e> <s> the facts through the means of representation and consultation will be made fully available <e> <s> as he rightly said my honourable friend the minister for defence procurement will be visiting the site on thursday and will do his very best to allay fears that may exist in the area which as my noble friend said have been very much exaggerated by the local press <e>", "<cs> my lords i say straight away to the noble lord that the requirement to protect the united kingdom from air attack will continue for the foreseeable future <e> <s> over-the-horizon radar can enhance the effectiveness of meeting that requirement <e> <s> the problem if any that may be caused for tourism will be addressed in the environmental impact assessment when that is made <e>", "<cs> my lords i hasten to reassure the noble lord that in no way do we minimise the possible impact of the facility in that location <e>

the locality towards the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i am right in saying that there is natural apprehension in the area about the proposal <e> <s> but as i have also said things will become clearer in the light of the new consultation which is about to take place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not completely certain how to answer the noble viscounts question but it probably could be done through the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords the building of the installation will be put out to tender <e> <s> the other points raised by the noble baroness will be fully considered in the environmental impact assessment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is correct that although the crown is formally exempt from planning legislation it is our practice to follow the normal planning consultation procedure as laid down in this case by the welsh office <e>", "<cs> my lords i am talking about nuclear deterrence from the point of view of preventing war across the world <e> <s> the governments position which i have just outlined is well known <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord jenkins will permit i shall come to that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble

and western europe in this field is very good <e> <s> i have no doubt that with the greatly improved relationships between east and west there will be scope for improving it still further <e>", "<cs> my lords the second question put by the noble lord goes somewhat wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> of course i agree with him that drug trafficking of any form whether in this country or abroad is a vile and abhorrent form of trade <e> <s> with regard to his first question perhaps i can take as an example the caribbean where the royal navy west indies guard ship and other royal navy vessels in the area provide assistance when they are available in co-ordinated anti-drug patrols for the us coastguard <e> <s> their role is limited to surveillance and monitoring <e> <s> it has made a significant contribution in deterring and apprehending drug traffickers <e> <s> we have the warm appreciation of the united states for that <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect to my noble friend his question goes slightly wide of the question on the order paper <e> <s> i believe that it would be better answered by someone else <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may first say that the services most frequently involved are the navy and to a less extent the raf <e> <s> the legal basis relies on the customs and excise and the police as the law enforcement agencies <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord the leader of the opposition that at the request of the foreign and commonwealth office and as part of her majestys governments package of assistance to the colombian government we have been providing training to the colombian law enforcement authorities in a number of areas including bomb disposal and close protection of vips <e> <s> furthermore my right honourable friend the prime

contains a duty for waste regulation authorities to monitor the site and to take remedial action to prevent pollution of underground waters <e> <s> for any operational site the licensing provisions and conditions will protect underground waters <e> <s> i can assure my noble friends that the nra is a statutory consultee <e>", "<cs> while i am sure it would be helpful to waste regulators and the industry to have advance notice of the programme of advice that the department intends to issue over a period this advice will include the statutory advice provided for in the licensing provisions of the bill <e> <s> it may be of assistance at this stage if i say that it is our intention to provide the guidance necessary for the implementation of these licensing provisions so that they can come into force in early <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this point in order to assist the noble lord lord nathan <e> <s> i can tell him that hmips responsibilities for controlled waste have been reorganised <e> <s> the audit role has been transferred to the regional offices of hmip <e> <s> it is likely that hmip will no longer produce waste management papers <e> <s> that requirement is likely to be transferred to the waste management technical policy group <e> <s> i hope that that goes some way towards enlightening the noble lord <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> if my

his request for a modification to the secretary of state on appeal <e> <s> for those reasons we cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right when he says that we have already discussed this issue at some length <e> <s> the matter was discussed both at committee stage in another place and previously in this chamber under clause <e> <s> i

will be determined once the amount is known but any likely savings will be in the medium and long term rather than the short term <e>", "<cs> my lords the soviet union continues to produce weaponry at a somewhat alarming rate <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated in the first answer it is the responsibility of industry to decide its own internal programming and research <e>", "<cs> my lords when i use the word alarming i must add that the soviet union is continuing to produce weapons and armaments at a regular pitch <e>", "<cs> my lords it is against the background which my noble friend has outlined that we have to make far-reaching decisions on the size shape and future of the armed forces <e> <s> it is not an easy matter it is a complex matter which needs very careful consideration

"<cs> my lords all decisions concerning the future are taken in consultation with our nato allies <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell the noble lord that in the long-term costing programme just under billion is being spent on defence <e>", "<cs> my lords while we anticipate opportunities for reductions in some areas it is too early to say what financial savings might be consistent with the outcome of the first stage of cfe and changes in eastern europe <e> <s> we remain resolved to sustain modern and well equipped forces adequate for our security needs and we shall provide the necessary

forces fully understand the circumstances and would much prefer that we made a good and sensible decision than responded with knee jerk reactions <e>", "<cs> my lords it is being conducted with those who are thought to be appropriate to determine future circumstances that is mostly with the ministry of defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat to the noble lord that as regards defence we

another of those cases where the committee <e>", "<cs> it is a particular pleasure to be able to welcome an amendment tabled by my noble friends lord renton and lord onslow and the noble lord lord moran <e> <s> we have heard how important it is that our water supplies should be protected against leachate from waste sites <e> <s> there is already recognition of this in the procedures for consulting the national rivers authority when granting licences <e> <s> it does indeed seem entirely reasonable that the nra should also be consulted about problems with disused sites <e>", "<cs> i am bound to say that it sounds a very interesting question but i am afraid i cannot give my noble friend a secure answer <e> <s> i shall be writing to him in the very near future on this point <e>", "<cs> we are delighted to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> if this modest looking amendment were accepted there would be no need for most of the rest of the bill <e> <s> the point is that the amendment would load onto the statutory nuisance provisions and hence on local authorities the function of policing all processes that might give rise to any damage to the environment and atmosphere or upset the ecological balance <e>", "<cs> we touched on the subject of environmental or green auditing by local authorities and others during discussion of part i of the bill <e> <s> this is something which a number of local authorities are already undertaking and can be highly effective if properly conducted <e> <s> officials in the department of the environment have been discussing with the local authority associations how this might be carried forward <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great care diligence and attention to the concerns expressed by noble lords <e> <s> i can say that with or without modification we shall consider this amendment very carefully and return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> in the circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are not convinced that we should be justified in setting up a new category of statutory nuisance to catch nuisance caused by floodlighting <e> <s> the matter was raised in another place <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for the environment and countryside undertook to give further consideration to the question of nuisances caused by light <e> <s> we have consulted as widely as time allowed <e> <s> enquiries which officials made of the institution of environmental health officers have not disclosed that this is a widespread problem nor that any widespread measure of support appears to exist on the part of local authorities for having such powers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for my noble friends closing remarks <e> <s> perhaps i may spend a few minutes trying to enlighten the noble lord lord mcintosh on our intentions <e> <s> these amendments raise the important question of the concept used to determine what practical limits should be placed on the obligation of an industry trade or business to take steps to minimise statutory nuisance <e>", "<cs> i shall do my best <e> <s> i am not absolutely certain that i shall be able to put to bed all my noble friends concerns but perhaps an answer to a few of them will suffice at this time of night <e>", "<cs> yes of course <e>", "<cs> first i take amendments nos <e> <s> b and b <e> <s> we do not consider that local authorities need these powers in addition to the powers of entry and inspection provided by schedule <e> <s> it would be wrong to provide further powers which could require a person to provide information that might be self-incriminating <e> <s> statutory nuisance relates to fairly simple matters such as smoke smell or dust and local authorities have all the inspection and information gathering powers they need <e> <s> the tradition of statutory nuisance enshrined in legislation which dates back many years has been that it is for the local authority using its powers of entry as necessary to establish whether a nuisance exists <e>", "<cs> i believe that i can be short on both amendments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> is acceptable to the government <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> raises a complex legal issue that we need to explore further but in the meantime we are happy to consider it <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take first amendments nos <e> <s> a and c <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a appears to be a paving amendment for amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> we suggest that the latter amendment is both misconceived and unnecessary <e> <s> it is misconceived because it would insert provision for a fine at a stage in the proceedings when the matter before the court is whether a nuisance order should be made <e> <s> an offence is not committed unless the requirements of the nuisance order are contravened or not complied with <e> <s> the amendment is unnecessary because subsection makes provisions as to penalties for such an offence <e>", "<cs> clause defined key concepts relating to the protection of the environment from possible damage from gmos <e> <s> i endorse your lordships concern that we should be particularly <e>", "<cs> the effect of amendment no <e> <s> would be to alter the definition of harm to emphasise that in the case of living organisms it means harm to the health of those organisms <e> <s> we consider that the present wording achieves the same <e>", "<cs> we are sympathetic to the notion behind this amendment <e> <s> indeed it conforms with the approach that the government have already adopted on the provision of advice to the secretary of state on the matters with which part vi is concerned <e> <s> noble lords will be aware that on th april the minister announced details in another place of a single committee to advise on all aspects of the safety of the release to the environment of genetically modified organisms <e> <s> under the chairmanship of professor john beringer the advisory committee on releases to the environment acre will advise on notifications and applications for consent to release gmos and on research needs proposals for regulations written guidance and other matters <e> <s> there is however no need for reference to acre on the face of the bill since the secretary of state can already obtain advice from whomsoever he chooses <e>", "<cs> we agree that there are major problems in controlling and containing the risks associated with gmos <e> <s> that after all is the whole reason for part iv <e> <s> we can therefore understand the noble lords concern to see that the exported gmos do not create problems for other countries <e>", "<cs> i should comment on the international anxiety that several members of the committee have mentioned <e> <s> the united kingdom government support the pursuit of vigorous international action on gmos and have been influential in the ec and oecd in securing rational and workable solutions <e> <s> the united kingdom will continue to work in international fora such as the united nations environment programme for a consistent framework of control which embraces and protects the interests of all countries <e>", "<cs> i merely wished to say to the noble lord lord graham that we entirely accept the valuable points that have been made by the noble lord and many other members of the committee too <e> <s> we are anxious to continue to play a role in international fora <e> <s> at this stage i do not believe that i can say anything more helpful than that we have listened very carefully to the anxieties put forward by members of the committee <e>", "<cs> a fundamental premise of the structure of part vi of the bill is that it should be <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may turn first to the point raised by the noble lord lord lewis <e> <s> the provisions of part vi in allowing for a hierarchy of controls are intended to apply for a long period and to cover a wide range of operations involving gmos <e> <s> the need is for a structure in the enabling legislation which would allow appropriately rigorous levels of control risk assessment notification or consent to be applied depending on the circumstances of the time <e> <s> the degree of scrutiny appropriate to particular gmo proposals is mainly a matter for regulations and in drafting those we shall take into account the views of the royal commission and others <e> <s> the acre will also advise on that aspect <e>", "<cs> as was said in relation to a previous group of amendments a statutory requirement for codes of guidance or practice would add nothing to what already appears on the face of the bill <e> <s> similarly the qualifications to clause suggested by the noble lord lord graham would not change what we already have <e> <s> whether risks are containable is a matter for judgment which can be interpreted only by the courts and the noble lords additional words would not change that <e> <s> for that reason i ask him to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> we agree that efforts to prevent damage to the environment should concentrate on gmos which present real rather than trivial risks and we can see that the noble earls amendments seek to point up the distinction between real and trivial risks <e> <s> however i do not consider that the qualifications proposed would help us in determining the acceptability of the degree of risk presented by particular gmos <e> <s> whether risks are unreasonable or unacceptable is a matter of judgment based on the facts of individual cases <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> the general responsibilities of this proposed commission are very widely expressed while its particular purposes as described in the noble lords amendment are already served by other means <e> <s> the advisory committee on genetic modification acgm set up under the health and safety commissions powers under the health and safety at work act exists to advise on general questions of genetic modification <e> <s> so far as releases to the environment are concerned the secretary of state will be advised by the advisory committee on releases to the environment acre whose membership was announced by the minister in another place on th april <e>", "<cs> part vi in common with other parts of the bill makes no special provision regarding civil liability for damage to the environment <e> <s> its purpose is to set up a statutory scheme for the regulation of activities involving genetically modified organisms <e> <s> this scheme is enforced by a system of criminal offences with stiff penalties which include fines of up to on summary conviction and unlimited fines for some offences on conviction on indictment <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> imposes a duty on the secretary of state to send copies of the advisory committees recommendations on consents to the consent applicant and persons who have made representations on the application <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make clear to the noble lord lord nathan that the advertisement proposals will ensure that any person can approach the secretary of state and/or the person proposing the release <e> <s> for the benefit of any members of the committee who were not here earlier this evening we have already indicated that we shall be considering the position of registers <e>", "<cs> the amendments seek to establish an appeals system in respect of consents and other matters <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a attempts to apply the part i appeals provisions to part vi <e> <s> unfortunately it does not take account of one crucial difference between parts i and vi <e> <s> decisions about authorisations under part i are to be made by either <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal first with the point made by the noble lord lord dean of beswick <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord lord graham of edmonton is aware of the issue involved <e> <s> there are many decisions taken by the secretary of state against which there is no right of appeal <e> <s> however there is always the remedy of judicial review for an aggrieved person <e> <s> that mechanism has been successfully used in many cases and it can give a speedy remedy <e>", "<cs> the enforcement of part vi will be undertaken largely by inspectors appointed under clause <e> <s> there are two main requirements for such inspectors <e> <s> first they should possess appropriate expertise which will require special training and development in such a new field <e> <s> secondly the inspection arrangements should as far as possible synchronise with those operated by existing inspectorates particularly hse inspectors who are responsible for enforcing human safety aspects of gmo operations in order to avoid duplication of visits to premises <e>", "<cs> had it not been for my noble friend lord craigton and the noble baroness lady nicol the government would have laid these amendments before the committee <e> <s> we accept them with pleasure and alacrity <e>", "<cs> that is quite correct <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may help the noble baroness on this amendment <e> <s> it modifies paragraph of schedule so that it makes clear that the consultation required of the secretary of state before he determines national park supplementary grants is with the countryside commission as respects national parks in england and with the countryside council for wales as respects national parks in wales <e>", "<cs> we must admit that we find the first amendment a little confusing as it purports to define the word natural whereas it really defines the words natural beauty <e> <s> this also leads to an unsatisfactory cross-reference in the second amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps at this stage i may speak to the other motion standing in my name on the order paper <e> <s> the army air force and naval discipline acts continuation order which was laid before this house on th june will continue the three service discipline acts in force for a further year <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware it is a long-established practice for the services disciplinary arrangements to be fully reviewed every five years through consideration of an armed forces bill and for the statutory framework to be renewed annually in the intervening years <e> <s> the last such bill was in so your lordships can expect to have a relatively early opportunity to consider service disciplinary procedures in depth <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i dispute the point made by the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton that it is a defence review <e> <s> as i have frequently said in your lordships house it is a study of options for changes in policy in the light of the warming of the situation in eastern europe that is what is driving us in that direction and not a need to find more money <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could come to that in a moment <e> <s> i am dealing with that issue under a point raised by another noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter that is coming under <e>", "<cs> my lords acts of bullying and any kind of racial prejudice are absolutely abhorred by everyone in the armed forces and by society in general <e> <s> great care is taken to see that they do not occur <e> <s> if and when they do happen they are dealt with quickly and in the appropriate manner as pertains at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that some members of your lordships house are concerned that homosexual activity remains an offence under the service discipline acts thus setting the services apart from civilian life <e> <s> service conditions that is where people live in closed communities on and off duty and often under stress are different from those in civilian life <e> <s> such conditions and the need for absolute trust and confidence between all ranks require that the potentially disruptive influence of homosexual practices should be excluded <e> <s> i fully accept that argument as did the select committee of the house in its report on the armed forces bill in <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that an order is laid before the house every year in between the five-year period and that every five years there is an armed forces bill <e> <s> there will almost certainly be an armed forces bill next year <e> <s> however in the intervening period the matter is dealt with in the form of an order <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank both noble lords for their comments and for the questions which they raised on the statement <e> <s> the noble lord lord williams of elvel was somewhat more generous than the noble lord lord mayhew <e> <s> perhaps i may deal first with the questions raised by the noble lord lord williams of elvel upon which i think i can be helpful <e> <s> he said that he was glad about the statement and welcomed overall some of its aspects <e> <s> he said that it was a long statement <e> <s> it is indeed a long statement <e> <s> however there has been much to announce and there will be much more to announce at a later date <e> <s> he went on to say he was delighted that the soviets navy strength was falling <e> <s> that may be true but whereas the numbers may be falling the quality is certainly improving <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not an increase in our out of area provision <e> <s> however it is something which will be constantly examined as and when circumstances demand that this should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for those remarks particularly the last point to which i know that all noble lords will pay particular attention <e>", "<cs> my lords that was a most magnificent contribution to the debate <e> <s> i agree with absolutely every word that the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord slim is interesting to hear on that point <e> <s> as regards the teeth versus tail plans for the support area we are determined to reduce support at least in proportion to reduction in front line units <e> <s> i make that point perfectly clear <e> <s> reductions in the ministry of defence and in the general support areas will also be commensurate with the front-line reductions <e> <s> however i should point out to the noble viscount that many such reductions were carried out in the early s <e>", "<cs> my lords the last point made by my noble friend is probably not quite right <e> <s> both the super-powers russia and america agreed that they would not enter into maritime talks <e> <s> my noble friend asked about the approximately frigates and destroyers <e> <s> as i said at the beginning of the statement all these proposals are up for consultation and general information <e> <s> that also goes for my noble friends points about orders staying in place for frigates and destroyers <e> <s> i take his point about naval force reductions <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the last point that my noble friend made <e> <s> i can tell him out of interest that yesterday i visited some members of the acs at crowborough <e> <s> i found them a most impressive unit of young men and women aged between and <e> <s> not only did some of them wish to play a part in the armed forces later but as my noble friend said they make a most admirable contribution to the local community <e> <s> that is a point that we shall bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords we have not had time to consider this aspect in the report of the house of commons defence committee <e> <s> it was published today i think i am right in saying and we have not had time to look at it carefully <e> <s> however the policy of the four-boat system will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say to the noble lord the leader of the opposition that the way ahead for further discussion on defence has not yet been determined by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> at the moment we are about to enter into discussions with our nato allies <e> <s> we shall consult far and wide <e> <s> for the future the exact way in which more information will be divulged is not entirely known <e> <s> i understand and will pass on the comments of the noble lord the leader of the opposition to my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords amendments nos <e> <s> a and a in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh would have the effect of excluding from the requirement to go out to competition any authority which had made satisfactory arrangements for the disposal of its waste satisfactory being defined with reference to the need to maintain an efficient waste disposal service <e> <s> that would prevent the introduction of competition unless the secretary of state considered that authorities had failed to make satisfactory arrangements in their area <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would specify that it is an offence to contravene the duty of care <e>", "<cs> my lords i can be brief on this amendment and say that we are happy to give an assurance that the code will draw attention to the existence of the codes of practice under the health and safety legislation among a number of cross-references to other statutory requirements which are not the subject of the code <e> <s> however it would be quite wrong to duplicate provisions of other legislation in the statutory code of practice <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble lord will feel on the basis of this explanation that he need not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this argument sounds familiar <e> <s> it has been debated fully in the past and the <e>", "<cs> my lords i can instantly say that we are happy to be able to accept both the amendments that have been referred to standing in the name of the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey <e> <s> however with reference to clause my noble friends lord renton and lord crickhowell raised in committee the issue of giving the nra a statutory right to be consulted about pollution dangers from closed landfill sites <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to say that the government are agreeing with my noble friends on an appropriate amendment to address this issue <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend lord renton will want to table such an amendment on third reading <e> <s> we would warmly welcome such an amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lady lady kinloss will feel that it has been worth her while to wait until such a late hour because we are <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i should first like to take amendment no <e> <s> in the name of my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> we are indebted to him for identifying that the word enforcing is not appropriate for this part of the bill and that that terminology properly belongs to part i of the bill <e> <s> we are happy to accept his amendment to delete the word enforcing <e>", "<cs> my lords i can advise my noble friend that i understand that confidential information has been kept from the register <e> <s> i hope that i have answered the particular point that he raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall answer the points raised by the noble lord lord mcintosh in particular those referring to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i shall endeavour to assure him that we are still about the grand order of things <e> <s> i shall also deal with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> both amendments allow the secretary of state to specify the date by which an authority must arrange for the disposal of its waste to a contractor by competitive tender <e> <s> they allow him to specify different dates for each authority if appropriate <e> <s> that allows the introduction of competitive tendering to be tailored to the individual circumstances of each authority <e> <s> it also ensures that there is no scope for authorities to obstruct the introduction of competition through delaying tactics and the formation of their lawdc <e>", "<cs> it has been the long-standing practice of successive governments neither to confirm nor deny the locations of specific nuclear weapons <e>", "<cs> this is a matter for the us government <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may first reply to the points made by the noble lord lord mcintosh <e> <s> to refresh his memory i said <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to disappoint the noble lord because the governments reply is that help is at hand <e> <s> the government consider that everything is well <e> <s> i wish to explain briefly why we believe this to be the case <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh said the amendments raise once more the proposition that the concept of best practical means bpm in part iii should be replaced by the concept of best available technology not entailing excessive cost batneec which is the formulation used in parts i and vi <e> <s> the noble lord argued in committee for the adoption of a standard definition throughout the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may put the noble lord lord mcintosh right on one point <e> <s> i did not in fact use the word crude <e> <s> i used the word robust <e> <s> i said that the bpm defence is a robust concept which has survived so long because of its simplicity <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mcintosh is quite correct <e> <s> we agreed in committee to consider the issue that was raised by the amendment <e> <s> we had concluded that a power in schedule to remove equipment would compare undesirably with the bills other rights-of-entry clauses which do not contain an equivalent power <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only repeat what i said before namely that it must be recognised that the equipment is the property of someone but that that property can be the means by which a business is carried on <e> <s> surely it is not necessary to remove all the <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the answer is definitely in the affirmative <e>", "<cs> my lords clause requires local authorities before serving a street litter control notice to inform the person on whom the notice will be served and to take into account any representations he may make <e>", "<cs> my lords while amendment no <e> <s> would enable the secretary of state to make regulations providing for general consents under clause for certain types of release taken together the other five amendments would establish a regime for gmo releases which would be similar to but less sensitive and flexible than that already provided for in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can give the assurance to the noble lord that he requires regarding information upon the continuing progress of the talks <e> <s> i hope that with that reassurance he will be content <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment as outlined by the noble lord is an attempt to impose a form of strict liability in certain cases where loss or damage is caused by the acquisition keeping or release of a gmo <e>", "<cs> my lords as annex a to the white paper states strict liability is a concept that has a potential application to secure environmental protection objectives <e> <s> it also points out the complexities of ramifications of the concept and the fact that the subject is being pursued in a number of international organisations including the european court oecd and the ec <e> <s> i can tell the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall deal with all the amendments mentioned by the noble lord lord clinton-davis <e> <s> i propose to begin by dealing with amendment no <e> <s> which requires details of advice given to the secretary of state by any other committee in addition to that set out by virtue of amendment no <e> <s> to be recorded on the register <e> <s> such a provision would be redundant as the register will relate only to part vi matters and the advisory committee appointed by the secretary of state namely in practice the advisory committee on releases to the environment will be the only committee giving relevant advice in such matters <e> <s> further there is some cross-membership of acgm and acre and close collaboration between the secretariats of these two committees and other relevant advisory committees <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to be able to help my noble friend even at this late hour <e> <s> i can tell him that part vi does not apply generally to northern ireland because environmental issues including gmos are transferred matter under the northern ireland constitution act <e> <s> the only exception is imports of gmos into that country <e> <s> that is because imports are a reserved matter under the act and are dealt with by the united kingdom government <e> <s> in most cases <e>", "<cs> my lords of all our defence commitments the direct defence of these islands is one that we should never contemplate abandoning <e> <s> in maintaining it we need to maintain our ability to provide early warning of any military activity in or above the huge expanse of the norwegian seas to the north of the united kingdom <e> <s> we believe that othr can make a substantial contribution to that difficult surveillance task <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the local concern upon which my noble friend comments <e> <s> an environmental impact assessment will be done <e> <s> that is essentially a technique for ensuring that the likely effects upon the environment of a new development are fully understood and taken into account <e> <s> by providing a full analysis of the proposals likely effects an eia can help to allay fears created by a lack of information <e> <s> at the same time it can help to inform the public of the main issues that the local planning authority will have to consider in reaching a decision on the planning application <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that the noble lord had such an interesting recess that he covered miles and that he is willing to cover it again <e> <s> equally i am aware of the sensitivity of that location and the strength of local feeling about it <e> <s> i can say categorically that st davids was selected as a location for the transmitter only after an exhaustive search for suitable sites <e> <s> in fact other sites were considered <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our understanding that as part of the scrutiny of the united states government spending proposals for the fiscal year congress has requested that the united states navy should re-examine the requirement to locate the radar in the united kingdom <e> <s> the response to that request is a matter for the united states government <e> <s> however we understand that they remain fully committed to the proposal to undertake a joint two-year trial of othr in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not accept the final point that the noble baroness made <e> <s> i must repeat that we are extremely sensitive to all the implications of this matter <e> <s> as regards the first point that the noble baroness made on nato i must emphasise that this is a trial project <e> <s> we would not normally expect to seek or to be granted nato funds for such a purpose <e> <s> however the air defence of the united kingdom region is an important nato endorsed task <e> <s> we are confident that the alliance will be interested in the implications of a successful outcome of this trial <e>", "<cs> my lords if the project were turned down any decision that was taken would be entirely a matter for the ministry of defence and the secretary of state for wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that when the noble lord told me to go away he meant it metaphorically <e> <s> i must repeat again that once we have submitted the planning applications we intend to give full public presentations of our proposals <e> <s> there will be a -week statutory limit on that <e> <s> i assure noble lords that no construction work will begin before the planning process has been completed <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is correct <e> <s> even disregarding eastern european nations there is no doubt that the soviet union alone retains a considerable advantage over nato <e> <s> that is why under our <e>", "<cs>

being successful in having negotiations with mr gorbachev such as the cfe negotiations and the csbm negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand very well the point made by my noble friend <e> <s> indeed that point is being stressed to mr gorbachev as frequently as possible in line with negotiations now taking place and future negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible <e> <s> we do not care to speculate on the number of casualties <e> <s> all i can say is that if we must go to war we hope that the casualties will be as few as possible and we are determined that that should be so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend is correct <e> <s> i was under the impression that i was answering on behalf of british casualties if any should occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear that it is the purpose of the united nations to restore kuwait to its rightful owners <e>", "<cs> my lords those are currently hypothetical questions <e> <s> if the events envisaged by the noble lord lord williams transpire they will be dealt with at that time <e>", "<cs> my lords it is your lordships wish <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is the legitimate government <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will agree that this has been a debate on a very high level highlighted by some notable speeches but starred by two memorable maiden speeches those of the noble baroness lady dunn and the noble lord lord haden-guest <e> <s> not only were they a valuable contribution to the debate once again they demonstrated that your lordships house is a house of diverse skills and talents <e> <s> i am sure that we can look forward to further performances of equal talent from both of those speakers in the near future <e>", "<cs> my lords any future funding that may be required is a matter between the treasury and the ministry of defence <e> <s> to counter blatant and naked aggression by iraq against kuwait through the deployment of
