noble friend lord teviot <e> <s> i have considered what was said then and have just now listened with much interest to the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> let me assure you that the government entirely accept that wider considerations of the kind described by the noble lord lord underhill and by the amendment ought to be and indeed must be taken into account when planning the provision of transport services <e> <s> indeed we made it clear in the white paper that we expect the wider benefits flowing from revenue support to be fully assessed <e> <s> but i really do think that the bill makes it absolutely clear that these wider benefits can and should be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords in the series of questions which the noble lord lord jenkins has put on this topic he has blurred the issue by confusing allegations of demands for payment being made and traders choosing to make unofficial payments for the removal of refuse <e> <s> as i have consistently stated the chief auditors investigations into the press allegations of bribery found no evidence of demands for payment of money being made <e> <s> what the chief auditor did find was that some traders had chosen to

responsibly in the light of the governments proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords the independence of local government resides in its freedom to make decisions within the framework laid down by parliament <e> <s> our present arrangements rest on the assumption that local authorities will have regard to long-standing conventions relating to national spending and other policies <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>

<e>", "<cs> my lords the response in so far as it refers to the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos for introducing a subject which needs to be talked about not i should have thought on the odd occasion but at fairly regular intervals throughout the years <e> <s> therefore i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i hope that he will be as pleased as i am by the contributions <e> <s> they were interesting and in some cases as opinion enlightening <e> <s> i shall try to comment on as many speeches as i can but the frustration of sitting

find it so <e> <s> the only way you can get even halfway towards it is to promise to write to speakers on matters which you omit to mention <e> <s> therefore i ask your lordships to bear with me <e>

subject has had to be raised at all <e> <s> whether this is an appropriate time and in an appropriate form is for your lordships to decide <e> <s> for myself i am saddened that we should even be considering a situation of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we have received a large number of

the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i am rather puzzled by the amendment and i should say first of all to the noble lord lord evans that my advice is that the power does not exist <e> <s> i am puzzled because if the intention is to allow different treatment of certain metropolitan county councils then i should point out that the amendment is defective because it differentiates between the purposes of part ii which are to cancel the elections to extend the terms of office of existing glc and metropolitan county council members and to give the secretary of state power to alter the quorum in any of those councils <e> <s> the amendment does not differentiate between areas or between individual councils <e> <s> since the three purposes of part ii are
