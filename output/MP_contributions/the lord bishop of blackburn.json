["<cs> my lords i find myself happy to follow the noble lord the founder and architect of the dual system a system appreciated not just by the church of england nor just by the roman catholic church but by the free churches the jewish people for there are jewish schools and i believe appreciated so far as our contacts with the des are concerned by the department itself <e> <s> after the consultations which took place when the commission on the government of schools under the noble lord lord taylor was sitting the prospect of this bill was welcomed the prospect <e> <s> it is good to see that wider representation of interests is given to governing bodies not least by the inclusion of parents who have a personal concern in the schools and of teacher-governors <e> <s> it is good to see that the position of the head teacher as a governor especially if the head teacher wishes not to be is clarified <e> <s> it is interesting to note also that as a result of this bill if it is passed the governing body of a voluntary aided school irrespective of its denomination will be closer to that envisaged by the taylor commission than that of a county school not least because the governors own the premises and also the governors employ the teachers <e> <s> the governing bodies of our voluntary-aided schools will be much more widely representative of the local community <e> <s> and the local community in the villages will be the rural community <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the spirit of this amendment covered already in the bill in clause <e> <s> if there is a minor authority the minor authority shall appoint and we have a parent governor <e> <s> it would seem that the concern is that as regards an agricultural area somebody with a knowledge of agriculture should be on the board <e> <s> if one is considering a school in an agricultural area i should have thought that the chances are that one of the parents would be involved in that industry <e> <s> if on the other hand one is in the middle of preston and living in an area where most of the children in the school may be of a different racial origin then presumably one of the parents in that school would be living next door to such a person and would have knowledge of community relations immediately rather than professionally <e> <s> is not that what is wanted <e> <s> therefore is not what is desired already covered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure we all have sympathy with what lies behind this proposed clause because the prospect of withdrawal from classes on this subject is really alarming and could be the thin edge of the wedge in regard to all sorts of other things <e>", "<cs> my lords all british broadcasting both by act and by charter rests traditionally upon a tripod it exists to inform to educate and to entertain <e> <s> the report before us is vastly informative and to read it is an education in itself <e> <s> those in search of entertainment may be disappointed but i like previous speakers warmly thank the noble lord lord annan for introducing this debate and agree with him that professor peacocks committee deserves to be congratulated on this in-depth presentation of wide-ranging issues thrown up with explosive urgency by the new technology of this decade <e> <s> peacock is prophetic <e>", "<cs> my lords before we run into the buffers will the minister welcome the assurance given in another place about the proposal to hold a major exhibition to commemorate the quincentenary of thomas cranmer <e> <s> that exhibition will be held in the great hall of lambeth palace in september of next year and will be preceded by two public lectures to be given by drpeter brooks of robinson college cambridge <e>"]
