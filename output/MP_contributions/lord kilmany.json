["<cs> my lords with regard to the original question is my noble friend satisfied that sufficient fuel is available to ensure that territorial army premises are reasonably heated during the winter months <e> <s> because in the coldest periods last year that certainly was not the case greatly to the detriment of the training of the territorial army <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his rather cautious reply <e> <s> is it not the fact that her majestys government still have influence in these affairs <e> <s> would he himself not agree that <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend for that reply which would seem to be very satisfactory may i ask him to bear in mind that private legislation can take a long time <e> <s> would it not be just as well to get on with putting this on the statute book without further delay to remove any possible anxieties there might be about the future holding of the derby <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether he will bear in mind that while many people admired very much the courage of the mounted policewoman riding a white horse who joined in the police charge at hampden park in very disagreeable circumstances this is not really the most suitable way to deploy female labour however courageous <e>", "<cs> my lords i too must apologise for not having put my name on the paper to speak earlier than i did <e> <s> may i confine myself to following my noble friend on the local point but although what i specifically raise is the figure concerned in fife it is the fact that <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that reply may i ask my noble friend what further help is being considered in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure for me to follow the noble lord lord richardson in his speech because among the many great offices that he has held in the medical profession one for several years was that of president of the general medical council <e> <s> i in my humble way was for years a lay member for scotland of the general medical council though not serving under the noble lord lord richardson <e> <s> in that capacity i always thought that it was my duty to put the laymans point of view and if there was anything like a doctors lobby to try if i may use the word to debunk it <e> <s> having listened to the noble lord lord richardson just now and having listened to the noble lord lord porritt i am bound to say that i cannot do other than find myself agreeing with their arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of a previous question may i ask my noble friend whether she would agree that members of your lordships house are just as capable of recognising cases which should be investigated by the ombudsman <e> <s> they are just as capable as members of another place <e> <s> would it not be in the public interest that we should have equal facilities to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it unnatural to be on different sides with my noble friend lord chelwood especially on a matter of this sort where we are both so keen on what is good for the natural life of the countryside but i am bound to say that when he asked your lordships what wildfowler would want to shoot a curlew <e> <s> he seemed to expect that no wildfowler in this country and i include scotland would want to shoot a curlew <e> <s> but the fact of the matter is that not only if you go to the committees of wildfowlers but if you go among them and talk about it as a wildfowler you will find that a very large proportion of wildfowlers are only too happy to shoot a curlew and it does not do anybody any harm <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not do any harm to cull a species which is not in short supply <e> <s> it is a good thing to cull the domestic hens it is not a bad thing to cull seals when they get too numerous or even deer <e> <s> the curlew and to a much lesser extent the redshank are well able to look after themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords in following my noble friend lord crawshaw i find myself in very great general agreement with what he has said if there was one part of it that gave me particular pleasure it was to hear my noble friends reference to the noble lord lord wigg with whom he admitted he had sometimes had differences of opinion but to whom he paid tribute and i would also like to pay tribute for the tremendous amount of work that he has put into the preservation of those two great british races the derby and the grand national <e> <s> i believe that this bill makes it possible to look forward with every good reason to a continuance of the derby being held at epsom <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply may i ask my noble friend for an assurance that the government will by no means restrict the use of plastic bullets if the local commander regards their use as absolutely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from that reply would it be true to assume that by and large the girls are proving themselves tougher than the boys <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply may i ask why if children are not very academic they should not be encouraged to play more games <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may intervene only for a minute or two i certainly undertake that i shall not stand in the way of my noble friend lord mansfield in replying to the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> i have only one small complaint to make <e> <s> i readily accept i have an interest in this matter it is not a financial one but it is an important interest and this is in the general sport and enjoyment of the whole of scotland <e> <s> but in particular i have an interest regarding the racecourse at ayr <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ross will know it had been counting upon a revaluation because those connected with the course were led to believe that there was very good hope of having a reassessment of their rate burden which would allow those concerned to continue with ayr racecourse on the same high class lines that they have learned to show to all who attend the races notably those who attend the september meeting when the ayr gold cup takes place <e> <s> this attracts so many good horses trainers and owners <e> <s> it has a good attendance of people who count on seeing the best at a very good time of year for scotland <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i readily agree with my noble friend about that <e> <s> but does he really understand how serious this matter is <e> <s> the noble lord opposite with whom i disagree about very many things feels that what i am saying on this point is worthy of support <e> <s> i want to beg of my noble friend to bear this in mind and see what can be done <e> <s> looking at what we are now discussing i cannot see it being made any easier to do <e> <s> but that does not prevent my hoping and urging my noble friend and his right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland to realise the danger and do something without too much delay indeed without any delay at all to set it right <e>", "<cs> yes my lords but may we take it from what my noble friend the leader of the house has said that although there is no obligation on other than the immediate follower of the maiden speaker to offer congratulations if the maiden speech is particularly good or is made by a personal friend there is nothing whatever against subsequent noble lords making mention of it and congratulating the maiden speaker <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply for which i thank my noble friend may i ask whether he is aware that scottish racecourses in particular are being so heavily rated as compared to english racecourses that they cannot balance their accounts <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that the burden of rates carried by scottish racecourses is three or four times as heavy as that carried by comparable english racecourses <e> <s> is my noble friend aware that unless something is done about it and done very soon horse racing in scotland will be killed stone dead <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> in thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that not only the street i mention specifically in my question but man other london streets have pedestrian crossings which motor-cyclists cross without any consideration for pedestrians <e> <s> is my noble friend not aware that if a crossing is supposed to be safe but is in fact not safe it constitutes a danger and that something should therefore be done about it and is he also aware that the figures which he mentioned do not look as if enough is being done at present <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the original reply which of course i very much welcome may i ask my noble friend the minister whether the statistics he has given include any estimate at all of the number of <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on the most promising announcement that he has made <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether the newspaper reports that one has read recently have been correct in mentioning the fife and forfar yeomanry as one of the regiments that will be recreated <e> <s> if i am right in that regard i should like to ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the lothians and border horse are another yeomanry regiment of the utmost excellence <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> with great humility and as no other than a layman may i just say a word because i have listened with the greatest care to what the noble and learned lord lord denning has said i have listened to what my noble friend lord renton has said and i have listened to what the noble lord lord mishcon has said from the opposition front bench i have also listened to what my noble friend lord galloway said <e> <s> it seems to me and i say this to the minister that their four speeches added up to <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of the original reply may i ask whether my noble friend has read in <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask my noble friend on the front bench to bear in mind that this matter merits some urgency <e> <s> at the present time there are a great many seals off the coasts of northern england and scotland and in particular at the mouth of the river tweed and the degree of damage done by them is highly unacceptable <e> <s> if we wait forever before we make up our minds the salmon stocks may be irrevocably damaged <e>"]
