["<cs> my lords first i should like sincerely to thank the minister for his kind remarks concerning myself <e> <s> i am pleased that my first duty as opposition spokesman on northern ireland affairs affords me the opportunity to offer my congratulations to the noble lord lord elton on his appointment as under-secretary of state for northern ireland <e> <s> the minister can be assured that he will have my support and i feel sure the general support of all in this house for those measures which are considered best to promote the goodwill peace and prosperity of the northern ireland people <e> <s> like his predecessor my noble friend lord melchett the minister has spent a lot of time in the province since his appointment and seems determined to get to know the people as well as the problems as quickly and as thoroughly as possible <e> <s> i feel sure that this is a wise and helpful approach <e> <s> i should like also to say that my noble friend lord melchett and his other ministerial colleagues of the previous government set a high standard of application which was respected and generally appreciated by all sections of the community throughout the province <e>", "<cs> my lords i would wish to thank the minister for the detailed comprehensive and explicit way in which he explained these two orders <e> <s> the orders are generally helpful to the people of northern ireland and bring the provisions concerning inheritance and tax-related matters into line with the provisions at present pertaining to england and wales <e> <s> we on this side of the house support the orders <e> <s> however i think that having stated my position for the present i would wish to qualify my support for the orders by placing on record my opposition to the capital transfer tax system as it applies to the united kingdom <e> <s> i realise that this is neither the time nor the occasion on which to press my views on this subject but i think that i should say that i believe that the capital transfer system is based on what is defined as the estate principle that is where the size of the gift or legacy is the only consideration in connection with the estate principle and transfer tax arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with my noble friend lord melchett in welcoming the very lucid and explicit way in which the noble viscount <e> <s> lord trenchard dealt with the redundancy payments schemes as provided for in these amendment orders <e> <s> i believe that the provisions of this scheme may help to alleviate some of the human problems arising from the long-term aspects of unemployment in harland and wolffs shipyard in belfast <e> <s> however as my noble friend lord melchett has indicated there is considerable concern among the staff and manual workers in various sections of harland and wolff about the operation of the present scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly welcome the order before the house and the interventions of my noble friends from this side <e> <s> i noted that in his remarks the minister mentioned that asbestosis would be included and i would welcome clarification of that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly agree with the noble lord lord auckland when he says that one of his regrets is that the order was not introduced much earlier <e> <s> some years ago this matter was debated at some length in this house and indeed in another place <e> <s> recorded in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for the way he has explained the details of these two orders <e> <s> on this side of the house we wish to declare that we concur with the remarks that he has made and will support the orders <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for explaining the effects of this order <e> <s> at the outset of my remarks i wish to indicate support for the proposed financial provisions contained in the order <e> <s> at the same time i must express regret that after almost seven years of the direct rule form of government over the affairs of the province we as a community have failed to achieve the establishment of a devolved assembly <e> <s> when i speak of a devolved assembly i mean a democratically elected devolved assembly with full vigorous positive and constructive participation by representatives of both parts of the northern ireland community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what methods were used to distribute that document and asking for the appropriate information to be sent back <e> <s> how wide was that distribution <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for repeating the statement to this house <e> <s> i have received a copy of it within the last few minutes <e> <s> as this is the first occasion since the summer recess on which there has been an opportunity to mention northern ireland affairs in this house i feel sure that all noble lords will wish to join with me in expressing our deep shock and grief at the tragic murder of lord mountbatten <e> <s> also i have great concern about the continuing senseless and vicious campaign of violence being perpetrated against the irish people both north and south <e> <s> our heartfelt sympathy is with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord lyell for his lucid and comprehensive explanation of this technical and complex bill <e> <s> i have had consultations with interested groups and individuals in northern ireland and i understand that the proposed legislation is in the best interests of the general public in northern ireland <e> <s> i welcome the fact which has already been stated by the noble lord that the bill will in no way detract from the manpower situation in the department of commerce and i understand that it considerably simplifies procedures in respect of insurance and general insurance policies <e> <s> therefore we wholeheartedly agree to the second reading of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the presentation and explanation of the measure before us <e> <s> in the present context of law-making for northern ireland we on this side of the house consider that the order is generally helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to join in expressing sincere appreciation to the noble lord from ulster lord dunleath for having initiated this important and indeed vital issue for debate in this house <e> <s> i also wish to applaud the reasoned thoughtful and generally fair way in which he presented the difficult emotional and tortuous political issues which inevitably arise in any discussion about the way forward for government in northern ireland <e> <s> i should of course have been disappointed had he done otherwise <e> <s> it has been my privilege to be associated with the noble lord lord dunleath over some years in matters and projects concerned with employment and industrial development and the problems of young people in northern ireland <e> <s> these matters have already been mentioned by the noble lord lord grey of naunton <e> <s> so i know something of his high standard of public service his commitment to cultural and economic progress in ireland and his approach to upholding human dignity in all aspects of living all of which are reflected in the objective way he had put forward proposals in this initiative <e>", "<cs> and the problems of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord lord elton for his explanatory statement as to what is proposed in this draft industrial assurance northern ireland order i wish to indicate support from this side of the house for it <e> <s> as it appears to me that the following two orders which the minister is about to introduce are based on the same principle of parity and consolidation i hope it will be in order and will help to expedite the business of the house if i indicate now in advance our support for the next two measures <e>", "<cs> my lords i must express gratefulness to the noble lord for the clear and concise way he has explained <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord indicate how long those figures have been higher <e> <s> at what stage did they become higher <e>", "<cs> my lords i should wish to join in thanking my noble friend lord underhill for initiating this important debate <e> <s> from a northern ireland viewpoint i should also like to compliment him on the objective and constructive way in which he dealt with the issues <e> <s> as he indicated in his opening remarks the noble lord is no stranger to northern ireland <e> <s> i have been pleased to be associated with him for over years in dealing with northern ireland affairs on industrial and political matters <e> <s> i know especially of his strong commitment and concern to improve the wellbeing the social development and the job prospects of our young people <e> <s> he rightly drew attention to the unhealthy situation which only at our peril can be dismissed as a situation of such a peculiar and local nature not relevant to the rest of the body politic <e> <s> some people would try to put it in that category <e>", "<cs> my lords according to my calculations we still have about half <e>", "<cs> my lords i will just finish with two matters <e> <s> first a plea for the linen hall library which this morning i indicated to the minister through his private secretary that i would raise together with a number of other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join the minister in his tribute to the security forces and particularly to the staff of the prison service who do a worthwhile honourable and very difficult job <e> <s> i also recognise that when this order was debated in another house yesterday it had some six hours of discussion spent on it <e> <s> i note the noble lords remarks concerning the human rights commission and lord plants role in that commission and i would support the order for approval for a six months period <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord elton for that brief explanation of the order and wish to indicate support for the proposed consolidating measure <e> <s> as i understand it the noble lord has indicated that the order does not make any change in the scope of the existing law in northern ireland in respect of the type of premises for which a licence may be granted for use as a theatre <e> <s> i take it therefore that the order does not place any additional legal or procedural impediment in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to compliment the noble duke the duke of abercorn on the reasoned and very comprehensive way in which he presented the various issues concerning the future of the health services in the omagh district <e> <s> the noble duke has rightly and fairly drawn the attention of this house to the great wave of public concern and anxiety about the western health and social services boards working party proposals to downgrade the tyrone county hospital and to close the omagh general hospital <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to interrupt the minister but i should like to thank him very much indeed for a very detailed and very helpful reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment <e> <s> i fully concur with the views expressed by noble lords opposite and by my noble friends on this side of the house concerning the operation of this clause <e> <s> it is my view that there is nothing in the provisions proposed in this clause that makes it possible for any question affecting a board to be dealt with more effectively than is possible through the existing provisions of the monopolies and mergers commission and the fair trading act and the way powers of investigation and control are available under the agricultural marketing act and the main reason why i rise to my feet the agricultural marketing northern ireland act because this provision will apply to northern ireland also <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that the present legislation for the protection and welfare of animals in northern ireland such as the cruelty to animals act which is over years old is sadly out-of-date and completely inadequate <e> <s> will he also not agree that there is an urgent need for a progressive review and revision of this legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the common sense and statesmanlike plan of the foreign and commonwealth secretary the noble lord lord carrington for a neutral afghanistan is receiving growing and worldwide support <e> <s> will he also agree that at the present time the carrington plan as it is being called provides greater hopes for resolving the real issues concerned than any increased pressure for a boycott of the olympic games <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that that position was known years and years ago <e> <s> the propaganda aspect of this is nothing new <e> <s> the new aspect of this is the afghanistan position and surely we ought to be backing the foreign secretary in his proposals <e> <s> is that not the contradiction in the whole thing <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that in the difficult climate of northern ireland another spark of life has been dimmed by these cuts forced on the bbc <e> <s> will the minister use his good offices and influence with his northern ireland ministerial colleagues to encourage efforts to retain the bbc northern ireland orchestra in suitable alternative musical employment in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord lord elton for his explanatory outline of this order <e> <s> in my opinion the order is a very important one in the context of the social and economic affairs of northern ireland and concerning the governments proposals for the requisite financial provisions <e> <s> this order is being debated today as the minister said in another place so perhaps under the vote for class xi that is a northern ireland assembly page of the order it may be an appropriate time for me to say that i very <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a consolidating measure <e> <s> i think it is appropriate that i should mention that there has been a tremendous improvement in the general court procedures in northern ireland <e> <s> this has generally helped in the smoother and more efficient running of the courts and i have pleasure in supporting the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount lord long for the way in which he has given an explanation of these two orders <e> <s> of course i readily agree that they be taken together for the convenience of the house <e> <s> i very much welcome the noble viscounts general remarks concerning the industry <e> <s> the shipbuilding industry is going through a very serious situation as regards employment indeed no one would know more about that than the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal who is sitting beside the noble viscount who met a delegation from harland and wolff last week <e> <s> it is something about which i should like to speak to him at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down would he not agree that his reference to the wage-bargaining role of trade union officials was partisan and narrow <e> <s> would he not also agree that wage bargaining can be positive and dynamic and that it can contribute to pushing forward the frontiers of productive investment technological innovation and real wealth creation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for the very concise and lucid way in which he has explained the provisions of this consolidation bill <e> <s> as well as the matters concerning criminal appeal i understand that this bill completes the principal provisions of the judicature northern ireland act which has effected the much-needed modernisation of the courts and the related procedures in northern ireland <e> <s> this in turn has led to the more efficient working of the courts and the availability of justice <e> <s> this consolidation bill is warmly welcomed by this side of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord elton for his very comprehensive explanation of the two orders <e> <s> there is no doubt that the new provisions which are contained in the main order are long overdue and in the context of business and commercial life in northern ireland should have a most useful and beneficial effect <e> <s> the order greatly assists in tidying up the law governing bankruptcy matters making it more simple to understand <e> <s> i accept that this amending order brings the legislation in northern ireland considerably into line with similar legislation in great britain <e> <s> however there are three points which i hope the minister will be able to clarify <e>", "<cs> my lords i again wish to thank the noble lord lord elton for his explanation of this order <e> <s> i should like also to indicate that the measure has a warm welcome from this side of the house and indeed i think it will be well received by the northern ireland community <e> <s> i believe that the order helps considerably so far as law can to ease hardship and to lessen strain and anxiety <e>", "<cs> i was a little happier with the latter part of the statement made by the noble lord the minister that reports of the commission would be lodged in the library <e> <s> that would be an easement of the situation <e> <s> but he has repeated a number of the matters that were mentioned in the other place <e> <s> his use of the terms that this is political and an erosion of the constitutional situation is completely out of keeping with the whole tenor of the remarks i made <e> <s> indeed what i say is that what is put down in this bill is an erosion of the situation <e> <s> if orders instead of having an affirmative resolution by which they can be debated in both houses are relegated to a negative resolution then that is an erosion of the rights and duties and democratic procedures relating to northern ireland <e> <s> that is what i and other persons are worried about when we see this legislation in its present form <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for his explanation of the commons amendments nos <e> <s> to and i readily accept the manner in which he proposes to deal with them <e> <s> i take this opportunity to speak in general terms to the commons amendments and say that i readily accept them subject to one or two matters on which i may ask for explanations <e> <s> nevertheless there are some aspects of the eec requirements which i consider impose on the united kingdom a compliance with impracticable uniformity <e> <s> i am glad to see that the measures we are considering today are more in keeping with the ideals of a useful and helpful harmonisation <e> <s> i believe that the proposals contained in the amendments should enable northern ireland interests to be dealt with effectively in the changed eec circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to express thanks to the noble earl the minister for his very comprehensive and lucid explanation of this order <e> <s> as the minister has said the proposals contained in the order have already been given detailed consideration and approval by the engineering industry training board the manpower services commission and by relevant employers associations <e> <s> the order has also been scrutinised by the joint committee on statutory instruments <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for that very helpful reply <e> <s> is he aware that in the ulster year book annual statistics which are most useful to commercial and industrial interests throughout the world no reference has been made recently to the functions and the role of the ulster office and will he seek to repair this particular misrepresentation of the position <e> <s> will he not also agree that this is disconcerting to those who have been using the excellent facilities of this office and also that it is demoralising to the staff <e>", "<cs> my lords may i express thanks to the noble lord lord elton for his explanation of this draft order <e> <s> as the minister has indicated the order is a more helpful revised draft of an earlier draft proposal <e> <s> i warmly welcome the provisions contained in the order which i believe have the general support of the incorporated law society of northern ireland and other interested bodies <e> <s> as the noble lord has indicated the order makes for a number of improvements in the administration of criminal <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for a very helpful reply <e> <s> would the noble lord not agree that there is an urgent need in northern ireland for the establishment of a farm animal welfare council similar to the body set up by the government in july for england scotland and wales and if not a separate northern ireland council perhaps there could be representatives from northern ireland on the existing council <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may ask one further question is the noble lord aware that the ulster society for the prevention of cruelty to animals has already made public the difficulties they are having in pursuing in the northern ireland courts cases of alleged cruelty to animals <e> <s> at the same time i welcome the approach that the noble lord has made <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether it is not a fact that the feed grain levy abatement which currently applies to italy will not be phased out until the end of <e> <s> as northern ireland is recognised as one of the less favoured regions of the eec would the minister not agree to use his influence and indeed his good offices to ensure that the province is given the same assistance as italy in respect of this feed grain so as to enable the livestock producers in the province to overcome this unfair competitive handicap <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that there is a considerable amount of discussion and talk around this report <e> <s> is there not a possibility that this penetrating and useful social survey may be relegated to nothing more than talk and indeed a depressing statistical exercise <e> <s> may i ask the minister is there not a tendency to over-concentrate on the relief of poverty and unemployment rather than to take suitable action to prevent these social evils and problems <e> <s> while i wholeheartedly welcome the governments support for the general publication of the report may i ask the minister whether he would not agree that there is a need for some form of concerted action generated by the government in order to tackle the proposals arising out of this report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for progressing this consolidating measure <e> <s> we have noted the tenth report of the joint committee on consolidated bills which considered this particular bill <e> <s> i also wish to compliment all concerned with this consolidating measure and warmly to welcome the considerable amount of work which has been undertaken to repeal the obsolete spent unnecessary and superseded legislation which according to my count covers separate acts dating back as far as the gaming act <e> <s> we warmly welcome and support the legislation now before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the noble lord the minister will not be too surprised if i compliment the northern ireland ministers on the expeditious way they have pursued the investment of american capital in northern ireland and on the effective way they have built upon the groundwork done and the seeds sown by the previous labour administration <e> <s> would he agree that the major factors attracting productive investment from <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord the minister for repeating the statement to this house <e> <s> the statement is indeed a very critical stage of the governments initiative to deal with the constitutional problems involved in the transfer of responsibility and the transfer of powers within the united kingdom <e> <s> but i must honestly say that i am disappointed at the statements flimsiness and general lack of content <e> <s> i had expected more from it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of a letter dated th june from the secretary general of the european parliament indicating to the northern ireland gas committee support for the northern ireland gas pipeline from the president of the european parliament from the council of the european communities and from three of the major specialist committees <e> <s> if a successful application were made a grant of something like per cent <e> <s> would be available <e> <s> may i ask the noble lord whether the government have submitted a proposal about the northern ireland gas pipeline to the council of the european communities or whether they intend to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords can i have an assurance from the minister that he will give urgent consideration to this particular letter and submission from the ecc <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether he is aware of the dismay the disappointment and even the discouragement that his words will have throughout the whole of northern ireland in respect of this matter <e> <s> may i ask whether he is fully aware of the significance of the chairman of the sports councils tribute to the members of the sports council for their achievements and inspiring contribution to sport and also his remarks concerning the director and staff when he said that their selfless dedication and enthusiasm was to be admired <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to the speakers in this debate and i am very much aware of the breadth of experience the deep concern and the earnest efforts that they have brought to bear on the difficult search for peaceful lasting and just solutions to our northern ireland problems <e> <s> as a comparative new member on our opposition front bench i hope that i do not in any way appear patronising if i say that the speeches today have been both responsible and helpful <e> <s> i should wish to follow in that positive way for i am convinced that the influence of this house is considerable in many respects in regard to many of the matters raised here today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether he is aware that the low pay unit pamphlet recommends a number of matters that the government could usefully implement to help those caught in the poverty trap and the low pay bracket <e> <s> is he aware that one-third of full-time workers in northern ireland are paid less than the recognised living wage and that compared with the united kingdom six times as many families in northern ireland rely on family income supplement <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that to cite that there are persons with higher earnings in northern ireland does not really touch the problem that i have raised <e> <s> the problem is that there are six times as many people in northern ireland as there are in great britain who are caught in the poverty trap <e> <s> will the noble lord not agree that there are ways in which the government could alleviate the position particularly in relation to school meals and school uniforms of persons who are caught in this trap as regards the cutoff rate and the incomes of which they are in receipt <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that it would be remiss of me if i did not take this opportunity to express from this side <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take this opportunity to thank the noble lord lord elton for the comprehensive statement on this appropriation order <e> <s> certainly i agree with a number of points that he has raised particularly in respect to education but i do not intend to go down the lengthy road that he has pursued in connection with education <e> <s> i think that is a matter for another day dealing with educational policy <e> <s> i think that today we are concerned with the industrial development of the province and the votes for monies to maintain that development <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to be as brief as possible <e> <s> it is the class viii vote item and the page number in the estimates is viii capital expenditure entailed by educational and library boards for youth services <e> <s> that has been considerably cut from to <e> <s> these are education and library boards dealing with local areas and with the needs in some small rural and development areas <e> <s> i should have thought that certainly capital development in this area was most essential <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for the warm way in which he has paid tribute to the security forces and to the police in northern ireland in his remarks in introducing the order <e> <s> without any reservation i wholeheartedly join with him in what he said regarding the security personnel as well as the industrial security personnel who do a terrific job <e> <s> i am sure that we all join with the noble lord in recognising the terrible strain imposed on the families of prison officers and members of the security forces who behind the scenes experience much suffering in trying to keep up morale <e>", "<cs> my lords i simply wish to thank the noble lord for the detailed explanation of the order which was discussed at some length in another place on th july <e> <s> if i may anticipate his introduction of the private streets <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indeed given the house a very comprehensive and detailed explanation of this order <e> <s> what he has stated underscores the numerous points made in a very helpful explanatory document issued some six weeks ago by the department of health and social service for northern ireland <e> <s> the noble lords statement confirms a very important point made in the explanatory document namely that the order enacts the first stage of a major reform of the supplementary benefits scheme and i would emphasise the words major reform <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that there is considerable public confusion about the no <e> <s> act and the no <e> <s> act in so far as attempts were made to amend the no <e> <s> act even before it was on the statute book <e>

tribunals and tribunal chairmen of the implications of the act which will be implemented in november <e> <s> have the government attempted in any way to contact the or so tribunal chairmen and representatives in northern ireland with information about the way in which this act will be administered and implemented <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am bitterly disappointed that there was not a much more ready response to the representations which have been made by various bodies <e> <s> the weight of that evidence indicates that there is serious concern in northern ireland about whether one person sitting on an advisory body over here for one day a month can bring forward views and opinions <e> <s> how is that person going to have those views translated to him over the water and back again <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the treatment of offenders northern ireland order considerably improves the situation in northern ireland <e> <s> i understand it to be somewhat in advance of the situation over here <e> <s> therefore i wish it well <e> <s> i hope that these young offenders centres will contribute towards making reformed and good citizens in northern ireland <e> <s> therefore the order has my approval <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that it would be to the mutual advantage of both the united kingdom and the irish republic if there were this suggested wider coverage of weather reporting throughout these islands <e> <s> does he not also agree that it is largely a question of agreement between the meteorological offices of the united kingdom and of the republic <e> <s> and as i think he has already to some degree offered will he use his good offices to bring about appropriate consultations about the wider coverage of weather reporting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to ask her majestys government the question of which i have given private notice <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that reply may i ask whether it is not a fact that the privy council met last evening and in an order-in-council put into operation certain implications arising from the action taken by prison officers in northern ireland <e> <s> whatever terms may be used to describe it is it not a fact that the grievance or dispute call it sympathetic action or whatever that is there at the moment is <e>", "<cs> my lords may i plead with the minister again <e> <s> may i ask him to consider the fire from the prevention point of view rather than from the salvage point of view <e> <s> would it not be ironic if as is possible this dispute was to be resolved in england and wales and for its side effects to continue in northern ireland for want of having some third-party communications and involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord for his clear explanation of the terms on which this order was urgently introduced and of the unusual way in which the order came into operation on th october <e> <s> he has given a detailed explanation of the reasons for the introduction of the order and the way it is proposed to operate it and in general terms i understand it to be such <e>", "<cs> my lords it gives me pleasure to join with other noble lords who have paid tribute to our two maiden speakers for their very interesting and useful contributions to this important debate today <e> <s> it is with a sense of sheer disappointment that i welcome the repetition once again in the gracious speech that her majestys government <e>", "<cs>

of years <e> <s> it brings into consolidation years of legislation which i agree with him will be welcomed by the general public and by housing practitioners alike <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity to congratulate all those who have contributed to the completion of the task which was initiated by the last administration <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house we formally welcome the order as a very useful piece of legislation and support its approval <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for the way he introduced the order and explained it in considerable detail <e> <s> i was pleased to hear the helpful remarks that he made about some of the governments intentions concerning nursery education <e> <s> the noble lord has already indicated that he is aware of the widespread concern that has been expressed in northern ireland about the proposal in article of the order <e> <s> i consider it difficult to reconcile what the minister has said with what is contained in the order <e> <s> i am not alone in that <e> <s> the minister will be aware that education and library boards have expressed great concern about it and parent associations the trade unions and in particular the irish national teachers organisation have all expressed opposition to the order especially article relating to nursery schools <e>", "<cs> my lords as noble and learned lords have mentioned the arguments both for and against a bill of rights in the united kingdom have already been heard on many occasions in this house <e> <s> for a number of reasons but especially because we are an unelected chamber i hope that on this occasion the bill of the noble lord lord wade may have an opportunity of a wide vigorous and informed debate by the elected members in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord elton for his detailed breakdown of the financial elements in this appropriation order <e> <s> i should also like to say that i am grateful for the arrangements making available the explanatory memorandum <e> <s> i found it most helpful <e> <s> while this is the third order in the annual cycle of orders to appropriate funds for services which are supplied to northern ireland and administered by northern ireland departments it gives this house an opportunity to deal with the wider economic and social aspects of life in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his helpful and considered explanation of this emergency provisions continuance order i would wish to repeat my support for the bipartisan approach to security matters in northern ireland <e> <s> i join with the noble lord in his tribute to the security forces and their work in northern ireland <e> <s> i think it will be accepted that i am a frequent and indeed persistent critic of the governments economic and social policies which as has been stated earlier this evening in this house are having profound effects on northern ireland but i feel i would be untrue to myself and indeed to the people of northern ireland if i engaged in nit-picking or a kind of mealy-mouthed support for the government in any sincere attempts to deal with a very serious and potentially disastrous situation at present existing in the province <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that this house shares with my noble friend lord brockway his deep concern about the dire consequences of the decision of the hunger strikers to reject the personal plea of cardinal tomas ofiaich and the government and others to end their fast

and private discussions with the leader of the opposition and the leader of the liberal party in another place about the immediate issues arising from this hunger strike as it affects the people of

committee on consolidation bills refers to this and to the following two draft orders before us today and that the joint committee duly considered this and the other orders <e> <s> i have also made appropriate inquiries from the law society for northern ireland a body which in my view does excellent work in scrutinising and considering legislation and orders affecting northern ireland and i

consequential amendments order <e> <s> i therefore wish to indicate support for this order and if it be convenient to the house also for the remaining northern ireland orders before us today <e>",

lord wade on this i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his explanation of the draft amendment order <e> <s> though he said that the amendments made by the order are minor they are far-reaching in many respects and i think that in general they are welcomed within the fishing industry <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity to congratulate the noble lord lord elton upon the extension of his ministerial duties in the northern ireland office <e> <s> in addition to his department of education brief he now has direct responsibility for the department of agriculture which embraces the fisheries that we are discussing this evening <e> <s> i know that the noble lord will find the northern ireland farming community as well as those engaged

the wellbeing and prosperity of these industries <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house agree with the principle involved in taking care of inflation <e> <s> the one question i would ask is is the order consistent with the regulations governing the expenses for local government elections in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e>

noble lord lord campbell of croy when he invited the minister to consider the position of northern ireland in this respect <e> <s> i have not had the opportunity to consult about the legal technicalities which may arise from this clause <e> <s> if the noble baroness lady young can be satisfied that this meets the requirements and procedural arrangements in the northern ireland act then

side of the water <e>", "<cs> my lords as other members of your lordships house have indicated the bill we are debating is a comparatively short one but as the noble lord the minister has already said there can be no doubt that the measures proposed in the bill loom large in their importance as political issues <e> <s> certainly the bill raises serious matters concerning our electoral system and about the principles governing parliamentary representation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his detailed explanation of this order <e> <s> he has gone to considerable length in explaining it and i think in total it means that the road services licensing laws the public service road passenger licensing laws and the insurance coverage as they are at present in great britain now apply to bring northern ireland into parity with the arrangements <e> <s> my understanding is that in many ways the order regularises and legalises the private motoring practices which have been in existence for some time <e> <s> these private travel arrangements enable friends neighbours and work colleagues to save money in the course of travel to their mutual advantage and convenience <e>",

political implications of this draft order i wish to say that regrettably and as the noble lord lord elton has already mentioned we are again discussing today these sensitive northern ireland issues

situations one should temper words with responsible understanding and compassion <e> <s> i am certain that today is one of those occasions when without sacrificing reason and frankness noble lords will join with me in exercising even greater care and restraint in the choice of comment about the business before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord elton for his very explicit introduction of this order <e> <s> while i paid tribute earlier to the security forces i join him again on this occasion in the warm tribute which he has paid to all the security forces in northern ireland and in his support from the box for their families and relatives <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down has he not made a case for the need for an inquiry <e> <s> there is a need

box but i am aware that other noble lords made arrangements to leave at a certain time when it was realised that it was in the dinner break when there is normally an hour allocated to discussion <e>

so widely expressed throughout these islands concerning the tragic death of mr kenneth howorth in the course of his services in protecting the lives and property of peace-loving citizens <e> <s> as the recent bombing instances have been associated in the public mind with ireland and with the irish people may i as an irishman say that i utterly deplore and condemn the methods and acts of terrorism and murder being perpetrated in britain in northern ireland and in the republic in the name of irish patriotism and the irish people <e> <s> i feel sure that noble lords will be fully aware that the vast majority the millions of irish people in ulster in the republic and those who have made their homes here in britain are ashamed and saddened by such vile acts acts which seriously impair the solutions to the problems confronting the people of ireland and add great difficulties to the hardships of the irish people <e>", "<cs> my lords in the solemnity of this house i rise to share with the noble baroness the leader of the house in this tribute to the memory of the mp for south belfast robert bradford and with the expressions of sympathy with his family concerning his brutal assassination <e> <s> today is yet another day of darkness and grief in ulster but i am very conscious that any words of mine here today will fail to express the terrible sense of outrage fear and

evening that there must be community commitment and determined action but such action must not be violent nor indiscriminate it must be within the law and in accordance with representative parliamentary democracy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble earl whether he has noted that since his appointment as a minister of state for northern ireland this is my first opportunity to face him across the floor of the house <e> <s> will the noble earl the minister accept that this side of the house sincerely appreciates and understands the acute and testing difficulties of his new position and his parliamentary brief <e> <s> may i further ask the minister whether he is aware of the great concern among community organisations about the financial aspects of the action for community employment scheme and whether he will consider the position so as to allow some flexibility to enable community organisations as well as statutory bodies and local government bodies to compete in the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl the minister for his very comprehensive and helpful outline of the draft order <e> <s> i also wish to thank the

forces in northern ireland and in his words of sympathy for those who have suffered through bereavement and injury caused by terrorism during the six months since we last debated these emergency provisions <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who live in northern ireland will perhaps more than most readily appreciate the sensitivity of the unstarred question tabled today by the noble lord lord moyola <e> <s> the question about the future government of northern ireland is of crucial importance and one that is uppermost in the minds of responsible citizens of northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his explanation of this order <e> <s> the house will know that the order was debated in another place last tuesday th january and as the minister will be aware of the

those areas of belfast <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give the house details of mobile and other units which are available in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to share with other noble lords the serious concerns which they have expressed about this breakdown of agreed law-enforcement procedures between the two sovereign governments namely the united kingdom government and the government of the republic of ireland <e> <s> we have heard the statement of her majestys government and the position that they have taken about the incident <e>", "<cs> i earnestly appeal to the noble viscount to do that <e> <s> i feel it was made in the heat of the moment and in a facetious manner <e> <s> i hope he will withdraw the remark <e>", "<cs> i beg the indulgence of the committee <e> <s> i invite the minister to help me with clause <e> <s> as other noble lords have been approached and lobbied by various people and organisations with interests in this bill one of the matters raised with me has been the governments proposal to increase from one to two the number of photographs required to be submitted by applicants for firearms and shotgun certificates <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the minister for accepting the suggested changes to this clause made at the committee stage <e> <s> i feel sure that the proposed amendment will not add untoward difficulties nor additional expense to applicants for firearms and shotgun certificates <e> <s> however the proposed amendment should provide for the more helpful control and administration of firearms <e> <s> the manner in which it is now contained in the bill should allow that procedure to be implemented where necessary and in a particular way <e> <s> i support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to indicate my support for the remarks and the points made by my noble friend lord prys-davies in his approach to this order <e> <s> there are a few specific points on the order on which i should like the minister to reply <e> <s> however in passing i wish to point out that i was unable to inform the minister in advance about the points i wish to make because of the short notice given for this debate <e> <s> indeed in this connection i wish to register my dissatisfaction at this short notice <e> <s> one sitting days notice to the members of this house for a debate on important legislation dealing with northern ireland issues is a blatant denial of any semblance of parliamentary democratic procedure <e>", "<cs> my lords in case it appears wrongly in the record i did say was to be the amount that probably would be handed over from health and social services to the housing executive <e> <s> i said that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to join in expressing my warmest thanks to my noble friend lady turner for initiating this important debate and also to say that i welcome the reasoned manner in which she presented the case for short brothers <e> <s> at the same time i hope that it will not be considered presumptuous of me from these back-benches also to thank noble lords who have already taken part in this debate and those who are to take part <e> <s> what i have heard have been very reasoned and constructive approaches to the problems of shorts and harland and wolff <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale for initiating this important and timely debate <e> <s> i also wish to express my appreciation of the work of the select committee which produced a constructive and challenging report <e> <s> as the noble lord lord allen has indicated the report and this debate have generated considerable interest in northern ireland among organisations and those directly concerned with the needs of the disabled <e> <s> in that connection i have noted in particular the cogent opinion of the select committee contained in paragraph of the report <e> <s> it clearly underscores matters relayed to me by the northern ireland council on disability nicd <e> <s> it encountered serious difficulties arising from the general lack of awareness and the ineffective communications concerning the ecs action for disabled people especially in respect of projects directed towards the promotion of integration <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the very forceful and topical speech made by the noble earl lord lauderdale on the very burning issues of energy <e> <s> i shall attempt some reference to other speeches made during these four days of debate on the proposed legislative programme <e> <s> in my opinion speeches have been direct and challenging <e> <s> some noble lords have expressed concern about the absence of parliamentary measures to provide for the future well-being and prosperity of the people and the good government of this united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to conform with the conventions of the house on statements of this kind and so i shall put my points quickly <e> <s> concern has been expressed about the unemployment that will arise in shipbuilding in the north-east <e> <s> that is a tragedy <e> <s> however the question is much wider <e> <s> the governments policy has allowed shipyard after shipyard to drift on to the rocks <e> <s> it has allowed more than that <e> <s> the government are sinking them before they have had an opportunity to be saved <e> <s> i cannot see how they can separate the shipbuilding industry of the united kingdom an island community from the shipping industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to what the noble lord lord orr-ewing said <e> <s> he mentioned some challenging and fresh points in the debate <e> <s> when the legislative stage of these proposals comes forward and if he speaks with the same tone and the same mind i feel sure that i shall be sharing the lobby with him particularly in relation to franchising <e>", "<cs> my lords i too was a member of the select committee appointed to consider the matters under the principal order <e> <s> i rise to support the approval of the orders now before the house and warmly to concur with the remarks so ably made by the noble and learned lord lord brightman <e> <s> i should also like to say that i welcome the critical and forthright way and i believe helpful way in which my noble friend the opposition spokesman lord dean of beswick dealt with the issues of urban development areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it somewhat daunting to follow the noble lord lord hunter of newington and other noble lords who have spoken in this debate who are so widely experienced and knowledgeable in the matters we are considering <e> <s> the complexity of the subject and the solutions have been mentioned by all noble lords who have spoken <e> <s> i will not resist the temptation to expand this debate into the wider critical issues as regards the present and future state of the national health service <e> <s> in my opinion the issues that we are debating today are closely related to the basic reasons for this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the informed and challenging speeches of noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> the general thrust of the arguments has prompted me to think in global terms about environmental control <e> <s> i am reminded of the lines of the poet john donne which i shall paraphrase no person is an island entire of oneself <e> <s> every person is a piece of this world a part of this universe <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to apologise to the house for not being in my place when the minister rose to speak <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord lord lyell for his reasoned introduction of the bill into this house and for circulating yesterday the helpful notes on clauses <e> <s> i should also like to thank my noble friend lord prys-davies and other noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> their speeches have been thoughtful and sensitive about the awkward and critical issues that arise from this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for outlining the details of this order to the house <e> <s> i also thank my noble friend lord prys-davies for his usual analytical and very thorough examination of the matters before us <e> <s> i believe that he has covered most of the points that i would wish to have dealt with <e> <s> in welcoming and supporting the order perhaps i may use shipbuilders jargon <e> <s> the legislation has been a long time on the stocks <e> <s> the order is a very modest piece of legislative change <e> <s> perhaps the minister can explain why it has taken such a lengthy period to produce such a simple advisory measure <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords in this house i am not a public representative in the elected sense but the laganside corporation project has given rise to more representations and correspondence to me than i have received on any other matter with which i have dealt over almost the last years <e> <s> i am sure that the minister with his experience in his ministerial duties and in northern ireland will agree that the order we have just debated and approved as well as this order embrace very important community factors in the province <e> <s> they both deal with matters concerning active community involvement <e> <s> my noble friend lord prys-davies has already mentioned democratic processes and the nature of community participation in schemes of this nature <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend <e> <s> he has argued the case for the amendment very forcefully and logically as he did with the previous amendments <e> <s> i get the impression and i am sure that other members of the committee also have the impression that the minister is labouring under great difficulty in relation not only to the principles of the bill but also to how it will be implemented <e> <s> he said that clause is very complicated <e> <s> the bill itself is complicated and flawed as my noble friend has already mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in commending my noble friend lady turner on initiating this timely and important debate <e> <s> i wish also to compliment my noble friend on the excellently argued and challenging opening speech that she made <e> <s> i listened with interest to the forthright remarks of other noble lords who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i am almost tempted to follow the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in dealing with aspects of the donovan report that are included in this white paper but i propose that my remarks will be solely directed to the white paper as it stands <e>", "<cs> the minister has given a clear full and historical analysis <e> <s> perhaps however he can clear up one matter <e> <s> i do not think it was intentional but he said that there was no parole in northern ireland <e> <s> there is an effective probation board in northern ireland that does parole work in the normal form as practised throughout england scotland and wales <e> <s> the parole system cannot be effective in the paramilitary situation <e> <s> that is the point i should like to have cleared up <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must go back to what the bill originally attempted to achieve namely to bring about the democratic processes of representation in local government in northern ireland <e> <s> for a number of years sadly the situation has deteriorated deplorably <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment for the reason of ambiguity but also because in my view the sub-paragraph is seriously flawed in the sense that it gives a reasoned purpose and objectivity to terrorism hat is without foundation in principle <e> <s> no terrorism that i am aware of in northern ireland is designed for political purposes <e> <s> it is designed for genocide hatred and sectarian reasons <e> <s> you give terrorism a sense of purpose or political objectivity as is understood by the phrase for political ends <e> <s> will the minister please explain to me what the political ends are <e> <s> i am in agreement that the sub-paragraph should be amended accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords as no university courses in veterinary education are available in northern ireland is the minister aware of the acute consequences for the northern ireland veterinary students competing for places in great britain if this proposed closure of the university of glasgow veterinary school takes place <e> <s> is the minister further aware that about northern ireland students obtain places at the glasgow university veterinary school which is considered more suitable to the veterinary training needs of northern ireland as regards students travel financial arrangements and other arrangements <e> <s> will the minister give his earnest attention to this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it is not presumptuous of me to rise as a citizen of northern ireland to thank noble lords from all sides of the house who have taken an active interest in this bill <e> <s> together with other noble lords i have tried to amend and approve the proposed measures with a view to making the legislation practical and realistic in order to achieve the political objectives that the government proclaim that the bill is intended to have <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank all noble lords who have taken part for their kind words <e> <s> i am only the carrier of good tidings <e> <s> the bill is the result of the rev <e> <s> martin smyths success in the ballot <e> <s> he chose the subject <e> <s> he will be pleased to hear the pleasant remarks that have been made in the house <e> <s> we are delighted to know that the bill is supported <e> <s> we shall be looking anxiously for its implementation <e> <s> we shall have further pleasure from that <e>", "<cs> my lords does the question imply that there are restrictions on approaches to the secretary of state and that formal approaches should be made only by appointed members of political parties <e> <s> alternatively is the suggestion that avenues are open to anyone who has views to express on the social and economic issues pertaining to northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e> <s> therefore unless any noble lord objects i beg to move that the order of commitment be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i wish to take this opportunity to <e>", "<cs> my lords when i spoke in the debate on homelessness in january i dealt specifically with the crucial issues of homelessness in northern ireland <e> <s> sadly i must say this evening that none of those issues has yet eased <e> <s> if anything the problems of homelessness in northern ireland have increased and the issues have become even more acute <e> <s> a commissioned study reported earlier this year that by over families will be annually designated as homeless in northern ireland but only of them will qualify for accommodation under the provisions of the northern ireland housing order <e>", "<cs> my lords some weeks ago i heard a prominent irish historian say that northern ireland has a problem for every answer <e> <s> whatever the essence of truth contained in that ironic remark there can be no doubt that while the legislative proposals in the bill may be the governments genuine answer to the blatant and proven needs for fair employment measures in the province it has certainly produced many serious and challenging problems for the government and the <e>", "<cs> i rise at this stage to ask the ministers help in connection with the bill <e> <s> i welcome the inclusion in the bill of clause which contains the phrase promoting affirmative action <e> <s> that is an amendment to the fair employment northern ireland act <e> <s> in his second reading speech the minister said that the bill was a complex and comprehensive piece of legislation indeed he went on to say that it was one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation to be put before the house <e> <s> i think that he meant that in terms of northern ireland <e> <s> certainly the amount of consultation and discussion that has been devoted to the bill in <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for that explanation <e> <s> however i think that in the process of it we have lost the essence of the issue which i raised namely the writing into the bill of the obligation of the fair employment commission to keep its work under review and to suggest to the secretary of state any necessary reforms <e> <s> that would normally appear under the general duties imposed on any particular body at the commencement of the bill <e> <s> i fail to see it in any part of the bill either buried in the general text or elsewhere <e>", "<cs> yes i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for the manner in which he has dealt with my amendment <e> <s> i shall read what he has said with great care <e> <s> i also thank the principal deputy chairman of committees for her help <e> <s> in my enthusiasm to get ahead with the bill i jumped two hurdles at once <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the minister and to the noble viscount <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord lord mottistone informed the chief whip that i had undertaken to move the amendment <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> two amendments in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone are included in that grouping <e> <s> i believe that we have overcome the earlier misunderstanding concerning my speaking to amendments on behalf of the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> as i understand it when amendments are left they become the property of the committee and that resolves the situation <e> <s> i thank the deputy chairman for her help and i am sorry to add to her burdens <e>", "<cs> the minister will be aware that out of all the various aspects of the bill this provision on employment by religious bodies has given rise to more controversy and perhaps more misunderstanding than any other part of the bill <e> <s> i think it is important at this stage that we should do something to clear up the bills intention in this regard <e> <s> i shall attempt to give what i consider are the arguments being presented in northern ireland and to express the feeling of unhappiness that exists among many religious bodies in connection with this bill <e>", "<cs> can i have a commitment from the minister that he will listen to what i have said and come back at report stage <e> <s> he has given me no commitment whatsoever <e>", "<cs> i made some very pointed remarks about the government having representations made to them by the churches <e> <s> the letter indicated that there was still confusion in some areas about the application of the act <e> <s> i would welcome some indication from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i believe that we should stop for a moment and examine what we are attempting to do here <e> <s> we are dealing with clause which states <e>", "<cs> i shall speak to amendment no <e> <s> with particular reference to clause which concerns the confidentiality of monitoring information <e> <s> i should be grateful if the minister will assure me that the bill imposes some duty upon employers as regards the confidentiality of this monitoring information <e> <s> my view is that there is a lack of responsibility on employers to maintain a register of all the persons employed by them and as regards dealing with the information compiled and its transmission <e> <s> the situation is left open to the excuse that the liability for someone obtaining employment through some under-the-counter or backdoor method should be on the employer <e> <s> only certain members of the staff or personnel involved should have access to the records and to the correspondence that is required by this part of the bill <e> <s> i hope the minister will consider the views i am expressing <e> <s> i hope he can help me by indicating how this matter will be regulated as regards the law and the courts and as regards the obligations to employees in particular instances <e>", "<cs> i thank particularly my noble friend on the front bench for his remarks and the points he made <e> <s> i am not convinced that he has got the real meaning of my intent in tabling the amendment <e> <s> i believe that the minister has dealt with it in a manner which is not helpful to the general need of the northern ireland community <e> <s> there are areas where training employment and reinvestment are all required <e> <s> if people are to be treated purely in terms of catholic or protestant blocs then we are in for more trouble than we have ever envisaged <e> <s> i propose to return to this matter at another time <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise in support of what the noble lords have just said <e> <s> the minister may demur but i have an obligation to people in northern ireland <e> <s> perhaps i may say that when he opened the debate on second reading the noble lord himself said that this was a most complex bill <e> <s> i find no fault with the noble lord but personally i am in an awful dilemma and i know that other members of your lordships house share that dilemma in that we wish to give our full support to the bill <e> <s> we think it enshrines an important principle <e> <s> we have supported the secretary of state for northern ireland in the principles that he has announced on the bill <e> <s> we felt that by participating in it we could improve it and at least let the people in northern ireland see that we were paying attention to this crucial piece of legislation that is before this house <e> <s> we have not had that opportunity and that is what i am protesting about <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to comment on one of the matters that the minister has explained namely that the legislation is under the direct rule arrangements <e> <s> the standing advisory commission was set up under a bill from the westminster parliament <e> <s> while the minister has explained some of the constitutional problems arising out of that he went on to infer that in the house there was some severe criticism of the department and other departments of the northern ireland parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected <e> <s> however on other occasions i have heard the minister respond by leave of the house and i expected that he would do so on this occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord repeat the reply that he gave to my noble friend lord prys-davies <e> <s> did he say that the regulations will contain some reference to the manner in which the applications will be tabulated or will there be directions to employers for written and casual applications <e> <s> this is important to the way applications are made for employment in northern ireland and throughout the whole of the united kingdom <e> <s> however as the bill applies to northern ireland it is important that the regulations should be clear and amenable both to employers and to those seeking employment <e>", "<cs> my lords the essence of this amendment was dealt with on report and in earlier parts of the debate on this bill <e> <s> it has been very ably moved by the noble lord lord bonham-carter and supported by my noble friend lord prys-davies <e> <s> there is little i would wish to add to the arguments that have been presented other than to stress what has already been mentioned <e> <s> living in northern ireland i know only too well the difficulties of implementing this provision <e> <s> in so far as it is humanly possible with my capabilities i have tried to put myself in the position of a secretary of state <e> <s> i would welcome this provision because i think the secretary of state and his ministerial colleagues are under a constant siege <e> <s> i believe this provision adds protection to the decisions of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords when the minister introduced the bill on th june he claimed that it was the most comprehensive and incisive piece of legislation ever placed before the house <e> <s> after some hours of debate i would describe the bill somewhat differently <e> <s> i consider it as others have already said to be complex tortuous and unclear on a number of important definitive legal and administrative matters <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord prys-davies has as usual dealt thoroughly and ably with the contents of this amending order <e> <s> i fully support the views he has expressed from the opposition front bench <e> <s> i welcome the ministers statement of concern about under-age drinking in northern ireland <e> <s> it is worth noting that in june the ministers own department issued a report of a <e>", "<cs> my lords is not part of the problem the fact that we are overloaded with business in both houses of parliament <e> <s> my second point is that we have the act on the statute book <e> <s> it lays down a procedural arrangement <e> <s> has the minister not identified the problem as being mainly at the draft or consultative stage of the order <e> <s> if there were more effective consultations at that stage of the legislation that might help to ease the problem <e> <s> may i follow the noble and learned lord and attempt to make a suggestion which may meet some of those problems in northern ireland <e> <s> would it not be possible under the northern ireland act to have draft orders more effectively and constructively considered at public sittings in the parliament building in stormont under the consultative committee procedure and chaired by the minister dealing with the particular order <e>", "<cs> my lords i join other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord longford for initiating this timely informative and challenging debate <e> <s> i consider the debate timely because of widespread public concern about the governments reforms of the national health service and the current political controversy over the future of patient care <e> <s> the timing is particularly important <e>", "<cs> my lords in a treasury statement of this kind i should have welcomed comments on two points <e> <s> first comments which will inspire or encourage the regions <e> <s> there is no mention whatsoever of incentives to the regions <e> <s> my other point is in connection with research and development <e> <s> wages have been mentioned in the statement as one of the ways to overcome problems of our competitiveness internationally <e> <s> my view is that the government ought to have made some pronouncement concerning the low rate of research and development that our productive employment and manufacturing industries are faced with in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords before i speak to the main subject in this debate perhaps i may first warmly welcome and support the words in the gracious speech concerning northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in commending my noble friend lady ewart-biggs for initiating this interesting and challenging debate and for her stimulating speech <e>", "<cs> my lords it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i realise that i did not give the minister notice but perhaps i may have the same courtesy of receiving a reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow the example set by my noble friend lady nicol and put a question before i make my comments <e> <s> will the minister provide information

additionality was the answer <e> <s> perhaps he will read the <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in thanking my noble friend lord underhill for initiating this very topical debate and

understanding of transport professionals politicians and the general public <e> <s> they are engineering finance and the rail linkage <e>", "<cs> my lords i too compliment the noble lord lord moran on tabling this timely unstarred question about the future of united kingdom peatlands <e> <s> i also compliment all those who have spoken on the subject with such clarity interest and challenge <e> <s> there is an urgent need to question the continuing destruction and accelerated depletion of our peatlands <e> <s> the government must surely have a positive answer to the request for a realistic

what the criteria are for financing measures to combat homelessness in rural areas <e> <s> attention has rightly been given to the human misery which exists in the inner cities and particularly in london <e> <s> however does the minister not agree that there is a tremendous amount of deprivation suffering and human misery in the rural areas <e> <s> can he indicate what criteria a voluntary body
