the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords arrangements for financial support for independent hospices have been under careful consideration for some time and it is hoped to bring forward plans in due course <e> <s> arrangements for hospices in wales and northern ireland are also being considered and it is hoped to deal with these at the same time as those for england <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am grateful to the noble earl lord longford for introducing this short debate and to all those who have contributed their views which were nearly all based on personal experience and who have raised questions on this important aspect of health care <e>", "<cs> my lords the new contract with its emphasis on continuing care will generally reinforce the professions commitment to the national health service <e> <s> the proposals have been welcomed by the general dental services committee as better for dentists patients and dentistry <e> <s> the proposed pay structure will reward dentists who attract more national health service patients <e> <s> we believe that that will be just as effective in the major cities as elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i assume the question refers to the governments initiative launched in june aimed at reducing junior hospital doctors rotas which are more onerous than one in three <e> <s> final reports on the initiative have just been received in the department and will need to be carefully analysed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lord who have contributed to the debate <e> <s> i add my congratulations to my noble friends lord mccoll and lord sainsbury and to the noble lord lord walton on their informed and excellent maiden speeches <e> <s> we look forward to many occasions on which we can benefit from their expertise <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for health announced last week that in addition to the million made available to respond to this tragic situation in a further million <e>", "<cs> we are aware of press articles and tv coverage earlier this year about alleged over-prescribing <e> <s> no complaints of any substance have been received by the department and therefore we have no plans to ask the general optical council to investigate this matter <e> <s> it is of course open to anyone who is dissatisfied following a sight test to complain to the general optical council or to the consumer complaints section of the association of optometrists at bridge house / blackfriars road london se nw <e>", "<cs> my lords the sale of reading glasses is a private transaction <e> <s> it is up to individual opticians who supply these optical appliances to use their commercial judgment and set their prices accordingly <e> <s> in doing so they will need to take full account of the prices being charged by companies supplying reading glasses <e> <s> we do not collect details of comparative costs <e> <s> we have always urged any person needing reading glasses to look around for the supplier offering the most competitive price before deciding a purchase <e>", "<cs> my lords health matters are certainly high on our agenda this week and i thank the noble lord lord hunter for introducing his motion as he did <e> <s> indeed i am most grateful to all those who have made valuable <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot hope to do justice to the quality range and depth of knowledge that this debate has evidenced <e> <s> but i think all noble lords who have participated for sharing their knowledge expertise and sincerely-held convictions <e> <s> it has been a fascinating debate as my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor predicted <e>", "<cs> my lords the subject which the noble lord lord houghton brings before us today is one on which as we all realise members of both houses and many people <e>", "<cs> my lords since st january more than building schemes each costing over million have been completed in the united kingdom <e> <s> a further schemes are currently under consideration <e> <s> the government continue to maintain the largest ever programme of capital investment in the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service has provided and continues to provide a very good hearing aid service to large numbers of hearing-impaired people <e> <s> a variety of proposals for hearing aid services announced last year included the setting up and evaluation of pilot projects which will involve the direct referral of patients from their general practitioners to the hospital audiology department without the need for a prior examination by a consultant <e> <s> however there are some patients with a hearing loss caused by an underlying medical condition who may need to be examined by a consultant before being referred for a hearing test and fitted with a hearing aid <e>", "<cs> my lords we are satisfied with the present arrangements as provided by the whitley council negotiating machinery <e>", "<cs> my lords for the uk in there were medical and dental staff by that i mean doctors and dentists and non-medical staff <e> <s> that figure includes nurses <e> <s> by there were medical and dental staff and non-medical staff <e> <s> that shows an increase in medical and dental staff over the period of per cent <e> <s> with non-medical staff increasing by per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments health policies are fully consistent with our objective which is to improve the health of the nation while securing maximum effectiveness and efficiency from the resources made available to the caring services <e>", "<cs> my lords the routine schools bcg vaccination programme has not been discontinued permanently <e> <s> because of supply problems and the need to conserve existing stocks of vaccine in order to protect high risk groups a postponement of one year has been made for the group of children due to be vaccinated in the autumn of <e> <s> the programme is due to resume this autumn <e>", "<cs> it is clear that the developments in human fertilisation and embryology that are the subject of this bill offer the prospect of increasing human happiness but they also raise some horrifying spectres <e> <s> one of the most alarming notions that is raised by this group of amendments is the mixing of human and animal gametes to create some kind of hybrid <e> <s> it is right that the bill should proscribe such a practice in the strongest possible terms <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint some members of the committee who expected to hear from my noble and learned friend the lord chancellor <e> <s> i think that my noble friend the duke of norfolk is unduly concerned in attempting to alter the bill with this amendment <e> <s> as currently drafted subparagraph d of paragraph of schedule permits treatment licences to be issued for practices designed to ensure that embryos are suitable for being placed in a woman <e> <s> i believe that that does not mean that they conform to the desire of the woman for a baby with blue eyes or other such characteristics but are suitable for the purpose of implantation and creating a viable embryo <e>", "<cs> central government support for the additional expenditure local authorities will incur under the children act and the governments community care proposals will be provided largely through the revenue support grant <e> <s> we intend to implement both sets of changes in / <e> <s> funding decisions will be made in this years public expenditure survey <e> <s> revenue support grant is unhypothecated and elements taken into account in determining its level are not separately identified <e>", "<cs> my lords it is useful to have the opportunity to return to this point so that i can explain the governments view more fully and illustrate it further <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is grateful to the noble lord lord stallard for having introduced this debate and for the way in which he did so <e> <s> it gives me the opportunity to pay tribute to the skilled and dedicated service of ambulance staff in caring for the sick and injured often in stressful and hazardous circumstances <e> <s> this is an acknowledgement that has frequently been made by the government in the course of the dispute and indeed before and perhaps in particular by my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of and concerned about this problem <e> <s> we are currently in discussion with health and social services authorities and voluntary bodies in central london with a view to identifying practical steps to help people get the support they need <e> <s> we hope that any approach developed for central london will prove a useful model for other parts of the country <e>", "<cs> my lords the national health service and community care bill makes provision for a new system of community care from including residential care and the government recognise that local authorities will need adequate resources to enable them to discharge their new responsibilities including assessment care management and securing the provision of appropriate care <e> <s> we are taking the necessary steps to ensure this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad of the opportunity to debate this topic because despite some of the allegations we believe that we have a record second to none <e> <s> this is proved by the fact that we now have more doctors than ever before more nurses than ever before and most importantly a higher proportion of people involved in direct patient care <e> <s> i say straight away and in saying this i take seriously the views of health service workers that i acknowledge that there are pressures on staff <e> <s> indeed there are bound to be in any large organisation <e> <s> the national health service after all employs nearly million staff and has gross expenditure this year of more than billion <e> <s> it is therefore no exception to this rule <e> <s> however we should not necessarily assume that all pressures are a bad thing <e> <s> they can offer a stimulus to the achievement of greater efficiency and effectiveness <e> <s> i believe the cash limit to be a discipline of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not possible to provide this information in the precise form requested by the noble baroness <e> <s> the figures we have show that for england and wales the total number of examinations for which fees were scheduled in the middle quarters of was million compared with million in the corresponding period in <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not accept that there is a crisis <e> <s> the bethlem royal and maudsley hospitals special health authority has been allocated a budget of million for the coming year <e> <s> this represents a cash increase of almost million or per cent <e> <s> it is for the authority to decide how best to use this allocation and to make more effective use of its very valuable clinical resources <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords the determination of central government grant to local authorities and the governments view of total appropriate local authority spending for - took account of resources for authorities to undertake the necessary preparatory work to implement our new community care policy after april <e> <s> charge capping applies only to those authorities whose budgets for are excessive in the opinion of my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> the proposed caps are in his view fair and reasonable in the individual circumstances of the authorities concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>",

bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the government propose that from orthoptic training will be financed on a national basis and located an two or more universities in england and one college of further education in scotland <e> <s> negotiations are in progress with a number of universities and we hope to reach agreement on financial arrangements in good time for the next financial year <e>", "<cs> my lords we are currently conducting a survey into the number of sight tests carried out during the first quarter of <e> <s> we expect results to be available towards the early summer <e> <s> the survey is being conducted by nop on behalf of the government <e> <s> it will provide an independent

west lambeth like all health authorities must operate within its resources <e> <s> to enable it to do this in - after consultation with medical and nursing staff the authority has agreed a package of measures which includes a reduction of around beds at st thomass hospital and a corresponding loss of posts <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult to make a reliable estimate on the information available but stringent safeguards are built into the licensing provisions of the medicines act <e>", "<cs> my lords applications for nhs trust status will not be invited until parliament has approved the necessary legislation <e> <s> staff and the local community will then have an opportunity to express their views on individual proposals to the region concerned before any formal applications are made <e> <s> we are nevertheless aware that ballots canvassing the views of various interests have taken place but we have consistently made clear that it would not be appropriate for changes in management of nhs services to be subject to such ballots <e>", "<cs> my lords the computerised call and recall systems which invite women for a cervical smear test in themselves draw attention to the need for regular screening <e> <s> furthermore the system of target payments introduced in the gps new contract is already stimulating doctors to encourage women to be screened <e> <s> the programme is also promoted through health education leaflets and through our meetings with representatives from womens organisations and other representative bodies in the voluntary sector <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments successful economic policies including our reform of the tax system have enabled us to increase spending on the national health service by per cent <e> <s> in real terms since - leading to the provision of more and better services generally <e> <s> as an example we are proud of our success in reducing the number of infant deaths <e> <s> infant mortality rates a key indication of the nations health are currently lower than in any previous year <e>", "<cs> my lords since st january there has been no reduction in orthopaedic beds <e> <s> however the elective orthopaedic beds provided at the royal masonic hospital were reduced to in november <e> <s> these beds have now been moved to the westminster hospital <e> <s> there has also been a net reduction of nine gynaecology beds provided at the westminster and charing cross hospitals <e> <s> there has been no deterioration in the standard of patient care at the westminster and charing cross hospitals and i understand that the staff involved have accepted the changes made <e>", "<cs> my lords following consultations and as part of the implementation of the national health service review the government have decided that from st april providers of hospital care in great britain will be reimbursed for the actual cost of the treatment of ec nationals as in-patients or at out-patient clinics <e> <s> that is facilitated by the new contractual system <e>", "<cs> my lords we have always made it clear that the government have a great deal of sympathy with the purpose behind the amendment <e> <s> at an earlier stage we agreed to look positively at how and whether the government could bring forward an amendment to meet that purpose albeit initially on a limited or experimental basis <e>", "<cs> my lords during our discussion of this subject at report stage my noble friend lady blatch made clear the priority that we attach to the development of effective child care services as has been said by the noble lord lord clifford <e> <s> on that occasion she quoted the secretary of states letter of last year to the president of the british paediatric association which reaffirms our commitment to the proposals of the court report and in particular to the importance of co-ordination of child care services delivery by general practitioners community health services hospitals and local authority social services departments <e> <s> i hope therefore that it is clear that as i think has been admitted by those who have spoken this evening we approach the amendment in a spirit of agreement on the way in which we all want those important services to develop <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do agree with the commons in their amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these amendments are designed to clarify the closure powers in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the commons amendments and reasons be considered forthwith pursuant to standing order <e>", "<cs> my lords the department of health through the social services inspectorate monitors the services provided by local authorities and gives advice and assistance as appropriate <e> <s> it is for local authorities to consider how to use the funds available to them in the light of local circumstances and overall legislative requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords in giving the bill their support the government have always been aware of the reservations expressed by and on behalf of the medical profession on access to records <e> <s> it is right that those concerns should be subject to public debate as they have been in this house <e> <s> i believe that on the whole points raised by your lordships on second reading which required clarification from the department of health have been met either during that debate or in subsequent correspondence <e> <s> however the noble baroness has now mentioned a couple more points which i shall be happy to respond to <e> <s> i should also like to take this opportunity to thank my noble friend lady blatch for holding the fort as it were on second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords the number of cervical smear tests examined in great britain has increased by two-thirds to approximately million over the past years <e> <s> we expect a similar rate of increase to continue in the short term <e> <s> we also expect the gps new contract which came into force at the beginning of april to provide a powerful incentive to gps to increase the number of women screened <e>", "<cs> my lords we recognise the fact that health visitors and social workers are a valuable community resource <e> <s> however the recruitment of health visitors is a matter for wandsworth health authority and not the local authority <e> <s> it is for employing authorities to take whatever steps are appropriate to recruit the staff that they need <e> <s> the department of health gives advice and assistance as appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords there h as been a welcome and steady increase in the provision of nhs chiropody services over several years <e> <s> the total number of people receiving chiropody treatment in the nhs increased by per cent <e> <s> between and and

honourable friends the secretaries of state for scotland and for wales <e> <s> their plans will be announced in written answers in another place today <e>", "<cs> my lords information available to the communicable disease surveillance centre suggests that there are people with aids in the united kingdom <e> <s> inherent delays in the reporting of new cases and deaths mean that this can only be an approximate figure <e> <s> the full medical facilities of the national health service are available to patients with aids plus support from social services departments and voluntary agencies <e> <s>
