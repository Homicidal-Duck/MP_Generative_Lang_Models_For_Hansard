["<cs> my lords the question i should like to ask the noble viscount is this is there anything more valuable than an efficient organisation which the noble viscount says this is and of which the government are going to sell half <e> <s> because i do not know that any organisation can be better than the people who work in it <e> <s> i am sure the noble viscount will agree with that <e> <s> i should also like to ask have any figures been made available to the minister or to anyone else showing how much the profit or loss would be on the sale how much it will cost to obtain the money and what proposals have already been put to the city of london about getting the money <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope your lordships will not be influenced by the noble viscount lord eccles the great advocate of the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord lord cockfield whether he has considered the effect of his statement on working people in this country who do not know whether or when they are to be discharged <e> <s> i suppose that one has to allow for party propaganda and i have no doubt that the propaganda is the result of certain home-work done by the conservative party during the pre-election period <e> <s> they have since had some time in which to work it out <e> <s> they must have had some idea in mind <e> <s> there have been leaks in the newspapers <e> <s> working-class people have done their best to do their jobs and now they are not sure what is to happen to them <e> <s> they will have to wait until the autumn after the recess <e> <s> noble lords are now to have two months holiday in the south of france or wherever they are going <e> <s> ordinary people have to wait until noble lords return in order to find out what is to happen to them <e>", "<cs> it was not my government my lords it was elected democratically <e>", "<cs> my lords evidently there was good reason for the foreign office and government of the day to withdraw our ambassador <e> <s> what <e>", "<cs> was it then a wrong decision on the part of the previous government my lords <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether i should or need not declare my interest in television but the noble lord lord willis said something which is very important <e> <s> nothing is worse for creative people and we need creative people of a high order in television in this country than censorship over their shoulders <e> <s> they will think that this is some kind of censorship <e> <s> one can ridicule the different arguments that have been put forward <e> <s> if i wanted to make a programme about asquith and lloyd george and about how they were going to fill this house with peers i would have leading the liberals the lord carrington of the day because he was a liberal leader in this house <e> <s> he was a third j or fourth cousin or uncle of our present <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised an important point <e> <s> the annan committee sat for a long time and did a very good job <e> <s> they visited every television studio in the country and the bbc and came to the conclusion that the number of complaints was so small that the way that they were being dealt with was as good a way as possible <e> <s> the bbc was the first organisation in the world to have television at alexandra palace before the war <e> <s> they closed down during the war and have been going now since on channel and since on channel <e> <s> independent television has been going years <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister whether he can explain a little further the benefits of being private <e> <s> is there any reason why the complainants should not tell their stories to english newspapers and get a full page about what they will say in private <e> <s> on the other side the television company the producer or the itv or bbc director will not be able to answer in the same scurrilous way as the complainant <e> <s> if this is public and if there is the right kind of commission and the right chairman with the usual methods of a tribunal they will be able to answer the complaint <e> <s> otherwise i am afraid that <e>", "<cs> there is no use going through the argument all over again but perhaps we might take a practical case <e> <s> if somebody complains about a programme the parish which the authority and commission operate is limited to television <e> <s> it can be shown subject to censorship in cinemas <e> <s> this has happened many times in the past as the noble lord lord hill knows <e> <s> we have had many a battle at one time on the question of somebody attacking a programme unwarranted and damaging or attempting to damage the reputations of the writers the actors and directors involved <e> <s> so there can be all this about private but if there is a complaint made about bbc or itv programmes they can be shown in the cinema and there is nothing one can do about it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl confirm what he seems to have been telling us that there has been no budget prepared of the total expenditure of her majestys government and the amount they might have to put into this enterprise however good or bad it is <e> <s> we have not had an answer to any of the questions that have been asked <e> <s> i am not commenting on the total benefit but it would be interesting from the national economy point of view to know how much money her majestys government are investing in this one project <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether we should have the advice of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give me some information <e> <s> the last line of amendment no <e> <s> says that the local education authority shall give their reasons for making their assessment <e> <s> if this amendment is carried it will mean that they will not have to rewrite what the professional reports have stated otherwise somebody will have to rewrite the reports <e> <s> we know from experience in this house what happens when people get involved in trying to write an amendment let alone writing something that becomes part of the law <e> <s> i therefore support this amendment <e> <s> i hope that the minister will realise that most people listening to this debate who have had any experience will find it agreeable if they find a little compassion on the other side of the house <e>", "<cs> i do not often speak in your lordships committee but i was involved in the original quota bill <e> <s> i was involved in the eady fund legislation and i have seen many things happen within the film industry <e> <s> one thing we need and need badly is the opportunity for people to learn how to make films <e> <s> we need a group of people who are film producers <e> <s> i think the talk about the comparison between television and anything else is wrong <e> <s> we produced a television-making group of people who were capable of eventually making jewel in the crown <e> <s> people must have training and experience <e> <s> i cannot see anywhere any enthusiasm for developing a picture-making community of which we can be proud and which can make films worthy of international sales i was waiting for the ministers to finish their conversation <e>"]
