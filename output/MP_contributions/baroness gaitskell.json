lord carrington for his outstanding speech <e> <s> the noble lord lord carrington described the motion as a hotch-potch and it really is a hotch-potch <e> <s> this subject deserves more than one debate it deserves half a dozen it deserves debate after debate <e>", "<cs> believe me my lords at this conference they rejected even the idea of family planning and birth control <e> <s> i do not mean they rejected it utterly they put it very low down on the list <e> <s> however i wish to return very briefly to the one point i have raised about the plo which i consider to be extremely important namely the fact that they are intent on the destruction of israel <e> <s> if we do not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether any <e>", "<cs> my lords will this government not go down as a government of promises and will they not be called the this year next year some time never government in the matter of reducing unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not understandable <e> <s> here is a country which wants its independence <e> <s> should we not and should not the noble lord lord barnby who is a wonderful example of british manhood and who appreciates british freedom understand that these people would like to get aid and to become independent from any country <e> <s> they have got aid from russia <e> <s> when we do not come up with aid is it not understandable that they should get it from russia <e> <s> we should not forget that in the last war russia was our ally and might well be our ally in the next war <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like briefly to ask a question <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor aware that there are many jews and i am one of them who do not approve of the settlements that have been set up by the prime minister mr <e> <s> begin <e> <s> is the noble and learned lord also aware that despite what my noble friend lord brockway said about the policy of the plo in their covenant they have the destruction of israel stated clearly <e> <s> unless they take that out of their covenant there will be no peace in the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords may i plead with the government to have an inquiry into this organisation <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that i have had many friends who have gone to scientologists and have had long courses <e> <s> in the first place i cannot understand why they call themselves the church of scientology <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend in his amendment and i will do so in two or three sentences no more because he has said it all and there is very little to add <e> <s> there is no doubt that this amendment would be not only useful but a complete transformation of information to this country about the third world and even about such associations as the united nations which has existed for so long and of which there is massive ignorance <e> <s> we need the educational function of this amendment and i hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords are we deluding ourselves if we think that the european community has a magic formula for success or progress in resolving the middle east conflict <e> <s> surely we should still stick to the american views in this area <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend from an entirely non-expert but political point of view <e>", "<cs> the minister keeps repeating the phrase arithmetical figure <e> <s> is it that or is it a fanciful figure <e> <s> what kind of figure is it <e> <s> arithmetical tells us nothing <e>", "<cs> i entirely disagree with my noble friend <e> <s> television is not the same as literature <e> <s> it is not the same as history <e> <s> it is a different medium and it really has a very free hand <e> <s> my noble friend said the suez film was very good <e> <s> was it so good throughout <e> <s> was it so accurate <e> <s> did it really give an absolutely accurate historical picture of what went on <e> <s> it did not <e>", "<cs> we do not have just that kind of picture <e> <s> we have to have something that is more accurate more true <e> <s> we do not have it because the people who take part in television sometimes are not so good not so accurate not so truthful they are in many respects very superficial when they do a programme <e> <s> the recent programme about my own husband which was put on television could have been torn to pieces not because it was beastly not because it was unpleasant particularly <e> <s> it was just not accurate enough it was not historical enough <e> <s> it was somebodys view <e> <s> and one could do nothing about it <e> <s> i am not bitter about it <e> <s> i simply said it was not historical <e> <s> i was <e>", "<cs> i should like to correct perhaps a misconception that might have arisen from my intervention <e> <s> i did not mean that the programme on my husband was defamatory libellous or any such thing <e> <s> the reason why i do not agree with either my noble friend lord willis or my noble friend lord strabolgi is simply that television as a medium is so free that one does not have to libel one does not have even to tell lies <e> <s> one can do it without any of those things because we have absolutely no control once a programme is on the air over what it will be like <e>", "<cs> they are not sick <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister explain why it is that when we listen to the one oclock news we continually hear that young people cannot find jobs <e> <s> therefore his optimistic answer really does need to be explained <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add three sentences to the debate <e> <s> of course one agrees with the proposed words they are completely innocuous <e> <s> but may i say that they will not achieve their purpose <e> <s> i was on the board of yorkshire television for over four years and we had one programme after another relevant to what we are now discussing <e> <s> i recall one programme in particular the gold run <e> <s> which showed how gold is mined in south africa <e> <s> that programme contained much history and showed the state of the country <e> <s> the proposed words are sentimental <e> <s> they will not have the effect on television or on education about international affairs that the people who put them forward think they will have <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a few comments to make about the complaints commission particularly from the point of view that the commission is no good in certain aspects <e> <s> i have in mind not the question of defamation but simply criticisms that people may have of television or broadcasting <e> <s> there was a programme about my late husband in anthony howards series reputations <e> <s> many of us have criticisms about incidents that are not necessarily slanderous <e> <s> they may have a certain slant or they may be very boring or the case may be made in an unfair way <e> <s> having thought about the subject and in particular having thought about the programme that was done on hugh gaitskell i would like a public right of reply not the need to apply to a complaints commission <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to intervene very briefly having too listened to the debate with great interest <e> <s> i do not know whether other noble lords heard a review on radio about northern ireland at this moment <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a very unfortunate moment to introduce this genteel code of practice we have been talking about with unemployment approaching million <e> <s> however good the government think these codes are they are not going to succeed at present unless unemployment falls not merely below million but unless we get rid of unemployment at this high level <e> <s> in this talk on the radio about northern ireland they simply said that all the trouble all the violence was entirely due to unemployment <e> <s> it seems to me this code of practice has not got a chance of working unless we get rid of unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords i was fascinated by the speech of the noble lord lord hylton just now <e> <s> some of us who try to follow events in northern ireland find it very difficult to understand what is going on <e> <s> i have learned more from his speech today than i have from reading newspapers for a very long time about the troubles in northern ireland and i should like to thank him for it <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand that to lay on dinner every time we have a long debate is rather difficult but does not the refreshment department show a lack of understanding here <e> <s> it could make all sorts of other arrangements <e> <s> it could expand facilities at the sandwich bar it could have not a full dinner but snacks <e> <s> surely there is a woman in the refreshment department i know that we have a new man as head of that department <e> <s> surely it could show some kind of imagination <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him how one can have dignity in local government if there is no fairness in local government <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister whether we should not have almost a philosophical look at the word competitive <e> <s> does competitive <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister a very short question <e> <s> why do not the government make this information generally known in the country <e> <s> i may say that what he has said today has given me some comfort about this terrible tragedy that is going on but in the country this information is not known <e> <s> why do not the bbc or the itv present a programme which says this <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it very difficult to understand this bill and it is no good pretending having listened to the contributions that have been made that i can understand it better now <e> <s> i can only see a great divide between some of us on this side or at any rate between myself and what has been said so far <e> <s> in my view to call this bill a social security bill is a misnomer it should be called the social insecurity bill <e> <s> that is the proper title for the bill <e> <s> it is a nasty bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> as i understand it income tax is paid on unearned as well as on earned income <e> <s> if the government decide to raise more revenue by increasing national insurance contributions they do not need to raise as much from taxation of unearned income <e> <s> but it is precisely because national insurance contributions are levied on very low earnings which are exempt from tax that the yield from an increase in national insurance contributions is much greater than the same percentage increase in income tax <e> <s> for the tories to raise the standard rate of tax would be a major reversal of policy whereas increases in national insurance contributions are likely to cause less fuss politically <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister a very brief question before he sits down <e> <s> will unemployment fall with the fall in the rate of inflation <e> <s> so far it has risen <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the government how we can have confidence in what the <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain to a non-expert why it is that every time the rate of inflation goes down one point we get million unemployed <e> <s> we do not understand why that is and it is no good trying to convince us that it means anything at all <e>", "<cs> why not <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the government take heed of these figures and take heart from these figures and instead of boasting about not taking a u-turn not only take a u-turn but do a somersault when thinking about unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords why are the government surprised that there is more robbery on the streets when so many people are unemployed <e>", "<cs> my lords do we not have our priorities somewhat addled when many schools do not have enough books <e> <s> surely we should not bother too much about how children all over the country care for their books <e> <s> is the minister aware that as in the past some children will look after their books and others will not <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister this if we can look forward to a uranium shortage surely we can look forward too to a uranium famine and so perhaps have a more peaceful world <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord this <e> <s> would it be true to say that over the century the plo have received more than many organisations and more than a great many refugees <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell me why it is that many employers are so much in favour of the closed shop <e> <s> surely they have an argument which we should consider as well because very many employers are in favour of the closed shop <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank the noble lord lord byers for initiating this debate and i hope i shall be as brief as he was when he spoke <e> <s> this is not a debate which is conducive to a detached view but i shall try to be as detached as i can <e> <s> regarding the speech of the noble lord lord mcnair from the liberal benches i should like to repeat something that i have said before in this chamber <e> <s> i was the united kingdom delegate in the human rights committee of the united nations seven times and i was there when arafat made his spectacular debut <e> <s> i also heard a new york television interview which an american television interviewer had with him <e> <s> the interviewer asked arafat are you really intent on the destruction of israel <e> <s> and arafat replied in ringing tones this is the first step <e> <s> that is just a little homily for the noble lord lord mcnair <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the minister agree that even if in certain places the cuts are necessary they always hurt people who are most vulnerable and who are usually the poorest members of the community <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to thank my noble friend lady david for introducing this very important and pressing debate <e> <s> then i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord swann on his maiden speech <e> <s> i met him some years ago at an <e>", "<cs> my lords does this not really amount to stealing from the next generation <e> <s> is that not what we are doing <e> <s> nibbling away all the time asking the parents to produce books losing teachers <e> <s> everything the government are doing is actually harming the growing generation of young people <e>", "<cs> may i intervene for one moment in support of my noble friend and against the minister <e> <s> we hear every other day of instances where this occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down may i ask him whether it would not be true to say that when it comes to comparing it with the success of the eec we have played down the success of our own agriculture <e> <s> we have lost out on that <e>", "<cs> my lords mention has been made of cheap fish dumped in this country but any housewife will testify that we cannot get cheap fish anywhere whether it be clumped or not dumped <e>", "<cs> my lords when will the day come when the rate of inflation will come down and the rate of unemployment will also come down <e> <s> so far that has not happened <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this he spoke about monopoly power of the trade unions <e> <s> what about the monopoly power of the employers who can throw millions of people out of work <e> <s> is not that the same <e> <s> why monopoly power only of the trade unions <e> <s> the employers have the same power call it what you like <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness why are we setting ourselves up as judges of this issue <e> <s> by what right do we do so <e> <s> we have heard today nothing to show that we know how to choose teachers and how to choose their intellectual qualities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that research and development is carried out mainly by industrial colleges by the colleges in this country and that so long as the cuts go on we shall not have the amount of research and development which we need <e>", "<cs> my lords are the government thinking of deploying the million unemployed that we have in this country and putting them entirely into the arms industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the minister quite apart from the nuclear weapons whether he agrees that it is a very good thing that the aggressive noises from both america and ourselves towards russia have now stopped and the americans want to talk to the russians and discuss the future of whatever they are going to do <e> <s> surely this is an end to the schizophrenic attitude of foreign policy that we and the americans have embarked on in the last year <e>", "<cs> may i ask the minister a question and give him an example of this <e> <s> i know someone who has the cheapest form of heating that is paraffin heating <e> <s> what happens when the price of paraffin becomes very high which has happened in this particular case <e> <s> how does this bill deal with cases like that which are so hard on poorer people <e> <s> this idea that any form of central heating is a good thing and has to be taxed and the value of the house goes up just is not true <e> <s> all sorts of things might happen <e> <s> electricity might go up <e> <s> paraffin might go up <e> <s> oil might go up <e> <s> all these things have gone up <e> <s> therefore i would support my noble friend lord ross on this and certainly not the government <e>", "<cs> that is not so <e>", "<cs> apparently not <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl the minister sits down may i ask him a very short question <e> <s> would it not be true to say that ever since this government were elected the balance between national government and local government especially towards local government has been continuously depressed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the minister on his reply as regards this issue <e> <s> we are put in a very invidious position when we get up and lecture other countries and particularly third world countries on reducing their populations <e> <s> it is all wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords while agreeing with the minister that this is a deplorable state of affairs is it not due to the low morale about education in general the shortage of books the quality of the teachers and the general atmosphere as i say of low morale in education due to all the cuts that have been made against education <e>", "<cs> my lords in supporting my noble friend which incidentally i do not often do may i ask the minister seriously to reconsider his question <e> <s> i have long experience of the united nations having been there seven times over a period of years <e> <s> would it not be a good thing that there should be a hostile condemnatory statement from the united nations about this terrible situation within el salvador <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i just ask him a very short question <e> <s> while i support the noble baroness lady sharpies up to the hilt on this issue does it not bring the common market into disrepute to have such daft regulations as this <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the same with milk on the doorstep <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord have we no protective material against the fire bomb <e> <s> anyone who saw the policeman in northern ireland covered in flames clive james in the <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be true to say that the only people who have supported the christians in lebanon are the jews in israel <e> <s> and precious little sympathy they have had from us or from any of the other european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the government have increased unemployment time and again since taking office may i ask the minister to agree that instead of bamboozling us with figures figures which are quite meaningless to most noble lords here and certainly to most people outside it would be more becoming for the government to be rather less proud of what they are doing <e>", "<cs> hear hear <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be true to say that if we have a free press the only alternative is a dictatorship <e> <s> whatever one may say about a free press that alternative would not be very welcome to a country like ours <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords in congratulating my noble friend on his absolutely outstanding and fair question on this matter may i ask the noble lord this question while there has been universal condemnation of israel would we feel very happy if the french put some nuclear reactors on the normandy coast <e> <s> would we feel quite as secure as we do now <e> <s> as i say there has been far too much condemnation of israel in this matter and after all the syrians and the iraqis are the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister how often this happens <e> <s> does it happen a great deal <e> <s> i have never heard about this at all <e> <s> so can he give us some idea of how often this kind of action is taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord how he reconciles his answer with the fact that cuts have been made against all types of education higher education medium education primary education everything <e> <s> and now that we know that in the years to come there will have to be more unemployment because of silicon chips with everything does he not agree that we should be giving special help to education throughout the whole range in order to create jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the foreign secretary agree that it is not just the failure of the united nations at all but the fact that in the plo covenant there is a wish for the destruction of israel <e> <s> i myself heard yasser arafat one year on american television <e> <s> he was asked do you really intend and wish for the destruction of israel <e> <s> he said this is the first step <e> <s> this was after a spectacular debut which he had had in the general assembly <e> <s> so we should not really kid ourselves that it is because they just cannot get together <e> <s> until the plo take out of their covenant the desire for the destruction of israel there can be no peace in the middle east at all <e>", "<cs> my lords for once i disagree with my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby about this amendment <e> <s> perhaps i am wrong but i regard this bill as a good bill but a limited bill <e> <s> it was not intended that this bill should cover the whole area of pornography it was meant to help children by stopping displays that children might see <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment is making very heavy weather of this bill at a serious time in our country <e> <s> the amendment would not work <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble lord the minister am i not right in thinking that while this is a good bill it is the governments intention that it should be a limited bill with limited objectives and not a wide-spreading bill at all <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the noble lord the foreign secretary on his miracle idea of going to moscow to put a stop to the suspicion and threats that have been the main part of our policy and the american policy towards the soviet union <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the government on this matter <e> <s> i am

such high unemployment is the worst time for the government to start tinkering with the trade unions and to start tinkering with their laws which have been there for generations and altogether the worst possible time to start their hanky-panky <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first like to make two congratulations the first is to the noble baroness lady macleod of borve on having the courage to

church and education are ready to help but what i and i know many people would like to see is that the church should take a very much deeper interest in the problem of unemployment which he put right

richer <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord the minister because i am a little confused about it whether it will now be necessary when someone gets the first prescription for glasses to be recommended to a specialist or to an eye hospital <e> <s> is that so or is it just that we can buy spectacles as the americans do over the counter <e>", "<cs> my lords in the muddled situation that we
