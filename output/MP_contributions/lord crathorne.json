["<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to join other noble <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first of all congratulate our maiden speaker the noble viscount lord chandos <e> <s> it was a truly marvellous maiden speech without any question one of the finest i have heard in this chamber <e> <s> seeing the noble baroness lady elliot of harwood still in the chamber it is a rather fascinating fact that her half-sister married the noble viscount lord chandoss grandfather and i shall leave your lordships to work that one out <e> <s> at this late hour i expect that the shorter my speech the better it will sound to your lordships so i shall indeed be brief <e>", "<cs> my lords like other noble lords i should also like to welcome this bill <e> <s> there have been so many fascinating speeches that i certainly do not want to reiterate a large number of excellent points that have been made from all parts of the house <e> <s> i should like to touch on two local radio points if i may <e> <s> first i must declare an interest as a director of an independent local radio station in the north-east <e> <s> the noble lord lord willis and the noble earl lord bessborough have raised the question of the levy and i am told we shall be hearing from the minister about that point <e>", "<cs> i think i should also like to wait until we come to that amendment in that case <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend lord belstead would think about the practical effects of this proposal <e> <s> i do not think that in effect it will work frightfully well <e> <s> the iba has an ability to bring a contract to an end and that seems to be working extremely well <e> <s> the iba inspects each contractor each year and writes a report each year to the contractor <e> <s> if for instance there is an effective contractor who receives a good report every year at the end of an eight year period it does not seem very likely that the iba will not re-award that contract <e> <s> that is one point <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the noble lord lord jenkins <e> <s> i am perhaps one of the few members of your lordships house who are actually involved in a theatre museum <e> <s> it is connected with our little georgian theatre in richmond in yorkshire which was founded in <e> <s> it is a beautiful theatre which i am sure all your lordships know about <e> <s> our museum has not been going long but it is very popular <e> <s> a question we are often asked particularly by people from abroad is why there is not a theatre museum in london and there is no acceptable answer to that question <e> <s> drama is britains premier art and has been for many centuries and london has always been at the centre of it <e> <s> furthermore we possess nobody has stated this perhaps the finest theatre collection in the world but with nowhere to house it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that answer <e> <s> i am sure that he will be aware how much we are looking forward to the opening after this long delay and the sooner the better <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take up just a couple of points raised in the debate <e> <s> there is no doubt that there is some concern about the governments proposals for the provincial museums after the abolition of the metropolitan county councils <e> <s> one point i should like to make is that it is vitally important for museums such as the laing in newcastle near to which i live and the walker in liverpool that they should retain and further develop their own characters <e> <s> if they are run from london by trustees of the tate surely some of the local character will be lost <e> <s> there is a real worry about this from the museums point of view and i think it is a sensible worry <e> <s> it would be unsatisfactory if such a thing happened <e> <s> from conversations i have had it is clear that both the london museums and the provincial museums are not entirely happy with those suggestions <e> <s> fortunately however my noble friend the minister has made it clear that he is still very much open to suggestions <e> <s> i should like to ask him whether he has considered the possibility of establishing for the provincial museums a system such as exists for example in regard to the wallace collection <e> <s> the trustee system has served our museums very well and i realise that there would be many initial problems to overcome <e> <s> clearly this is not the moment to discuss them but i hope that we shall hear from the minister on that point <e>"]
