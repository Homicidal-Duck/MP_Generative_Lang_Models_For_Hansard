["<cs> my lords in addressing your lordships house for the first time i wish to speak about the williams report because it deals with matters which have always interested me and with which at various times i have been directly concerned <e> <s> the first occasion was a very long time ago when i was elected to the london county council in and was put on the sub-committee of the theatres and music halls committee <e> <s> one of the first things we had to consider was whether the magnificent eisenstein film <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord appreciates that one of the reasons why some of the nationalised industries have not made profits or their profits have been lower has been that the government have stepped in and controlled the prices of the products <e> <s> that is the most important factor which the noble lord must take into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a few words to what has already been said by other noble lords <e> <s> as there appears to be unanimity in this house on the subject there is perhaps no need to put forward any arguments <e> <s> we appear to be all agreed <e> <s> i must declare in the first place a form of personal interest not a financial interest in that this building is to be put up in a constituency which i represented in parliament for nearly years <e> <s> that is a local interest if you like <e> <s> it is also an aesthetic interest because i feel as strongly as anybody else who has spoken that to put up such a vast building in this area would be an abomination and destructive of my major interest in the matter namely the pleasantness the high qualities the architectural merits of london <e> <s> one is thinking in this connection not only of londoners but of all those who visit london <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be as brief as possible <e> <s> the first thing i want to do is to express my appreciation and thanks to the noble lord lord nugent for bringing up this matter once more and i hope this time successfully <e> <s> for many years i have been deeply interested in the subject because for two years during the attlee government i was parliamentary secretary in the ministry of transport and in that position was responsible for road safety <e> <s> safety belts were not a feature of the problem in those days but exhortation propaganda and an attempt to get a change in the habits of the public was indeed a very important feature of the ministry of transport for which i was responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that everyone in this house will support this bill because its purpose is to remove a very real grievance which has been in existence for a long time <e> <s> i have been well aware of it because for many years i was chairman of both the pensions fund and the members fund and members frequently made representations to me and to my committee and i to lord boyle and to the leader of the house at the time that this grievance should be remedied as soon as possible <e> <s> nothing has happened until now <e> <s> i am delighted that it is happening now <e> <s> one of the reasons why it has not happened before and there are many reasons is that the argument has been put forward that people who did not contribute a penny to any of these funds should not get any benefit from them at the expense of those who have contributed <e> <s> the other argument was that anyone who does not have a reasonable income can apply to the members fund <e> <s> many members have said quite understandably that they do not want to do this <e> <s> i do not think it was recognised and i say this on behalf of my <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene for only a few minutes <e> <s> i have taken a great interest in this problem for over years ever since the time under the attlee government when on behalf of the ministry of transport i was in charge of its very intensive road safety campaign and i believe that we did some good <e> <s> one of the conclusions that we all reached as a result of the campaign and after the spending of millions of pounds was that what you can do by education and exhortation is limited and after a certain stage no benefit results and some form of compulsion is necessary <e> <s> that was true then and i am perfectly certain that it is true today <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to be able to speak in a debate in which the noble lord lord peyton has spoken <e> <s> i used to know him very well in another place and i always used to admire his contributions though i seldom agreed with them <e> <s> i should like to say first of all not only that i welcome the noble lord but that i think his speech today was more forceful which is saying a lot than they usually were in the other place <e> <s> secondly i should like to say that i agreed wholly with the general line of his argument <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said by many-previous speakers the question whether or not this house should be televised has been decided <e> <s> it was decided by a vote this time last year <e> <s> what we have to consider today is really whether the report which is before us adequately expresses the desires of this house and whether or not the proposal in the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord chalfont is a wise one <e>"]
