["<cs> my lords will my noble friend give consideration to encouraging the bbc to reduce its budget in less necessary areas areas of less consequence and perhaps to retain this vital service which i am sure he values as much as any other member of this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to accord some support to the noble baroness <e> <s> the response to her letter in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this house would be discharging nothing more than its ancient duty if it were to see these clauses as providing the minimal protection for the dignity and liberty of the subject <e> <s> i have experienced situations of great tragedy and sorrow in which the closed shop has been misused or has been sought to be misused by enthusiastic and well-meaning trade union officials <e> <s> i will not bore the house but i recall that perhaps the best convenor that i ever had to contend with a magnificent chap who went bald-headed for production and bald-headed for top pay and if there were more like him in this country today our economic dilemma would not be so severe was to be cast out of his union because he has a disagreement with its headquarters and shop stewards finally presented the pistol point to me on the classic and understandable argument that if you do not belong and do not pay to belong you have no right to enjoy the benefits of trade unionism <e> <s> that is a very ancient belief and one not without its merits <e> <s> but it rarely stands up to the consistent behaviour which has characterised human life when we seek to inflict appalling disciplines on a man and his family for a permissible disagreement <e>", "<cs> having listened carefully to the speeches of many noble lords this afternoon one has the feeling i say this with respect that there is a lack of realism in the approach to this matter <e> <s> the measure of disenchantment with politics and parliament that pervades our country today and which is of course widely encouraged by many undesirable organisations will not be affected nor improved nor removed by compressed superficial compelled presentation of minuscule highlights of sensational utterances in this chamber or perhaps in the other house where at times they are more likely to occur <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to refer to the underlying concern perhaps the unspoken concern <e> <s> we are talking about the capacity to be competitive we are talking about direct labour organisations <e> <s> in truth whether they are or are not competitive is always going to be open to question <e> <s> that is the underlying concern because if one has six competitors and five can go broke by reason of their irresponsibility and one cannot that is not competition in terms that business understands it <e> <s> i think it is best to out with these truths <e> <s> we might try to rest upon return on capital employed and our accountants might like to finesse and say do you mean return on capital employed <e> <s> do you mean return on assets employed <e> <s> do you mean return on assets managed <e> <s> we all know that in large organisations not merely local authorities but large businesses there are vested interests who commit themselves to an activity because it creates managerial status managerial salary and privilege <e> <s> therefore one sets up a situation which is full of inequality and which cannot beyond all reasonable doubt satisfy the test that it is competitive because it lacks the ultimate sanction <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am most grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for having ventilated this noxious issue in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> clearly i could not have been present neither for that matter could the noble lord opposite at any examination or inquisition relating to miss joanna harris but i did not quote from newspapers i did not quote from speculation and i did not quote from the spoken word <e> <s> i quoted from information communicated to me by a highly respected member of the local authority concerned and i named her <e>", "<cs> i had not intended to intervene but there might be others on the benches on which i sit who can scarce forbear to cheer at hearing our front bench in such unqualified terms condemn municipal and public trading as something which could be an irresponsible use or misuse of public funds <e> <s> i hope that that conviction which i heartily applaud is going to be a consistent factor in government policy in dealing with the british steel corporation british rail the coal board and all the other ailments from which we have suffered for so long <e> <s> i merely ask that we be consistent <e>", "<cs> i sense the sadness that the committee may be about to divide on this issue <e> <s> for many of us here and for many outside that will be a matter of real regret <e> <s> to most of us the post office is a commendable institution well established and historically well run with the occasional hiccup here and there something which renders a great corporate service to us something which through the postman who to many of us is a cheery friend is a necessary symbol and part of our lives <e> <s> to hear it cast in terms of something which is to be lightly and readily disregarded by any government whether of the right the left or the centre is i think a measure of exaggeration of anything that any of us would believe would happen or is likely to happen in real life <e>", "<cs> to we natural free enterprisers lord mottistones suggestions are naturally persuasive but if they were adopted we should be in danger of addressing ourselves to the plausible attractions of competition in terms of the service to our domestic market and of disregarding the tremendous significance of the telecommunication supply industries in this country which i submit will need the concentrated purchasing power of british telecom if they themselves are to address world markets on this frontier of technology which is concentrated in the new telecommunications situation and positively and advantageously expressed by system <e>", "<cs> it would be unwise to dismiss this amendment lightly <e> <s> i think that your lordships committee would render a disservice to a movement which was born of dire social necessity that in my mind is beyond question but which for years has desperately needed dignity responsibility authority and self-sufficiency <e> <s> the amendment would seem to rest upon the assumption of sensibility lying behind <e>", "<cs> my lords persuaded by some difficulty with eyesight the lateness of the hour and the fact that your lordships patience cannot be limitless i shall confine my limited contribution to the main thrust of this most perceptive report <e> <s> in my relatively short time of years in your lordships house i cannot recall a document of greater quality deserving of a much better reception as has been said than it was given at first by the government whom i sense to be now engaged in a process of repentance <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister will i hope allow me to express what i wish to say in the form of a statement rather than a question because my remarks are rather difficult to phrase <e> <s> i speak from some knowledge of the industry <e> <s> the upside worth of the proposed deal with general motors it is very much upside for gm can also be upside for this country <e> <s> we are talking and the minister is talking about trucks as if bedford and leyland were common or similar <e> <s> they are very different <e> <s> bedford produces trucks in the light to medium range and only touches the borders of the heavy range of trucks <e> <s> leyland was once years ago the great european leader expressed in its lovely calendars of beautiful ladies to leyland shes a lady <e> <s> i hope that the minister will take care that the lady is not raped in the process of the situation <e> <s> the great attraction for general motors it is not a disadvantage to our own country is that general motors badly needs a european base for heavy commercial vehicles <e> <s> leyland might well have a better future in such a circumstance than it is likely to have with any other partner <e>", "<cs> my lords forgive me <e> <s> may i ask the minister to be mindful of the danger that if general motors were to switch its castings and forgings to plants in europe which it owns merely to fill them up <e>", "<cs> my lords in rising with some hesitation to support the amendment i am conscious of the fact that the necessities addressed by the bill are real and purposeful <e> <s> deep-seated problems which have developed over the years in municipal housing of all kinds must have presented serious economic problems to this government indeed to any <e>"]
