["<cs> my lords i have prepared an elegant speech in i think extremely good english but i shall not deliver it because the time is not appropriate <e> <s> may i quickly say how much i enjoyed the two most witty maiden speeches and how delighted i was that two noble lords should put the case so well of the british council which to me is the most grievously affected at the moment in a series of grievous cuts <e> <s> i also agree with the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale about the total horror of the word gay in its new use <e>", "<cs> we are very happy to have you here <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can clear my mind by asking the noble duke whether it is his idea that this should be in lieu without a debt for it to be in lieu of <e> <s> that is the problem is it not <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i thank the noble duke very much <e>", "<cs> it is not for me to answer anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords ever since the third report of the expenditure committee was published in march many of us myself included have been thinking about this bill <e> <s> i wish to say at the beginning of my speech that it has gone better than i ever dared to think it would <e> <s> there were many very difficult problems and they seem very largely to have been surmounted <e> <s> i congratulate wholeheartedly the minister his representative here and the government <e>", "<cs> in fact it was my intention but i am perfectly prepared to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether other noble lords agree <e> <s> my view is that i do not like it in the title <e> <s> i think the noble baroness lady airey suggested that she did like it in the title <e> <s> if other people agree with her we can step down but if they agree with me i think i would ask the noble lord lord mowbray to do what he has suggested and accept the amendment in principle <e> <s> i will withdraw it for him to examine it and we can bring it back on report <e> <s> but i do not want to force this view unless other people agree <e>", "<cs> i think we have shown sufficient consensus for me to withdraw the amendment and to point out that the consequential amendments will need to be withdrawn as well <e> <s> what i do not want is for it to be described throughout as the national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> i do not mind it being in the long title <e> <s> with the permission of the committee i beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord reigate introduced his bill which was overtaken by the event of an election he asked this question and i rather think that i managed to avoid giving him an answer <e> <s> the answer that i was certainly advised to give was the one which has been given by the noble lord opposite <e> <s> but this is not a very necessary reason for accepting it <e> <s> it seems to me that whatever happens in the end the trustees will be appointed on the advice of the ministers concerned <e> <s> my noble friend lord ross of marnock has made it perfectly clear that if nothing else there needs to be an alteration in this subsection <e> <s> i shall certainly not oppose this amendment and i think that the feeling of the committee is pretty solid that the minister should take it away and think about it <e>", "<cs> may i just say that the arts council is administered with this in mind but not in writing which is what the noble lord is suggesting <e>", "<cs> there is a slight problem here as it stands <e> <s> when the arts council were dividing the amount of money available between different countries there was always a tremendous argument about headage <e> <s> we had a great deal of trouble if my welsh colleagues will forgive me for saying so with wales about this <e> <s> if you put a thing like this in writing in exactly the form it is in you are liable to get people in england saying what proportion of the national heritage is in northern ireland <e> <s> you have got one out of <e> <s> what proportion in wales <e> <s> you have got two out of or whatever it may be <e> <s> this is awkward <e> <s> i am not sure what the right answer is but i am not at all clear that this is the right answer <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord take this away and consider a phrase of the kind after consultation with the secretaries of state for northern ireland scotland and wales <e> <s> that would cover it would it not <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord explain why we could not cut all this out and use scientific to mean historic and architectural as well as archaeological <e>", "<cs> as president of the royal society for the protection of birds i should like to associate myself fully with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i could not quite understand the noble lords last remarks <e> <s> he said that if it were valuable for the trustees to purchase some rights on neighbouring land they would do so <e> <s> surely the point of this amendment is that the trustees could give money towards for example the rspb to do so <e> <s> the fact that the rspb have not done so may have been because they have not got any money though i am glad to say that that is not the case at the moment <e>", "<cs> if that is the case then it seems to me to meet what is in the amendment <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is telling us <e> <s> that in other words the trustees can advance money to an institution to buy rights associated with the neighbouring land without buying the land itself <e> <s> that is the question at issue <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that under this bill they can do so <e> <s> if so i think we shall all be perfectly happy <e>", "<cs> is the noble viscount aware that the government have asked that this amendment should be withdrawn in order that the next amendments can be accepted <e> <s> is he saying that he is not in agreement with the second amendment <e> <s> if not he is wasting our time <e>", "<cs> i hope that they are <e>", "<cs> that is right <e>", "<cs> i should like just to reply to the noble lords answer to my amendment <e> <s> of course i read the report of the discussion in the other place very carefully and it was because the governments answer was so totally unsatisfactory that i have raised the matter again <e> <s> the noble lord really did not answer with the frankness that we have come to expect from him <e> <s> this does not say as he implied that the trustees shall not make a loan under this clause except after consultation with the treasury which would be an obvious thing to do anyway <e> <s> it says except with the consent of the treasury <e> <s> i object totally to this and if the noble lord cannot take it back and alter it i think we should divide on it because it is against the whole basis of the new world that this bill is bringing in <e>", "<cs> but the advice that is being laid down to posterity is absolutely incredible <e> <s> we should not give a cash loan to somebody who is economically not viable <e> <s> that is absolutely ridiculous <e> <s> the whole business of the trustees is to look at the people to whom money is being given to see whether things are properly run and proper accounts are kept and every now and again if they wish to do so they can consult the treasury <e> <s> what we are objecting to is that the government are saying that something should be done with the consent of the treasury and then they say that <e>", "<cs> in return for that so long as the noble lord will give it what is known as a good looking at i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think we will all join in welcoming this amendment and its consequences <e> <s> as somebody who has taken a very great interest in libraries i am particularly pleased <e> <s> i think it is perfectly clear from the words the noble lord used that lord teviots amendment is covered by what has just been said <e> <s> i hope the noble lord lord teviot will think so too <e>", "<cs> i should like to endorse that <e> <s> as a minister it has been my business to deal with chattels and it may often be desirable to decide to buy a chattel on behalf of an institution or to give an institution money towards buying a chattel before the institution knows where the rest of the money will come from <e> <s> this kind of thing has to be done from time to time <e> <s> it is entirely desirable that the trustees should not become collectors <e> <s> i quite agree with a time limit but we must demand a time limit they must be allowed to buy and keep for a period <e> <s> in relation to real property i think that a year would be the minimum but in relation to chattels my own view is that three months would be sufficient <e> <s> however it would probably be less trouble to have both periods the same <e> <s> this is extremely important <e>", "<cs> my noble friend made an unusual error in saying that my name was on this amendment <e> <s> it certainly is not <e> <s> i do not agree with what is in this amendment <e> <s> i think that we are much better off to stick to clause which gives the in lieu situation everything they can possibly want in my opinion <e> <s> this amendment suggests that the ministers whose duty it is at the moment to accept objects in lieu should before they decide what to do with them consult with the trustees <e> <s> this i am totally and absolutely opposed to because what you do not want is two lots of non-expert enthusiasts asking advice from various other people and then coming to different conclusions <e> <s> it is bad enough having two ministers but to have two ministers consulting trustees is simply foolish <e>", "<cs> on this side of the committee we are equally delighted at this sensible concession by the government <e>", "<cs> anyone would think from the remarks of the noble marquess that the national gallery british museum tate gallery and walker gallery were not great english assets <e> <s> i was astonished to hear what he said and i know he did not really mean it <e> <s> of course we must have both <e> <s> we all know that <e> <s> to me the satisfactory thing about the bill is that it is putting into the hands of a jury of so-called and we hope cultured people the decision as to what shall be done with objects which are acquired <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble marquess for a moment <e> <s> the bulk of the in lieu chattels that is to say pictures <e>", "<cs> i feel that i must make a few short remarks at this stage about a matter which is not mentioned in the bill and which has not been mentioned here namely the current system by which the <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say that i think the amendment is something which must be very seriously considered and i <e>", "<cs> i should like to give qualified support to the noble earls amendment <e> <s> our belief when we were in government was that the right solution to this is contained in clause and that the final structure of the trustees and their funds should be that they deal with everything as the noble earl said <e> <s> at that time i do not think the museums were very apprehensive <e> <s> in any case the government fell so we never got to final discussions with them <e> <s> i hope that this will happen in the end but of course i would not support doing this against the museums open objections <e> <s> i think one has to get round those or else postpone doing it <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is any point in arguing about this <e> <s> the noble lord speaks of a principle but he has not given us a principle <e> <s> he said that a number of people doing similar jobs are not paid <e> <s> of course that is true <e> <s> there is no principle involved in it <e> <s> the principle which we wish to have involved is that cultured people without large incomes can be approached on this point <e> <s> it is only permissive and if i were minister for the arts when the first chairman was appointed i should not pay him but i should be very glad to know that i could if the time arose when it was suitable to do so <e> <s> i think we have a principle but i do not think the noble lord has and in any case we will let the committee decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it does not appear to me to do that <e> <s> it means that if there is a situation of deadlock the minister will have to solve it in whatever way he thinks best <e> <s> one way is to say that he will pass this section over and not that section <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to stop him from doing this <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will remember that noble lords on his side <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble baroness she spoke of the london opera house <e> <s> i think she meant the london opera school <e> <s> the opera house is still open <e>", "<cs> my lords i fear that the noble lords question will get a fairly frosty answer from the noble lord opposite <e> <s> it is indeed refreshing to hear a new recruit on the other side make a plea for proper planning for a carefully negotiated entry into the private sector is not that something rather like nationalisation <e> <s> for more quangos and for more spending on the arts <e>", "<cs> my lords i went to miss vacanis when i was young <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has promised us a debate and having given us a statement which really says nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> we on this side have not tabled any amendments to the bill on the assurance of the noble lord which he has repeated that this is an interim measure that the government do not regard it as something which will deal with the film industry for the next years that they are fully aware that there are very serious problems concerning the film industry and that this country needs and above all has the talent for a good film industry but at the moment the money is lacking <e> <s> how to produce that in anything as speculative as the film business is a problem and i not having the answer am not able to criticise the government for wanting to look at the matter further <e>", "<cs> my lords many of your lordships will already have learnt that you cannot believe everything you read in print <e> <s> if you look at the speakers list your lordships will see that the noble lord lord ponsonby of shulbrede should be speaking now and that i should be speaking at the end of the debate <e> <s> that is due to a mistake which may even have been made by my own whips i do not know <e> <s> however it is a mistake which i refuse to accept and so does my noble friend lord ponsonby <e> <s> therefore we have gone back to where we started <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter of great interest <e> <s> i said something slightly in opposition to this and i do not wish to say anything that is not right <e> <s> if the noble lord is talking of the level how many are there <e> <s> that is the figure that matters if four were lost there <e> <s> and if the noble lord is talking of the level how many are there there <e> <s> that is what matters to the other four <e> <s> clearly most of the people at the bbc are not paid more than or are they <e> <s> i do not know <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord longford for raising this matter <e> <s> i did not like the way in which he raised it because i do not believe that criticism of the parole board of the kind he made is at all justified <e> <s> however i agree with pretty well all of his conclusions so we shall probably get on all right <e>", "<cs> as i have an amendment within this area it might be for the convenience of the committee if i were to speak to it now <e> <s> i should like to begin by agreeing with the first amendment proposed by the noble lord lord hooson <e> <s> to go beyond the individual i think is going further than we need and would create enormous difficulties because after all somebody in soviet russia and somebody in chile is attacked every day of the week by somebody and we do not want to open up a whole series of political things of this kind so i think that the limitation to individual is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> after consultation with the secretary of state for scotland is in the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must go on trying <e> <s> i want to get something critical into the bill <e> <s> it lacks any criticism by any body except the iba who are doing the job themselves <e> <s> although i have the highest possible opinion of the iba as it is and as for the rest of my life i think it will be i still think that it is an absolutely false principle <e> <s> if we had these advisory committees appointed by the secretary of state and of course i accept lord drumalbyns suggestion whether they be appointed by the home secretary after talking to his colleagues or by each secretary of state i should be very happy <e> <s> but what i want these bodies to do is not just to be advisory but to have a duty of criticism and that is what i cannot get into the bill <e> <s> i keep on trying to do so and i fall a cropper every time <e> <s> i shall try again on report but i do not think at this time of night that it is much good pushing it <e> <s> but i hope noble lords will understand that at present there is no monitoring of the very very broad instructions contained in clause and without some body looking at this over a period we will get inevitable erosion <e> <s> but i shall not press the amendment tonight <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> it might help if i were to point out to the noble earl the deputy chairman that amendment no <e> <s> not no <e> <s> is the first in the group to which my noble friend was speaking <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be assured that it will be first business <e>", "<cs> i will accept the noble lords absolute assurance that every step will be taken to ensure that under-s are not confined with over-s <e> <s> i accept the fact that he has told us that neither detention centres nor borstals are full at the moment that is what i understood him to say <e> <s> so the question of receptions will not create a problem for the next few days anyway <e> <s> i think that i am right in interpreting what he said as that <e>", "<cs> i agree to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will not be put off by distance <e> <s> this is a question of money and members of boards of visitors will be quite prepared to visit if the cost of their petrol at its present exorbitant rate is paid for <e> <s> this is something that the noble lord must bear in mind <e> <s> i am happy to accept his assurance and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not think this is quite the end of it because the emergency can be extended by a month and it seems to me that without trying to get the bill altered which i realise is very difficult at this stage we want a fairly positive assurance from the government that the secretary of state himself will be informed if any prisoner on remand has not been seen for over days so that he can look at the case himself and do something about it <e> <s> one hopes that it would not be very many <e> <s> but does the noble lord think that something of that kind could be given to us in order to keep us quiet <e>", "<cs> would it be possible to deduce from what the noble and learned lord has said that if we call it days unless the prisoner wishes it not to happen or something of that kind that could be put up to the secretary of state <e> <s> it seems to me that that would meet my point absolutely <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies may i say first that i am grateful for the support secondly i do not know what the noble lord lord renton means by artificial <e> <s> what was artificial about including this <e> <s> that is a puzzle to me <e> <s> i do not know that it is worth going into but it seemed to me to be quite a wrong adverb <e> <s> i should have thought that my paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i have to agree with the noble <e>", "<cs> it is just worth adding that it must be with the prisoners consent because a lot of prisoners would be furious if their wives were told they were inside <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one short remark which i think is out of order because it is on our amendment which was not passed <e> <s> though it is probably impossible to arrange proper visiting in police cells i take it that every effort will be made to make it possible in the larger camps or anything else which are being set up <e> <s> i should like an assurance on that <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble baroness would allow me to intervene to clarify a point <e> <s> when the noble baroness said that she thought that the part of the white paper which dealt with custodial matters was less than disappointing did she not mean that it was more than disappointing <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i say that i refrained from speaking today because i thought that our case would come so much better from the other side <e> <s> i congratulate her on the way she has made it <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not of course oppose this motion and owing to the lateness of the hour i do not think i want to do more than ask a certain number of questions to which i could perhaps have written answers if that is easier <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for those brief answers <e> <s> i want to make only two further comments <e> <s> there is a possibility of this situation running on into january <e> <s> we all hope it will not <e> <s> i do not think that the absence of the -day rule which we asked for would be tolerable if it became or <e> <s> i think there must be some answer in writing from the home secretary to me possibly put into <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy about the latter but i am not really happy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised at being asked to do this <e> <s> this is a most important order concerned with civil liberties <e> <s> there is no question of my being confined to asking questions <e> <s> i do not know whether it is the general view of the house that one has only to ask a quick question <e> <s> it is not my understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with this at all <e> <s> i shall not be long but i shall not ask a question at this moment <e> <s> i shall make a statement <e> <s> i think that it is absolutely improper that the amenities in police cells should be dependent upon the charity of the police <e> <s> i think that in these circumstances the home secretary has a duty to ensure that amenities are available in police cells and i hope that we can hear that something is being done about the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask whether he has not rather exaggerated his statement to the house that the abolition of the house of lords is an official commitment of the labour party <e> <s> it is traditional in our party that conference makes decisions and loyal members remain in the party and try like anything to alter them <e> <s> we remember hugh gaitskell on the famous occasion <e> <s> it is absolutely misleading to saddle us many of us who totally disagree with this commitment of the national executive committee with that view <e> <s> we shall fight as hard as we can to alter it <e> <s> if it comes into the manifesto then we shall have to go <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply which goes some way towards explaining the position <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that a similar situation arose in and the experience of the probation officers association is that those who were trained at that time and did not get jobs never did get jobs <e> <s> does the noble lord agree that it looks as if there is going to be a total wastage of the training of about probation officers at a time when the probation service must be reinforced in order to deal with the appalling prison situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for that information <e> <s> i think that that will be a helpful move <e>", "<cs> my lords may i have two minutes of your lordships time to apologise most humbly to the minister that i missed his speech and to the house for my discourtesy in not being here <e> <s> the reasons are obvious the traffic blocks were incredible <e> <s> i wish to say two things <e> <s> the first is that i want to support my noble friend lord harris of greenwich in his tribute to the army and particularly to the police and the governor grades of the prison service <e> <s> i discussed with the chief probation officer how things including frankland the new prison are going <e> <s> they seem to be going extremely well and there is very high praise for the police from all sides <e>", "<cs> we would support this amendment subject to one or two points <e> <s> first it is clear to us that the burden of proof should be on museums as is stated in the amendment <e> <s> secondly i can speak for the integrity of museum collectors as i have had a lot to do with them in the last few years but i think that the word <e>", "<cs> before speaking to this amendment i think i should make a confession <e> <s> it is that like the noble lord lord chelwood i am a biased character in that up to the end of this year i was the president of the rspb and the noble lord is a distinguished predecessor <e> <s> there is no financial attachment to this but it would be absurd to pretend that there is not a certain bias <e> <s> one of the things that we in the rspb are particularly keen about is the preservation within reason of the birds of prey which are becoming increasingly scarce <e>", "<cs> support from the noble viscount is as agreeable as it is unusual <e> <s> i must say to the noble duke that his arguments were as he told us they would be entirely on my side and i was not quite able to understand why he came down on the other side <e> <s> one cannot always see into peoples minds which is what makes these debates so interesting <e> <s> but it seems to be clear that the less woodcock are shot in september in scotland in other words the less tiresome the change is for the man who shoots the better it is to make this as one step among several others that i shall move towards unification <e> <s> therefore i hope that the noble earl and the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am happy with what the noble earl has said <e> <s> i think that it would be much easier for us to intervene as regards the french and the italians if we had taken a first small step so i very much hope that the noble earl will come back to us with agreement to this amendment which i am happy to withdraw <e>", "<cs> i am entirely happy with that suggestion and i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i agree <e>", "<cs> i agree about the weather there is good consultation on that <e> <s> i did not suggest there was a shortage or a running down of mallard <e> <s> i suggested it was a widlfowl resource which <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not press the noble earl but i should be very grateful if he will raise this matter with the other matters because i think that the three amendments as a whole would improve things very much if the alteration can be made throughout <e> <s> however in view of what he has said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg to support the amendments <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies to my noble friend it seems to me that the first amendment at least would give flexibility <e> <s> as it stands now the secretary of state has got to consult a person i would not have thought that he necessarily had to but as things are he has got to consult a person but he may not consult more than one <e> <s> that is what i read in this <e> <s> it seems to me that at least we could have persons so that if he wanted the views of some well-known naturalist in the area he would be able to obtain them <e> <s> i believe this should be looked at again if the noble earl can be convinced <e>", "<cs> with that assurance i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with respect donate is a very odd word in this respect <e>", "<cs> may i answer that before anybody else speaks <e> <s> because one situation that we visualise concerns somebody who is entirely on the side of conservation and would like to do it but cannot afford to because it would cost him too much <e> <s> that is a common situation and i think the noble lord is barking up the wrong tree here because the number of times you would have to force anyone would seem to me to be very few indeed <e> <s> generally speaking i agree that it is not worth forcing these <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what we are trying to do <e>", "<cs> may i reply to one point of the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> i gave a wrong example to the noble lord lord stanley <e> <s> there is no question of altering farming operations that comes later in the sssis <e> <s> under this the kind of thing that would happen is that it would not be worth having a sanctuary in one area if the shooting which was going on continued <e> <s> therefore you would have to persuade the owner to let you buy the shooting rights from him you might want some fences altered or something of that kind <e> <s> but i do not think farming operations really apply to this subsection <e> <s> they apply later <e> <s> the misunderstanding is my fault <e>", "<cs> may i just say that the noble lord the leader of the house particularly asked us to do so <e>", "<cs> the noble lord promised my noble friend that he would look at part of the problems which we have been discussing in particular the question whether existing sanctuaries are affected by anything in the bill <e> <s> we believe that the intention of the government is that they should go on as they are subject to anything which may be given to improve their position <e> <s> however we want confirmation of that <e>", "<cs> that is an entirely satisfactory answer <e> <s> i am not asking for an amendment although i am hoping for one <e> <s> however i am asking for a careful examination and for a statement at the next stage about the position <e> <s> on those terms i am very happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his full explanation of what is going on <e> <s> may i begin by saying that we shall certainly not oppose the continuation of the order in its reduced form <e> <s> we are very glad that the form is reduced and we hope that it will not be necessary for very long <e> <s> the noble lord said that the court order stopped the prison officers committee from stopping the strike for six weeks <e> <s> did i understand that aright <e>", "<cs> i see my lords <e> <s> thank you <e> <s> there are one or two things which are extremely interesting about this <e> <s> the figures are a <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down will he interpret for me it is my own <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down may i ask him whether i am right in thinking that the word section has no significance in this or any other bill <e> <s> if it has significance is it simply a synonym for clause or has it some other meaning <e> <s> because if it is a synonym for clause i think it is a great pity to use it <e>", "<cs> the noble earl must be aware that we are going to discuss clause when all this kind of thing can be dealt with and i hope that we shall not every time anything is raised this afternoon have to say that <e>", "<cs> from this side of the committee we are happy to support these amendments <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> with the leave of the committee i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> with respect the clause says <e>", "<cs> in the supplementary list of amendments this is shown as under clause but it is in clause <e> <s> i think that should be noted <e> <s> we are not entirely happy about this amendment <e> <s> of course the general point is sound but this clause applies to eggs as well as birds and it is easy if somebody is dealing illegally in rare birds eggs to say my grandfather had them and you cannot prove it either way in the face of it <e>", "<cs> could we be advised equally when the noble earl receives his reply <e>", "<cs> my lords as a fellow visitor to brixton with my noble friend lord hunt i should like to be associated with his tribute to mr selby who seemed to us then to be doing a very remarkable job in appallingly difficult circumstances <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord either agrees or does not agree i should like to raise a question about ringing which is relevant to this question because the birds in schedule part i have to be ringed <e> <s> the problem is the difference between close ringing and the broken ring which is more often used <e> <s> i do not want to go into the technical details of this but i hope that when making regulations in connection with this clause the secretary of state will not allow the use of split rings until a satisfactory and tamper-proof one has been found <e> <s> the reason is quite obvious it is easy to take off a split ring or to put it on which suggests that a bird has been bred in captivity which in fact it was not <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord does that may i say that this discussion has left me very uncomfortable about a number of birds in the list on schedule part i <e> <s> if the noble lord includes in his assurance looking at the birds on that list well and good <e> <s> we should like to discuss it with him <e> <s> if not i shall consider with my noble friends whether we should put down an amendment on report on that particular angle <e>", "<cs> they are not in cages at least <e>",

damaging the eggs i should favour it but none of this will have any effect on the real problem which is the problem of policing <e> <s> goodness knows how scottish landowners are supposed to do this

and like that of the noble lord it is a probing amendment is that we want to stop the freedom given under paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes but i should like to see what sort of amendment the government produce <e> <s> there are difficulties here <e> <s> i do not wish to make it illegal to pick up a gulls egg <e> <s> on the other hand i do not wish to agree to blanket licences something that could be most dangerous although we shall discuss that on a later amendment <e> <s> i am therefore in rather a dilemma in knowing how to play this hand <e> <s> it might be possible to have a licence covering a very limited area or something of that sort so that the collection of gulls eggs about which we heard such a sad story concerning scotland could be carried out in that area <e> <s> however this is a probing amendment and we shall be interested to see what the government produce on this subject <e> <s> on that basis i beg to ask leave <e>", "<cs> i am content to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not see how it would work under a general licence i quite agree <e> <s> from the rspb point of view we think it desirable that most careful restrictions be imposed regarding photographing certain rare birds in certain rare conditions and that it is done only under rather scarce licence <e> <s> apart from that people who like to photograph birds can go to our reserves where there is no landlord who has to be asked <e> <s> from hides which we provide they can without licence take what photographs they like of anything they happen to see <e> <s> that is about as much as we can do for the bird photographers i think but the scientist must be looked after <e>", "<cs> before the amendment is agreed to i wish very briefly to repeat some of the points that i made when this matter last arose <e> <s> we can agree to this amendment only on condition that we are given a new definition of livestock and i want confirmation that we are to be given that <e> <s> we do not agree to game birds being included in the definition of livestock because we think it is impossible to protect birds of prey if a licence to shoot can be got if they take game birds which are being reared in the wild <e> <s>

entirely in agreement with what is in my noble friends mind <e> <s> in other words if in considering the protection of crops against any kind of reserved animal there is a better way than giving permission to shoot it then clearly a licence should not be given <e> <s> that is common sense <e> <s> i should have thought that the licensor would observe this anyway but i should like to hear what the government have to say <e>", "<cs> i am at fault <e> <s> i meant to mention amendment no <e> <s> which has not been withdrawn <e> <s> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> that is the first amendment which i am pinning this group on to <e> <s> noble lords know the general point which i am trying to make but i want to go into it in some detail <e> <s> the licensing provisions contained in the bill are wide <e> <s> they differ in a number of respects from the arrangements contained in the existing protection of birds acts with which on the whole we have been fairly satisfied <e> <s> to begin with the bill enables licences to be granted to kill or take any wild bird in order to prevent serious damage to crops property <e>", "<cs> i do not see how we could get on better <e> <s> i do not trust people whose commercial interests are affected <e> <s> i have never found them to be trustworthy in any way <e> <s> they look after themselves and not the other man <e> <s> this is not the christian doctrine but it is adopted by everybody i know christians or otherwise <e> <s> i would even say socialists or otherwise and we may as well expect no more <e> <s> really the whole of this clause shows lack of trust it is derogating certain things to which clauses to will not apply <e> <s> one might as well say there is no point in putting this down let the licensing people do as they think fit <e> <s> the greylag goose in anglesey is a very good example <e> <s> i do not believe for one moment that if you wish to protect angelsey crops at a certain period from the greylag goose it is necessary to do it for the whole of anglesey <e> <s> i do not know how many farms there are in anglesey but it cannot be a large number <e> <s> i know the area fairly well and i should have thought it would have been possible to have individual licences for a fortnight when the crop was <e>", "<cs> i would rather play it the other way round <e>", "<cs> i do not myself see the difficulty <e> <s> if we take fruit farming for example it is entirely in areas it is usually a matter of under farmers over a very large area not all of whom grow the same fruit <e> <s> i should have thought the bullfinch was admirably suited to a specific licence to be issued to a specific farmer on a specific farm <e> <s> i think they would want to get it extremely quickly and that is one of the reasons why i am sorry that my suggestion about the regional offices of the nature conservancy council has not been accepted <e> <s> i do not see a problem here at all <e> <s> i do not understand why the noble earl having said that he would be specific in his opinion at this stage in regard to brent geese in the south of england and would not want to issue a general licence should want to be able to issue a general licence in other cases <e> <s> i do not believe that is necessary <e>", "<cs> with that particular assurance which i think has been granted that at least the noble earl will look at what his colleague said it seems to me that if those words could be added to the definition of general we should be fully satisfied <e> <s> in any case i am happy to withdraw the amendment until such time as we have an opportunity to hear what the noble earls conclusions are <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl wants further discussion far be it for me to deny him <e> <s> i thought the opposite was the general direction required <e> <s> i would only say that it is the normal thing in the social services or anything of that kind agriculture for instance that if you are going to ask for a grant you should pay the necessary expense of getting it and i see no objection to it at all <e>", "<cs> i do not want to get involved in this because it is between two members on the same side of the committee <e> <s> i would only like to say that if something costs money to do and is for your benefit there is absolutely no reason why you should not pay for it <e>", "<cs> if he does not get a licence he will not be

without written evidence of a very clear kind <e>", "<cs> i am extremely sorry to keep on interrupting but it is rather misleading <e> <s> if the noble viscount looks at amendment no <e> <s> lord craigtons amendment he will see that the nature conservancy council can serve a notice and in it can say whether it is an area of special interest and say what is the special interest in other words

agree with this amendment <e> <s> i have spent a good many hours saying exactly the same thing in this house and i shall not say it again <e>", "<cs> first i was a little surprised that the noble lord

sssis is worse than that of other people <e>", "<cs> on a not very different point i am a little puzzled about compensation <e> <s> i do not think my noble friend lord houghton of sowerby will object

and the horrible smell and the frightening effect of motor-bicycles dashing in sequence along bridlepaths <e> <s> i am very disappointed that there is nothing in this bill which has any effect on it <e> <s> the fact that that is quite irrelevant to this clause i feel noble lords will forgive <e>", "<cs> on this side of the committee we should like to accept at least the spirit of this amendment and of the new clause to which amendment no <e> <s> b refers <e> <s> this is a very complicated question <e> <s> we may not love motor bicyclists who pass our house or go along greenlanes on which we wish to walk but it is quite clear that they must have some rights <e> <s> however i think the government should look very carefully at what the noble lord has suggested that there should be limitation of their rights and in so far as it is thought necessary as laid down in the later clause following consultation arrangements could be made to preserve parts of the lanes exclusively for the pedestrian <e> <s> i think there is probably no one in the chamber who would not agree with that <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend having been for a brief two years in charge in an indirect sense of agriculture in northern ireland i should like to ask a couple of questions <e> <s> the first is what is the attitude of the northern ireland farmers union towards this <e> <s> they

that this sort of thing will go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i confess to some disappointment because the last time we discussed this we got support from at least half a dozen noble lords on the other side

wildfowlers think knows more about the matter than anyone that this is a case on which i should like to test the views of the house <e> <s> i very much hope that there will be as many people who agree with sir peter scott as disagree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised at the farming objections to this amendment <e> <s> last time we discussed this matter we became rather confused and talked about habitat protection where there is of course an interference with farming <e> <s> it seems to me that it is not an interference and by far the most likely example here will be shooting

catapult <e> <s> i think that the more one can make this not part of every childs upbringing the better <e> <s> i believe it to be something quite different from the pleasures of the chase or the skills of hunting or shooting which i am not particularly opposed to unlike my noble friend but i think that for children to be let loose with everybodys approval to pot what they can with a stone and

association is much concerned about its present position <e> <s> can he give any reassurance that there will not be severe cutbacks by the libraries in total expenditure on books <e>", "<cs> my lords may i add my support from this remote bench <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will press his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment but there seem to be problems with subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that short sentences overcrowd the prisons very much less than long sentences and a partially suspended sentence must be shorter than any other kind of sentence except the wholly suspended sentence <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that all the recommendations for the partially suspended sentence have included the recommendation that the remainder of the sentence should be served under supervision <e>", "<cs> my lords i wondered how the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter would manage to change gear in this debate because until he started speaking there was a unanimous very sincere very careful and very worried discussion of those matters which as a result of government policy which was not in this debate being attacked seem to be causing real damage <e> <s> that is a very interesting and important matter to discuss <e> <s> but skilled parliamentarian as he is he used an old method which was attack <e> <s> happily from this bench it is not my business to intervene in arguments between the two front benches <e> <s> in many ways this is a relief <e> <s> therefore i shall not follow the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to intervene for one moment <e> <s> with respect he seems to me to be missing the whole point of this debate <e> <s> this debate is on a perfectly clear motion which is suggesting not that there ought not to be cuts but that the effect of some of the cuts is very damaging and ought to be thought about again <e> <s> nobody has suggested that the tories or anybody else make cuts for fun <e> <s> with respect this is all quite irrelevant to the subject which we are trying to discuss <e>", "<cs> my lords the point of my intervention was that there has been a great deal of evidence from all sides of the house to suggest that that is not being done at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord vaux for asking this fascinating question <e> <s> i am grateful to him for the clarity of his speech and i am particularly grateful to him and to the noble baroness lady phillips for the brevity of both of their speeches <e> <s> i only hope that i can be both as clear and as brief <e> <s> i find being brief on something which interests me as much as this a little difficult but i will do my best <e> <s> i must correct one point which the noble lord made in his opening speechanimals are not controlled by one ministry but by two the ministry of agriculture and the home office and exactly the same problems arise there as arise whenever there are two ministries <e> <s> i just throw that in in passing <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating the noble lord <e> <s> lord bellwin on setting out this bill with great clarity at some length which was quite justified <e> <s> my only complaint is about his use of the word privatisation which i am horrified to see coming into the ordinary bureaucratic speech <e> <s> i wish to protest very strongly against it <e> <s> otherwise i thought that it was an admirable speech <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my quondam friend lord underhill on a very fine discussion and a very serious argument of a bill with a lot of which he agreed and with some of which he did not <e> <s> i thought it was admirably done <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i am worried that when the time comes there will not be government action and i think there ought to be <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that brief and not unexpected piece of information may i ask him out of curiosity the reason for this <e> <s> was it the unwillingness or perhaps the inability of the institutions to pay the necessary overtime <e> <s> or was it the unwillingness of the employees to work on a may day holiday and was that under the instruction of the unions and had it anything to do with the civil service strike <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords i was and it is because of that that i am asking these questions <e> <s> i said at that time this is disastrous <e> <s> we must try to get it altered <e> <s> i was prevented from doing so by the general election and i wondered what steps the government had since taken <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl finally saying there is nothing whatever that can be done about this situation <e> <s> it has always seemed to me i admit to having been in the hot seat originally that while one could not do anything about it quickly or immediately one could release the galleries to make their own arrangements with their own staffs <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that it would then be very clear if the staffs were prevented from doing anything at whose behest they were so prevented <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has not answered the question in any way whatever <e> <s> the question was what are the health grounds for not instituting a review <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the most prominent oculists and ocular surgeons state unequivocally that there is no harm whatever in looking or reading through glasses which have not been accurately prescribed <e> <s> is he also aware that ever since i have had that advice i have on the basis of it been using other peoples glasses with the greatest satisfaction <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the distinguished speaker who has just sat down has taken the line that he has taken <e> <s> i think it quite irrelevant to refer to remarks made on second reading by a noble lord who is not present and who has not put his name to the amendment <e> <s> i do not think that we should be prejudiced by racial talk which i agree with the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson of ewell can be very damaging <e> <s> the important point <e>", "<cs> may i say just one thing about that <e> <s> there are of course two entirely separate issues here <e> <s> one is organised crime and in that case no doubt this sort of thing would be done and probably is done already <e> <s> i think your lordships will find that the organised criminals who are paid by central bodies to do this are very careful how they do it and take very little risk <e> <s> what we are concerned about in this amendment is the ordinary feckless young man who is out of work has nothing to do sees a row of cars and rather like a naughty boy puts his hand on one handle just wondering whether there is anything that is going to happen <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt but it is an important point <e> <s> of course it is not the same as sus but it is one of the offences over which sus was constantly exercised <e>", "<cs> surely it is an imprisonable offence that we are talking about is it not <e>", "<cs> i do not want to prolong this discussion <e> <s> but of course from my point of view and the point of view of my colleagues the comparison with a three-year sentence for taking and driving away as opposed to stealing a car which is much more serious is far too high in itself <e> <s> i should have thought that one of the first things that the home secretary or the lord chancellor will do when they begin to talk about scaling down sentences will be to deal with that <e> <s> i think the analogy was falsely drawn but having said that i am sure that the noble and learned lord on the front bench will be happy to hear that the noble lord is willing to take the amendment away and look at it <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord answers that question perhaps i may add another while being in full support of the complaints made from the opposition front bench in relation to the very casual attitude towards your lordships deliberations which are going on at this moment <e> <s> when we were discussing this on second reading these deals were presumably three-quarters made and were known about to the minister and to the railways board <e> <s> i should like to ask while we are discussing the rest of these things whether there are any other deals for which we are today going to give permission to be done and which have already been done <e>", "<cs> we on these benches are unable entirely to support the amendment which has just been moved <e> <s> it seems to us to be based on a doctrinaire view which we do not share <e> <s> we believe it is absolutely wrong that british rail should sell its assets for ideological reasons to suit the government but we do not believe it is wrong that british rail should dispose of its assets in order to use the money for something else <e> <s> we have already expressed our conviction that if they do that under the present arrangements we shall come to these later they will probably be unable to use the money for something else <e> <s> but that is a different point <e>", "<cs> could the noble lord lord bellwin repeat what i believe he said that this is not a matter of selling assets under duress <e> <s> if it were i should agree with the noble lord lord beswick but if the railways board is selling off property which it does not any longer wish to use for one reason or another that would be perfectly acceptable <e> <s> always behind all this there remains the feeling that there is no guarantee that if the railways board sells valuable property the money will be used by the board for development <e> <s> the noble lord lord bellwin gave a reply of the same kind which lord cockfield gave when talking about the treasury when he said that the railways board will have the money but that it will be taken into consideration in any future estimates that are made <e> <s> what this really means is that the railways board will not have the money <e> <s> in that case i cannot really understand why the railways board is prepared to sell off any assets at all except under duress <e>", "<cs> may i add one word in support of what the noble viscount has said <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord seen the report in todays <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add two questions to the very thorough remarks that have already been made <e> <s> first my recollection of when i was concerned with prisons in northern ireland was that every visitor whether a solicitor or not was searched <e> <s> is that correct <e> <s> if that is so then it seems to me that one can pinpoint pretty easily what went wrong <e> <s> secondly while welcoming mr pearces appointment may i ask that at least a good deal of his report be published <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may just add one point here which is in slight opposition to what the noble and learned lord is saying there are three schools for delinquent boys in northern ireland in which there is no distinction whatever of religion and they work perfectly well together <e> <s> so it is a little bit more than the purely mechanical arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord give way for just one minute <e> <s> i do not think there is a single living penologist who thinks that the main object of imprisonment today is reformation <e>", "<cs> my lords i had the honour or was it the duty <e> <s> in of introducing this order into your lordships house for the first time <e> <s> i have prepared a few remarks which go a little wide but i hope they will not be out of order <e> <s> may i begin by saying how much i enjoyed the speech of the noble baroness in particular her remarks about the common market a point of view that we here are very interested in <e>", "<cs> my lords i not only will agree with that but we have been trying very hard at least for the last eight years and so far have got very little distance <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say that he said some curious things about the hunger strike <e> <s> he gave the impression that if somebody went on a hunger strike about something which was not terribly important then you should give way to him <e> <s> it seems an odd thing to have said <e> <s> he seemed to suggest that it was right to stand up against political status but that these people were asking for something less and that therefore we should give way to them <e> <s> it is something i find difficult to understand <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords in fact the noble lord has answered my question so i will put it briefly <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that according to all the evidence public opinion is determined that the police should have everything they need to control riots and what is important which is well explained in the statement is that this should be used only under the very strictest supervision and as a last resort <e>", "<cs> my lords it is customary when dealing with the appropriations order to select one or two of the things which are referred to and speak about them and i propose to say a word or two ask some questions and make some suggestions on northern ireland agriculture <e> <s> first however i should like to support my old colleague lord blease in his objections to the way this has been rushed <e> <s> i think we should have had five or six other speakers if this had been done properly and it has made things even worse by telling us to be ready by a quarter to seven and to finish at eight oclock only to find that we started at twenty past seven and will be lucky if we finish by twenty past eight <e> <s> i have already apologised to the noble lord <e> <s> i have a fierce engagement very shortly and when i have finished speaking i am going to down my papers and run <e> <s> i think it is absolutely wrong to do that but i have to <e> <s> the fault is not mine it is because of the arrangements that have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when one was loading ships for invasion one always left a space for naafi goods and that cultural defence is exactly the same in relation to the billions being spent on straight defence <e> <s> does the noble lord remember that there was an important general whose name i have unfortunately forgotten in the last world war who described the work of the british council in the middle east as worth a brigade to him <e> <s> it seems to me absolutely incredible <e> <s> do the noble lord and the government really mean to save what is something under million on a budget of or billion <e> <s> do they not believe that in order to get intelligence you have to make friends and that in order to make friends you have to show them the best we can do in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in the absence of my noble friend lord hunt who particularly represents the parks interest and from this bench i would just like to say that we are entirely behind this amendment <e> <s> i think the case has been adequately put by the mover and i need not put it again <e>", "<cs> my lords from my serried rank on this bench i would like to support the noble lord lord buxton of alsa <e> <s> was unable to be present at the earlier debates and so i shall not speak in detail but i should like to make one or two points of principle <e> <s> am i wrong in thinking as the law would stand without this amendment that there is nothing to stop except the paying for it the entire surface of the broads being reclaimed for more efficient farming <e> <s> or is that a misconception <e> <s> it does seem to me that this is always a question of degree <e> <s> clearly without the fenlands and lincolnshire we should be much poorer than we are <e> <s> there was a time when it was absolutely right to reclaim <e> <s> that time is certainly at question now in a number of different areas <e> <s> the broads are a very special area not only from the point of view of the birds there which are unique but also from the point of view of the fish and marsh plants <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also support this amendment from this bench <e>", "<cs> my lords when sitting next to the noble lord lord boston i supported the emergency provisions on that bench the things which interested me chiefly were two or three provisions in this temporary bill for which we had been pressing for years to become part of our permanent penal legislation <e> <s> one of them has been discussed by the noble lord lord foot and i agree with all that he said <e> <s> the only point about that in relation to this bill is that it is faulty as things stand and there is no limit under this bill to the number of weeks that a man can be held on remand and there is no specific demand that he should give his waiver to his right to go every eight days <e> <s> i was hoping that by this time we should have at least this provision put forward in some permanent way so that these additions could be made and we could discuss any of the further difficulties about civil liberties <e> <s> i know that the noble and learned lord lord gardiner and the howard league are opposed to this and i would only say that the inter-parliamentary penal affairs group has made the recommendation specifically and we all hope as does the noble lord lord foot that it will be contained in the queens speech <e> <s> if it is we will support it from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really telling us that it will not be as high as the amount received <e> <s> because that is the implication of his answer <e>", "<cs> my lords has any consideration been given to the extraordinarily difficult task of moving from the aerodrome level down to the railway <e> <s> one cannot take a trolley there <e> <s> anyway there are never any trolleys and one cannot get a porter and it can be very difficult for people of my extreme old age who have to carry two bags <e> <s> the two-level position is absolutely absurd and something should be done about it <e> <s> will the noble earl lord avon agree <e>", "<cs> my lords as my name was mentioned however inadvertently at the beginning that perhaps gives me the right to say a very brief word <e> <s> i cannot believe that the noble lord lord bishopston is as flattered as i was at the confusion of the noble lord lord mackie but i should like to make one point if i may to the noble lord lord hawke <e> <s> he and i with most members opposite and indeed i believe most members here in spite of their present view all voted with eyes open to join the common market <e> <s> anybody who thought that the closed shop and the restrictive practices of the hops marketing board which had worked so well for so long could be tolerated under the treaty of rome had not given the matter very much thought <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i was listening to him with the greatest attention in his most interesting speech and there is one point which i think we shall agree with but that i want to have cleared up absolutely in my mind <e> <s> it is the question of sending the mentally handicapped to hospital <e> <s> surely in the case of mentally handicapped children beyond a certain level the normal practice is to send them to an institution which is a branch of a hospital <e> <s> i only wish there to be no confusion <e> <s> i have been a governor of a hospital and we had a very fine institution for purely incurable mentally handicapped children <e> <s> i think it should be made clear in what the noble lord has said that he is not speaking against that practice <e>", "<cs> my lords as a layman the first and i think only layman to speak i would not presume to discuss any of the legal points in a bill which consists of very little else <e> <s> but from this bench i feel it is important to say that we share one determination with the conservative government i would not say the only one but one of the few we share and that is a determination to remain in the common market and to do all we can to smooth out the wrinkles which still remain and the bill seems to he an effort in that direction so we welcome it wholeheartedly and in every way <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the fine could come into operation if he moved from paris to boulogne or could it not <e> <s> reading the bill as a layman i thought that it did <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to follow the noble lord lord boston of faversham pretty accurately and quite shortly because i agree with his approach almost entirely <e> <s> i think the noble lord lord willis made an unanswerable case for something being done and for a second reading for this bill <e> <s> i think there will be one or two things we shall want to discuss very carefully in committee which i shall just refer to in passing <e> <s> my noble friend lord hunt was to have spoken here but he is not well and he and i found that we agreed so i am doing it for him <e> <s> we were both very strong supporters of lord gardiners rehabilitation of offenders bill and we are anxious not to spoil it <e> <s> i think this can be done quite easily <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not quite understand this point <e> <s> i think that what is suggested is that it should not be an offence to disclose not that there is an obligation for the police to do anything <e> <s> i do not know where the noble lord gets this <e>", "<cs> my lords we must not have a long argument over this but surely at present the noble lord is suggesting that the police are under <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree with me that the real evil of all slaughtering is not the act of slaughter but the driving of an animal which has been happy on a farm for two or three years perhaps into a lorry out of a lorry and on to a queue at the end of which animals are being killed whether after being stunned or by being turned upside down and having their throats cut <e> <s> the last stage is a -second affair <e> <s> the thing which is really bad is the whole process leading up to it whether it is done after stunning or by ritual slaughter <e>", "<cs> my lords we normally debate the appropriations order and the renewal of the emergency provisions order together and it has been our custom for the last seven years or so to allow speakers to stray a little wide of the details in the orders and to look for a few moments at more fundamental problems <e> <s> as the emergency provisions order has been scheduled for the most inconvenient time in the whole year that is at the last minute before the christmas recess and as i intend to be playing golf on the south downs at that time i propose i hope with the tolerance of the house to avail myself of this licence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with complete conviction from this bench that we support the renewal of the order <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that this is no time to consider even for a moment easing up on the emergency provisions just when it looks possible that things might be getting a little better <e> <s> the noble earls most interesting introduction gave us some good news about the strength of the ruc the level of activity and various successes <e> <s> both noble lords who spoke before me said something about the diplock courts <e> <s> i hope that nobody considers for one moment that one get justice in northern ireland without the restrictions of the diplock courts <e> <s> even with the diplock courts i have seen people unable to give evidence through sheer fear and in my opinion dispensing with diplock courts should not even be discussed at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am surprised by the inevitability suggestion <e> <s> belgium and holland were joined in the th century <e> <s> why should not they equally come together <e> <s> would the noble lord say that that too is inevitable <e> <s> i do not follow the argument <e> <s> the noble lord is saying something which the facts do not support <e> <s> this is not an objection to union but i do not understand the noble lords thinking <e>", "<cs> before this amendment is agreed to may i suggest that a very much better form of drafting would be to say if necessary which has exactly the same meaning as and/or and is less inelegant <e>", "<cs> i am not very satisfied with that reply <e> <s> i do not think it is a matter of vital importance because in most cases the hospital where the patient is received will know that he has been in before and will doubtless report the matter in a routine way to the commission <e> <s> but if another hospital is involved i believe that the commission will have no means of knowing this <e> <s> it is probably desirable that this fact if it is found by the practitioner and there is no burden on him to find out it is only if he knows should be reported <e> <s> i do not see how psychiatrists and the commission are going to be given a lot of work i do not believe that they are going to be given any work as a result of this amendment <e> <s> i do not think this is a <e>", "<cs> i should like to join those who are expressing uneasiness about this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that what the noble baroness has at the back of her mind is to safeguard the patient against abuse from an evil member of the family <e> <s> we have all read books about this and some of us have actually met it <e> <s> clearly there must be a safeguard <e> <s> it seems to me that section of the act deals with this matter and says that there have to be two doctors one of whom has to be approved by the local authority and the other has if possible to have had previous acquaintance of the patient <e> <s> that seems to me to be the kind of safeguard which is more <e>", "<cs> is there confusion between treatability and curability <e> <s> it seems to be perfectly clear that one can treat psychopathic cases with very little prospect of success but one can treat them and give them better conditions <e> <s> we know from prison work that many of our clients who are considered to be psychopathic give less trouble in certain conditions than in others <e> <s> one does not cure them and make them fit to go out and therefore it seems to me that the whole discussion is rather confused in that everybody is treatable but not everybody is curable <e> <s> i just throw that in to add interest to the discussion <e>", "<cs> i should feel happier about this if it went through the courts <e> <s> i would be quite happy if one could say that the courts are to decide when the protection of the public is required <e> <s> i do not think it is necessary to specify that <e> <s> but there is no test of that kind in the bill is there <e> <s> there is simply a series of words <e> <s> what about somebody who regularly sexually exposes himself <e> <s> we all know cases of this kind at least if you live my life you do <e> <s> this is not doing any harm to anybody except in the nature of nuisance on the other hand that is the <e>", "<cs> i take it that the word supervision which in this context usually means a probation service explicitly does not apply to the probation service here <e> <s> it is important that we should not land this kind of thing on the probation service without saying so and without demanding further resources for them because otherwise they would not be able to do it <e> <s> i want confirmation but i believe i am right in thinking that that is excluded in the terms of the amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness lady masham of ilton is perfectly right <e> <s> this seems to me to be a very important point indeed <e> <s> i believe that there has been some confusion in the governments mind between doing something as a desirable accompaniment to an act and insisting on it <e> <s> it seems to me that what the noble lord is saying is that where the mental health tribunal considers that the patient needs a bit of looking after it cannot order a discharge without making some kind of recommendation that the patient should be looked after <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble baroness who proposed the amendment would insist on this being compulsory <e> <s> i do not believe that that was her intention and it need not be <e>", "<cs> may i say one word about procedure here <e> <s> may i suggest that the noble lord the minister gives an indication of whether he can accept either and if so which of these amendments in which case we will all agree to that <e> <s> if he is going to accept neither then we wish to know which we will go for <e> <s> if it is in order i should like to suggest that the noble lord lord wallace should speak again <e> <s> we have said from this bench and the liberal bench that we will support him if necessary <e> <s> would he support us if necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i must agree with the last speaker <e> <s> i am absolutely certain that as things stand at present we shall have increased traffic problems and i am particularly grateful to the noble lord lord balfour of inchrye for raising this question at this moment <e> <s> it seems to me that all of us are going to say variations on the same theme <e> <s> however there are three or four absolutely obvious things which could be done which must be done and i hope that this debate will make them clear <e>", "<cs> would the noble baroness explain what has means <e>", "<cs> this is an interesting and rather intricate point <e> <s> i think that there should be a difference between delegating function and delegating power <e> <s> in the case of the arts council it was the governments intention expressed in an act that funds should be handed in bulk to the arts council and the distribution of them broken down by the council keeping the minister at arms length from artistic judgment <e> <s> that is a perfectly sensible arrangement with which i think most of us would agree <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the question of students can the noble lord explain why people coming to work here are treated i think quite correctly with exemption and students are not <e> <s> students are coming here to work and it seems to me that the government have done so much damage already to students that they ought to be very careful about this matter <e> <s> i should like to support the noble lord lord gladwyn and the noble lord from the front bench who spoke in begging the government to reconsider this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that after listening to this debate i am not entirely happy about the situation <e> <s> if the doctor who is in charge for some reason is not there he appoints some-body else to carry out his function <e> <s> that is how the clause reads <e> <s> in those circumstances it is not only a question of good practice but one of essential practice that the doctor who is brought in who may be anybody it is not defined should have a look at the patient <e> <s> i cannot see any way out of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to support particularly the last remark of my noble friend on the front bench <e> <s> we are quite prepared to support this order but we are anxious that the noble lord and his colleagues should be fully aware that when the facts which you have got to face are particularly difficult as in northern ireland altering the set-up of departments has very little to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not take advantage of the debate on this order as i did last time to make a number of general comments beyond agreeing with the peroration of the noble lord lord blease in which he listed all the things which are so terribly wrong in northern ireland things of which the minister is fully aware but which need restating and i am glad lord blease restated them <e> <s> i shall be very interested in the answers to the questions all of which were of a general kind asked by my noble friend on the liberal front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that it is frightfully important to know what we are talking about <e> <s> it is on page of the noble earls notes to us under class i vote two lines from the bottom of the paragraph in subhead a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> one does learn something new every day <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord has the right to speak <e> <s> i should like it to be made absolutely clear whether he has or not <e> <s> he has not spoken yet <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether i am misunderstanding but why is it so much worse for the defendant if the plaintiff can say that he has already established a <e>", "<cs> having listened very carefully to the arguments i shall advise my noble friends to support the amendment <e> <s> i want to say only one thing apart from acknowledging the same debt which the noble lord lord hawke does i too travel free with the greatest of pleasure <e> <s> the point of the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that many of us who are interested in this subject are not specially critical of the opticians for making too much money <e> <s> we are critical of the government for allowing them to have a monopoly <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the glasses that i am now wearing and through which i see extremely well cost dollars in new york across the counter <e> <s> why should the british public be deprived of this perfectly reasonable outlet for their money in order to improve their sight or to make it worse as they prefer <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that owing to the rather foolish convention by which third and later speakers must ask questions and not make comments i shall ask him several times whether he is aware of things which i think he probably is aware of <e> <s> is the noble earl aware for example that from this bench we endorse entirely this latest effort to return gradually to devolved government <e> <s> is he aware that we have always taken the view that direct rule was not permanent but only temporary <e> <s> is he aware that we cannot produce effective politicians unless they are allowed to take part in government as well as politics <e> <s> is he aware that one of the difficulties in northern ireland over the past few years since government was exercised at stormont has been that no responsible duties at all have been laid on politicians <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we found a number of very competent and effective politicians in the stormont experiment and that it is a great pity that it was sabotaged <e>", "<cs> my lords from this bench we have never yet differed on a vote with my old friend and colleague lord blease <e> <s> i am very glad that he is not taking this to a vote because if he did i should have to differ from him <e> <s> the only objection to this order that i can see

not be sentenced to custodial service anyway so it is in no way parallel to building a prison <e>", "<cs> may i briefly support the opening speaker here <e> <s> he has raised two points one pro and one against <e> <s> the pro point is the increased flexibility which the home office and the prison department very much require <e> <s> to have one youth service covering the whole gamut of youth

but i should like more backing for it <e> <s> anyway i am grateful for what the noble lord has said and i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will accept that but i am not entirely happy <e> <s> it does not seem to me that a sanction for breaking is the same as a new offence <e> <s> it seems to me a wrong use of words and i believe the noble lord should look at this <e>

should like to support this amendment but briefly because the noble baroness lady birk said pretty well all that there is to be said about it <e> <s> it is absurd to encourage conditions which the people who have to ensure that they are carried out believe to he impossible <e> <s> this is what the national association of probation officers say about these negative conditions and they are supported by the association of directors of social services who are the other side of the picture here <e>", "<cs> it is curious to hear that the views of the people who will have to operate this provision have been completely ignored in this way <e> <s> let there be no misunderstanding <e> <s> the people who have to deal with this are the probation service and the national association of probation officers both the noble baroness and i have informed the government of this think that it is unworkable <e> <s> what is the point of instructing people to do something which they who have to operate it think is unworkable <e> <s> it seems very lacking in understanding not at least to look at this again and to talk to somebody about it <e> <s> it is so very difficult to make any progress

said <e>", "<cs> it would be very ungracious for me not to say that i am very happy to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the noble lord for giving us notice that the government intend to introduce a curfew order <e> <s> if i may have the noble lords attention for a moment perhaps i may ask that we be given proper notice of this because whether the curfew order is good or bad

very carefully and i hope that we shall be given proper notice of it <e>", "<cs> the parliamentary all-party group on penal affairs did go rather further than this amendment and made a recommendation that care orders should no longer be an available option in criminal proceedings at all <e> <s> we are not moving an amendment to that effect but that is what most of us in the group would hope to have <e> <s> we take the view that a care order is something which should be put on a child who needs help and not one who needs punishment <e> <s> we have fallen back on a number of amendments to safeguard the use of the criminal form of the care order <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend speaks may i clear up a question of words <e> <s> custody does not in the english language or in law so far as i know mean secure custody <e> <s> somebody who goes to an open prison is in custody and somebody who is in residential care is i should have thought in custody in the ordinary sense of the word <e>", "<cs> the noble baronesses from the all-party penal affairs group have put the case so well that i need not delay the committee at all beyond saying that the kind of child who has to try to represent himself is either inarticulate or too articulate and has no idea at all of how to make his case <e> <s> if one regarded a care order as something done for the benefit of the child at his home then that is one thing but i maintain that a residential care order of a criminal kind is a form of custody and in my opinion no child should be sent into any form of custody without legal representation <e> <s> i believe this is absolutely basic <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble baroness will insist upon this amendment if she has to do so <e> <s> the presence of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on the front bench makes me think that he almost certainly agrees with what i am saying <e> <s> if i am wrong i still hope that the noble baroness will insist <e>", "<cs> having had a very helpful discussion with the noble and learned lord i shall say only that i support the amendment and l am quite certain that some review should exist <e> <s> i should have thought that a review by the juvenile courts was as good a way as any other <e>", "<cs> like the noble baroness i prefer amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i want to refer to something that the noble lord said in defence against amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> he said that if you review the custody under a residential care order of a criminal sentence and you do not do the same under a civil arrangement you are putting the two people in different categories <e> <s> this is the argument against the criminal care order <e> <s> it is clear that it is wrong that this should happen <e> <s> but it is still clearer that somebody who is under a sentence should not fail to have his sentence reviewed because somebody who is put in a similar position for his own good and convenience because there is nowhere else to send him has no arrangements of this kind <e> <s> the reply is absolutely unsatisfactory and i hope that at the end of these two amendments we can get a better reply out of the noble lord because that is not an answer that one could accept for one moment <e> <s> if somebody is sentenced to however simple a custodial sentence which a residential care order is there must be some system of reviewing how long he stays there which does not apply to somebody who is under a civil care order which is entirely different <e> <s> perhaps we can hear some more about this later <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the example of the noble baroness and say simply that i support the opposition front bench and the admirable speech made by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> a great deal <e>", "<cs> i am not quite understanding what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i have proposed adding some words to the conditions <e> <s> i want to know whether the government agree with that or not <e> <s> i am really not interested in the rest of it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that support <e> <s> what i cannot understand is why if it is right to say to abscond or to injure or to damage or take some other persons property in the bill it should not be right to extend those very slightly in the bill <e> <s> why have we to wait for regulations <e> <s> it seems to be a total <e>", "<cs> i am grateful and with that assurance am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i was an early member of the jellicoe committee and of course we were unanimous in our condemnation of adjudication

authority <e> <s> these are very useful and very important functions and i strongly support the amendment with the reservations which have been made by both lady trumpington and lord avebury <e>",

long but it is important that we should realise that clause gives us the opportunity of using executive release to deal with our problems <e> <s> the government are refusing to use these powers <e>

now reply <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i welcome the opportunity rather a rare one of agreeing entirely with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter on this case and hope that the government will think about it very seriously <e> <s> all of us who are concerned with the heritage and the arts have begged the treasury from all angles to do things about vat in different cases and i hope that the noble lord will pursue this with his colleagues <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this very simple amendment -because of its simplicity <e> <s> what it really says is that years

been through that <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i should like to point out that under the present amendment it can mean that <e> <s> nobody would suggest that a person who commits the more savage kind of crime should automatically be given parole after years <e> <s> there is no suggestion of that at all <e> <s> the only suggestion is that he should have the right for his case

i should like to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> as a long-time member of the national farmers union i can do no less than support this amendment <e>", "<cs> the amendment is wrongly drafted but what the amendment is trying to do is as clear as a bell and i hope that the noble lord will take the point <e>", "<cs> may we get this absolutely clear <e> <s> i am fully aware that if the offender applies he can get it <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the clerk to whom he would have to pay it can demand it without the offender applying <e> <s> that is the point i am not clear about <e>", "<cs> i am very satisfied with that <e> <s> there is a subtle difference between the two and i think our way from the point of view of what we are all trying to achieve would be more effective <e> <s>

comments <e>", "<cs> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very happy to support the noble earl in the shortest possible way by saying that if there are any objections

are all sorts of difficulties and i could easily reply from the front bench opposite about those difficulties but the point of a really progressive ministry is to deal with difficulties and not just to brush them aside and continue to do nothing as we have for year after year <e> <s> i believe this to be an absolute test of the governments willingness to supersede the arguments which it will have from its officials inevitably because there are difficulties and say this is what we can do and what we will do <e> <s> i hope that that is what the noble lord will say <e>", "<cs> may i say that too

"<cs> my lords the noble lords argument is very difficult to understand <e> <s> the position roughly speaking is that we all agree with him that there has been a sad falling off in the use of

executing that remedy disagrees <e> <s> this really is not a very serious argument <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to speak again with the leave of the house and put up something more serious <e>

has said but i should like to add that the proceedings during this bill have not indicated that the home secretary is taking much notice of the very grave and serious warnings which mr pearce gave in

amendment was really by way of a probing amendment and the noble lord on the front bench has given us a very adequate reply with which i personally am satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may support the amendment without interfering with the legislative argument i would only like to say that so much of the good intentions of every government has fallen down through lack of enough money for the

withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that he will and that he will come back to it on third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i must associate myself with those remarks <e> <s> we have been opposite one

distinction can be made with absolute clarity between care and secure care <e> <s> i see no problem and i think that we should pursue this <e>", "<cs> i was a little puzzled by the remarks of the noble baroness lady faithfull because the two amendments are in no way inconsistent <e> <s> the second amendment limits the times at which any sort of restriction order can he put on <e> <s> the first

service want this they should have it <e>", "<cs> my lords as someone who used to smoke and who does drink i regard nicotine alcohol and cannabis as being more or less on a par <e> <s> i think that any nation or government which has never had nicotine would he right to stop it coming in and that any government who had never permitted alcohol would he right to stop it coming in <e> <s> so i think the government are correct in trying to stop the growth of cannabis but in so far as any cannabis does get in a person who uses it for his own purposes and who does not sell it is in my opinion in exactly the same position as most people in this house <e> <s> it is ridiculous to suggest that imprisonment is a suitable penalty in this case <e> <s> certainly those concerned can be fined <e> <s>

arguments but with the intention of contributing a little abrasiveness perhaps to what i think has been an over-indulgent discussion of rather a monstrous small but very ugly event <e> <s> throughout the proceedings on the criminal justice bill we were assured and we asked about it again and again that the government appreciated the importance of the probation service that they recognised that the

think they are wildly furiously and hopelessly wrong and dangerously wrong too <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble baroness whom i have not heard in this house since several years ago when she used to give me a lot of trouble when i was on the other side <e> <s> i am going to follow the main point that she has been making in a moment but i should like to say a couple of things first <e> <s> incidentally i am going to be very careful not to say anything to offend my noble friend lord longford because i do not think i have ever taken part in a northern ireland debate without getting a letter of apology from him the next morning <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord moved this amendment with admirable clarity and admirable conciseness and from this bench we are very happy to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to welcome this statement from the government <e> <s> direct intervention of this kind is absolutely warranted by the very difficult state of conditions in northern ireland and in my opinion we could do with a good deal more of it elsewhere but that is another point <e> <s> i am particularly pleased that the first thing which is suggested the new grant of up to per cent <e> <s> of corporation tax payable has been specifically supported in advance by the assembly because this makes the assembly feel that it is at any rate being listened to by the government which is important <e> <s> we welcome the intervention whole-heartedly <e> <s> the noble earl gave my noble friend from the liberal benches an estimate for one of the items <e> <s> will there be an estimate for the cost of the whole package because i think we should like to see it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to this argument with the greatest of interest <e> <s> to begin with i was rather in favour of the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble lord lord mishcon has concentrated on paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment in so far as it is a means of legitimising through the bill the business of mail order <e> <s> it seems to me that mail order is a decent sort of business <e> <s> it is on the whole well conducted by major companies although there may be some which do not and it is an endeavour to find out what people want and then give it to them <e> <s> that seems to me to be desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not include a stockbrokers advice for example i imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl leaves that point will he allow me to ask a question because we have no right of reply and we must clear things up as we go <e> <s> is the noble earl denying the trend of the figures that all three speakers have quoted <e> <s> i am quite prepared to accept the figures which he gives about certain money being spent <e> <s> we are talking about a trend which is downwards we think catastrophically downwards <e> <s> is the noble earl saying that that is simply not true <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that when the bbc rather carelessly <e>", "<cs> first my lords i must say how much i was moved and impressed by the introduction of the noble lord lord bethell <e> <s> he covered the situation in the greatest detail and i have little to add to what he said except that i promise solid support from this bench for the implications of all he had to say <e> <s> secondly the noble baroness lady birk made an excellent speech and in particular raised the point which was also raised by the noble lord lord avebury about appeals <e> <s> that is an issue to which we shall have to return although it is not a subject with which we need deal tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords we too support the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry that the noble earl has watered down his amendment <e> <s> i believe that the amendment is an essential one and that it is essential that in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a great pleasure to follow the noble baroness who made such an agreeable speech from her most mobile stance or seat <e> <s> i am never quite sure whether she speaks from the cross-benches or from the tory benches <e>", "<cs> my lords from one or two of the things that the noble baroness said i suspected so but i very much respect the line she took particularly over the disabled with regard to both the cordless telephone and the extremely important business of the blind operators <e> <s> i am sure that the government will be just as keen to work this as we all are <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not put it quite in those terms but i am aware that they thought that the additions which are contained in this bill are very much more satisfactory than the old provisions <e> <s> i said that this was caused through the lobbying of people like the nfu <e> <s> i did not say they were satisfied or dissatisfied with this if the noble lord will allow me to continue <e> <s> these statements of the department will not be in the bill and can have no legal force <e> <s> as one speaker mentioned there is no promise that new provision for distant and expensive facilities will not be charged at an exorbitant price <e>", "<cs> i find it impossible to support this amendment on the ground that one should not invent new reasons for sending people to prison when informed opinion is perfectly clear that first it does not do them any good when one has done so and secondly that it does not act as a deterrent to people who do not understand our mode of thought <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down may i point out that neither i nor i think the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey gave the overcrowding of prisons which we all admit to be disgraceful as a reason for what we said <e> <s> both of us i speak for myself but i think for him also believe that to send someone to prison where it can do him or her no good where it has no deterrent effect and where the people do not understand the reason for it is ridiculous and we oppose it <e>", "<cs> i do not feel that either the noble lord lord mcintosh of haringey or <e>", "<cs> is it not true to say that no doctor would perform a sex change operation except for the benefit of the health of the subject <e> <s> is that not covered by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am awfully pleased that the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls is going to put aside his own prejudices and start again <e> <s> this will be very nice for all of us because we are very used to those prejudices we know them very well we have heard them very often <e> <s> the noble lord told the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale that he was not going to follow him because he was going to make a political speech in relation to the debate <e> <s> he is perfectly entitled to do so but i find political debate of this kind extremely boring and i am not going to reply in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not by any means always agree with the noble lord lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> the noble lord sometimes expresses his views rather more strongly than i should <e> <s> however i stand behind his general approach to clause and i shall come back to that <e> <s> it is the crux of the debate <e> <s> but before doing so i propose unlike many noble lords here to make a short second reading speech <e> <s> most of the speeches have been committee stage speeches <e> <s> we are accustomed to doing things the other way round <e> <s> there is hardly a committee stage that does not contain a number of second reading speeches <e> <s> today is rather unusual <e> <s> this is because you have all heard it before <e>", "<cs> i remain rather puzzled by this but i daresay the noble lord the minister can help me <e> <s> supposing the entry says this is a good man and he is suitable for promotion or supposing it says this is not a very good man and he is not suitable for promotion is that an intention or is it not <e> <s> it seems to be a very obscure definition and one that is not clear at all to me <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord because i think that he has made a valid point <e> <s> the capability of the equipment is changing week by week and i think it far better to deal with the operation rather than the equipment <e> <s> i am happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord says that he only uses it for that purpose <e> <s> i imagine that the noble lord means on that occasion <e>", "<cs> that is a very important condition <e>", "<cs> i have to agree with the noble lord lord mishcon that this bill can well be described as half-baked but my own view is that it would be even more half-baked if we tried to include written records rather than limiting it to the new technology which is the new danger <e> <s> it seems to me that it is impossible to do it right and that as the noble lord lord mottistone says this is a first step <e> <s> it is absolutely vital to get built into the bill which so far the government have not properly done means of altering the procedures as we go along <e> <s> when we come to talk about the advisory committee and related matters that will be the time to discuss it <e>", "<cs> it is true that he did not give the names to don elvira but he probably had an accurate list <e> <s> that is a frivolous example but it shows how difficult it would be to deal with the records and i am glad that we are not trying to do so <e> <s> i think that we are failing to deal with the computerised records <e> <s> however at least i support the effort <e>", "<cs> may i make a quick comment <e> <s> there seems to be some confusion in the mind of the minister about archives <e> <s> archives are always as complete as they can be <e> <s> that is what the word in its modern sense means they are cross-indexed through computers in a way they never could have been in the old days <e> <s> for example the british institute of recorded sound has a copy of every record that has ever been produced bar one or two they have not been able to get hold of and of every broadcast made <e> <s> these are or eventually will be fully cross-indexed <e> <s> this seems to me an abosulutely legitimate part of the collection of information for posterity <e> <s> the fact that the bbc is going to use it for news is quite irrelevant <e> <s> they are wholly entitled to do this in any case <e>", "<cs> would it not be helpful to have the next amendment discussed at the same time <e>", "<cs> this is on the whole the most important amendment we have come to yet today in my opinion <e> <s> i said on second reading that whenever the bill differed from the lindop report it seemed to me to be wrong <e> <s> this is a very major omission <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mishcon said the lindop report set great store not by exactly what the noble and learned lord has moved in his amendment but by something even stronger <e> <s> we are prepared to accept the amendment of the noble and learned lord as being the most we are likely to get but it is most awfully important that the performance of this lonely registrar with his half dozen helpers dealing with a very large number of things in an entirely new way should have proper advice and advice which has the backing of a statutory position <e>", "<cs> i only want to ask whether i heard the noble lord aright <e> <s> he said that there might be a need <e> <s> if that is what he thinks we are miles apart <e>", "<cs> i must make one point <e> <s> the noble lord has been here all this afternoon and has not seen the tape <e> <s> on the tape he will see that a new brontosaurus has been discovered in sussex with an absolutely different kind of claw from any previous brontosaurus and therefore showing its power to evolve <e>", "<cs> unlike most other noble lords in the committee i do not think that i have spoken on this clause before <e> <s> i think everybody else has <e> <s> however the noble and learned lord has said enough for me to be brief <e> <s> from these benches and i think from all parts of the committee we are ashamed of the fact that this will almost certainly fail to satisfy the convention <e> <s> we have had too many cases in the past where this has happened <e> <s> we feel that it is important not to expose ourselves again particularly in such a disagreeable way <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to clarify one point <e> <s> he said that although there were a number of aspects which did not involve breaking the law it was important for the immigration authorities to know them <e> <s> i do not know what they would be <e> <s> but if they do not break the law why should they not say so <e> <s> why must they conceal from the data subject that they want to know whether he had an aunt in timbuktu or somewhere <e> <s> to me the noble lord has made no case at all and i think that before we finally vote whether now or on report we must have an explanation <e> <s> it really has no meaning whatever <e> <s> if the immigration authorities think that somebody may be trying to get here or approach his cousin or something of that sort surely if it is not illegal they can say we are trying to find out because we thought you wanted to approach your cousin <e> <s> i cannot understand it at all <e>", "<cs> as a co-signatory to the amendment i would prefer not to divide the committee on this but to consider what the noble lord has said because it seems to me that the fact that the liability is exactly the same now as it was before the bill is a relevant argument <e> <s> i am not entirely happy <e> <s> i hope my noble friend will withdraw the amendment and look at it again for report because it has been a long and difficult argument and it is rather a complicated situation <e>", "<cs> i do not want to say a lot about this matter but i think that the noble lords advice about how difficult this would be to operate in the computer world is absolutely remote from the facts <e> <s> all of these things including stamping the envelope could be done at the beginning of each entry <e> <s> this is what computers do <e> <s> there are a series of functions that have to be carried out <e> <s> they could all be done by way of a single though rather complex order to the computer <e> <s> the idea that it is labour intensive shows no appreciation at all of what we are talking about <e> <s> however i do not wish to encourage my noble friend to press the amendment <e> <s> i just think that the noble lords evasion of it was inadequate <e>", "<cs> i know that the committee is very hungry and i shall be brief <e> <s> i was about to speak on this matter on the question that the clause stand part of the bill but my noble friend has tabled an amendment so i shall say just a few words about the amendment <e> <s> for a good many years i was chairman of the national committee of the family service units <e> <s> they are social work units which take the most difficult families in the area and try to sort out their problems <e> <s> in the days when i was connected with them which was years or more ago the reports used to be extremely frank and very often quite unrepeatable and with very good reason <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one point <e> <s> it is very important to remember that records of this kind will be referred to from years ago so that there must be a retrospective cut <e> <s> the bill must not apply to records made before the bill becomes law <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first opportunity i have had to address the noble earl when he is moving an order from the front bench on the other side <e> <s> it gives me the chance to congratulate him on joining that nearly round dozen now of noble lords on both sides of the house who have served over there and lately our group has been distinguished by the arrival of the noble viscount the leader of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the custom in this house over the last three years has been that the two first speakers are replied to and that we were discouraged from getting up before the noble lord had replied to them <e> <s> therefore i am somewhat disturbed to be told that i am in the wrong when i am clear that this is the course of action that we have employed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am also grateful to the noble lord for having listened to our arguments <e> <s> i share the hesitation of the noble lord lord mcintosh in thinking that the amendment is sufficient but it is certainly necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i am inclined to support this amendment although it is a little difficult to visualise exactly the conditions in which it would be necessary <e> <s> i suppose that if one were using a word processor to prepare a report on the maze prison escape for example one would describe the type of things we shall doubtless hear this afternoon in a great deal of detail and one could alter it as one went along and further information came in <e> <s> and one would not mention names <e> <s> that i suppose is really the point <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish from these benches both of them or all four of them to echo the sympathy to the family of the prison officer who was killed and to express our great admiration of the fighting spirit of the prison officers in the maze who are essentially on extremely dangerous active service and one must never forget that <e> <s> what it seems to me remains to be said today is simply that the key moment was getting the guns into block <e> <s> once guns are in a prison anything may happen <e> <s> that seems to be the key to which we shall look for the answer when the inquiry is finally made <e>", "<cs> my lords one could add an objection to the defence of the noble lord lord mottistone of the governments obduracy which is i hope only temporary <e> <s> clauses and actually say what the advisory bodies should do <e> <s> this does not apply to the millions of people who are giving advice <e> <s> they have no limitations or instructions and if one has a body which tells one what to do and which also must be consulted before changes are made that is something very different from what the noble lord says we have already <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mottistone that what one wants to see is various branches of the industry getting together drawing up a code going to the registrar and asking whether such a code would do <e> <s> the registrar would then vet it <e> <s> everyone has been in favour of that from the word go and it is clearly the most flexible way of handling anything as complicated and as constantly changing and developing as this industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for what he has said <e> <s> i do not propose to divide the house at this stage because it is a difficult point <e> <s> however it seems to me that a data subject who will be being advised by definition more or less by professionals will from time to time want to know whether there is anything held about him <e> <s> i think it would upset him very much indeed not to be answered <e> <s> to say that there is a file on him but that he is not going to be told why for the reasons dealt with in the next amendment seems to me to he an impossible position hut that is the position in which we are left at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would speak again only to say that in view of what has been said i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a long and complicated amendment and i propose to make quite a long speech <e> <s> would it not be better to dine first <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear that the governments mind is not made up <e> <s> that takes us a long way because this is a changing situation in the thought of the people concerned <e> <s> i have changed my mind completely in the past year as a result of talking to the people who are concerned <e> <s> i am very surprised at having been able to do so but i am quite clear that this is right and i hope the government will follow <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not quite understand the noble lords argument <e> <s> as i see it the amendment states that it shall not be a condition <e>", "<cs> my lords i must express a small doubt about this <e> <s> i have been concerned in my professional career with problems in northern ireland and police and terrorists <e> <s> there is not the slightest doubt that the difficulty of getting information which leads to an arrest involves all sorts of rather disagreeable methods from which we the citizens benefit <e> <s> occasionally these methods are exposed and the police get into trouble <e> <s> i am unhappy about any amendment which is going to make the position of the police in getting information about serious crime more difficult than it now is <e> <s> it seems to me that this amendment does that and i therefore express a doubt at this moment <e> <s> i could be convinced otherwise but i express a doubt <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the exposition of the trustees would be so well informed so interesting and so moving that it would not be necessary for me to add to it <e> <s> i did make some notes but they would not have enabled me to make comments so elegant as those we have already heard and so i have thrown them away <e> <s> i wish to make only two points <e> <s> first i believe it is desirable that someone who is not a trustee should speak as well in opposition to this bill <e> <s> i am by nature a consumer of art rather than an artist or a collector <e> <s> up until the age of about that was all that i had ever been <e> <s> then i suddenly found myself in the important and interesting position of being an administrator who could hurt or help the arts <e> <s> obviously i tried to help them <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the bill is better than when it first appeared but it could be a great deal better than it is and i hope that it will be by the time it leaves the other place <e> <s> meanwhile i am grateful to the noble lord the minister for his courtesy during our discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i check back on a part of his earlier argument about which i was a little puzzled <e> <s> was the instance of hereditary dockers given as an example which the noble lord thought should be followed in legislation or as a warning to us not to follow it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord gisborough has made a lot of points some of which i agree with but more of which i think i do not agree with <e> <s> it is too late to go into detailed argument across the floor and so the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow him in detail <e> <s> i did notice that he examined the speakers list very closely before he said anything about womens equality he saw that there was no noble baroness to follow and so he took the risk <e> <s> i will not follow him in that either <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess my feeling of admiration for the homework which has been done by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> i looked at the order fairly carefully and i could not find a single question to ask <e> <s> however i suppose that that is the difference between industry and idleness <e> <s> i did take the trouble to ring up the northern ireland office and was assured that this order was simply bringing northern ireland into line with our arrangements here <e>", "<cs> my lords we in the alliance in both parties wish to be associated with the horror which has been expressed by the secretary of state and we thank the noble earl for repeating the statement today <e> <s> those noble lords who heard lord fitts maiden speech a few minutes ago will realise that we can say very little to improve upon what he said in his disgust and horror at this intolerable action <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to speak without having put my name on the list <e> <s> this was due to a fault between me and my chief which we have not yet resolved <e> <s> i thought this bill would go through in two minutes <e> <s> everybody must agree with the enabling power in this bill <e> <s> the one thing we want the government to do is to let somerset house for the purposes very clearly and with respect to the noble lord lord houghton very restrictively described in clause <e> <s> i am not quite clear what he is worrying about but we shall come back to that <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment one can buy under nhs rules spectacles on prescription for a price of something like to and for the same sort of thing one is apt to pay to through a registered optician <e> <s> does it mean that the price will go up to or instead of the or under the nhs <e> <s> secondly may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the main objection to the monopoly of the opticians has been that it is based on a false premise that to use glasses not prescribed by a proper doctor can hurt your eyes <e> <s> the general view of all competent oculists professors of optics and others is that it does your eyes no harm whatever to use glasses which are not the best for your eyes to see through it is just tiresome <e> <s> this is a very bad reason for a monopoly <e> <s> i should like to welcome this move in the right direction but to question whether it has gone nearly far enough <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment having two grandchildren of <e>", "<cs> what difference does it make <e>", "<cs> in fact what happens and i happen to know of a particular case is that the man refuses to work and the wife does not get any money that is all <e> <s> the court cannot do anything about it <e>", "<cs> i must come back once again <e> <s> there is a very great difference as a rule between the man who refuses to earn more money and the woman who does not see how she can <e> <s> i do not at all like the idea nor do a lot of other people like the idea i have heard many complaints about this of a court telling a woman that she ought to go out and get a job when it is very difficult for her to do so <e> <s> this has caused great offence i think rather unreasonably and i hope that the noble and learned lord will take it into consideration <e> <s> it is a very important view of a great many perfectly reasonable people who do not include me <e>", "<cs> my lords the two parties on these benches associate ourselves fully with everything that has been said and i shall not say it again <e> <s> one is really lost for words <e> <s> month after month we are getting up from these benches and responding to statements about barbarism of this kind first from one side and then from the other <e> <s> my old friend lord fitt will speak later he knew the murdered man well so i shall make no personal comments <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to reply to the noble lord <e> <s> it seems to me that he ignores the fact that in most cases of the kind that we are discussing the awards are made as consent orders with negotiation of the amounts to be paid taking place between solicitors before the registrar <e> <s> so this is not a general criticism of the courts which one may well say could be trusted to act properly <e> <s> it is much more the point that in trying to get the most that he can for his client the solicitor refers to the bill and puts forward an argument which in due course the other solicitor gives way to <e> <s> am told that that happens quite frequently <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down can i be clear that it is the first amendment on the list of amendments that will be reconsidered <e>", "<cs> i should like to say from these benches that we shall inevitably support the amendment but if i had been handling it i should have waited to hear what the draftsman had to say <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the point of view expressed by the noble lord lord tordoff <e> <s> the one thing that i should be sorry to lose from the amendment if it is not accepted is the nursery school side which the noble and learned lord said in a way that i could not understand would harm the child <e> <s> i did not understand that <e> <s> it is not important <e> <s> what seems to me important is that it is not general practice throughout the country to give pre-five year-old education to children <e> <s> an awful lot of families do not do so <e> <s> it is not compulsory <e> <s> it is in a different category to compulsory education and what follows it <e>", "<cs> i know my noble friend lord mcgregor who will be here later but probably too late for what matters considers this to be probably the most important matter on the whole bill <e> <s> he will be very pleased at the noble and learned lords reply <e> <s> i take it that the noble and learned lord is telling us that basically he agrees that this research ought to be done and perhaps on a wider scale which is obviously more desirable <e> <s> even if there is a restriction of money i would plead that it should be begun even if it is on a smaller scale <e> <s> in any case the noble and learned lord agrees that this is something which should be done and therefore we are happy to leave it to him to come and tell us in due course what will be done and how it will he done <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> it does indeed give me a measure of satisfaction <e> <s> i will read extremely carefully what the noble and learned lord has said to see whether it is a full measure <e> <s> for the moment i will with the leave of the house beg to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may add one word the chinese of course were talking of reconciliation and we are talking about conciliation but at a much later stage <e> <s> however there is a machinery which exists there is a court welfare officer whose business it is to find out the facts from the parties and report to the judge <e> <s> the judge then makes the decision on the report he is given <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord the minister aware that it is generally thought by people who are interested in these affairs that the present standards as maintained in her majestys prisons are well below the standards <e>", "<cs> my lords we welcome the order as bringing the law in northern ireland into line with the law in this country <e> <s> we bear in mind that it is particularly suitable in northern ireland because there much more than here the nonpayment of dues has been used as a political weapon <e> <s> any strength that we can give to the law to enforce payment of judgment debts should be supported <e> <s> i should also like to welcome to the dispatch box the noble lord who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow my noble friend if i may so call him that in two particular ways <e> <s> first of all the noble earl gave us a clear and succinct account of what this paper stands for and i found it useful <e> <s> i knew that my noble friend from the labour front bench would ask all the questions i was going to ask and i thought that i should be lucky if i had any left <e> <s> i have one or two but very few <e>", "<cs> my lords my point was that there is no value in computerisation unless one destroys jobs and i do not believe that the government are in a position to destroy jobs in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> my lords each time this order comes up for renewal i say yes without the slightest hesitation <e> <s> with things as they are today nobody in his right mind would hesitate to agree to the order <e> <s> i make only one comment <e> <s> it has always seemed to me quite wrong that people who openly advocate terrorism should be allowed to elect their colleagues to parliament or to the assembly <e> <s> i was very pleased to read in the newspapers that the secretary of state was considering how long this privilege should be allowed to sinn fein <e> <s> i have made my views clear several times <e> <s> i think that its members should not be allowed to take part in democratic assemblies as long as they openly support violence <e> <s> the ira was made illegal for that reason <e> <s> one of the protestant terror gangs the uvf was also made illegal <e> <s> both those moves were right and i do not think that either of them did any harm <e> <s> it would be a good thing if the same were done with this organisation <e> <s> meanwhile i am happy to approve the order <e>", "<cs> they have had their dinner which is more than we have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to support this motion <e>", "<cs> my lords am i to understand from what the noble earl said

<e> <s> i welcome the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i greatly enjoy the speeches of the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor when he gets into top gear though i must say that i enjoy them more when i do not agree with them and unfortunately this time i do <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord lord mishcon is right to point out that one or two of the adjectives used by the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor in describing the speech of the right reverend prelate were perhaps a little extreme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for repeating the secretary of states statement <e> <s> it is a very frank statement and one which i think covers both sides of this extraordinarily difficult situation <e> <s> ten years ago i had ministerial responsibility for the northern ireland prisons <e> <s> i was enormously impressed by the courage and endurance of the governors the assistant governors and the prison officers who dealt with a situation which was almost untenable <e> <s> it was perfectly clear to me as well as to every governor that they were each and every one of them sitting on a mine which might go up at any minute <e> <s> this is to some extent true of all prisons but it was very much truer in northern ireland than it is here <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble earl says that there is no information available about the types of training does he mean that he has not asked for it <e> <s> i simply cannot believe that it is not available because it is part of the governments policy <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way for a moment <e> <s> he has quoted a number of figures <e> <s> i shall be quoting the same figures but i will interpret them in an absolutely different way <e> <s> i just wished to make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always a pleasure to follow an hereditary peer from what i may describe as the younger generation who has made by far the most radical speech of the day <e> <s> i do not agree with a word of it so i shall not follow it in any sense except that what i am going to say i hope will be largely on the other side <e> <s> but first i must say with what pleasure i heard the admirable maiden speech of my noble friend i must call him so lord henderson of brompton <e> <s> it is and has been a tradition in this house that maiden speeches make <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will pay attention to what my noble friend lord ezra said <e> <s> the reason i favour this amendment is that this is the first place in the bill where the consumer can get any attention at all and i agree with the noble lord lord weinstock that the position is in many ways entirely unsatisfactory <e> <s> we have amendments tabled on clause but as my noble friend lord ezra pointed out the committees with which we should have to fiddle about to get some proper consumer representation would be appointed by the director general which is quite clearly not the right way to appoint consumer representation <e>", "<cs> this house lost by a very narrow majority by four votes an attempt to introduce more influence of parliament to this appointment and to this whole bill <e> <s> i have enjoyed disagreeing with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for many years very much and i am embrarrassed to find it very difficult to disagree with him in what he says <e> <s> the truth is that the proposed select committee is in the first place a political appointment <e> <s> there will be a majority of the party in power on the select committee so it is not non <e>", "<cs> or by the alliance <e>", "<cs> with respect if any noble lord wishes the amendment not to be withdrawn we have the right to continue the conversation <e>", "<cs> i wish to make only two remarks <e> <s> i think it an awful pity that it should take minutes to move an amendment so obvious as this one <e> <s> i think it also a great pity that not a single amendment from the centre benches on this side of the chamber has been moved in less than minutes <e> <s> having said that i believe that what the amendment proposes is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> the only answer that there can be to it is that what it proposes is already included in the bill or the government are to do it and the whole matter could very well have been dealt with in three minutes <e>", "<cs> the noble lord referred to my saying that the amendment was obvious <e> <s> it is obvious that before you make appointments you consult trade unions <e> <s> it is not obvious that you put it in the bill <e>", "<cs> until the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones spoke i was rather doubtful whether this amendment should be supported <e> <s> but i think if it is necessary to put the same thing in twice which is what the noble and learned lord has pointed out this does mean a deliberate attempt to weaken something and we are all perfectly clear that that should not be weakened <e> <s> so i feel more able to support the amendment than i was before the noble and learned lord spoke <e>", "<cs> i did not want to interrupt the noble lord in his eloquence but i should like to make a point about prices <e> <s> at the beginning the noble lord made a very curious remark <e> <s> he said that british telecom could not afford to increase prices because it would lose custom <e> <s> did i misunderstand the noble lord <e> <s> because if that is what he said i would point out that every time anybody puts up prices anywhere and this is a calculated risk it is almost inevitable that for a short period that person does lose custom <e> <s> one thinks it is worth doing in the end and so one does it <e> <s> therefore as a description of why bt would not do it with respect that seems to me to be quite meaningless <e>", "<cs> it concerned competition in rural areas <e>", "<cs> the difference between reasonable demand and need is extremely narrow <e> <s> i think that it would be wrong of the government having won an important amendment in our last session by four votes and having lost this one by votes not to be a little gracious here <e> <s> i cannot think of single case where the difference between reasonable demand and need would involve a major decision <e> <s> i suppose that one could consider an old man living alone in a cottage miles from anywhere with his friends and relations thinking that he ought to ask for a telephone but he is not taking the trouble to do so although he clearly needs one <e> <s> i suppose that that would be an example but then i think that he should probably have it <e> <s> so i am rather distressed at this rigid attitude over a difference which is so fine between the two when so much opinion within the committee has shown that this kind of change this kind of emphasis on the service part in the future is very deeply felt throughout <e>", "<cs> it may be that before long i shall have to demand an apology from the noble lord but i shall not ask for payment <e> <s> i do not expect to pay for it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister said quite clearly that he would consider it <e> <s> i think that the noble lord did not hear correctly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that those of us interested in northern ireland are grateful to him for not holding out false hopes of which we have had far too many <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the noble earl the advice that he has asked for <e> <s> there is absolutely no case for extending the causes on which people can be imprisoned <e> <s> at the moment far too many people are in prison for far too little <e> <s> although the offence to which the noble earl referred is particularly nasty and despicable imprisonment which involves or a year expenditure produces not good but total and absolute harm as is agreed by everyone <e> <s> it is ridiculous to bring in imprisonment at this stage for an offence of this nature <e> <s> i hope that the noble earls suggestion will be rejected <e>", "<cs> i do not understand the point which the noble lord makes <e> <s> my point is that one should not send people to prison when one knows that it will do no good <e> <s> generally speaking it is agreed that that kind of offence is not influenced by the sanction of prison <e> <s> i am not clear as to what the noble lord said in opposition to that <e> <s> he talked for a while-but i could not understand the direction of his argument <e>", "<cs> i think that that undoubtedly is quite a wrong description <e> <s> there is every possible doubt that the kind of person who in a malicious way rings up to damage somebody because he has offended him is affected by the fact that he might be sent to prison <e> <s> that proposition is extremely hard to justify and is almost certainly untrue <e>", "<cs> i should like to agree with my noble friend in principle particularly because of the opportunity of regionalisation and regional command which is the kind of thing that this might develop into quite well and i should like to see the bill at least make that possible <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble countess lady mar <e> <s> it seems to me that the approach of the noble lord lord bruce of donington to the noble lord lord cockfield is hardly likely to be very effective though that of the noble countess lady mar might be more effective <e> <s> we have heard from the noble lord that the government agree with the points in the amendment <e> <s> the question is whether or not they should be put into the bill <e> <s> i believe that the unhappiness and uneasiness of the staff would be eased if this were to be achieved without breaking a fundamental principle <e> <s> no fundamental principle is i believe involved <e> <s> this provides an opportunity for the noble lord to do what he has done once or twice before in the bill though in a rather different way namely to do something with the deliberate intention of reassuring the majority of the people who are concerned about their future in this monopoly <e> <s> though a per cent differentiation may end one day by becoming competitive it is certainly not competitive now <e> <s> i appeal to the noble lord on quite different grounds from my colleagues on the labour front bench <e> <s> it is worth asking him to think again about whether or not a little more could be done to meet the point <e>", "<cs> i intervene only to say from these benches that we support our noble friends immediately in front of us <e>", "<cs> i am not only pleased but also a little surprised at the modest welcome which the noble and learned lord gave to the amendment <e> <s> i am happy that the government are thinking along these lines <e> <s> we have been reduced to that as the most that we can get out of the majority of our amendments <e> <s> after all it is a good deal <e> <s> even if the government will not accept amendments the fact that they agree with them is rather a help <e> <s> all that i should like to point out is that one of the significant aspects of the amendment which is a probing one is that the incentive for the telephone user to take up shares should be specifically offered in the sense of a discount of his bill <e> <s> this is a matter to which the noble and learned lord did not refer <e> <s> i shall not be pressing the amendment <e> <s> however before withdrawing it i should like to ask whether there is any way that this could be included in the general benevolence which the noble and learned lord has shown towards this idea <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i should like to point out that the noble lord lord bruce said and this is clearly true that with a very large issue of this kind the bulk will be taken up by the institutions <e> <s> what i am asking and what i think the noble and learned lord suggested was not an unwelcome idea is that provision should be made at issue for the very large number of telephone subscribers i do not know whether there are million or million of them to have a special right to acquire a limited number of shares perhaps worth or worth because they are subscribers <e> <s> that is the point i made and i think that it is a point which the noble and learned lord took on board <e>", "<cs> my lords can i have clarification on one point <e> <s> if the objectors are able to ask for compensation for work lost is there any way of distinguishing the people who are causing the trouble most of whom will be objectors <e> <s> i shall be very sorry to see them being paid for work lost <e>", "<cs> my lords if objectors are able to claim for compensation for work lost as the people who have wrecked the party will mostly be objectors is there any way of distinguishing them from genuine objectors so that they do not get compensation for what they have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for that reply <e> <s> is the noble lord aware how tantalising the government have been to those of us who told them in the first place that this measure was wrong-headed and who cannot wait to be told that we were right <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we were first promised a date by the right honourable gentleman mr brittan in we were secondly promised a date in when the promise was made by the right honourable gentleman then mr mayhew and thirdly the noble lord himself at the report stage of the criminal justice bill promised us a date in <e> <s> lastly the honourable gentleman mr hurd gave us the final date we thought which was early in the new year of <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that february th is the latest time which can be described as early in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for repeating the answer which covers that shameful event and which i think everyone in the house will have blushed to hear <e> <s> having not had the chance to read and consider the answer i can only say that it sounds as though a great deal was done to try to prevent this sort of thing happening and it was entirely unsuccessful <e> <s> therefore as a whole we must think again <e> <s> i have only one suggestion to make and that came out of the statement <e> <s> i understand that over fans were arrested and i believe were then released and sent back <e> <s> i should like to have a bilateral arrangement when these matches take place that the fans are sent back under arrest and not released <e> <s> at least we could then deal with them here <e> <s> i withhold any further comment from these benches until we have had time to discuss the matter but we deeply deplore anything so shameful to our nation <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord consider detainee <e> <s> is there anything wrong with that word <e> <s> i think there probably is but i do not immediately see what <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> with respect i think that in ordinary english the word detainee means someone detained and has no reference to where <e> <s> the reference to a detention centre to many people in this country would be meaningless because they do not know what a detention centre is <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is not clear from the bill how much trouble will be taken to explain to the prisoner at either end <e> <s> that is what the noble lord lord mishcon is trying to provide for <e> <s> we are often told that it is not necessary to put things in a bill because they are implied but in this case i do not think that implication is good enough <e> <s> i do not think that i really need say very much more <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> there is a great reluctance on the part of draftsmen to say shall to secretaries of state but i think we must try to get over that because the terms of clause are that three things should be agreed <e> <s> one is that the secretary of state shall agree <e>", "<cs> i accept that there is no sinister intention but there may be a sinister effect over the years <e> <s> peoples attitude to criminals vary and people here may say that they do not want some fearful criminal who has done something awful in another country back here and that we should allow that chap to stew in his own juice over there <e> <s> this is the kind of thing which is not in the spirit of the bill and which in my opinion would be absolutely unjust and should be protected against <e> <s> things change very fast and under a nazi government i am quite sure we should have got a reply of that kind <e> <s> i think the bill should be strong enough to deal with it <e>", "<cs> we have had a useful discussion <e> <s> i shall in due course withdraw this amendment but i shall certainly come back on report <e> <s> we have had a clue as to the way in which we ought to go which we shall have to examine very carefully <e> <s> it may be that we should treat inward and outward cases differently <e> <s> i am not quite convinced of this <e> <s> but i should like to look at it very carefully and <e>", "<cs> i think that it does <e> <s> i should like to read what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> is there the slightest difference in those two things <e> <s> it seems to me that there is not <e> <s> if anything which comes to the knowledge of the secretary of state would be notified to the prisoner what is the difference from saying that he has a duty to do so <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to that across the floor this amendment is entirely concerned with charges which the prisoner will meet when he gets back to this country <e> <s> it has nothing to do with the foreign country <e> <s> if the foreign country has charges against him presumably it will not agree to his transfer <e> <s> it is simply the case of a man who has committed crimes in this country and knows that he has because he has got away with some of them and where other charges may be pending <e> <s> he will want to know what will happen when he gets to this country and how many charges remain <e> <s> in so far as the secretary of state knows that the noble lord has already said that the secretary of state will have a normal duty to inform the prisoner <e> <s> in so far as he does not the amendment in a <e>", "<cs> on that i am grateful and quite content to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> i hope that the near agreement we seem to be very close will produce something on which we can entirely agree at the next stage <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the minister replies may i point out that we have an amendment in the name of the noble lord lord mishcon on clause which i believe we should take before we discuss whether the clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> it is always a pleasure for me <e>", "<cs> there is one thing which i think the noble lord has not taken into account which is that in relation to by bilateral agreements you have got to get the best bilateral agreement that you can and if you are dealing for example with south africa i doubt very much whether they would agree that somebody who had committed what they call a racial crime and we call ordinary behaviour should be released when they get here <e> <s> until you get a series of different bilateral agreements to consider i do not think you ought to start laying down things in the bill to prevent the secretary of state taking advantage of such things <e> <s> my own view is that this should be up to the prisoner to choose <e> <s> would he rather come here and serve a sentence under conditions he is aware of which in british law he would not be liable to or would he rather go on serving it there <e> <s> i think it is perfectly clear that he should be given that decision and in most cases he would choose to come here to be decently treated <e>", "<cs> if i may comment on what my noble friend said over eire the rule is perfectly simple there is or will be an agreement that sentences would be served over there that would have been served here and there is no way round that <e> <s> if a certain number of people who certainly would not be supported by the irish government cheer too bad <e> <s> in relation to northern ireland that is part of great britain and the home secretary does what he likes <e>", "<cs> i think that it is covered at the beginning of subsection where it says <e>", "<cs> i am grateful and happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> the argument is fairly obvious and does not need infinite repetition <e> <s> but when the prisoner is asked whether he agrees to be repatriated we do not want him to be told that unless he can pay a certain percentage of the cost he will not be <e> <s> that is what we do not want <e> <s> what the noble lord lord melchett has added might deal with the matter <e> <s> most of us think that this is wrong as it stands but there are a splendid couple of words in line which say <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord is correct in his estimate it would be ridiculous to ask for more but i should like to ask that the question of expenditure recovered and all of the problems about that be included in these statistics and i look forward to writing to the noble lord year after year on this question <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to divide the committee on this but we have shown that we want to be told by the noble lord the minister at the next stage or possibly in the final speech on the question that this bill do now pass what sort of statistics will be kept regularly so that at least we know how to get hold of them <e> <s> i should be content with that rather than laying a report before parliament if the amount of information is small <e> <s> if after a year or two it becomes complicated we shall ask for something more <e> <s> as long as the noble lord will make some sort of accurate response to what we can expect to know at the end of the first second and third years about how this is working i should be happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i say how agreeable it is for once to find myself agreeing very largely with the noble lord on the front bench <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply on behalf of my noble friend lord lloyd of kilgerran there seems to me to be all the difference in the world between having three national bodies in <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened from these benches with fascination to two long arguments of a second reading kind about the virtues and vices of privatisation <e> <s> we are not even faintly convinced by the governments version of this argument but we are convinced that this is too near a wrecking amendment for us to support it <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i am not happy about this <e> <s> when the minister was speaking i thought that he really was trying to meet the amendment but when i look back at the amendment i cannot see that he has improved it <e> <s> he has put it somewhere else and as the noble lord <e> <s> lord bruce of donington says being the licence it is amendable without an act of parliament <e> <s> he has not included the main part of the original amendment which was on the basis of the geographical location of the installation <e> <s> that is what the amendment was about <e> <s> that is what the committee carried <e> <s> in spite of the fact that i feel that the noble lord and his advisers have had a shot at doing this <e> <s> i do not think they have done it well enough and the noble lord ought to take it away as he sometimes takes away our amendments before we turn it down <e>", "<cs> my lords this is just the sort of thing that made us nervous of privatisation <e> <s> here we have a service <e> <s> the noble lord says it is inefficient <e> <s> i use it perhaps times a week because i am lazy and do not always have a telephone book <e> <s> i am asked what town <e> <s> and i usually know what town it is <e> <s> i say for example norwich <e> <s> they say what name <e>

international calls but i never make any and that is not what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord suggested that the words directory enquiry can apply to all sorts of other things apart from asking for a telephone number which is what we are all talking about <e> <s> i see that the conditions do not take that view <e> <s> condition no <e> <s> states <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord wigoder whose name is on the amendment may i say from these benches that we have always regarded this as one of the most difficult and most important issues of this bill <e> <s> we have no hesitation in supporting the amendment which has been very clearly and if i may say so at considerable length expounded by both noble lords lord shackleton and lord mishcon <e> <s> i shall say no more than that <e> <s> we are behind them in their wish to deal with this very difficult problem <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just question the noble lord <e> <s> we want to get this right <e> <s> i do not think that any right of free association was given <e> <s> what was given was the right to segregation <e> <s> i think that was a disaster but it probably was inevitable <e> <s> however there was never any question that one block could have association with another block which is what the noble lord seems to be suggesting <e> <s> if so i withdraw but i thought it was not <e>", "<cs> my lords we all know that it is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the last sentence of the speech of my noble friend lord fitt is one with which nobody in this chamber few as we are would entirely disagree <e> <s> there are other sentences about which i am less certain <e> <s> i was afraid that this debate would do more harm than good and in my opinion it has <e> <s> it is fair to say that my noble friend lord fitt interests us and we all have the greatest affection for him but what does his story about mr mcconnell and his wife mean <e> <s> to me it means nothing <e> <s> i do not

<e> <s> the whole thing is absolutely mysterious <e>", "<cs> my lords not having spoken before i can speak now and will do so briefly <e> <s> my noble friend here and i came in to the chamber with the feeling that probably these amendments should be acceptable and by the time the noble and learned lord said he was going to pass more amendments in the next stage of the bill we thought he perhaps ought to he given a chance to do so <e> <s> but personally i have not had time to consult with my noble friends i have been seriously shaken by two particular comments from the front bench <e> <s> the first comment was from the noble and learned lord when he said that the phrase likely to contravene is an extension which is not covered in complying contravene is covered in complying but likely to contravene is an extension <e> <s> the second point is the application of likely to contravene which is a new thing to possible industrial action <e> <s> now i do not think that has been satisfactorily explained and unless by leave of the house we can have some further explanation <e> <s> i think we shall have to support the opposition <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may seek a word of explanation from the noble lord when he exercises his right of reply <e> <s> i am not quite clear about one aspect <e> <s> he has shown that there will he a gap between the commission of an offence a breach of the licence and the pouncing upon it by the director <e> <s> but if the first breach causes damage to anybody the director has a right of law without this amendment <e> <s> if it does not cause damage the director will not need it <e> <s> that is what puzzles me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord bruce made it clear that under clause the ordinary worker in the sort of firm we are talking about will not be in the position of an ordinary worker in a firm of builders or an insurance company or a business who has the right to strike <e> <s> personally i think that strikers are not by any means always right although some of my colleagues in other places think they are but that is a different point <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to clarify this <e> <s> the noble lord lord bruce of donington said in his opening speech that he could not see that industrial action against a company could ever not involve stopping that company from functioning or risking stopping it from functioning <e> <s> if that is the case it means that every industrial action breaches clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to come back but that is exactly what i have just said that it is impossible to strike against a company without the knowledge that if the strike is successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt again but this is a vital point <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords what is the difficulty in adding to paragraph where it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from these benches to be associated with those sentiments <e>", "<cs> my lords it is necessary for me to say that my noble friend and colleague did not suggest that anything was wrong <e> <s> he said only that it is the rule of this house and always has been that if a group of amendments is being discussed together and any noble lord wishes to speak to a separate amendment he has the right to do so <e> <s> there is nothing very offensive in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> normally as a cambridge man i should have taken the fitzwilliam as my example but as i knew that the noble lord lord strabolgi was going to do so i want to make a few comments about the ashmolean <e>", "<cs> my lords we are grateful to the noble lord for introducing this amendment which i think covers the situation as well as can be done <e> <s> i am a little worried about one thing the expression mental or physical condition <e> <s> supposing somebody is a very disturbed character as some are apt to be and is absolutely determined not to be brought back but comes under this definition of being mentally or physically incapable of making proper decisions <e> <s> in such a case can the secretary of state overrule his determination not to be brought back and bring him back <e> <s> this is an awkward question and i ask it because i think we ought to face it <e> <s> these cases are so marginal but we shall get cases

given of a per cent <e> <s> increase fail to take account of the fact that the price of books has i would say gone up a good deal more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill always goes so thoroughly into northern ireland discussions that he leaves the rest of us with little to say <e> <s> i shall try not to repeat everything that the noble lord has said all of them points that i have in my notes or rather not all the bulk of them <e> <s> i do disagree however with the noble lord on one point <e> <s> it seems to me that agreed deceptions in a general election taking place among million people is more than enough to justify a very strong bill indeed <e> <s> the noble lord the minister justified it by saying that it was only the tip of the iceberg <e> <s> it probably is <e> <s> but even if it is not i shall have no difficulty in supporting the bill as it stands <e> <s> there are three points really that have been discussed in the other place <e> <s> i am prepared to back the government on each as i think is the noble lord lord underhill who has just spoken <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will forgive me if i do not follow him in his particularly interesting reference to what goes on elsewhere and to what they might like to have elsewhere <e> <s> i am not going to follow him because i want to pursue one particular point that comes out of lord houghtons most interesting introduction which was taken up again by the noble and learned lord lord simon and the noble earl lord halsbury that is the question of the composition of this house in relation to the composition of the other place both of them in relation to the popular vote as shown and to see if upon a consideration of that there are any conclusions we can draw <e>", "<cs> my lords not without notice <e> <s> i shall write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not take any notice of this amendment <e> <s> it seems to me to be absolutely unnecessary and wrong-headed <e> <s> there is provision in the bill for changing after experience and i think it is in clause and then under heads e and f the documents which will be necessary <e> <s> clearly if there is a difficulty of the kind to which the noble lord has referred this can be alleviated by adding to the list of documents or in other ways <e> <s> but the idea where you observe with total unanimity that there is a very great deal of cheating going on of a general principle not to do something to stop it is ridiculous in my opinion <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will give short shrift to the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should just like to associate myself in part with the noble and learned lord lord rawlinson <e> <s> he was on a committee for which i produced a report in which i think referred to this <e> <s> if it did not as my noble friend lord hutchinson says we have from these benches moved i think in every criminal justice bill for the last years an amendment to this effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should much like to follow the noble lords most interesting and convincing speech about the necessity for intelligence but there is not time <e> <s> one proposition has arisen today upon which i want to ask the government to come back to us <e> <s> that is the perfectly clear proposition put forward by the noble and learned lord lord lane that convicted drug pushers should be deprived in some way or other of their profits and indeed so far as possible of their existing assets <e> <s> i should like the government definitely to come back to us here and say what they are doing about this proposition <e> <s> it is clearly practical and it would clearly be useful <e>", "<cs> i think that it is bitterly disappointing to hear the lawyers taking this view <e> <s> as very much a non-lawyer it seems to me to be absolutely monstrous that the money in prepayment put forward in the ordinary course of daily business which has grown up since all these laws were made where it is customary for people who are selling things to demand a prepayment not as an extension of credit but as a guarantee that the man does not cancel his order the seller thereby losing the sale should not when received as part payment be kept as part payment for that article <e> <s> if owing to insolvency the supplying company cannot deliver the article then they should return the part payment <e> <s> if there is any laymen who thinks otherwise i should like to hear him say so <e>", "<cs> i do not think that what the noble lord lord mischcon has suggested is enough <e> <s> i certainly agree with it <e> <s> it is fraudulent if somebody who is on the verge of bankruptcy accepts money for something they know they can never deliver that is a quite separate thing <e> <s> what worries me <e>", "<cs> it is a question of an absolutely different category and that is why we insist on it <e> <s> there is no comparison whatever between a housewife who buys something and a man who manufactures something in order to sell it <e> <s> they are in quite different categories and given long enough i could identify exactly how <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord cannot really feel that they are in the same category and i do not think that we are giving preference <e>", "<cs> i think that this is the last of the bundle of clauses which the noble lord lord mishcon intends to treat in this way <e> <s> i found what he had to say in so far as i was able to understand it which was not all the way very interesting but i think it is a wrong procedure in this committee <e> <s> i have been through many committee stages <e> <s> i have been in your lordships house for years and never before have i heard difficult points dealt with in clause after clause simply on the question whether the clause shall stand part <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon questions whether it would have been better if he had remained silent <e> <s> i say god forbid <e> <s> i am very pleased to have been told the reasons <e> <s> this is not my bill and i have not studied it but it seems to me that we must ask for a longish interval between now and report stage <e> <s> we must ask for time for the minister to write replies to the noble lord lord mishcon and his colleague and for them to have time to put down amendments so that these matters can be properly dealt with on report <e> <s> otherwise we shall be trying to force a very complicated bill through this house in a way that is quite inadequate <e>", "<cs> with respect the minister did say he would take away supervisory and bring back something better <e> <s> it was agreed by all concerned when we discussed it that what was meant by supervisory was not its ordinary meaning it was advisory or something of that kind <e> <s> that is what i think we are going to hear from the minister but he has already promised to take it away and with the help of his various advisers and legal experts come back with something better <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak tonight not only as a spokesman for the alliance but also as an ex-president of the rspb <e> <s> i only want to underline what my noble friend has said <e> <s> he never leaves one much to say when one is following on <e> <s> the two vital points about this order are first the change from may to shall <e> <s> i thought that my noble friend made rather heavy weather of that <e> <s> he has two absolutely specific statements from the minister in the other place repeated here <e> <s> the minister said on th january at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords while admitting the fact that it is very wide of the main question may i say that the answer to it is exactly the same as the noble earl has given for the main question <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that the worrying aspect to us is that the theatre museum has been gradually brought up over the past eight years and it is just at the point of taking-off as it were when now there seems to be a real threat that there will not be enough money for it to do so <e> <s> the noble earl cannot satisfy us by saying that he has given a generous amount of money to somebody else <e> <s> what we want to know is whether he can influence those people to see that the theatre museum is opened <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches we fully support the noble baroness in what she is trying to do <e> <s> we share some of the doubts about whether the phrasing or the drafting is correct <e> <s> in particular i should like to support the request of the noble lord lord mishcon that we do not just leave it to the good will of the minister but that the government provide us with a suitable amendment expressing the intention of the noble baroness but perhaps more accurately and clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord kilmarnock has supported the noble lord in his pursuit of this question several times <e> <s> unfortunately today he is engaged <e> <s> i have always supported this but never studied it very carefully so what i shall say will hardly be longer than what the noble viscount opposite has just said <e> <s> from these benches we support this fully <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point may i ask a question <e> <s> it is perfectly clear that because there are exceptions made about information and so on the noble lord has listed them and we all agree with them there is no major difficulty in making exceptions <e> <s> a very wide exception is made as the noble lord has stressed for students with considerable difficulties but not impossibilities in the way of getting these books <e> <s> there is a very small part of the whole trade which is the wholesale trade which it would be just as easy to bring in as any of the other things <e> <s> it is in no way comparable to bully beef <e> <s> it is an educational thing and the whole argument is educational <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a strict non-welshman and without consulting the colleagues on these benches among whom wales is well-distributed i have not the slightest hesitation in supporting the amendment <e> <s> it seems clear that the problem that the noble lord lord renton has raised can easily be solved <e> <s> the person who decides whether it is practicable or not to do anything at the time is the person who is told to do it <e> <s> in this case that is the director <e> <s> i see no problem there <e> <s> it is entirely desirable that we should do anything we can at any time to support the reality of this language of which i do not understand a word but which i know to be a wonderful one from so many friends who do <e> <s> i do not think i would be saying too much on behalf of my colleagues when i way that we support this amendment fully <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that if one were to follow the main question and what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has just said the natural recourse would be to keep everyone who had committed a serious crime in prison indefinitely or at least until the very end of the longest sentence that an individual was given <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that the courts are absolutely content with the present parole system <e> <s> they do not find it necessary to alter their sentences because of its existence <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree that it is absolutely wrong to use one disastrous instance as a reason for altering the general procedure which is working very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by saying that the noble earl is a friend whom i admire and a political opponent of whom i am wary <e> <s> when preparing for this debate i received messages of gloom uncertainty discomfort and worry from all over the country and from all over london <e> <s> i said to myself how is he going to handle this debate <e> <s> i then said to myself there is only one way he can handle it he will have to brazen it out <e> <s> and brazen it out the noble earl has with some very elegant brass <e> <s> he has told us of some of the glories that exist and that are at risk today we having built them up since the war with elaborate work and immense government subsidies constantly increasing <e> <s> one way or another he seems to me to have avoided the situation which really is very difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl the minister sits down if he intends to write to his noble friend will he place a copy of that letter in the library <e> <s> this is an important point but to me it is very obscure <e>", "<cs> my lords surely there was no limit on that <e>", "<cs> it is occasionally useful for a layman to speak when lawyers are arguing <e> <s> i have listened as laymen always do and i was convinced by each lawyer who argued <e> <s> looking back at the three i wish to commit my colleagues here to the second lawyer who spoke the noble and learned lord lord denning who said that everything that was asked for in the amendment was desirable but that the convention already covered them <e> <s> this i believe is perfectly true and it takes lawyers to go on arguing about it <e> <s> i should however like to add one point <e> <s> i join in condemning the use of the expression and/or <e> <s> if however one looks at the amendment one sees that those words are not there <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor replies may i ask what sisting means <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness has spoken so well on the smaller <e>", "<cs> my lords i normally defend the government against missiles from the labour party over the northern ireland situation but i cannot on this occasion <e> <s> it seems to me absolutely ridiculous that over people which i believe is the estimate should be left with no medical card which is suitable <e> <s> clearly they may have other things the medical card is only an alternative to five others but these are very simple people and particularly in the backwoods as it were of northern ireland they will trot up to the polling booth and say im all right <e> <s> ive got my medical card but if it was issued before they will be turned away <e> <s> there would very properly be a major scandal and i do not think the government would have a leg to stand on <e>", "<cs> one has to rise because the noble baroness made a perfectly sensible statement <e> <s> she said if we find that a thing does not work we shall have to do something else <e> <s> that was the essence of it <e> <s> if the noble lord does not agree with that he should say so <e>", "<cs> i am passionately addicted to the preservation of archives <e> <s> like i think most noble lords who have spoken i think it is frightfully important <e> <s> i shall not develop that point <e> <s> however what i am not clear about is this <e> <s> let us take the glc case for a start <e> <s> one amendment suggests the residuary body <e> <s> it has been suggested that it should go to the city of london records office which i understand already has two of its own <e> <s> then the third amendment suggests that in relation to the shires and this could equally be done in relation to london a special body should be set up to look after it <e> <s> whichever of these solutions is chosen what evidence <e>", "<cs> it is with the complete agreement of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that i speak <e> <s> of course we value listen to and admire with affection and respect anything that the noble lord may say but he would be the last person to expect us to agree with everything that he says <e> <s> the idea is insulting to him and ridiculous to us <e> <s> i make no apology for wholly disagreeing with the noble lord and for saying that i think he is unexpectedly confused <e> <s> the point at issue is that of an overall body <e> <s> it is to deal with four areas the police the fire services waste disposal and i am afraid that i have forgotten the other one <e>", "<cs> they are functions which i think can be reasonably joined together <e> <s> they are in no sense overall <e> <s> my noble friends and i shall be moving some amendments to add some kind of body to deal with the arts voluntary bodies and other matters which are not in any way connected and it would be ridiculous to tie them in with the police the fire brigade or anything else <e> <s> therefore the issue of an overall body which is the point of the bill is not being wrecked and with the greatest respect i think that the noble lord is quite wrong in suggesting that it is <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord strabolgi suggested that these two amendments should be taken together <e> <s> therefore i wish to speak to my amendment now <e> <s> it is a very complicated and very largely a muddled issue and i am sorry to say that i cannot deal with it as shortly as i should like to <e> <s> the bill is so drafted that this part of it is extremely difficult to amend <e>", "<cs> nobody suggests that the boroughs could not do the same thing and i think in time we may get them to but we have all tried for a very long time to get the junior local authorities to give more money to the arts and that has produced very little <e> <s> what the noble earl is acquiescing in is a straight cut of between million and million off the million which i make about per cent <e> <s> and also almost more serious the loss of a very valuable patron <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i say that he has just made a very important point about the size of the body <e> <s> i am not speaking for the noble lord lord strabolgi but in my speech i made it clear that i was not particularly anxious to have all these things brought together <e> <s> i thought that they could perfectly well be run separately <e> <s> i think it is very important that that is not a major issue in the suggestion <e> <s> what we want is that they should be taken care of <e> <s> i do not see why it should not be in half a dozen bodies <e>", "<cs> it is very kind of the noble earl to allow me to intervene <e> <s> this is a very important point <e> <s> i did not interrupt the noble earl when he made that statement before so i think i should be allowed to interrupt now <e> <s> my view is perfectly clear <e> <s> the sum of million is not additional money <e> <s> the noble earl said that he had raised the level of the bath water but he let it out first <e> <s> this is a transfer of money from ratepayers money through the precept to central money <e> <s> as such that may be an advantage <e> <s> the continuity may be a good thing <e> <s> but it is in no sense new money <e>", "<cs> i am very much surprised at the noble viscounts intervention because if he were interested in the subject he might be expected to say i agree absolutely with this and what we have to ask the residuary body to do is to get the districts together and form a permanent council or something of that kind <e> <s> if he agrees with it it would be much better to say so rather than as it were getting the whole thing put aside <e>", "<cs> if i may reply very quickly i think we are in total agreement <e> <s> the residuary body was left in because it seemed the easiest existing body to attach and we knew that the government were very frightened of appointing new bodies <e> <s> but when it comes down to a single thing like archaeology that objection hardly applies <e> <s> i should be very happy if the noble viscount were to support us <e> <s> if the noble lord when he comes to reply says he cannot do anything about this we shall move an amendment on report in terms agreed with the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for a full reply from the noble viscount and i shall discuss it with my noble friend who initiated this amendment <e> <s> my only comment before withdrawing the amendment is that as the new head of the security services is to make intensive enquiries we shall never know what conclusions he will come to which might be rather disappointing <e> <s> i do not know whether later when he has had time to do that we might ask a question and receive an answer on what he found <e> <s> having said that i am happy to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question <e> <s> i appreciate that he did not agree with what the right reverend prelate was saying <e> <s> but at the very beginning of his speech the noble lord said in an attacking way that the right reverend prelate seemed to reject everything that he found unacceptable <e> <s> does not the noble lord do so <e> <s> it seems to me that he does exactly the same <e>", "<cs> that would have been much better my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord for his reply which is uncharacteristically less forthcoming than usual i should like to repeat the basis of my question <e> <s> are these curtailments being enforced because the boys are enjoying the work <e> <s> i think that it is reasonable to have a centre which is aimed at deterrence <e> <s> however i believe that it is very misguided that when by chance one hits on something which gives the boys a chance to show themselves to compete and to take an interest in something one should not follow that up to do the most one can for them <e>", "<cs> my lords with his professional experience as a soldier the noble lord knows very well that drill in particular is a weapon <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord agree that curtailment is still curtailment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord himself was trained in baby care i actually was not but i wonder whether if the boys began to enjoy that there would be a curtailment of their courses to <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that it is in no way satisfactory to say that a feasibility study will be carried out <e> <s> immediate action is required to remove these women from where they are and to put them somewhere else <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that the all-party penal affairs committee wrote to the home secretary over a month ago making these points <e> <s> i think that it has not yet received an answer or if it has it has not yet reached me <e> <s> when there are people mutilating themselves at this level of numbers it is a form of infection of the most dangerous kind <e> <s> it cannot be left while a few scientists work out a feasibility study <e> <s> is the noble lord able to give us a more satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords as long as we do not have to wait until the end of the day <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us a little more about what happens under a sentence of youth custody <e> <s> am i right in thinking that juveniles under are held in prison for days and then sent to a youth custody centre but that juveniles over owing to the overcrowding of youth custody centres may easily spend all their <e>", "<cs> my lords are they under or over <e> <s> they are two different cases <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord one last question <e> <s> am i right in thinking that there is a strong connection in each of the inner city areas with drug traffic and that for unemployed people wanting to earn easy money it is a great temptation to take some money for distributing drugs <e> <s> this means that the very big and powerful drug barons who are in no sense black but are of all colours and all nations are to some extent behind this <e> <s> if the police are to make a special effort as they are now doing will this make the relationship with the people in the area even more difficult <e> <s> is this the true picture or an exaggerated one <e>", "<cs> my lords i personally and i speak for my party think it is high time this was done <e>", "<cs> my lords it is kingsbridge <e>", "<cs> my lords we are happy to support this order from these benches <e> <s> i shall be interested to hear the answers to some of lord prys-daviess questions but irrespective of the answers i think that we can fully support it <e> <s> i should like to take this opportunity which is the first we have had on behalf of my noble friend lord hampton and myself of congratulating the new secretary of state wishing him the luck that he will certainly need and expressing the hope that he will be successful in bringing to a satisfactory conclusion the negotiations so well-initiated by his predecessor <e> <s> having said that we are happy to support the order <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not follow up in detail her very interesting speech about education though i shall be interested to hear later on the elucidation of the governments policy at some length <e> <s> in this house i have answered for education for some time but as i have never believed that anybody knows anything about it at all except that the one thing you want for education is good teachers and no one knows how to train them i had better say no more on the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i clear up one point <e> <s> am i right in thinking that he said that the increase in real terms in the arts council grant from to was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that that is a very small increase in relation to the demand <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that police duty is very difficult <e> <s> could he tell us whether there has been a single prosecution in the last months for any motorcycle which is making too much noise <e> <s> if so i should like to hear the details that have been publicised <e>", "<cs> my lords debates are more interesting if a speaker occasionally differs from the speaker before him but i am unable to differ from the noble viscount or my noble friend lord cledwyn <e> <s> what i have to say therefore will become variations on the same theme <e> <s> i shall underline one or two differences in a slightly different way but i speak for the two parties of the alliance and i think that i must therefore say what i have to say <e> <s> although i could almost say i agree sit down and leave it at that i think that would hardly do justice to our growing voting strength in the country to which i shall not refer again <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me because he must be nearing the end of his speech <e>", "<cs> my lords surely what has been said by the two speakers before the speech of the noble lord make it perfectly clear that there is absolutely no intention on the part of the british government or the british political parties to do any such thing as to drive them into the south <e> <s> the noble lord should not say that <e> <s> he should know better <e>", "<cs> my lords surely

terms my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord remember that when he answered the noble baroness on rd july i intervened to say that i thought the matter ought to be dealt with very much more urgently than he was suggesting and he said that what mattered was to get it right at the end of the day <e> <s> i replied with lightning repartee so long as we do not have to wait till the end of the day <e> <s> we are not only having to wait till the end of the day there is no day named <e> <s> i am speaking very seriously <e> <s> it is terrible that this situation should continue and that there

attention to what the noble lord lord stallard has said that one of the ways that the distress of the unionists which seems to many of us to be unreasonable can be somewhat eased is by a fuller report

good case for doing something which on the face if it seems very sensible and unless the minister has the usual string of deliberate and strong objections which convince me that this is not a right

easier understood if they were made roughly comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and learned lord lord simon is not here to speak because i usually agree with him <e> <s> i do not know whether i should have done so tonight but i was hoping for his support in what i am about to say and i shall now have to get on without him <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord prys-davies speaks of sadness <e> <s> that is what i feel intensely at the moment <e> <s> this seems to me to be the first sign after the general strike which was an explosion of something which may be very bad indeed for all of us so much so that i feel impelled to pause for a moment to look at what has happened to the loyalty to this country of the loyalist majority in northern ireland our friends and compatriots who are now deliberately trying to reduce their part of the united kingdom to anarchy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves that point i have sent him a copy of a letter today <e> <s> i see that the noble lord indicates that he has received it <e> <s> will he keep me advised as to what action happens as a result of these meetings and let me know whether it applies to the letter i have sent to him <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not keep your lordships very long <e> <s> i want simply to say that this is a marvellous example of the inefficiency of our system of direct rule in the discussion of what happens <e> <s> it is perfectly inadequate to deal with a matter as important as this without a committee stage without amendments and without three or four meetings in this house <e> <s> i am not going to attempt that <e> <s> the noble lord lord prys-davies made a jolly good shot and i agree with most of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord indicate whether he can answer my request to let us have a statement in due course not to hold up this order showing us the difference between legislation in england and wales which is the basic legislation and the new legislation in northern ireland <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my difficulty about this is that i think it is absolutely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will agree that the feeling of the house is so strong about this that we should have a much more detailed answer as a result of a full inquiry <e> <s> i agree with him absolutely that at this stage to start saying that the irish are guilty or not guilty or the english are guilty or not guilty is quite wrong <e> <s> we ought to have the things done step by step so that we can see who to blame and then blame them <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to endorse every word my noble friend on the labour front bench has said <e> <s> i think that this should be and i ask the government that they should make it a watershed in the aftermath of the irish agreement so much and no more <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord leaves the question of manning and goes on to resources may i ask him whether he will now or possibly later after thought answer my final question <e> <s> does he agree that if the government are to support grendon in the way that it was built up which i understand him to be saying again that they wish to do there are only two ways that they can do it <e> <s> one is by reducing the number of patients treated to the present staff level and the other is by increasing the number of staff to the present inmate level <e> <s> nothing else is of the slightest use in my opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his full reply <e> <s> above all i am very grateful to the half-dozen speakers whom we might describe as the old prison gang who speak on most occasions <e> <s> but if we add together what all six of us have said i am afraid that if one then reads the noble lords reply with care one will see that no effort whatever has been made to answer our problem <e> <s> the position is very clear <e> <s> of course we know about the difficulties in the prison service <e> <s> for heavens sake most of us have been dealing with it for over years and it has got worse every year under every government <e> <s> it is no good talking to us about that <e> <s> in view of the present great difficulties we are asking the government whether they want to go on with the therapeutic regime at grendon which they admit and we agree is important and good or can they not afford to do it <e> <s> if they cannot afford to do it i beg the minister not to think that he can do it at half cock he cannot <e> <s> this is what he is suggesting <e>", "<cs> my lords following the question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter it is really desirable that we should train libyan pilots at all <e> <s> can we have a view on that <e> <s> ones first reaction is that it might become a great nuisance to have a lot of trained libyan pilots <e>", "<cs> my lords i start with a sincere tribute to the noble baroness <e> <s> we over here regard her as practically our only friend on the other side where penal matters are concerned <e> <s> this week i heard two tory whips saying well her ladyship never votes with the party <e> <s> i would not mind if that were true but

office for over years and it has not changed at all yet the people are all entirely different <e> <s> they are good intelligent ready to listen and ready to give you any information you want yet

christianity it is a criticism of us <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking without my name being on the list <e> <s> i wish i had known before half-past twelve today that my noble colleague lord crawshaw was delayed by family illness and could not give the support which this party and the liberal party the alliance party in fact most strongly feel <e> <s> i wish to stress this because we are used to these views being put forward by the noble lord lord beaumont but as he has chosen a different seat he can no longer speak for us <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the minister will allow me to ask him a question on that point <e> <s> does he seriously think that the government believe that discretionary powers about enforcing fire precautions are better than compulsory powers <e> <s> i cannot believe that i correctly heard the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is giving a misleading impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i must ask the minister to make clear whether that is an option <e> <s> if it is an option then it does not have to be taken does it <e>", "<cs> my lords before we leave this very serious problem may i ask one question <e> <s> am i right in thinking that the only difference between the government and the prison officers is one of suspension and abandonment of strike action <e> <s> it seems to me a very narrow difference <e> <s> i should like to say to the prison officers whose friend i hope i have always been that they should look at this <e> <s> it seems to me that there is a way out by saying all right abandonment for the moment but we shall call it abolition <e> <s> we can always start it again at any minute <e> <s> the difference is verbal and therefore we shall agree <e> <s> if they would do that the whole matter could be solved because i believe this is not a question though it should be that the kind of proposals that the home secretary will make will be acceptable <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord accept the word reasonable in front of notice <e> <s> that might meet both sides who agree so completely <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the first supplementary question of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter the noble lord quoted a figure of per cent <e> <s> of lifers who reoffend <e> <s> will he confirm that the number of that per cent <e> <s> who commit a really serious crime is extremely small and that the hulk of those per cent <e> <s> committed fairly petty offences <e>", "<cs> may i support what has been said from these benches <e> <s> i missed the first speech but i heard the speech from the liberal front bench and the speech of my noble friend lord hunt <e> <s> i want to add my weight to the objection to any proposal which extends sentences for young people anywhere <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord whether if the consumer wants to have a pay meter which i think is what the noble lord has been talking about any charge is made for putting in the meter <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will impress upon his right honourable <e>", "<cs> but is the electricity that is used knocked off the deposit or do you have to send a separate cheque so that the deposit plus the amount for the quarters electricity is in the companys hands <e>", "<cs> may i differ from the noble baroness having been concerned in the consumer world many years ago <e> <s> it is absolutely essential that any consultation should be made before the decision is final <e> <s> of course every consumer council will say the price is too much and they are usually right but it does not alter the result <e> <s> but consultation must go before and the consumer council can at least then put the argument which is put to it by the customers <e> <s> that should be the routine <e>", "<cs> my lords my recollection of years ago when the report was made is not very clear and i have not had time to read <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down as we are on report may i ask a question <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the arguments he has used are without exception exactly the same arguments which were used to us when we made the major changes which i think and i ask the noble lord to tell me whether this is so have worked rather well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to associate our benches with what my noble friend has just said <e> <s> we may feel sad as he does but we can hardly be surprised that the government find it necessary to take some action <e> <s> the assembly was formed as the statement tells us originally as an all-party group to examine how to set up a devolved northern ireland administration and to monitor and report on the northern ireland departments <e> <s> it now consists of one party only the sdlp having led to its downfall by refusing to co-operate <e> <s> it is therefore unable to consider how to make an advance towards an all-party assembly and recently it has refused to continue with its duties of monitoring <e> <s> it had only two functions and it is not performing either of them now though up to date it has been fairly decently paid for its attendance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the noble lord in his questions and add one question to which perhaps the minister will reply in his answer <e> <s> the reason that there appear to be no recruits accepted in the lite regiments may be and i think possibly is to a large extent that they do not apply to join <e> <s> this is probably because they do not think that they have any chance of getting in <e> <s> this means that if one wants to alter this somebody must do something about it and that person is the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords what does the noble lord mean when he says that it has been an obvious advantage to the consumer <e> <s> is there a single consumer in this house who has found the denationalisation of the telephone system of great advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord ask such noble lords to hold up their hands <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the previous two speakers <e> <s> some years ago for quite a period i was chairman of the national executive committee of the family service units <e> <s> we dealt and still deal exclusively with what are technically known as problem families <e> <s> there is not the slightest question that if you are dealing with <e>", "<cs> why not do it in local rates equally <e> <s> what is the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we cannot leave it exactly as it is <e> <s> everyone is uncomfortable about the position except the noble lord who is answering and i wish to make him show a little more interest in the subject it is a very tricky one <e> <s> undoubtedly prejudices exist which should not exist we all have prejudices <e> <s> but can he not give some encouragement to the hope that within the next months this house will be informed that a policy of absolute lack of discrimination is being fully carried <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may agree with the last remarks of my noble friend of course the government must clear up this stalker business quickly <e> <s> but to say anything about it before it is cleared up seems to me entirely wrong and i shall not follow that course <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter who implied that there is a detectable difference in deterrence between a six- and a -months sentence <e>", "<cs> i must say a word or two more in the debate <e> <s> it is important that the view of either side should not be misunderstood <e> <s> my noble friends who propose that the clause should not stand part of the bill are perfectly clear in their minds that there has to be a provision which does what both sides want but without doing very much more <e> <s> we do not ask that people should be allowed to do what they like and commit acts of hooliganism without interference <e> <s> we are asking that after this long and extremely interesting debate the government should go away to see whether they can do something rather more effective and rather less dangerous than the provisions in the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl regret as i do that certain elements of the christian religion should in this house describe the church of england as wishy-washy <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question before he sits down <e> <s> i understand that this bill does not apply to northern ireland <e> <s> i am rather surprised and should like to know why not <e>", "<cs> i should like to support amendment no <e> <s> from these benches <e> <s> let

out inside a dwelling is correct <e> <s> i should like to know what the noble earl has to say about it <e>", "<cs> i am unhappy at this reply because what the minister has said in effect is that this amendment does not go far enough <e> <s> if that is so let him take it away and produce an amendment which does <e> <s> merely to say that one cannot ask the local authority to do something which they ought to do seems to me not an answer at all <e>", "<cs> i am not happy about this matter <e> <s> i have spent the past years trying to get shorter sentences and it is perfectly clear to me that a man who feels race hatred so bitterly is not going to be deterred by a longer sentence <e> <s> the kind of opinion we are apt to hear expressed from certain people elsewhere is that we must have longer sentences <e> <s> however we have spent our lives explaining to them that on the best evidence a longer sentence does not deter <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying how nice it is to have a new face opposite us <e> <s> we are a gang of penal reformers who come pretty regularly and to have our average age reduced to something well under is very nice for all of us <e> <s> i welcome the noble lord lord beaverbrook and i hope that he will enjoy the good-tempered but extremely serious discussions that we have from time to time at which i may say we get attendance from almost all of us except her majestys judges which is a pity <e> <s> i want to put that on record <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that we are very far apart on that particular point <e> <s> the noble earl complains and he has just more or less done so with some reason that for an arbitrarily appointed board to make judicial judgments as to the length of punishment deserved by one kind of crime as opposed to another is to usurp the function of the courts <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord fitt knows me well enough not to mind if i do not follow him in his rather elaborate exposition of alleged miscarriages of justice <e> <s> i have not studied any of them <e> <s> i do not know whether he is right or wrong <e> <s> everybody is terrified of miscarriages of justice <e> <s> i shall say only this to the noble lord <e> <s> i believe that we have less miscarriages of justice under our system than under most others <e> <s> i think that his argument has been a very powerful one against capital punishment <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be in order to ask the noble viscount a question about these arrangements <e> <s> i have already met one ex-chairman of the arts council and one head of a museum who are removing their names from the list of speakers because of the number already down on it <e> <s> would it not be possible when there is more than a certain number of entries on the list to have a first-come first-served arrangement so as to have a limit of something like <e> <s> i should like the house to consider that <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not thought that it was the fault of the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords am i right in thinking that group therapy is not provided in male prisons either <e>", "<cs> my lords we also welcome this bill <e> <s> it is high time that the matter was cleared up <e> <s> it seems to have been cleared up in a very straightforward manner which i could more or less understand when i read the bill <e> <s> that is not always the case <e>

not be this evening <e> <s> i have listened very carefully to the argument <e> <s> i acknowledge that the matter is extremely difficult <e> <s> having heard all the debate i have not the slightest doubt about where i come down <e> <s> i come down without a moments hesitation behind the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor and the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> what matters and the only thing that matters is the child <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question <e> <s> lawyers call it mar-eye-tal and ordinary citizens call it marital <e> <s> why <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may begin by saying that it is a remarkable fact that the number of people sitting on the government benches has actually doubled in the past five minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord lyell for taking us through the appropriation order so thoroughly <e> <s> i am grateful also to the noble lord lord prys-davies for discussing various parts of it <e> <s> i shall say no more than that the picture is sombre because so much of what is being spent as the noble lord pointed out is for redundancies <e> <s> it is a great tragedy that there has been a big change in harland and wolff <e> <s> it is not useful at this stage to comment on it because we all know about it <e> <s> nobody knows what to do about it <e> <s> i believe that the government are genuinely trying to do something <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble baroness because like her i was a farmer and i educated three children in the most expensive way entirely on what i made out of farming and subsequently found myself the noble baronesss successor as chairman of the consumer council which was so improperly abolished by the tory government almost as soon as i had left it <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> whatever the directive says this suggestion is only common sense and it is never a bad thing to use common sense <e>", "<cs> i am not quite clear on this point <e> <s> is the noble lord saying that the time taken to make sure that a drug is safe should be reduced <e> <s> he suggested that people might die if it were reduced longer than necessary <e> <s> of course that is true <e> <s> but equally if it were reduced too quickly people might die from it <e> <s> i do not think there is an argument that the noble lord has used which makes any sense <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord expains what he means by saying that the consumers risk is oh so small <e> <s> the consumers risk is death that is what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that it will almost certainly be salutary for the people who have to make these very difficult decisions to know that if anything goes wrong the courteous ruthlessness of the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter will be on to them in no time <e> <s> in spite of that does he agree that what is important is the fact that it is often non-violent cases which go wrong and there should be no confusion in the mind of the public that it is only the violent cases which deserve the comments that are frequently made <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that i left the city in but was aware even then of the breed to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness will forgive me if i do not follow her directly but i shall refer to birmingham in due course <e>", "<cs> my lords the secretary of state made it perfectly clear time and again and we all agreed with him that it is essential that people should feel they are doing these things for themselves <e> <s> that is the point <e> <s> if you have contractors in and outside people doing the work that is completely lost <e> <s> what the noble lord has said is absolutely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that on these benches we are perfectly clear that some re-arrangement is absolutely essential in the staff of the prisons <e> <s> is he also aware that we very much hope that he will be successful in negotiating an agreement with the prison officers who have had a difficult time for a long while and with whom i believe it will not be easy to deal <e>", "<cs> my lords it is lucky that i have no more than a minute and a half to reply becaue i feel almost speechless at the reply that the noble earl has given <e> <s> he knows that i respect and like him but quite honestly nobody in the prison service hearing his speech would recognise what he was talking about <e>", "<cs> the answer is that i do <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw my motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to follow the noble lord lord prys-davies in expressing outrage and condemnation of this most offensive crime <e> <s> lord justice gibson was known respected and honoured throughout northern ireland and in the south <e> <s> all noble lords who have worked in northern ireland will agree with me when i say that he was one of the judges who risked their lives by their very profession <e> <s> he was in the front line and he has given his life for his country as nobly as anyone can <e>", "<cs> some of my best friends are lawyers but i can assure members of the committee that they should never trust lawyers on questions of this kind <e> <s> there is only one issue of the faintest interest with which anybody in this committee ought to be concerned <e> <s> that is that if a genuine refugee comes to this country we shall stand by our word and look after him <e> <s> i think everybody wants that our lawyer friends want it but they are unable to distinguish fact from fiction <e> <s> that is one of their great difficulties <e>", "<cs> i must take up the minister on that <e> <s> it is a question of the meaning of words <e> <s> there is no ill-intention involved <e> <s> to say that someone is in immediate danger is a narrower provision than to say that he is in danger of persecution if he goes home <e> <s> it is a narrower definition <e> <s> many refugees who if they went home would be in danger are not in danger now <e> <s> therefore to my mind the argument put forward by the noble earl is entirely wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord allow me to add something <e> <s> i agree entirely with what he has said <e> <s> however there is a feature which arises not only in northern ireland but also in this country although it occurs much more often in northern ireland <e> <s> it is that the accused is happier to be where he is and deliberately delays his case coming to court <e> <s> my feeling is that any arrangements made ought to make it clear that this kind of thing puts him out of court as regards appealing for an earlier trial <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i take up one point that he made <e> <s> he said if i understood him aright that he was not sure that the government had a real will to win <e> <s> i think that that is an absolutely unjust reflection on the present policy because the answer to the noble lords very understandable complaints about things going wrong the whole time that has been happening for years in northern ireland is to be tougher and everything will come right <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness replies may i ask her to make perfectly clear to those of us who are not part of the usual channels why there should be any objection to postponing the bill until later as other noble lords have suggested <e> <s> in the recent past i have had to complain about lawyers in the house <e> <s> but this afternoon they have been first class <e> <s> as most of us it is fair to say are not part of the usual channels we need an explanation of why this serious warning from lawyers who have to deal with the matter and who are experts in it should be ignored <e> <s> i hope that the noble baroness will be able to give that explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for repeating the home secretarys statement which was full of good and useful news <e> <s> to someone like myself who has been singing cassandra for to years it is an enormous relief at last to feel that the government are attempting to face up to a difficult situation <e> <s> it is much more difficult a situation than it would have been had some action been taken earlier <e> <s> i am not going to stress that because when people do what we want them to we must praise them even if they could have done it a long time before to greater advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i knew that my noble friend lord harris would make a powerful and disturbing speech <e> <s> i knew that the noble baroness lady phillips would make ones hair stand on end when she talked about risks <e> <s> i do not believe that either exaggerated the situation <e> <s> we are back to the days when mrs thrale begged dr johnson not to come down to streatham at night <e> <s> that is the position today and it is very disturbing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl remember that when fresh start was put before the house it was given a warm welcome from all opposition benches <e> <s> however we warned the government that as far as we could see the scheme depended entirely on providing enough staff to reduce overtime to nine hours a week which i believe is the present scheme <e> <s> is he aware that certainly in one prison of which i know and i think in a number of others fresh start has commenced without the provision of the necessary staff <e> <s> that seems to be a very dangerous procedure <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord means extradite from and not to <e>", "<cs> it is not always that i can agree wholeheartedly with the noble earl lord onslow <e> <s> this evening i do <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make one very short remark as a layman <e> <s> it is what the layman always thinks when he hears a series of well thought out and well delivered views given by distinguished lawyers <e> <s> at the end of each speech i thought there is a lot in what he says <e> <s> i shall have to look at that tomorrow <e> <s> however at the end of the debate i stand exactly where i came in <e>", "<cs> may i just ask the noble and learned lord whether he meant luxury when he spoke of the luxury of jury trial <e> <s> it is a curious idea <e> <s> i should have thought luxury was wrong and i should like to give him the opportunity to withdraw the word <e>", "<cs> may i say thank you to the noble and learned lord <e>", "<cs> i shall be interested to hear the answer to the noble and learned lords question <e>", "<cs> before i withdraw the amendment i reassure the committee that something of this kind will come from either the government or from us on these benches at report and therefore we can discuss the matter in its proper place <e> <s> discussing this amendment without amendment no <e> <s> is short of the facts <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is of course right <e> <s> without altering the behaviour in prisons on all sides the proper accommodation would be unsuitable <e> <s> the intention of my noble friend lord henderson and if he has not put it quite rightly it can easily be altered is that the home office will say we are perfectly clear that this is what we ought to aim at <e> <s> we not only cannot do it at once <e> <s> we cannot even begin until at least the year after next <e> <s> but we are going to have a programme week by week in our prisons so that in years at least prisoners in this country can be shut up in a way which is decent instead of in the way that they are shut up now which is indecent <e> <s> the words decent and indecent may exaggerate <e> <s> in my opinion they do not <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me <e> <s> he agreed with me when i said that we must refurbish properly or words to that effect <e> <s> surely we cannot do anything without having a standard <e> <s> why can that standard not be expressed <e> <s> that is what worries us <e> <s> we know perfectly well that chairs with three legs are not accepted in prisons unless they are meant to be three-legged chairs <e> <s> wrong things are not accepted on purpose <e> <s> why can that not be stated <e> <s> why can we not say we have a vet y long way to go but we want each cell to be like this and in due course it can be made so <e> <s> that is all we ask <e>", "<cs> as my name is on the amendment as we have been asked by the chief whip to be short and as my noble friend has put the case with clarity i have nothing to add <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for having given us a serious argument

am grateful to him for doing so <e> <s> i wanted to get some feeling of the support in the committee i think that if we table an amendment on report it might be rather different from this one <e> <s> i shall explain why in a minute <e> <s> i also believe that we should probably win that amendment <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble earl for giving me the opportunity to get this matter openly discussed <e>", "<cs> the opportunity of earning the chief whips credit is too difficult for me to resist and i hope that i shall be able to support my noble friend in a speech of two minutes <e> <s> it seems perfectly clear to me that something along those lines is a possibility <e> <s> we hope that the government will look at the matter find out the best way of dealing with it and coming back with it <e> <s> i believe that there is a real demand that the matter of people being imprisoned for not paying fines should be sorted out <e> <s> the best way of sorting it out is to set the fine in relation to what they can with moderate discomfort manage to pay <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will take that suggestion away and bring back something after careful consideration which we can support <e>", "<cs> the amendment is quite clear <e> <s> the words are <e>", "<cs> we must accept the fact that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter thinks that the idea is impractical foolish and a waste of time <e> <s> i do not and my noble friend who puts forward this amendment does not <e> <s> i should now like to call on the government to come in and see whether the minister will accept my suggestion that this is an important and valuable idea <e> <s> will he put the resources of his department into finding out whether he can put forward a sensible scheme <e>", "<cs> surely the position is that if that does not apply this amendment if passed will enforce it and so it should <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady macleod <e> <s> what worries me is not the

education reform bill will become something quite different for which the government are very much more responsible at their own desire and request may i once again ask the noble baroness whether she

akin to a doctor presented with a patient who has terminal cancer and a sprained ankle but who nevertheless spends his time on the sprained ankle <e> <s> it is still worth doing so <e> <s> the report is about fairness and justice and not basically about the prison population which of course is a far more important aspect <e> <s> that is very much the line taken by my noble friend lord hutchinson

prisons by saying that the money will be spent elsewhere because it is more important <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like if necessary million of the million to be spent putting right the visiting arrangements in all our three or four hundred prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pursue the argument of my noble friend in general but hope to offer some details other than those that he has so far given to the house <e> <s> this report should be compulsory reading for every magistrate and judge in the country <e> <s> those who have the power and the duty to send people to prison should be aware

far too little money in putting right the appalling conditions in existing prisons <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with extreme trepidation to follow the noble lord lord cocks <e> <s> i blush as i say that not only was i at eton but i was also at trinity college <e> <s> that combination is generally regarded as being fatal <e> <s> however i agree with the noble lord on one issue there are a few non-lawyers in this house and it is probably as well that they should be allowed to speak in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that they will not be frightened by anything the noble lord said about annoying other people <e> <s> conscience has nothing to do with annoying other people a free vote is about conscience <e>", "<cs> my lords the last two speakers have given technical reasons for not achieving the alteration put forward by my noble friend <e> <s> that may be right <e> <s> but we should obtain their help to make the alteration unless they profoundly disagree with it <e> <s> if they do i cannot think why <e>", "<cs> my lords could not the change in approach to sentencing young offenders which has worked so well also be applied to older offenders <e> <s> i believe that serious recommendations have been made to that effect <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will consider them <e>", "<cs> i must support this amendment <e> <s> i live a long way away in battersea <e> <s> it is a very nice district quite near the park <e> <s> it is perfectly easy to train ones dog to hold until it gets to the park <e> <s> everyone trains their dogs to be clean in their houses and there is not the slightest excuse for allowing the streets to be fouled <e> <s> i am happy to support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords for information only perhaps i may ask whether there is a registration system <e> <s> are you allowed to call yourself a chiropodist without satisfying somebody else that you know what to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> however will the noble baroness discuss with her colleagues the importance of having standards for all activities in relation to health not only for the national health service <e>", "<cs> my lords i must support my noble friend lord annan on this matter <e> <s> i have little to add except the main argument namely that we are always against a very powerful person dealing with a very weak one <e> <s> in this case we have very weak people <e> <s> perhaps half a dozen composers and creators are powerful at any time but most of them are beginning or half-way through the creation of music whether it be i was going to say good or bad but perhaps i should not highbrow or lowbrow and their position is extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earls analysis is interesting <e> <s> does he not agree i am sure he does that the crime figures fall into two categories <e> <s> one encompasses serious crimes including violence and the other covers petty crime <e> <s> as the noble earl said serious crimes have not increased as much as petty crimes and we can be pleased about that <e> <s> nobody in the penal reform world wants mercy for crimes of violence but we can no longer afford the luxury of sending petty criminals to prison particularly when the prisons to which they are <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the noble lord who has just spoken <e> <s> it seems to me as one who has never and never intends to listen to pop or rock music that people should listen to what they want to hear <e> <s> nobody should tell them what it is called <e> <s> the noble lord said that in the fifties people were unlucky to have to listen to the music of the thirties <e> <s> well i come from the thirties and i think we were jolly lucky to be able to listen to chicago school jazz and so on which is now quite dead <e>"]
