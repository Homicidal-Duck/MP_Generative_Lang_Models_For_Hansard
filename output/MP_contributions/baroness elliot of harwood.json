["<cs> my lords this is the first speech that i have had the opportunity of making since the general election and i should like to congratulate the government on the swift way in which they have got down to business <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the lord chancellor on his speech today it was really most moving <e> <s> i feel that the encouragement we have had even from her majestys opposition and the good will is a good augury for the start of this parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support every word that has been said by the noble lord lord tanlaw and others <e> <s> however i should like to make one point which so far no one has raised <e> <s> there are certain areas in scotland and wales and i think in parts of england too where there are no railways no buses and where only one form of transport can be used namely the motor car <e> <s> those areas must he looked at by any government <e> <s> i sympathise with the present government in suddenly finding that this crisis has come upon us because it is extremely difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with very great pleasure to follow the noble lord lord walston since i am a member of committee d of your lordships house over which he presides so efficiently and with such tremendous knowledge <e> <s> when listening to him your lordships will realise that you are listening to a real expert on agriculture and that is something which we all admire very much indeed <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this debate has been delayed for quite a long time since our report was made on st march and since then there have been tremendous events <e> <s> the result of the general election has given us a new parliament a new minister and possibly some new policies although i would say that in committee d where all parties participate and our excellent chairman presides over us with great <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord lord wilson of langside with great pleasure <e> <s> everything he said i would endorse <e> <s> i also agree entirely with what has been said by the noble lord lord home of the hirsel and by the noble earl lord mansfield <e> <s> i remember that in the debate we had on the referendum there was some question that the referendum had not expressed the views of the scottish people <e> <s> i think that now we have had both the referendum and a general election there can be no doubt at all in anyones mind that the people in scotland did not like that act of parliament which they were asked to vote on in the referendum <e> <s> when it came to the general election i was absolutely staggered by the fact that at the meetings i addressed admittedly not a great many though i did take a fairly active part in the general election every time i went to speak for a candidate i would ask have you had a great many questions about scottish nationalism home rule or the referendum <e> <s> and he would reply nobody asked anything about that <e> <s> that absolutely staggered me but it was true <e> <s> it was true in glasgow it was true in the borders and it was true in one or two places in edinburgh where i went to help the conservative candidate <e> <s> i felt sure that during the general election at least there would be people who would ask many questions on this subject but it was hardly mentioned at all <e>", "<cs> my lords possibly in the area i represented there were no party politics and so it was very easy to co-operate although in fact the member of parliament was of a different political party from the majority in local government <e> <s> i think that could be got over it is not insuperable and anything that makes for closer liaison is well worth doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not require to declare my interest since the noble lord who spoke first from the opposition has pointed out that i am in fact a fairly considerable hill farmer <e> <s> while i realise that the noble earl on the government side is in the awkward position of having to economise in every possible way there are some economies which are more valuable than others <e> <s> an economy in which one could involve the lowering of production of what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has pointed out is one of the essential foodstuffs and not over-produced at all in the eec is something which we ought to think twice about <e> <s> we could still increase our production from the hills which would be an enormous advantage to the consumers in this country and an enormous advantage to everyone concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for his answer may i ask him whether there are any plans for the commission to make the french abide by the rules of the commission and whether or not if it is impossible to do that her majestys government have any plans to help in any way those british producers of sheep who are being severely hurt by this policy which is quite contrary to anything we hoped for when we went into the common market <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that reply which is certainly quite encouraging <e> <s> does he realise that although it may be improving now the decline in production of beef has been so great that it is back to levels <e> <s> it is very difficult to build up the national herd of beef if at the same time we allow the individual herds to get smaller <e> <s> i hope the government realise that this is a very urgent matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble earl very much for his most encouraging answer <e> <s> as this is one of the ways in which we can get some money back from the eec i hope the government will encourage as many people as possible to use this money in order to improve their equipment and so on with a view to selling more of our produce abroad <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that reply <e> <s> i hope that he will be successful and that he will extend as far as he possibly can inquiries to all organisations dealing with consumer affairs <e> <s> i am quite sure that in that way there will be a good response and also good replies which will serve a useful purpose <e> <s> i hope that this will continue and that many more people will become interested in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords as the th speaker in this debate i am reminded of the old saying patience is a virtue <e> <s> catch it if you can sometimes in a woman but i will not say what the end is <e> <s> like my noble friend lord belstead i have listened to every speech so we can both claim some patience <e> <s> at the outset i wish to pay tribute to the maiden speech of the right reverend prelate the bishop of bradford which was magnificent and i hope we shall often hear him <e> <s> i have some association with bradford in that one of my relations is at the university there and i would confirm everything he said about the community the variety of people in bradford and the way in which they manage to work together most successfully <e> <s> as i say i hope we shall hear from the right reverend prelate many times in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as a hill farmer and one of those who i am glad to say will have something coming to them out of this regulation i should like to thank the noble earl and the government very much for having come forward now with an appreciable increase and with sympathy which we all appreciate for our plight <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that answer and i shall read the report with great interest i hope that her majestys government will be as successful in trying to get more satisfactory answers out of russia and the east european countries as they have recently been in negotiations elsewhere that we have been hearing about <e>", "<cs> my lords is a very long time ago <e> <s> as events change with such rapidity would it not really be wise for her majestys government to start as the noble lord lord goronwy-roberts has suggested an initiative but with the intention of coming to some compromise over the money <e> <s> my lords is a very long time ago now <e> <s> masses of debts have been wiped out since <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that answer may i say that i hope very much that under his expert guidance we shall continue to make whatever representations we can about the behaviour of the russians in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> is there nothing more that can be done by us and by the european parliament to impress upon the soviet union the error of their ways <e> <s> also in view of the fact that on th january the united nations passed a unanimous resolution condemning the russians again for their afghanistan behaviour is there anything more that we can do <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an extremely interesting debate <e> <s> i was particularly interested in what the noble duke the duke of norfolk said about the problems and experiences that he has had in connection with his wonderful property <e> <s> i hope that the government will feel that what the noble duke has just said is something that can be incorporated in the bill because he has had the experience and difficulties which this bill is designed to try to prevent <e> <s> this is a wonderful occasion when we in this house have no one dissenting from the object of the bill <e> <s> it is something we all want <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend lord stanley <e> <s> i stand here tonight rather in the position of being the mother of all marketing boards since it was my husband who in started the milk marketing board and a great many others <e> <s> although some of them have not survived or have outlived their usefulness i think it is perfectly true to say this <e> <s> last year or it may have been the year before when the eec challenged whether our farmers should be able to continue with marketing hoards they said we could if the dairy industry the milk producers would vote up to per cent <e> <s> in favour of the milk marketing board <e> <s> they voted per cent <e> <s> or per cent <e> <s> in favour <e> <s> so it shows in any case that this has the wholehearted per cent <e> <s> support of the dairy industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for that reply may i ask whether it would be possible for her majestys government to suggest to the eec that they might think of ways of disposing of the surpluses in a more lucrative and better manner <e> <s> apparently they have no idea of selling agencies of any kind and it seems that all they can do is give away the surpluses <e> <s> if there could be some proposals made for selling the surpluses would he agree that that would benefit everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i rise to take part in this debate because so far we have had only speakers who have been ministers of education under-secretaries of education or those who have held very high-ranking positions in the world of education <e> <s> i can speak only with some ten years experience as chairman of an education committee but that is quite a long way away from the noble lord lord butler and the people who make the education acts <e> <s> i should like also to say with what interest and pleasure i listened to the noble lord lord butler <e> <s> i remember very well in although i was not in parliament at the time going to listen to debates in the other place <e> <s> my only association in those days was that i was chairman of one of the biggest of the youth organisations <e> <s> it was at that time that the department of education had what i think was called a youth service committee which was designed to keep close liaison both with the voluntary organisations and i was chairman of one of the biggest and with the education authorities <e> <s> so i do have some experience which laid the foundation of the present liaison between the voluntary youth organisations and the local education authorities <e> <s> that is another of the admirable results that sprang from lord butlers act <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much indeed for going to so much trouble to give me all those figures <e> <s> in view of the great complications which are going on in the world of sugar i wonder whether the minister could explain why the eec has not joined the international sugar agreement and would it not simplify things <e>", "<cs> i should like in a few words to support the noble lord and also the noble lord lord reigate <e> <s> i think if the suggestion made by the noble lord lord donaldson and the noble baroness lady birk could be incorporated and the fund itself could be the national heritage fund that would be excellent <e> <s> i am all for putting in the reason but i think the title should be left as it is <e>", "<cs> i should like to support that view very strongly <e> <s> we want to make this fund something special and if we have as i think the noble lord said five secretaries of state who might in the course of their lives put a finger in the pie i cannot imagine anything more completely muddling <e> <s> all we want is one person who and i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon in view of the importance of this heritage fund should be the first minister in the government <e> <s> if the noble lord could take this back and think about it again i am sure that it would add enormously to the importance of the fund and also simplify matters greatly because five people would not then be concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one or two questions and i declare an interest that as a farmer i am a member both of the fhds scheme and the farming capital grants scheme <e> <s> i view with some dismay the fact that at a period when everybody knows that the farming industry is in very low water these changes will probably reduce production and what farmers can do <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for his answer <e> <s> have these recommendations which arc now coming from the department been discussed with for example the national farmers union or any of the agricultural organisations particularly of course the marketing boards because i have not as yet seen any published proposals from the five advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are not going to discuss the matter with let us say the milk marketing board or any of the other marketing boards shall we in this house or in the other place be able to discuss the reports and the proposals before they are put into effect <e> <s> last thursday we had one recommendation which was put through which had not been discussed by anybody so far as i can see and it is something which has caused a certain amount of anxiety among agricultural people <e> <s> i am anxious that the agricultural community should co-operate with the government but i think that there should be opportunities for discussion and the reasons for the government taking certain action on the recommendations of these people should be made clear to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord speaks i wonder whether i may say a word because i feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> the marketing boards started and organised by the conservative party and supported by all the other parties are working extremely well <e> <s> they are subject to all the safeguards which noble lords want in connection with the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> suddenly therefore to include these boards in <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is excellent <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford chaired the committee and although i may have one or two slight criticisms to make on the whole i agree with every word that has been said by those who have spoken on the report <e> <s> it is timely since those of us who live in a rural area know how every day there are temptations for people to leave the rural areas and go into the towns although at the moment possibly not quite so much because of a certain amount of unemployment <e> <s> but in my area there is not much unemployment <e> <s> it is something one continually has to look out for and hopes to be able to prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with that too <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add a very few words from the point of view of the dairy industry the milk industry if you like and also because i support entirely the views that have been expressed by the noble lord who moved this amendment on the subject of milk in schools <e> <s> i have had a far longer association with milk in schools than anybody in this whole assembly since it was way back before the war that lord boyd-orr and my husband made the original inquiries and tests about milk and the value of milk for growing children and came out with the scheme which has been running for years and years known as the milk in schools scheme <e> <s> so i support that wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend did not mention that we are going to lose million from the eec if we cut down on the distribution of milk <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to all the speakers and to the introduction by the noble baroness lady young and i shall be very short because in fact almost everything i wanted to say has been said and said very well indeed <e> <s> my experience in this field is not so much in dealing with individual cases but having been chairman of a social work committee for something like years i have found we were always having the complications of case work that was entailed for the social workers by supplementary benefits of one kind or another <e> <s> therefore i welcome the appeal made by the noble baroness lady macleod of borve and also by the noble baroness lady faithful for simplifying the machinery of supplementary benefits as much as we possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords as a very enthusiastic supporter of the committee whose reports are now before the house i wish to begin by thanking the noble lord lord walston for the way in which he conducts our meetings and the enthusiasm which he displays <e> <s> i also wish to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos who during lord walstons absence took his place as our chairman <e> <s> i thought the noble lord lord cledwyn was first-class in his chairmanship flowing from his great experience as a former minister of agriculture he knows a very great deal about the subject <e>", "<cs> i fear i did not hear all of the noble lords question my lords but i am sure he would not disagree with my views on the behaviour of the french over sheepmeat <e> <s> he is a producer of sheep but not to the extent i am and i live in the borders of scotland where the production of sheep is a vital matter for the farming community <e> <s> we in this country are in fact the biggest producers of sheep and lamb in the eec and as such can produce better mutton and lamb than any other country and we should be allowed to sell it where the demand comes from whether it comes from different countries in europe or not <e> <s> on this matter i take a dim view of the way in which the french are behaving <e>", "<cs> may i add just one word of support <e> <s> this is an extremely valuable and very important amendment and i agree with every word of my noble friend <e> <s> i am the vice-president of one of his organisations <e> <s> the real point about this is that it is much the cheapest way of helping these people <e> <s> if as the noble baroness said you put them into old peoples homes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make a short intervention <e> <s> i apologise for not having put my name on the list of speakers until this morning <e> <s> i should like to support every word that the noble lord lord ross has said <e> <s> he made a first-class speech he said exactly what we all feel in scotland about this issue <e> <s> i hope that the government will realise that this is something which transcends all party political views it is something about which we feel deeply <e> <s> above all in not intervening to stop the bbc from doing this they are going to do irreparable damage to music not only in scotland but in the united kingdom and all over the world <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross spoke of the great influence of the scottish symphony orchestra and pointed out the enormous ramifications of this great orchestra <e> <s> i will not add to that except to say that i agree with everything he has said about it <e> <s> he put it better than anybody else could have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with enormous interest to the technical and excellent speeches that have been made and we are indebted to the noble lord lord campbell of croy for initiating a debate on this subject <e> <s> i rise because i have always had great respect for the post office and postmen who from my experience do their best to serve the public individually because the postal service is for most people a personal service <e> <s> of course it deals with vast quantities of mail and enormous distances involved are long-distance communications and all the other matters which have been excellently described by among others the noble lord lord orr-ewing but the everyday postal service is for ordinary consumers a personal service and often when the post arrives their jobs and duties for the day are revealed to them <e> <s> so i believe that on the whole each person really judges the postal service by the delivery service of which he has experience every day <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise with some hesitation to take part in this debate because last week when i put my name down to speak it was because of the first part of the motion of the noble lord lord foot <e>", "<cs> my lords the enormous number of parties was caused by the electoral system otherwise they would not have had them all <e> <s> this was an absolute disaster and i should hate to see that kind of thing happening again <e> <s> the same thing happened before the rise of hitler in germany when the weimar republic was not very strong and the changes which took place were very detrimental to the government of germany at that time <e> <s> out of that instability arose the nazis and the hitler rgime <e>", "<cs> my lords i said in my speech that there are a great many different kinds of proportional representation <e> <s> i have looked at them all <e> <s> i have studied the german system as well as the others and i still come to the conclusion that i prefer to have our existing system which after all has lasted since and is on the whole one of the most successful systems in the world today <e>", "<cs> my lords if broadcasting is one of our methods of defence which i think the noble lord has said surely it is the very cheapest kind of defence we can possibly engage in far better than building expensive weapons <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his reply <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will be successful in this <e> <s> after many years in local government i know that the temptation to appoint more people and to pay them more is very great <e> <s> i hope that he will be successful in reducing the numbers employed by the local authorities <e>", "<cs> may i say one word <e> <s> in the last years i have had a lot to do with the disabled and the integration of the disabled into the community and into the ordinary way of life <e> <s> the various kinds of disablement the conditions under which disabled people live and the way in which one can integrate them are so valid that it is important to know what are all the possibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that answer <e> <s> may i ask the government whether they realise that these delays hesitations and failures to make decisions cause particular difficulties in the world of agriculture since the growth of animals is a matter that does not stand still <e> <s> if one does not make a decision when the animal is a lamb it very soon becomes a young hogg or ewe and the period for sale is completely ruined <e> <s> if they possibly can i urge the government to ensure that decisions are taken under the eec agricultural policy <e> <s> it is really vital that a decision be taken in this matter and i ask the government to bear this in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the position can the noble lord say what will happen if new zealand does not agree <e> <s> because the entire sheep industry of england scotland and wales would therefore be in jeopardy <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the noble lord lord stewart very much for putting this motion down and for enabling so many of us to make a short contribution <e> <s> my contribution at this hour will be short <e>", "<cs> i am glad to support this amendment <e> <s> i speak as one who has been like the noble earl lord cromartie years even longer still on the county council <e> <s> it was the noble earl lord minto who succeeded me when i retired <e> <s> i can vouch for the fact that the work on the regional councils now as opposed to the counties which existed when i was on the county council is tremendously increased <e> <s> the area has increased the amount of work has increased <e> <s> the number of people who do it is smaller and it is most important that we should recognise this and help these county councillors or regional councillors and i am sure it is only right and fair that in scotland we should have the same treatment as they have in england and wales <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will recognise this and see that this amendment is included in the bill <e>", "<cs> may one word be said from the north from scotland because although my experience has been entirely there and not in england i border very extensively on the area of the noble viscount lord ridley and we have many times had conversations and consultations <e> <s> i should like to support what the noble viscount lord ridley has said i think that that amendment is a very valuable one <e> <s> like the noble lords lord cledwyn of penrhos and lord stanley of alderley i would prefer to have the more definite proposals that are contained in their amendment <e> <s> i would not support the noble lord lord sandford and the district councils views i think that that would weaken the situation <e> <s> i am quite sure that in the area in which i live and which i know the views of the noble viscount lord ridley and if possible those of the noble lords lord stanley of alderley and lord cledwyn of penhros would be ones that people would want to support <e>", "<cs> my lords i would open my few remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not possible for our government to protest particularly about the jamming of western broadcasts which i think is absolutely monstrous and also about the recent charges in east germany to germans going over to the east which is only exacerbating a situation which everybody is hoping to be able to cool down <e>", "<cs> my lords may i support this amendment <e> <s> last week we had a debate on the fisheries industry <e> <s> although the question of fish farming did not arise it is obvious that this is a vital food for the community <e> <s> the problems of fisheries in the eec particularly of our own fishing industry are very great indeed <e> <s> the question offish farming is vital <e> <s> certainly when speaking for scotland i know that there are many interests there and that fish farming would develop considerably if it had the <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment my lords <e> <s> may i ask my noble and learned friend to say what the situation is in scotland <e> <s> in my experience empty dwelling-houses there are not rated provided they are completely empty that is not containing furniture and so on and pay rates only when they are inhabitated by people using the facilities provided by the local authority <e> <s> it seems most unfair that if one has an empty house which one cannot let one might like to but there is no possibility of so doing one should be charged rates when one is not using any of the services supplied by the local authority <e> <s> i hope the government accept that people will be very upset if they suddenly find through no fault of their own because they cannot let a house that they must pay rates on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the government on this programme which seems to be going extremely well and is very successful <e> <s> in fact i hope it could be enlarged even further and possibly we <e>", "<cs> my lords i remember that when i was chairman of a housing committee in scotland very often we used to alter houses for really handicapped people by installing ramps larger doors different lavatories and so on perfectly easily under the existing legislation <e> <s> there was no difficulty at all <e> <s> it was simply proposed to the committee and the committee agreed to it or not as the case might be <e> <s> it is totally unnecessary to have any more legislation concerning houses for handicapped old people or anyone else because <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i bow to his knowledge of scotland more than to anyone elses but the fact remains that there are a lot of empty houses <e> <s> i know of many four-roomed houses in the borders of them in one place alone <e> <s> they are not going to allow people to put a father mother and three children into a little house built for pensioners <e> <s> they would not be allowed to do it they would have to take the houses which were built for ordinary people and the pensioners houses will remain for pensioners <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl for explaining the situation <e> <s> as long as it is well known and appreciated by rating authorities that nursery grounds are included among other things then i am satisfied and will withdraw the amendment <e> <s> if there is any doubt i trust that the scottish office will issue a circular of some description to give the information that this is ground which passes the test of being a market garden ground derated ground and there should be no doubt in the minds of rating authorities and they cannot descend on market gardeners or other gardeners and change the rates <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask one question <e> <s> i am entirely in favour of every word that my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has said <e> <s> i was against the proposal to charge for planning authority <e> <s> however in this amendment i note that my noble friend lord ridley talks about england and wales <e> <s> do i take it that we in scotland are in the happy position of escaping from this or are the nationalised industries to get away scot-free in scotland as they are in england and wales <e> <s> if so i am dead against it <e> <s> unfortunately the clause about charging for planning has been accepted and is in the bill but i entirely agree with my noble friend lord ridley that the nationalised industries should be included <e> <s> so i should like to know whether this amendment and the whole principle apply to scotland as well as to england and wales <e> <s> if that is so it only makes me feel more against it than i was previously <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment very strongly indeed <e> <s> ever since the reorganisation of local government in scotland there has been difficulty over the responsibilities of the regions and those of the districts <e> <s> the regions are the planning authorities and it is the regions which must be consulted and which must be brought into any development anywhere in the area within which they operate <e> <s> schedule lists the district councils the london borough councils the new town corporations the urban development corporations <e> <s> but none of those operate in scotland <e> <s> the new town corporations and the urban development corporations are not the bodies which have the authority in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for that answer may i ask him what the government intend to do or what they can do <e> <s> what is happening at the moment is that the legitimate travel agents who obey the law or the rules laid down by iata are rapidly losing their clients because what they call the bucket shops are getting tickets from the very airlines who are under iata suggesting that this should not be done <e> <s> in fact they are being undermined by the very people who they want to protect their own rules <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that answer i am sorry to say that i did not hear all of it because of a little disturbance going on opposite but i should like to congratulate the government because i understand that they have managed to get quite a lot of support from the eec fund for a scheme in this country <e> <s> i hope that will continue <e> <s> because of our contribution to the eec i hope that we shall be able to benefit from whatever we can get from them for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not bore your lordships any more than i feel i must <e> <s> as another sheep farmer who is engaged in exactly the same kind of activity as my noble friend who has just spoken i should like to add my congratulations to the noble earl lord ferrers and to the department of agriculture for having brought off this result <e> <s> this is a remarkable success considering the length of time it has taken <e> <s> i agree entirely with both the noble lord lord ross of marnock and the noble lord lord mackie that the time factor is something which the agricultural people in brussels apparently never really understand <e> <s> they go on talking about things thinking they are dealing with some dead object that is not going to change when in fact they are dealing with live objects that alter all the time <e> <s> if ones lambs are born in say april they are not at all the same if the scheme comes into effect in november they are a quite different kind of animal <e> <s> they would still be called lambs but they would be twice as big <e> <s> those in brussels do not realise that these delays are terribly frustrating <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend very much for the help that has been given to hill farmers i should like to say as a hill farmer that the urgency of the matter is tremendous <e> <s> costs have increased enormously and we need an immediate inquiry and if possible an immediate answer otherwise there will be bankruptcies right and left <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill has said this debate on the address covers a very wide field and many subjects are discussed <e> <s> i listened with great interest to what lord underhill had to say and i wished that i could have joined in for i suppose that i use the railways more than anyone in the whole house <e> <s> however i refrain from entering that discussion for i do not know enough about it

friend lady faithfull and by the noble lord lord hunt <e> <s> the passage in the gracious speech which begins <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the minister very much for that reply may i say that i am delighted that he has managed to get some alteration in the clawback for other countries <e> <s> may i hope that the minister of agriculture in the process of further discussions will be able to increase that to include the european countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> does he not think that it really is most unfair and altogether dishonest to allow and encourage as some of the airlines do the selling of tickets in the bucket shops because they cannot sell them through the ordinary channels <e> <s> surely it would be better to get iata to change the arrangements so that tickets can be sold perfectly genuinely at whatever price they are worth <e> <s> we had a good example on the railways the other day with the granny tickets <e> <s> if that had been done dishonestly by people who were not interested in honest-to-god railway traffic there would have been a tremendous row <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will do something about the unfairness to people who keep to the rules as laid down by iata <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble earl for his answer i should like to congratulate the government on this scheme <e> <s> it seems to me to be an admirable one and i hope they will not find it necessary to cut it in any way <e> <s> i am sure that it is an insurance for the future and i hope the government will encourage all areas to embark upon the scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords we are having an extremely interesting and very important debate and we are much indebted to the noble earl lord cromartie for inaugurating this discussion although i agree with the noble lord lord campbell of croy that with the forthcoming stodart report this is really an exercise in discussion and putting our points of view but to some extent i think we must wait for decisions until we see the stodart report <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a short debate as we see on the order paper and there is a great deal more business before your lordships so i shall not speak at any length but i hope very much that the present secretary of state will have an open mind about these things and that when the stodart report comes out we shall not be told that it has nothing to do with the boundaries or with reorganisation <e> <s> it must have something to do with the boundaries and it must have something to do with reorganisation <e>", "<cs> my lords it was their status that i was concerned about <e> <s> i knew that they had them but i wanted them to be grand <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of the hill-farming community i thank the government very much for this admirable proposal <e> <s> it comes at a crucial moment and also at christmas and i look upon it as a slight christmas gift from the government for which i am exceedingly grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking my noble friend very much for that answer i feel much encouraged by the fact that this should i think be a great asset to our telecommunications system <e> <s> what i wonder is whether he could tell us at all when it is likely to take place <e> <s> i am not sure whether or not the bill has gone through the house of commons yet but is there any time schedule involved <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i take part in what i think is a very remarkable debate <e> <s> nearly half the speakers on the list have spoken every speech has raised a matter of the greatest interest and each speaker has made his or her contribution in a most original manner <e> <s> this is a matter of tremendous interest to everyone and this international year of disabled people is of great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for his reply <e> <s> since i put down the question i have received an admirable summary of the european railways performance comparisons and i am glad to see that our railway system compares quite favourably <e> <s> however i hope the government realise that this is a vital service and that it is desperately important that enough investment should be made in it <e> <s> i hope the noble earl will support the british railways board in their efforts to try to improve the services which they give to the public <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to all the very interesting speeches and i want to speak not about transport policy in general but about the railways about transport by rail about british rail <e> <s> i do so because in company with others of your lordships i use the railways almost as much as or perhaps more than anybody in this house <e> <s> i do so because i travel every weekend of my life back to scotland and come down to london and always on the railway and i like it <e> <s> i like the railways i like the services they give us <e> <s> i think the railways are a great asset to this country <e> <s> but i think there are a lot of things we could do to help the railways <e>

to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for his reply which has reassured me considerably <e> <s> i tabled the question because i saw an article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that by not taking decisions by not suggesting that iata rules should be changed the government are penalising the travel agents who obey the law who are members of iata and carry out the rules <e> <s> the people who do not the bucket shops are profiting by this which many of us think is most unfair <e>", "<cs> my lords i take part in this debate for the simple reason that i have been attending all the committee meetings that we have had on sugar which were chaired so ably by the noble lord lord walston <e> <s> i also take part to back him up in every way in the speech that lie has just made <e> <s> he has in fact said exactly that which our committee is anxious for the government to realise <e> <s> it is an appropriate moment for him to put down this question because it was a year ago at the time we were first discussing this question of the production of sugar and refineries and so on when we were warned when the noble earl lord jellicoe was giving evidence to us from tate and lyle that if the import of cane sugar went down any further tate and lyle would be in the unfortunate position of having to close the factory <e>", "<cs> may i support the noble lord lord glenkinglas because it is not only in the hill areas where it is very difficult to kill foxes <e> <s> in some areas particularly in the south of scotland where there are enormous forests it is quite impossible to hunt foxes <e> <s> hunting is one of the ways in which we used to kill them but you cannot do that now because there are hundreds of foxes and if you go out hunting the hounds get into a vast forest and they are all lost <e> <s> so far from hunting being any good for killing foxes it does no good at all <e>", "<cs> i should like to support my noble friend lord gisborough in his amendment <e> <s> there is all the difference in the world between developments which are on a commercial basis or which involve other interests and other people and the farmer or landowner being allowed to move a small proportion of gravel or whatever it may be for the sole purpose of mending a hole in the road or doing some other improvement which is important to him but which has no significance for a planning authority <e>", "<cs> i thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i am very much reassured <e> <s> he spoke about the use of minerals for roadmaking <e> <s> i was thinking about roads over the hills and the use of these minerals to fill up bog holes so that tractors can get across the hills instead of disappearing into the mud <e> <s> my amendment has nothing to do with making roads to be used by the public <e> <s> one would of course need planning permission for that <e> <s> when the clause is <e>", "<cs> i want to say a word about this <e> <s> i feel strongly about it <e> <s> in a long experience of farming i have always dealt either with the ministry of agriculture in england or the ministry of agriculture in scotland <e> <s> i have never had to deal with the ncc and i think most farmers would find it rather strange if they suddenly had to deal with another organisation which they have never had anything to do with because no question of interference with conservancy had ever arisen <e> <s> the secretary of state for scotland whom the noble lord lord donaldson mentioned is the authority which i think is the right authority to be used on this and other occasions where agriculture is involved <e> <s> it is the same thing with the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> i am all for consulting with the ncc if required and for their giving such advice if asked to do so but i do not think that they should be a licensing authority <e>", "<cs> i take it that when my noble friend mentioned the ministry of agriculture he included the secretary of state for scotland because that is the authority in scotland <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment because i think it would help very much if the government would put something of this kind into the bill <e> <s> there are a variety of escape clauses for thieves if one does not absolutely write down what would happen <e> <s> anyone who was stealing an animal or a bird or whatever it might be and then got some help from someone taking him off in a motor car or a land rover who was not as it were involved in the actual theft could probably get away with it <e> <s> if we could bring in something of this kind i think it would be an additional method of helping the police or whoever was dealing with the offence to catch the offender <e> <s> i hope that the government will take this quite seriously and will either incorporate this amendment in the bill or one of the suggestions made by the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that reply <e> <s> however to me the idea that they will be consulted without writing it into the bill means that it is something which can be avoided <e> <s> i think that it would he better if when considering these matters the noble lord looked at it again to see whether or not it could not be a statutory obligation on the secretary of state for the environment to have representatives from those two departments and i particularly press the scottish representative for scotland <e>", "<cs> i hope that the government will think about this <e> <s> i have no idea how many of the various societies to which the noble lord lord melchett referred are on statutory bodies <e> <s> my point was really that as regards anything of this kind which affects agriculture the ministers concerned should be consulted <e> <s> there are a lot of things about which they do not need to be consulted but on these particular matters they do need to be consulted <e> <s> although i shall not press the amendment i hope that the government will think about the matter as something which so to speak completes the picture in a fairer manner <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i listened with great interest to what the noble earl lord avon had to say but i am not very happy about it <e> <s> in the farming world if the land has been designated and cannot be used for what it could normally be used for it must lose its value i cannot see how it can do anything else <e> <s> i think it unfair that there should be no possibility of any compensation <e> <s> in view of the noble earls explanation i shall not press the amendment but i do not like the answer very much <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words since this amendment is exactly the same as the one to which i referred a few moments ago <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord lord houghton that those of us who do have land are desperately anxious to conserve it to share it with as many people as possible and to do everything we can to improve it agriculturally and in other ways and that some of us think that some of the things done in the name of conservation or what-have-you do not always improve the land <e> <s> on the other hand i would say that i am on the whole prepared to defend the farming population and the farming industry as being anxious to preserve the land and to do the very best with it much more for instance than the people who outside towns use it for building houses planning purposes and all that sort of thing which does away with it <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the governments reply <e> <s> i am afraid i think it is not good enough <e> <s> i cannot understand why you should not have the owner and the occupier or the owner or the occupier <e> <s> there will be far more delay if one or other of them takes great exception to what is being done and takes the matter to court <e> <s> it would be infinitely better to get the goodwill of both sets of people <e> <s> i would have thought it would be perfectly simple to add either as lord renton suggested or owner or put in occupier and owner as long as it is not just the occupier because that seems to me too silly one would be dealing with only one side when one wants to get the goodwill of everybody <e> <s> i will withdraw the amendment but i think the government should look at this because it seems to me it is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords we are much indebted to the noble lord lord byers for putting down this question which is of passionate interest to all of us <e> <s> it is now quite a while since we had a debate in your lordships house on this subject and i think the situation has changed dramatically since that time <e> <s> to begin with there are quarrels and wars between arab countries between as we know iran and iraq and they have nothing to do with israel israel is not involved with them <e> <s> the arab states are conducting most unwisely wars against each other and israel is outside it <e> <s> the production of oil is suffering which also affects the whole world <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment because it is one which deeply concerns anyone who farms in hill areas whether it be wales northumberland cumberland the south of scotland or anywhere where there are great areas which are used for grazing <e> <s> to allow stray dogs on to those areas can be absolutely devastating <e> <s> i know that people normally think that dogs are very harmless animals and that they do not do anything which they should not do and so on <e> <s> however they can terrify sheep and they can of course attack them although i am not saying that ordinarily they would do so <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask a question before the amendment is withdrawn <e> <s> my noble friend spoke about restrictions being called the countryside code <e> <s> does that apply to scotland <e> <s> because i have never heard of it in my life <e> <s> i live in an area where any amount of trouble is caused by dogs not on footpaths but on the hills <e> <s> the dogs get away <e> <s> those of us who are anxious as i am to see that people can walk over the hills can go on our land and so on are only too delighted to let them do so provided that they do not have dogs that chase the sheep <e>

put bulls into every field or on to every hill <e> <s> it is only at a certain time of the year when the bull and the cow run together <e>", "<cs> my lords is there a time limit on the investigations of this group commission or whatever it is called remembering that the problem of timing is vital <e> <s> how soon has this committee been asked to report on what is a desperate situation <e>", "<cs> had given notice of her intention to ask the following question <e>", "<cs> my lords all that remains in regard to my question is to ask this of the noble lord who has already answered the question most admirably can he tell us anything about the position in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak in this debate with some diffidence but i have been and still am chairman of a fairly large agricultural auction market and have had or more years experience of that <e> <s> but i speak today more as the first chairman of the first consumer council <e> <s> i have had a long association with consumer organisations and it is really on their behalf that i should like to make a very few remarks in this debate <e>", "<cs> i apologise my lords <e> <s> the registry of business names is what i meant <e> <s> this proposal has caused alarm and despondency among many consumer organisations <e> <s> the national consumer council which is the consumer organisation that succeeded the council of

vice-president and which publishes admirable documents such as <e>", "<cs> at what point my lords does an international agreement which is breaking all the laws receive the consent or the approval of the member governments <e> <s> surely when the law is being broken the international agreement can no longer stand <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to hear from my noble friend that this is a popular subject <e> <s> i wonder whether there is anything more that can be done because i have a feeling that this kind of training is very useful and that adult education colleges and classes are the ideal place for this to be done <e> <s> i hope very much that more encouragement will be given to people and that more classes will be provided if they are really wanted <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord why there is this hold up <e> <s> every time he very kindly gives an answer it is always the same one namely we are waiting for iata <e> <s> why cannot we as members of iata as leaders in europe call a meeting of the iata members to deal with this subject straight away so that people are not breaking the law <e> <s> what is so irritating is that people are breaking the law and one cannot do that in this country without being prosecuted but in fact nobody is being prosecuted <e> <s> why cannot her majestys government call an iata conference and get this matter straightened out once and for all <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble baroness lady phillips i am associated not with the general nursing council but with the royal college of nursing and i have had a very interesting letter which was received also by the noble lord lord wells-pestell putting the points which have been put already by him and by the noble baroness lady phillips <e> <s> i should like to say that while i am a strong supporter of the eec and i realise that it is important that there should be freedom of movement between the eec countries i agree with what was said by the noble baroness lady phillips that this freedom of movement is useless if members of the nursing profession or doctors or dentists come into the country but cannot make themselves understood <e> <s> not only can they not make themselves understood but the people they are attending cannot make communication with them <e> <s> fortunately i have been in good health all my life but when i have been ill it has been absolutely vital to be able to talk with freedom and understanding to the nurse or doctor looking after me <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his speech and for the alterations that he has managed to make in the regulations that we are discussing <e> <s> i speak from the standpoint of having been in local government for years and having for a long time served on a planning authority <e> <s> i know that in addressing my questions to the noble lord lord bellwin i am speaking to someone who has had the same kind of experience as i have had in local government <e> <s> i agree with much of what the noble baroness lady birk said <e> <s> she put the criticisms very fairly and they come from the kind of authorities that have been in touch with me <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not delay the house but i feel very strongly against compulsory powers <e> <s> people are talking as though farmers are not interested in conservation <e> <s> we are interested in conservation and in preserving the beauty of the countryside and doing everything to get it used by the public in general and also in developing it according to voluntary agreements <e> <s> this idea that the farmers are all intent on ploughing up what is beautiful is rubbish <e> <s> i have been farming for years <e> <s> i live quite near some of the parks in the north of england in northumbria and we do not have any trouble <e> <s> everybody co-operates with everybody <e> <s> i have not heard of a single person who has done something against conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> as i think your lordships are aware i am a hill farmer <e> <s> last thursday night there was a discussion on how to help farmers <e> <s> i can tell your lordships that the very worst thing that can happen to a hill farmer is for his sheep to be chased or bitten by dogs involving perhaps the killing of gimmers as my noble friend said <e> <s> this is a very serious matter <e> <s> i was glad to hear what the noble lord lord melchett had to say about this <e> <s> i have only one difference with him <e> <s> i think that hill land must be included <e> <s> the real hill farmer probably has only a small proportion of his land enclosed his biggest flock is out on the hill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has said that this is an all-party amendment <e> <s> certainly i am speaking from these benches with great conviction and experience in this subject having been a chairman of the consumer council <e> <s> i can also speak for the noble viscount lord hanworth who unfortunately could not be here <e> <s> he and i were together on the original consumer council and i do not think that he would disagree with anything i have to say <e> <s> in this amendment and on this occasion we have a group of all-party people <e> <s> how many people on this side of

kilgerran and lord ponsonby of shulbrede is absolutely correct <e>", "<cs> my lords after a most interesting discussion i think we can perhaps return to our debate on agriculture <e> <s> it falls to

people would he impress upon them the fact that this would be an extremely popular thing to do <e> <s> to do away with the cheating which is what is going on now which we all know about is something which would redound enormously to the credit of this government and the minister if he could possibly bring it about <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for his answer <e> <s> i hope the government will encourage as much as possible the <e>", "<cs> my lords mention has been made of my speech <e> <s> the problems are very difficult and very bad <e> <s> i supported the last amendment that the noble lord lord stanley moved and i intend to support this one <e> <s> gundogs are not a

bill i spoke with some strong feeling on the subject of a central register of business names <e> <s> i promised my noble friend lord trefgarne that would listen very carefully to what he said about

variety of different agencies and organisations which are all interested in this matter and as your lordships know i am particularly interested in it because was the first person to be chairman of the first consumer council <e> <s> it has now passed into much bigger hands and is backed by the government and paid for by the government but i still remain extremely interested in this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask whether she is aware that in a world in which there is so much violence both here and overseas and in which there are so many violent groups right just as much as left there is a danger of having politics infiltrated into the schools by various methods which one would deplore <e> <s> it is to be hoped that the government will keep a very close eye on the subject because it could be dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with the greatest interest to the whole of this debate and the speeches that have been made <e> <s> i have spent many years of my life in social work and i look back on the first time that i met the noble lord lord wells-pestell <e> <s> i do not know how many years ago it was but it was a long time before the war <e> <s> he was the mayor of a london borough i forget which one and i went as chairman of the youth clubs to make a speech there and to try to persuade that borough to give money to the youth clubs <e> <s> i had a very friendly reception from the noble lord and if i remember rightly although it is or years ago i think we got some money out of him <e> <s> i say this simply because although i think he does realise it he did not appear to realise how deeply many of us have been engaged all our lives in social work and in my case particularly in family work and youth work <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i think that education is ablsolutely vital and i should be only too happy to see as much money as possible spent on education <e> <s> but it must be money that we earn money that we can spend because we have it and not money that we have to borrow with the result that at the end of the day the next generation is poorer than todays generation <e> <s> i entirely agree with what the noble lord says about education <e>", "<cs> my lords as the seventh or eighth member of your lordships house to take part in this extremely interesting debate i shall be very short <e> <s> but first of all i wanted very much to thank lord mottistone for the admirable way in which he has chaired the committee and also the members of the committee for the interest which i think we all have in it and in the work that it does <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether government will encourage the planning officers of buildings for which they are responsible to be very attentive to the access to new buildings being put up by local authorities and planning that they should be made adequate to deal with the access to which the noble viscount lord ingleby refers <e> <s> it is the planning authorities of local government which i hope the government will press on this important matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to take part in this debate having spent a great number of years in local government in scotland in particular the borders <e> <s> the noble earl lord minto took my place as the representative when in after years i thought it was time somebody else took on the responsibility <e> <s> i shall not follow what the noble earl said because i think it is for my noble friend lord mansfield to answer those points but i must tell him that his reaction was a little over-strong <e> <s> i say that because having spent many years in local government i find no difficulty in supporting the government in the bill which contains a number of important aspects <e>", "<cs> my lords i have spoken in these debates because i have a very close association with consumer organisations not with business as such but with all the consumer organisations which cover the whole country <e> <s> it is a very wide spread of organisations and people who are deeply concerned with honesty and getting fair play for both the consumer and for the business person <e> <s> i had hoped very much that the government would put forward an amendment which we should all be able to support including i am sure the noble lord lord mishcon and it is a disappointment to me that that has not happened <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to this discussion and i am wondering just how many noble lords have had letters or com <e>", "<cs> as the noble viscount has said this amendment has come to some of us on all sides of the committee it certainly came to me from the scottish landowners federation <e> <s> in many ways the conditions in scotland are more difficult as our water descends from heaven if from nowhere else

museum but it is a place where one can learn about the trees <e> <s> it is an absolutely first-class amenity <e> <s> i cannot imagine anybody if they were rash enough to buy some of that vast forest

amendment strongly <e> <s> in the south of scotland and the borders where i live the forestry commission practically surrounds every farm <e> <s> it is vast and we farm almost in the trees as it were so close are they <e> <s> this state of affairs would never have existed had there been real co-operation many years ago when the forestry commission began and there would never have been this vast area of forest taking up so much agricultural land but that is done and finished with and there is no point in dwelling on that <e> <s> my noble friend lord mansfield knows well the real problem for farming that exists and that we must have co-operation <e> <s> i beg him to accept the amendment because it would do a tremendous amount of good <e>", "<cs> i shall very briefly support the noble lord

allowed to break the rules may i ask the minister why british airways and any other british airline should suffer and lose business because they are sticking to the iata rules when nobody else is <e>

keep the house for only two minutes or so <e> <s> i should like to say with what enthusiasm i greet this bill and how optimistic i feel having listened to all the speeches today <e> <s> i think that there is a real head of steam in this country today wanting to do something practical and helpful on this particular problem <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the government and my noble friend lord campbell of croy for getting the amendment into the scottish bill <e> <s> i think that that will be a great help in scotland and i hope that it will apply also to england <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend very much for that most encouraging reply <e> <s> i think the sooner this report is published and the details known to the public the better it will be in this difficult situation for the police <e> <s> i am delighted to hear that the results of this survey are to be published in july <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with interest to the noble lord lord ross of marnock and one appreciates that he has immense experience of all kinds of government particularly of government in scotland <e> <s> but i must protest at some of the remarks he made <e> <s> first he said that those of us on this side of the house did not support our noble friend lord mansfield <e> <s> i made as strong a speech as i could on second reading which was countered by my noble friend lord minto <e> <s> both of us live in the same area and as i think i told your lordships he has succeeded me on the regional council <e> <s> on this particular bill we differ and there is no reason why we should not after all we differ from our friends in many ways <e> <s> but that does not make me any less friendly towards him <e>", "<cs> my lords i have asked this question several times and we are always fobbed off with the fact that iata are the controlling agency <e> <s> if iata are the controlling agency ought they not to control their members so that their members do not break their laws <e>", "<cs> my lords would it be possible for the government not to lose this opportunity of issuing a circular to local authorities urging them to study the availability of access for the disabled in any new building which is put up <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very brief indeed because so much has already been <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble earl for introducing this bill <e> <s> as with all education bills we cannot think that it is not a controversial bill <e> <s> it is controversial and no doubt we shall hear from the noble lord lord ross all that he feels in this matter <e> <s> i have had as i expect most people have a great deal of information sent to me by cosla by the educational institute of scotland by the advisory council on child care and by the mentally handicapped childrens organisations <e> <s> i have studied all these with great care and i know of course that we all have different views about how best education shall be handled in scotland or indeed in any other part of the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to pay my tribute from these benches to the persistence the accuracy and the care with which the noble baroness lady burton has pursued this matter <e> <s> it is really wonderful and it shows that there are still people who believe that one must fight for things which one believes to be right and not allow them to pass under the counter as it were so that no one pays any attention to them <e> <s> we are all deeply indebted to the noble baroness and like other noble lords who have spoken in the debate i pay my tribute to her <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord regarding the discussion which is obviously going to be highly controversial and i read with interest the debate in the other place who in the end has the authority to say to the ncc you cannot have this land <e> <s> is the minister of agriculture the man who finally decides or is he at the command of the ncc <e>", "<cs> i have listened with great interest to what has been said because i spent quite a long time of my life as chairman of an education committee doing the sort of planning which the noble lord lord ross speaks of and which was necessary particularly in a rural area when the population changed <e> <s> numbers might go down and it was therefore necessary rather reluctantly on my part either to amalgamate two rural schools or to close one and take the children to a school in a nearby town <e> <s> but it did not really worry the education authority because in fact they only did it because it was necessary and because the parents wanted it and therefore it all went quite smoothly <e>", "<cs> i support the government on this issue <e> <s> it is a long time since i was closely associated with the scottish office and the secretary of state although there was a time in my life when i was married to a secretary of state and never in my life have i seen anyone who has more matters referred to him <e> <s> i cannot imagine not wanting to cast off some of the work covered in the phrase referred to the secretary of state <e> <s> the secretary of state has to adjudicate on and express opinions about an enormously wide range of subjects and i should have thought that it would be marvellous to cast off some of the responsibilities to someone else <e> <s> undoubtedly the sheriff if he was a local sheriff would know the local conditions very well and if publicity would be detrimental to the parent or child anonymity could be preserved <e> <s> i consider that in this instance the sheriff would be a very suitable person to make the final decision and i support the government in what they propose <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock on the great importance of notification a very early age of any disability or handicap in children whether mental or physical handicap <e> <s> that is extremely important <e> <s> it is only after many years of publicity from voluntary organisations dealing with the mentally handicapped <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for that intervention <e> <s> it may be that i am not as up-to-date as i ought to be but the general principle that it is the local people and the local authority who can both disseminate information and know where the information should go is i think still the most important thing <e>", "<cs> i shall add only a few words to what has been said <e> <s> i support the amendment because it has been pointed out to me by the scottish consumer council that a great many of the parents and other people concerned with the education of children are worried lest the appeal committee is highly biased and has no really independent chairman <e> <s> this is not in the least a political point it is purely a practical one and we are anxious to ensure that the appeal committee contains a majority of independent representatives and that it is seen to be functioning fairly in the eyes of the parents who are appealing against an education authority decision <e> <s> at the same time the chairman of the appeal committee should be an independent person and should not be a member of the education committee or authority <e> <s> he should be somebody who can be quite independent and can view these discussions from an independent point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not help the government very much indeed if they got out this report in view of all this speculation <e> <s> there is no doubt a very good reason for the decision about the gas showrooms and this could be explained <e> <s> if the government would only get the report out immediately i should have thought there would be an enormous advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for that reply <e> <s> i am sure that the consultations will be of great importance and will prove to be a great success <e> <s> but does the minister realise that the public order act under which the police are at present operating dates from <e> <s> it seems to me that it is a long time since anybody tried to alter that to meet present conditions and although i agree that it is extremely difficult a little speed might help the police was a long time ago <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name on the list of speakers but i shall be speaking for only a very short time <e> <s> i should like to say how much i approved of every single word that our chairman has said tonight <e> <s> no one could have described this report more accurately and more interestingly <e> <s> i was present at a good many though not all of the interviews which we had <e> <s> but not being particularly interested in poultry i am afraid that i did not do as much homework as i might have done on other subjects <e> <s> however i am quite sure that the house has had from the noble lord lord cledwyn an absolutely first-class description of what happened when we were taking evidence and discussing the matter and i can add very little to what he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall follow the example of the speakers who have already taken part in this debate and be very short <e> <s> first may i congratulate my noble friend lord mansfield on the way he introduced the bill <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock said that this is an extremely complicated and rather difficult bill to make one speech about because it deals with so many subjects <e> <s> however i think that my noble friend lord mansfield introduced it in a most encouraging way and i shall certainly support him as much as i possibly can <e> <s> may i also congratulate the noble lord lord ross of marnock on his researches into history <e> <s> the fact that in there was a bill which contained clauses whereas this bill contains only is an improvement <e> <s> the way in which the noble lord lord ross of marnock looked back on the past was most engaging <e> <s> i was fascinated by all he had to say about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say one or two words very briefly <e> <s> i appreciate entirely the problem facing our minister of agriculture when he has to go to brussels and argue our case because our case is a simple one <e> <s> we farmers in this country have tried and tried very successfully as the noble lord lord bishopston said for a number of years to improve the techniques and the production to lower costs employ fewer people and at the same time increase the amount of land under cultivation and the amount produced <e> <s> in this case we are referring to dairy and pigs <e> <s> we have been extremely successful <e>", "<cs> i do not speak with great knowledge and experience of this subject because it never came up in the days when i was on my local county council <e> <s> however i have with me a letter from the border regional council supporting what the noble lord has just said <e> <s> they believe it would be simpler and make for more equal licensing methods including in relation to charges if it was the wider area which controlled the licensing rather than the district only <e> <s> it might be difficult in the highland area but on the whole my feeling is that bearing in mind that this is a public service and that the public travel widely on these occasions and can easily go outside the districts it would be better if it were a wider area which was responsible for the licensing <e> <s> i therefore support the view that the licensing authority for a public service of this kind should be on the widest basis and should be the region rather than the district <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that reply <e> <s> however is it not a fact that the number on the registry of business names and the register of companies has gone up considerably this year and amounts to something like <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a word or two to thank the noble lord lord ross for his reference to my husband because it was he who put through the original bill <e> <s> if i remember rightly it was the first bill that gave an independent housing authority controlled by the scottish office but still not attached to local government authority the chance to build houses as the noble lord lord ross has said in parts of scotland which were difficult of access and expensive to build in and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of hill farmers i should like to say that we are extremely grateful to the government for this additional allowance <e> <s> of course everybody wants more <e> <s> i entirely agree with the noble lord who has just sat down that if we can have more we will take it happily <e> <s> on the other hand let us be grateful for what we have been given <e> <s> it is true that while most hill farmers have been having two or three extremely bad years this year has been slightly better <e> <s> one only hopes that it will continue <e> <s> on behalf of the many hill farmers of which i am one we should like to say to the government that this is helpful and useful and we are grateful to them for having arranged this with the eec as well as with the national farmers union <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment which has been moved by the noble baroness lady faithfull <e> <s> as chairman of a social work committee for many years i had some experience of finding myself with people who turned up either homeless or not knowing what to do or who had no employment and no one to back them up in any way <e> <s> the social workers had to look after them or did look after them if they applied in any way but it would have been very much easier if this had been an obligation which the social service department in a county or city would be able to cope with <e> <s> i believe that this is an <e>", "<cs> i should like to add one word <e> <s> i have listened with the greatest interest to the speeches that have been made by both the noble lord lord hooson and my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i think that what my noble friend said appeals more to my feeling about this clause in the bill which is obviously something that concerns us all very deeply indeed <e>", "<cs> i also have received the same letter as the noble lord lord underhill and i think that it is well worth going into this matter <e> <s> it can be an abuse i do not know whether it is or is not <e> <s> anyway it is something that should fit into a bill of this kind when we are making licences for different things <e> <s> i hope that the noble earl will possibly do what my noble friend has just suggested and will not wait too long but will get hold of the matter <e> <s> it would not require a great deal of planning or anything else to put it into the bill as it is <e>", "<cs> i should also like to support that <e> <s> if we say or children pass on to secondary school at any rate in the country districts when they are or and therefore have more experience <e> <s> but i certainly think that is the absolute minimum and i would not mind if it were <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this proposal of the noble lord lord ross of marnock <e> <s> it is so to speak a fairly new offence with young people <e> <s> it is quite inexplicable so far as i am concerned i simply cannot understand why it has caught on as it has <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking my noble friend for that reply may i ask him whether the response in taking up the shares has been as enthusiastic as we hoped it would be and does he think the scheme will go ahead the moment it starts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are very much indebted to the noble earl for raising this question and making such a fascinating speech himself about an extremely fascinating document <e> <s> i think this is a subject which we have never before aired in your lordships house and i am very glad that it has been brought up tonight <e> <s> we in scotland have some of the loveliest museums and galleries in the united kingdom <e> <s> i so much agree with the noble earl when he talks about the national gallery in edinburgh <e> <s> i think it is one of the most beautiful galleries certainly in the united kingdom and i would even say further afield in europe <e> <s> it is a really marvellous little gallery <e> <s> what is more our galleries attract very large numbers of people <e> <s> any of us who have attended as i have since the very beginning the edinburgh festival will have noticed that a tremendous number of people are fascinated by the galleries and the exhibits that are shown especially on those special occasions <e> <s> we get a very good return for the money that is spent on our galleries <e>", "<cs> i remember very well the election which the noble lord has just mentioned when glasgow still had a great many air raid shelters <e> <s> they were very ugly things with cement roofs and brick or cement sides <e> <s> people were not supposed to use them for advertising but the supporters of our opponent in the election and my husband was fighting kelvin grove covered everywhere with posters of himself as the labour candidate for kelvin grove <e> <s> it was very difficult to compete with that so on the day before polling day i organised a tremendous group of enthusiastic conservatives who over-posted all the labour posters with the slogan vote for elliot <e>", "<cs> i would like to support my noble friend <e> <s> this is an administrative bill which covers all the country and all the different types of organisations which are administered in scotland <e> <s> to me civic conjures up a purely urban or city area and it would be a great mistake to leave it at that <e> <s> whether local administration can be improved upon i do not know but i much prefer it to civic government <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the splendid contribution which british agriculture makes to the balance of payments may i ask my noble friend to assure us that the government will not support the devaluation of the green pound which has halved the sterling value of the increases <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment and to refer to what the noble baroness lady faithfull said on her amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i think it would be a good idea if we could have a combination of the responsibilities <e> <s> the district health authorities are after all not local authorities they do work under a different jurisdiction <e> <s> on the other hand the importance of the social work department and the possibility of social workers being able to undertake the care and supervision as it were of people coming out of mental hospitals would avoid a tremendous amount of trouble <e> <s> it would probably save quite a lot of money <e> <s> it would enable these people to live in the ordinary community but with someone to whom they can talk and who can help them <e>", "<cs> my lords in the half minute i have left i should like to thank all noble lords very much indeed for the part they have played in this debate <e> <s> whatever else one may say about it the debate has been enormously constructive <e> <s> i have learnt a great deal as i am sure did the minister from the reactions which people have exhibited and the stories they have told <e> <s> the experience has been very valuable indeed and i hope that the government will pay attention <e> <s> i am sorry that the debate could not have gone on longer because i enjoyed every moment of it <e> <s> i want to thank all noble lords very much indeed for taking part and i beg leave to withdraw the motion <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer which is encouraging but i hope that the government will encourage more people to do this since obviously it is one way to get new houses at very low cost <e> <s> i understand that in the budget it was proposed that the grants of up to percent <e> <s> are to continue and therefore this will be one <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government realise that this is a subject which has been so to speak on the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank my noble friend very much for that admirable reply which said a great many of the things i hoped the minister would say may i ask whether he would also agree that the demand for housing has changed in the last years or more in that the demand today is for the modernisation of older houses making them fit for living in and then the opportunity given to the people wanting houses to buy them rather than rent them <e>", "<cs> my lords we have heard most interesting speeches and we are indebted to the noble lord lord lucas for having introduced this debate <e> <s> it shows also how much agreement there is in your lordships house on a subject of this kind <e> <s> i have listened to all the speeches and i have agreed with everything that the noble lord lord underhill had to say and i admired the way he put it i have agreed with everything that the noble lord lord taylor said he having had great experience on the board of a scottish railway and i have also agreed with many other people <e> <s> i was interested in lady loudouns description of waterways of which i am afraid i know absolutely nothing but which i am quite sure are very important <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my contribution to this debate entirely agreeing with everything that the noble baroness lady burton has just said <e> <s> i will if i may congratulate the noble lord lord mishcon on the manner in which he introduced this bill which made it simple to understand although in some ways it is a rather complicated bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise to your lordships for the fact that this is the third speech that i have made in two days in the house <e> <s> i promise that i will be brief <e> <s> but i could not possibly not take part in this debate because i want to express my thanks to the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i can tell your lordships quite honestly that if in scotland where per cent <e> <s> of our land is designated as less favoured anything were done to reduce the assistance which goes to farming in those areas it would be very unpopular <e> <s> that land cannot be used for anything else and it would become derelict which in itself would be a disaster <e> <s> also i take some pride in the fact that in scotland we have a very efficient sheep and hill cattle industry <e> <s> that is a great help to farmers who want to buy store animals and fatten them on rich land which as i know from my delightful experiences the noble lord lord walston farms in england <e> <s> however that is by the way and i hope that your lordships will forgive me for making that slight digression <e>", "<cs> my lords do the government realise that there is a terrific head of interest about this particular consumer report <e> <s> i get any number of letters <e> <s> it is vital that we should have some discussion in the house otherwise we are dependent on noble lords and the noble baroness lady burton who never fails to bring this matter up and it is something we desperately want <e> <s> is it possible for the government to make some proposal for a date some time so that we can really get going on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend lord fellers very much indeed for what appears to be a very successful outcome to what was a very difficult thing for the glasshouse industry in this country <e> <s> i congratulate and thank my noble friend warmly for having brought this about <e>", "<cs> my lords before i ask this question i must declare an interest <e> <s> i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i would like to thank the noble earl very much for that extremely good news <e> <s> i am quite sure it will be appreciated when one realises that per cent <e> <s> of scotland is less favoured area and all that the noble earl has said will apply to them <e> <s> i think we must be extremely grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord kinross has put the matter very clearly and very simply <e> <s> i was approached by the noble earl lord haig who i think is president of the british legion scotland and who unfortunately cannot be here today <e> <s> i know that he feels very strongly about this matter <e> <s> when something is working well is a success and fills an important gap in this type of legislation it is a great mistake not to continue it <e> <s> so often legislation is concerned with changing things when change is not necessary <e> <s> the existing legislation and the amendment that is being put forward reflects exactly what is happening and what should continue <e> <s> i hope the government will realise that certainly in scotland we should be extremely disappointed if the legislation is not continued <e> <s> if it is a success why not let it continue and include it in the bill so that it would cover more people <e> <s> so i very much hope that the government will do what lord kinross seeks and accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to take part in this debate <e> <s> it is somewhat of an historic moment for me because i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord oxford and asquith with whom i have an association which goes back to his grandfather who was in fact my brother-in-law <e> <s> it is very interesting that we should be able to meet in the house of lords during a debate of this kind <e> <s> i did not know that he was going to speak and i suppose that he did not know that i was going to speak either <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him very much indeed although i do not agree with everything that he said because as the noble lord lord chelwood said those of us who are interested in the middle east are generally interested because we feel strongly on one side or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the government very much on those admirable results of their financial policy <e> <s> hope that they will continue at that rate for a long time to come <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount very much for that most encouraging reply may i also ask whether he welcomes the fact that productivity in manufacturing is rising at record levels and that over-manning has been virtually eliminated in much of british industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that in the united states of america candidates are not accepted unless they have a considerable number of supporters endorsing

trades or the consumers and any change can only cause unnecessary disruption duplication confusion and extra expenditure <e> <s> i think those words come from the consumer council and i believe they

that he said but i agree completely with him <e> <s> i thought his speech fascinating <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross of marnock like me has a great interest in scottish literature <e> <s> his quotations from our national bard were most apt and important <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord why a programme which is being backed by her majestys government which is receiving excellent grants from the eec and which is approved by everybody should suddenly be attacked in this way doing much harm to the work and delaying things very badly indeed <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to say what he is really going to do about it because it is just no good saying we arent going to do anything and it is most important that the kind of rubbish that it being written should be stopped <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for his most encouraging answer <e> <s> i hope that every possible opportunity will be taken to urge capital expenditure in the areas where much still needs to be done and can be done <e> <s> i understand that both the labour and materials are there <e> <s> what is required is a certain amount of drive <e> <s> i hope that the government will put that drive behind their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the moment has come when we may perhaps return to the question of the scottish mental health bill <e> <s> i have listened with great interest to the speeches that have been made and i shall speak for only a very short time <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the minister on the way in which he introduced the bill and to say that the principle on which it is based namely that people suffering from mental disorder should have the same protection and rights under this legislation as they would have if they were suffering from physical illness is one with which i entirely agree <e> <s> the fact that certain conditions of mental illness are different from physical handicap and require different treatment only makes it more important that such treatment should be very carefully planned and administered and that the bill is designed to do <e>", "<cs> i too fully support what has been said by the minister and by the noble lord lord ross <e> <s> the words mentally defective have a slur attached to them and i think that mentally handicapped is a much better term to use <e>", "<cs> i should like to comment on this <e> <s> in the many years during which i was chairman of a health committee and a social work committee after-care was the most important thing we had to do <e> <s> we used to spend an enormous amount of time and trouble either getting the social work department to deal with this because mostly it was that department that did so or getting the help of voluntary organisations interested in mental health and in the after-care of mental patients <e> <s> i am sure that it would be to the advantage of any local authority or health authority dealing with this aspect to know that no one leaves a mental hospital of any kind without the health committee or the health authority in the area being notified and being absolutely certain that from that moment there is someone available to supervise look after and care for that person to ensure that he will not return to hospital which otherwise is almost inevitable <e>", "<cs> having run a social work committee for a number of years and a childrens committee as well and dealt with people who came from mental hospitals i would assure my noble friend lord selkirk that in no circumstances would anyone be appointed to that job who was not a trained social worker with very often training in dealing with mental patients <e> <s> at no point was any amateur or anyone who could just be described as good with people appointed to a post of that kind <e> <s> it was extremely carefully advertised people were interviewed and the whole thing was done in the most professional way possible <e> <s> certainly in the area where i operated we would never have appointed anybody who was not absolutely first-class at this difficult job <e> <s> i hope very much that that standard which i am bound to say applied up to the year is continuing <e> <s> it is certainly so in the area where i lived and where the social work department was responsible for these things <e> <s> they are all trained people with great experience <e> <s> far from the word competence or whatever it is that people are putting forward i would use the word trained <e> <s> what is needed is social work training and it certainly takes three or four years before anybody should be allowed to undertake a job as important as this <e>", "<cs> everywhere <e>", "<cs> yes it is a university course <e> <s> they give a degree <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> are there further plans for selling land which belongs to the forestry commission but which is not yet planted at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i also strongly support the amendment <e> <s> in the country districts it is sometimes difficult to find housing accommodation for the children who are described in the amendment <e> <s> on the other hand speaking from experience i had considerable success in getting people with a cottage perhaps a husband and wife living in a rural area who had some training and knew how to do it to look after these children in small groups <e> <s> it is not necessary for children to go into a big home or indeed even into a hospital if one can make a local arrangement whereby there is a smaller house or cottage in which to put say half a dozen children with two people who are either husband and wife or two social workers to look after them <e> <s> i believe that it is perfectly possible to bring that about <e> <s> i hope the minister will accept the amendment because it is very important and will be most useful in all conditions <e>", "<cs> my lords i strongly support everything my noble friend lady faithfull said <e> <s> oddly enough i have had a long association with the training of social workers <e> <s> indeed it was in when dame eileen younger as she became and i started to get training for social workers <e> <s> that was originally in connection with youth leaders but it went on to involve the training of all the other types as described by lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to all these speeches with enormous interest <e> <s> i should like to pay my tribute to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and to the noble lord lord john-mackie <e> <s> i think that it was the noble lord lord woolley who mentioned the early days of farming <e> <s> i vividly remember when my husband was minister in being taken to see the two mackies father mr mackie <e> <s> the reason was that he was so much ahead and doing such a marvellous job in aberdeenshire that the minister of agriculture who was also a personal friend was taken there in order to see what was going on <e> <s> i can say with my knowledge of the mackie brothers that they have carried on in this marvellous way and are two of the best farmers we have in scotland <e> <s> therefore it is splendid that the noble lord should have inaugurated this debate and given everybody a chance to take part <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord i will say that i have already done so <e> <s> i have spoken to the conservative party about this and have said how much i disagreed when they cut down the milk-in-schools scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords from this side of the house i should like to support this proposal <e> <s> i think that it would be wise to accept it <e> <s> normally in local government or in any form of government as chairman of a committee you try to publish an annual report <e> <s> a report is something that interests everybody <e> <s> this particular subject of mental health is one which interests people tremendously <e> <s> there are some very good proposals in this new bill and i think it would be to the great advantage of the government if they were simply to say that an annual report will be published as it is on almost any other subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say i am a little surprised that the noble lord lord ross of marnock does not realise that the training of social workers is a matter common to all the universities <e> <s> the curriculum is the same <e> <s> it has been worked out with enormous care by the universities of edinburgh glasgow aberdeen and dundee <e> <s> the training of social workers has been developing now for a great number of years as i said earlier when commenting on something that was said by the noble earl lord selkirk <e> <s> if you take a degree in social work you can do so in any university which gives degrees in social work <e> <s> fundamentally as with all degrees whether a history or a classical degree for example the same body of experience is needed in order to pass the exam <e> <s> at the same time those who take exams for social work can specialise in various aspects such as mental health after-care in connection with hospitals and in a variety of other ways <e> <s> but fundamentally they all get at a university a degree which counts like any other ordinary university degree a ba a bsc or whatever it may be <e> <s> that is vitally important <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very interesting debate and i promise your lordships that i shall be short and i hope to the point <e> <s> i do not often speak on bills which have absolutely nothing to do with scotland and this bill has absolutely nothing to do with scotland <e> <s> but the reason i should like to speak is because i have been a ratepayer in london for years in the same house <e> <s> there are not many people who can say that and if i were to tell the noble lord lord mishcon the difference between the rates i paid in as compared with the rates i pay now i do not think he would believe me <e> <s> but i dare say that in years one must not make comparisons since the world is now quite different <e> <s> on the other hand i have been and am still a strong supporter of london and of all that happens in london though i have not actually been on the london county council <e>", "<cs> i support this amendment <e> <s> i put my name down in support of it from these benches for a particular reason <e> <s> it was in may that the right honourable member for finchley now our remarkable prime minister began her political life in the house of commons <e> <s> she balloted and had time for a private members bill called the public bodies admission to meetings bill <e> <s> it went through the house of commons with the support of all parties even people as different as mr fenner brockway and mrs castle supported the bill <e> <s> the member for finchley invited me who in had just become a member of your lordships house to pilot the bill through this house as a private members bill <e> <s> with some trepidation i did so and i had the support in may of the labour party whose spokesman in those days was lord morrison of lambeth and of course the support of the conservatives and the liberals <e>", "<cs> that is allowed for in the bill as drafted <e> <s> if something of that kind is about to be discussed one simply asks whether the whole meeting agrees that it should be discussed with the press not present <e> <s> if all say yes the press are then not present <e> <s> but they are present unless such a resolution is passed <e>", "<cs> i should like to add a few words because i spent about years visiting prisons on behalf of the home office when i was a member of the advisory council on the treatment of offenders <e> <s> i do not want to stress this too strongly because it was a long time ago and things have changed tremendously <e> <s> but i remember that on occasions and they were very rare when one visited a prison when a marriage was about to take place or had just taken place it had the most extraordinary effect on people <e> <s> they were all interested <e> <s> i did not find any of the officers in any way hostile to the job which they had to do which was to be present when the marriage took place <e> <s> it had a very friendly effect <e> <s> it was the kind of effect that made you think that they really wanted to get better to help and to leave behind their criminal background <e> <s> this may have been my imagination but it was the prevailing atmosphere <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment i have had a lot to do with the schizophrenic society <e> <s> i have also unfortunately in the the course of life had quite a lot to do with people suffering from this mental disability <e> <s> it is such a strange illness because so often people can go on for days and weeks without any seeming disadvantages and then suddenly they change into something quite different <e> <s> it generally makes any decision they take under those conditions unwise <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a very great honour and pleasure to follow the noble lord lord prys-davies who has just made his maiden speech <e> <s> i think that everybody who heard him must have been deeply impressed by the calm accurate and interesting manner in which he presented the point of view of someone living in wales and in different parts of wales <e> <s> he described the rural area so very graphically <e> <s> as i live in a rural area in scotland i can endorse every word that he said about the vital importance of recognising that the railways must meet the needs of rural as well as urban communities <e> <s> i hope very much that we shall hear many more speeches from the noble lord on different subjects <e> <s> i am sure that we shall all listen with very great interest indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with tremendous interest to the speech of the noble lord lord kearton <e> <s> in this debate he is the first member of your lordships house who has spoken as a non-member of sub-committee d i am a member of that sub-committee and have been ever since it started <e> <s> it is very encouraging to hear lord kearton say that he supports the common agricultural policy with not unnaturally some reservations which indeed we all have and that as an industrialist he is prepared to say that agriculture is an industry which should be and has been supported by the government <e> <s> it is true to say that we get tremendous support from the government and that also as a nation and individually we get a tremendous amount of help from the eec <e> <s> those people who run down the cap and the eec often do not realise how much help we get from the eec not only for agriculture but for developments in rural areas and in less favoured areas and for the social policy and other developments which we hope for and are prepared to carry through <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say just a few words on this matter and to add my congratulations to those extended to the boundary corn mission on the way in which it has dealt with this extremely complicated subject <e> <s> i think that this is the third reorganisation of constituencies that i have known in scotland during the many years in which i have been engaged in politics there <e> <s> in glasgow there were originally constituencies there are now to be <e> <s> the one that i knew best kelvingrove no longer exists at any rate not in name though of course it exists in fact because it is still there <e> <s> but it is not listed as a constituency <e> <s> a reduction to constituencies from is quite a big change <e> <s> of course the population has gone down enormously and i am quite sure that the change is right <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for that reply <e> <s> i know how very difficult it is to reduce the staff in many local authorities but i would congratulate him on the fact that this trend anyway is going in the right direction and possibly will go further as time goes on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his answer <e> <s> i hope this trend will continue that the new policy food from britain which is based on exports will be successful and that the government will back it as much as they possibly can <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> is the united nations refugee organisation playing an active part in this tragic scene <e> <s> is there any hope that more refugees will be able to be not repatriated but taken into other countries <e>", "<cs> i must apologise to your lordships for not being in my place at the beginning of this debate <e> <s> it came on much earlier than i had expected and as i had another engagement to fulfil i am afraid i did not hear the beginning of the debate <e> <s> i agree completely with what the noble baroness lady birk said <e> <s> i am sure that i should also have agreed with every word that the noble lord lord ardwick said <e> <s> i have a great deal of experience of these matters <e> <s> the reason we fought hard for the access to meetings bill which related to committees run by authorities particularly those which have a great deal of influence and which are very important for the ratepayers and voters in any given area was because we wanted them to know what was happening <e> <s> they could not participate because they were not members of county councils <e> <s> but those who are interested can go to meetings listen and express their views outside if they want to do so <e> <s> it is all done in public for the reason that it is the public who are interested <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no doubt at all that this bill is a very important one and i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord trefgarne on the way he introduced very simply very clearly and very straightforwardly what is a long and complicated bill <e>", "<cs> i wish briefly to support the amendment moved by the noble lord lord strathcona and mount royal <e> <s> i do not know what is going to happen to the bill but the amendment at least meets some of the points that have been put to me and to many other people <e> <s> since for many years i was chairman of a housing committee and was connected with both charitable housing and local authority housing i would say that it is most important that in a housing community there should be not only those people for whom special housing is provided such as the elderly and the crippled but also ordinary people too <e> <s> we do not want a community that is divided <e> <s> after all we live in a world in which there are people who are well as well as others who are ill or disabled <e> <s> we do not segregate them we try to bring them into the community so that as much as possible of their lives can be led in normal conditions <e>", "<cs> i too support the amendment <e> <s> as chairman of a housing committee i have had a certain amount of experience of this type of accommodation <e> <s> i used to insist that in small groups of houses one house was built which could be used by somebody who was in a wheelchair or had some kind of disability <e> <s> it always worked very well <e> <s> the expensive way is to build houses without making any provision for someone who is disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the noble earl lord mansfield and the government on bringing this bill forward <e> <s> admittedly it is limited but it deals with a subject that is highly controversial or has been in the past <e> <s> the result of the bill will be to take much of the controversy out of the subject <e> <s> i congratulate the noble minister on the way in which he introduced the bill and on the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name of the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank my noble friend for that extremely satisfactory answer <e> <s> i hope very much that this will be well appreciated when it comes to the general election because certainly one of the best things that have happened is the policy of the urban development grant <e> <s> i thank my noble friend very much for this information <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware of the volume of correspondence that i have received from consumer associations asking the very same question as that put by the noble baroness lady burton who is the leader on all these issues and whom i strongly support <e> <s> is it not possible at the beginning of a session when life is not quite so hectic for the government to arrange a debate as soon as possible on a matter that concerns many people and organisations an issue in which i believe the government should take a keen interest <e>", "<cs> my lords this house is well know for treating many subjects not from any party political point of view but because we all feel very keenly about certain aspects of our national life which transcend party politics <e> <s> today i am speaking in support of what the noble lord lord strabolgi has said with real feeling and real enthusiasm for this proposition <e> <s> when we had the original debate on this subject and persuaded the minister to ignore the proposals which were made by sir derek rayner now the noble lord lord rayner we did i thought an excellent job <e> <s> i hope very much that my noble friend lord gowrie who i admire enormously and who has great courage and above all great interest in the arts will show himself to be an independent mind on this matter and will be able to persuade his colleagues that this is an investment a valuable investment and that the returns on the money that is to be spent and as the noble lord lord strabolgi has just said it is a very small amount will benefit everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that there is great urgency about this matter <e> <s> unfortunately one of the things that result from the present recession is the fact that many companies go out of business suddenly without warning and people who are dealing with them suddenly find that the companies have heavy debts which they are unable to pay <e> <s> it is a tremendously urgent matter and unfortunately is one of the consequences of the present recession <e> <s> i hope that the government realise that this is something that could be dealt with more swiftly and better because the problem is getting worse <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great pleasure that i take part in this debate being one of the members of sub-committee d who visited northern ireland last week <e> <s> one of the responsibilities which that committee has taken and i think others have too is to visit the areas where we want to find out more about how things are going and also to discuss with the people on the spot how the work of the eec grants and eec activities affect the area in which they are living and working <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord realise that this question began way back about or years ago when i was chairman of the first consumer council and that it has been kept on the order paper for a very long time notably by the noble baroness <e> <s> it would be a great advantage both to industry and to the public if this matter were dealt with far more swiftly <e> <s> there is no suggestion that it is easy to do but it can be done and on the whole i think that the government are in favour of it <e> <s> can the noble lord speed this thing up <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for his reply <e> <s> and i am glad to hear that the schemes are going so well <e> <s> i hope they will be pressed on with particularly those in regard to the technical training of young people <e> <s> i also hope very much that the government will pursue these with vigour <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord shackleton pointed out the year that the noble lord lord shackleton and i became life peers <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that there are an enormous number of people who are deeply concerned about this question of the consumer councils more particularly because we want to get as many sales as we possibly can for everybody who is producing goods <e> <s> consumers are therefore vital <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will do his best as quickly as possible so that there is further development and discussion on this vital matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for that very satisfactory answer <e> <s> i am glad that the houses are being taken up <e> <s> it means that hopefully more will be built as a result <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how glad i am to hear the government statement along these lines because waste of land in this connection would be a pity <e> <s> may i ask whether anything is being done in scotland in this particular regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to every speech that has been made this evening and i have agreed with every one <e> <s> i agree exactly with what the noble lord lord graham of edmonton said and i agree with all that has been said by everybody else who has spoken <e> <s> that means to say that i shall speak only very shortly because i was going to say a lot of things that have been said by others <e> <s> in saying that i support them i hope that the house will realise that i feel tremendously strongly <e> <s> one thing that i mind very much is that these five orders have been brought out on the th anniversary of the start of the milk marketing board <e> <s> the start of the milk marketing board in was the work of my husband who was the minister of agriculture of the day and who had a tremendously hard task in getting the dairy industry to co-operate in getting the farmers to come together and in co-ordinating the different farming methods that were used in those days <e> <s> it took a long time but it has been successful <e> <s> it has been far more successful than ever we dreamt it would be in <e> <s> it has been one of the great successful agricultural efforts which this country has made and i think it is nothing short of tragic that suggestions of this kind should come out now when in fact the board is very powerful and very important and all the other dairy industries that have been mentioned by the noble lord lord graham are co-operating <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble earl very much for his most interesting answer <e> <s> it comes as news to quite a number of people <e> <s> too few <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise from these benches having for a great many years been a keen supporter of the consumer council and consumer policy generally <e> <s> we could not have heard a better or more complete analysis of the situation in regard to the gas industry than we have heard from the noble baroness lady burton of coventry <e> <s> in my opinion she is one of the greatest exponents of the feelings and views of consumers in any house of <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister mentioned the fact that in this country we all honour free trade in europe <e> <s> but quite often the french at certain times of the year mostly in the autumn close down the import of lamb <e> <s> i know this because it happened to me <e> <s> when that happens it is very frustrating <e> <s> this has happened several times and i wonder whether this also will be discussed because it is in fact quite wrong <e> <s> how they get away with it i really do not understand but they do <e> <s> i think that this new proposal of limiting the ports where lamb can be imported might have something to do with their trying to cut down the amount of imports because fewer ports might enable them to import less <e> <s> i wonder whether the minister realises that these things happen although strictly speaking they are not supposed to <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while i am delighted to hear that answer can my noble friend say how much young people are taking this up and making a possible career for themselves <e> <s> one is so often told that one cannot get young people trained on lines which would be useful to them in their future careers <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly indeed <e> <s> i agree with everything that has been said by the noble lord lord howard and by the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> i have had the same kind of experience as my noble friend lord home only on a much smaller scale <e> <s> i have lived in an area which is very large and wild and in which from time to time electricity drainage and other services have been proposed <e> <s> unless one has had the opportunity of giving advice let alone anything else as to the best way in which to do something it will all have been done extremely badly <e>", "<cs> i should like a very short word <e> <s> i agree with what the noble viscount lord ingleby and the noble lord lord molson have said <e> <s> my experience comes from being responsible for starting a home for the disabled not for permanent stay but to enable them to improve their capacity to <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment as well <e> <s> this is as i think the noble baroness said an all-party amendment <e> <s> i am speaking now as someone who has spent years on a county council as chairman of the housing committee for quite a while and chairman of the social welfare committee for i do not know how many years and i know how difficult it can be to get the kind of accommodation that you want for old people <e> <s> far too often they have to go into community homes or old peoples homes long before they need to do so for the simple reason that there is nowhere else for them to go <e> <s> i fought all the time i was on the county council for accommodation for old people where they could live on their own and in a community as the noble lord lord evans said <e> <s> we do not want them isolated <e> <s> if they are in a rural area then we want them in the villages if they are in towns we want them to be part of the community and not isolated and pointed out as being in an area for old people <e> <s> they are part of the community and we have to keep them as part of the community <e> <s> it is very difficult to do so when there is a rising number of old people and a lower number of houses being built <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend very much for the answer to my question <e> <s> it is encouraging that the extremely difficult problems of fishing have now reached the point at which they are being tackled very satisfactorily <e>

the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that very satisfactory answer and ask him whether he will be able to continue this encouraging improvement as this is very important indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to congratulate the noble earl lord dundee on his maiden speech <e> <s> i feel particularly delighted because his father was under-secretary of state in the scottish office when my husband was secretary of state in and and i knew him very well <e> <s> i am sure that he would have been enormously proud of the speech that his son has delivered with such enthusiasm and such care <e> <s> i hope that we shall hear the noble earl often and that he will play an active part in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may add a few words because i feel strongly on this issue and i did not have the opportunity to speak in the last debate <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that the contribution which the voluntary organisations make to local authority work cannot be overestimated <e> <s> i spent years of my life in local government and i know how much help one receives from voluntary organisations <e>

everything using paid officials <e> <s> i am not suggesting that there should not be paid officials but obviously one can have tremendous assistance from voluntary organisations in all the areas which my noble friend lady faithfull has outlined <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask why there is this extraordinary delay <e> <s> i had something to do with consumers councils some years ago and one was able to push the thing on quite hard <e> <s> the department responded and on the whole it worked very well <e> <s> it seems now that the delays go on and on <e> <s> surely it is possible to make the thing

strongly <e> <s> the amount of money saved by ratepayers through the work done by voluntary organisations must run into millions of pounds <e> <s> it would be crazy for anyone to think that economies can be made by cutting down on the grants made to voluntary organisations because the local authorities would then have to provide goodness knows how many more services to make up for the loss of

lady cox and i should like to support her in every way <e>", "<cs> my lords i am concerned about the areas where there are unfenced roads <e> <s> in the borders for example there are a great many

scotland bill is a good title <e> <s> i think that it can include everything that the noble lord lord grimond talked about and with which in many respects i agree <e> <s> therefore i approve of the title <e> <s> equally i think that the board of trustees combining the royal scottish museum and the national museum of antiquities is a good idea <e> <s> one will get important people who are extremely keen and interested to be on that board and i think that it ought to be and will probably be a very good combination which will bring people together to work together and to promote more

amendment <e> <s> it would seem strange in a scottish bill that you should have to put in these words but the point of the whole thing is that we want to have as much as possible of our scottish

this country connected with consumer affairs and that this is one of the difficulties which i know the ec has <e> <s> can the minister press it further so that we really can get some replies which would encourage our own people as well as everybody else <e>", "<cs> i regret that i was not here for the second reading of this bill because i should have liked to speak on it <e> <s> i spoke on the bill put forward by the noble baroness lady wootton because i have always been and always will be passionately opposed to corporal punishment and to the death penalty <e> <s> i have always opposed corporal punishment and no government will ever persuade me that it should be a part of our education system <e> <s> corporal punishment is degrading to the child and to the man who administers it <e>

except buses and therefore the bus services are absolutely vital <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great interest that these matters arouse in thousands of consumers and in view of the fact that my noble friend has said that three of the consumer councils have more or less agreed their guidelines would it not be a good idea for us to have a debate here so that the public would realise what has been happening <e> <s> there are many people who really have no idea of what is going to happen when for instance the privatisation of gas takes place <e> <s> i would ask my noble friend whether a

words in support of the amendment <e> <s> with one or two other noble lords i have been in close touch with the all-party committee on disablement <e> <s> this is one of the subjects that we discussed

had a group whose job it was to see that all these matters were reported and acted upon in this country it would be a great advantage to this bill and a great advantage to those people who use public transport and whom we have been discussing at such length <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> it is important <e> <s> what the noble baroness has said about the numbers of people who could claim this is remarkable <e> <s> i have a note here which says that per cent <e> <s> of the population are of an age to qualify for concessionary fare schemes but according to the

the opportunity of talking to a number of people mostly in scotland and in the rural areas about the bill <e> <s> i want to say at once to the noble lord lord peyton that i am anxious that this bill should succeed <e> <s> i am not against the bill <e> <s> i think that it is a good bill and i think most people do <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment which arose out of a discussion that we had in scotland with this independent section of bus operators who are not at all against the bill <e> <s> they are quite prepared to operate it but they think that certain items in it will be very detrimental to small bus operators and above all to those in rural areas and i think that they are right <e> <s> we all know that bus operations in towns or covering large districts

delay things otherwise there will be no fairness because competition will have taken place long before the office of fair trading has given an answer <e> <s> i do not know whether the minister is aware that this is a fact <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord what relationship there then is between the department of trade and industry and the consumer councils that are part of their subsidiary organisations <e> <s> is it a fact that the department of trade and industry does not pay any attention to what the consumer councils ask or say <e>", "<cs> my lords may i also add one word in support because i have had a great deal to do with handicapped people in the last five or six years <e> <s> i know that it would make a tremendous difference if a clause like this went into the bill and if the bus organisations realised that with very little trouble they could do something which would make an enormous difference to a great many people who otherwise would not be able to get about <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this proposal and that we shall really do something in this bill for the handicapped <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add my thanks to the noble lord lord plowden for the admirable way in which he conducted this report and this committee <e> <s> it was fascinating to listen to and fascinating to read afterwards when it was printed <e> <s> i

think of <e> <s> the over-production from which the agricultural industry is suffering can only be dealt with by finding more consumers and more markets <e> <s> therefore i hope that the government will continue to encourage every kind of selling operation which would help the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to support the noble earl lord malmsbury and also the noble baroness lady nicol <e>

everyone who has described the new forest as one of the greatest examples of our national heritage one that we must all preserve and which we must all support <e> <s> at no point would i disagree with

expensive and which are resold and if they are not safe they could be very dangerous indeed and do a great deal of harm <e> <s> i think the minister should consider this urgently as it is a matter with which he ought to be able to deal <e> <s> it has been on the ground so to speak for a long time <e> <s> i hope very much that the minister will accept these amendments and if not tonight he will see that they are incorporated in any future amendments to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to all the speeches in this extremely interesting debate and i appreciate what a lot of experts on scottish local government we have in this house <e> <s> first of all i should like to congratulate the minister on his simple and succinct presentation of the bill which i rise to support <e>", "<cs> i should like to support what has been said by the noble baroness lady carnegy <e> <s> i too was present at the meeting that we had with the scottish ratepayers <e> <s> everything that the noble baroness said is exactly what they said <e> <s> i have had any number of letters from people begging me to say that the unfairness which the present domestic rates produce in scotland should stop <e> <s> it is not going to stop if you are going to let it go on for another three or four years <e> <s> the idea that if you wait things are going to get better is wrong they are going to get worse <e>", "<cs> i too have had correspondence with the scottish national trust of which i have been a member for a great many years <e> <s> there is a real difficulty here <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor quoted from correspondence which i have also received <e> <s> i believe that the government should consider whether or not it is possible to make some arrangement whereby houses which belong to the national trust and which are registered to the national trust but which sometimes are occupied by owners should be treated as a different category <e> <s> i do not know exactly how it can be done but i certainly think it is a situation where if we do not do something it will be very detrimental to the national trust <e> <s> that would be a great pity <e> <s> i very much hope that the noble lord might be able to take back this matter and look at it again <e> <s> it is something which would be of great value to the people of scotland since the national trust properties are some of the best and most important places that people visit <e>", "<cs> my lords i live on a farm in another less favoured area although crofting is not the kind of farming there <e> <s> i agree with everything that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie said <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my congratulations to the noble lord lord carter on his maiden speech <e> <s> it is a great pleasure to welcome to this house someone who is going to be an agricultural spokesman <e> <s> it does not often happen <e> <s> peers have many interests but agriculture is an interest which not many peers have and i

difficult these matters are to alter <e> <s> the minister has led a real revolution in local government on the abolition of rates <e> <s> it is the governments policy but it is very difficult <e> <s> i consider that he has put forward a wonderful case and has been extremely patient <e>", "<cs> my lords as we know there is a shortage of sheltered housing and therefore many old people have to live in ordinary homes <e> <s> do not the government think it would be wise to save money and to help those people who live on their own by letting them have emergency alarm systems in ordinary houses as well as in sheltered homes <e>", "<cs> my lords it may seem strange to your lordships that i have risen to speak about lyndhurst in the new forest when i normally speak about scotland <e> <s> however my interest in the subject goes back to immediately after the last war when the father of the present noble lord lord manners gave to me as chairman of the national association of youth clubs one of the most beautiful houses in the new forest namely avon tyrrell <e> <s> it was to be used by young people for holidays conferences and so on <e> <s> it has been an outstanding success and has made an enormous difference to hundreds of thousands of young people <e> <s> although i am now too old to go there for such <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sorry if i have made a mistake but it seems to me from reading the report that the verderers were overruled <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that perhaps answers the noble lord <e> <s> in any case i was only reacting to what i had read in the report

interested in the third theme discussed on page of the report concerning the relationship between agriculture and the environment <e> <s> i speak tonight as a farmer <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for that excellent reply <e> <s> i have been requested to ask whether the changes in gas prices could possibly be altered more consistently as they change too often and it is difficult for horticulturists <e> <s> is that possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that satisfactory reply <e> <s> can he give further details of what has been achieved first by the bill and secondly by the agricultural training bill which was passed at the end of the last parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to congratulate the noble lord lord blyth on a very interesting and entertaining speech <e> <s> i hope that we shall have the opportunity of listening to him many times <e> <s> i am sure that his contributions will be greatly appreciated <e> <s> i congratulate him very much <e>", "<cs> i rise to support my noble friend <e> <s> i speak as someone who has been involved with the system in scotland which she has so admirably described <e> <s> let us face the fact at once that the arrangement in scotland is a great success <e> <s> if we want a success story we must get the people who are organising that system and running it in scotland to tell us about it <e>

him on the success of this scheme <e> <s> can he say whether the response has been what was hoped for and are the government satisfied about the number of women who obtain employment after taking this training <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the fact that my name does not appear on the list of speakers <e> <s> i notified the noble lord that i wished to make a short speech <e> <s> i apologise to the noble lord lord stallard but i shall be no more than a few minutes <e>", "<cs> my lords if british rail wants to continue to make the railways pay it should give attention to those of us who use british rail every single week <e> <s> otherwise people will turn to the airlines which in my opinion will become more crowded and less satisfactory <e> <s> i hope that the government will press british rail to continue these services because they are vital to a great many people <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third occasion on which we have brought forward such an amendment for your lordships consideration <e> <s> i have studied the two earlier debates with much interest <e> <s> i cannot add much to the case made by my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment of the noble earl lord radnor <e> <s> as the committee know i live in the middle of the biggest forest area in scotland <e> <s> the change in prices and costs during the years in which i have been there is simply colossal <e> <s> if you are going to say that the grants that have been given are limited to what in any given moment is allowed it does not bear any relation to what

we should remain a united kingdom <e> <s> i am sure we must adhere to that principle <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for that admirable reply but i should like to ask one supplementary question <e> <s> as one who was instrumental in starting social work training in the s perhaps i may draw the attention of my noble friend to the report by mr blom-cooper on the death of the small girl kimberley carlile in which it was stated that most of the social workers in that case were trained <e> <s> is he satisfied that today social work training is adequate to deal with these very serious child abuse cases <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my thanks to the noble earl for inaugurating this debate today <e> <s> i agree with him that from time to time it would be an excellent idea if we could have debates on the development of scotland not so much because it is scotland alone but because scotland plays a very important part in the united kingdom and in the european world <e> <s> i think it is most important that we should be able to discuss a variety of matters because we still have a tremendous influence outside the bounds of our own country <e> <s> that is still of very great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister realise that the westminster city council voters of whom i am one having owned property in that area for more than years have never been consulted about this matter <e> <s> we have never been asked whether we approved of it <e>

a long speech but i want to ask a question <e> <s> i am not in any way opposed to the principles of the bill and the clause <e> <s> however i was visited this morning by the general secretary of the national association of youth clubs the biggest of the youth organisations in this country <e> <s> it is supported so she tells me by many other voluntary organisations <e> <s> their query is this <e>

two cases and so has the noble baroness lady lane-fox <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his admirable reply <e> <s> however i should like to ask one further question <e> <s> can the noble lord confirm that the money is directed towards those parts of the country most in need of it <e>",

whether i would put my name to this amendment <e> <s> i feel very strongly indeed about this matter but to exactly the opposite effect from the noble lord lord aldington <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may say a few words because as members of the committee know i spent the past two months in the care of the national health service <e> <s> i thought i would never experience that in the course of my life <e>

which are doing a very good job <e> <s> that area provides accommodation for people leaving hospital while other areas do not do anything <e> <s> some of the new techniques are extremely valuable <e> <s> will the minister make inquiries about the areas where this is not being done <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply and i also congratulate the government on their admirable policy for dealing with the effects of the devastating storm <e> <s> is the minister certain that all the people who were affected by that disaster are aware of the help they can receive in dealing with repairs <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl very much for that excellent answer <e> <s> will he confirm that he is getting the response that he hoped to receive in order to spread this scheme right throughout the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment moved by the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> it would mean that the authority which we wish the secretary of state for scotland to have would be mentioned on the face of the bill <e> <s> if that were not the case the company might by subjected to the kind of takeovers which go on all the time these days which i find difficult to follow and often disagreeable <e> <s> the amendment simply states that the secretary of state shall have the final word in such matters <e> <s> the amendment should be supported wholeheartedly <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the minister on that answer and on the success of the scheme <e> <s> the first priority for agricultural land must surely be its use for farming <e>

amendments <e> <s> my experience is not as great as that of noble lords who have already spoken <e> <s> however i have had the experience of starting a day centre for the disabled in my home town and

most keen about that where houses are let to disabled people the matter should be properly dealt with so that they can live like ordinary human beings perfectly happily <e> <s> it can be done and indeed it was done <e> <s> however it was a new idea for many people and i am talking about a long time ago <e> <s> but now i think it is done rather hurriedly <e> <s> it is most important that this provision should be part of any housing bill especially a new one <e>", "<cs> i should like to express my support for the amendment because i have had some experience of local authorities building and adapting houses for disabled people <e> <s> so far as i know it does not interfere with the building of houses for ordinary people <e> <s> i think it is most important <e> <s> people on county council committees and so on do not realise that we can do something about the problem <e> <s> it is not an enormous problem it is something which can be divided up into all the areas and dealt with <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support the proposal for school boards <e> <s> i was chairman of an education committee for something like eight or years <e> <s> i remember that the difficulty was always getting parents interested in how the children were progressing how they enjoyed school life and what they were interested in <e> <s> i think it is an excellent suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords i

i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him on the way in which this scheme has grown <e> <s> i hope we shall continue to produce as much propaganda for it as possible so that we have more and more of these schemes and more and more attempts to prevent the horrible crimes which we presently have in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to echo the congratulations of the two previous speakers on the way in which the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor introduced the bill <e> <s> it was done in a splendid way and was easy to understand <e> <s> i speak in this debate simply because i have had long experience of social work myself <e> <s> i was chairman of the childrens committee in roxburghshire for some years and chairman of the advisory council on child care for scotland for another five or six years <e> <s> i can speak with some authority on the subject before us today <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment <e> <s> one of the best things that has happened in the last year or two is the fact that disabled or handicapped people have been absorbed into the community very successfully in conditions which people sometimes may have thought could not work <e> <s> but they have worked and it is extraordinary how many disabled people can now live in the community like anyone else and carry on their lives like other people <e> <s> i think this amendment put forward by the noble baroness lady masham is simply in line with what is already happening all the time <e> <s> i hope very much that the government will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> i rise to support this amendment and to endorse all that has been said by the noble lord and the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> children in care are the responsibility of the authority and sometimes of one of the great voluntary organisations in particular the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children <e> <s> in many cases they are in care because they have been abused by their parents or their guardians and are already frightened and probably very difficult to manage <e> <s> but to inflict more violence will make everything worse <e> <s> when they are in the care of the public authority it should not mean more punishment of that kind <e> <s> understanding persuasion and consultation can nearly always prevent the child from becoming more difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i am the last speaker in this long list and i shall be very short <e> <s> i should like to say one or two words from my long experience of working and living in scotland <e> <s> first perhaps i may congratulate the noble viscount lord dunrossil on his excellent speech <e> <s> it was delightful to hear him <e> <s> i knew his father very well <e> <s> i am delighted that he is here and i hope that he will join us on many occasions <e> <s> the speeches of the noble baroness lady carnegy and the noble lord lord elliott of morpeth were both excellent and i agree with every word they said <e>", "<cs> i should very much like to support the amendment <e> <s> i have had great experience concerning difficulties with families and over and over again it is granny or grandpapa who saves the situation and very often looks after the children or a child as the case may be <e> <s> it is most important that they should be mentioned in the bill <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord quoted from paragraph to schedule which provides for his parents <e> <s> it is often the parents who are at fault so one wishes to have other people involved <e> <s> the paragraph then provides for <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to join in the debate because i feel very strongly about the subject <e> <s> i agree entirely with every word that has been said on both sides of the committee <e> <s> i have had long experience of the problem going back to the days when i was at the london school of economics in the s <e> <s> we have been fighting for years and years for proper training for social workers <e> <s> i cannot think why the general opinion of so many of our governors and local authorities is that social workers do not play an important part <e> <s> they play a vital part <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble and learned lord very much for his reply <e> <s> my advice came from the childrens legal centre where they have a number of lawyers but lawyers do not always agree with each other as we know <e>", "<cs> my lords i also wish to support the amendments <e> <s> in my experience much can be avoided if only the facts are found out before the trouble begins before the assaults or the sexual attacks are made <e> <s> that often does not happen and we only know after the worst has occurred <e> <s> if we could organise local authority care and support for the children and families in that way we would save tremendous problems and trouble and be very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor for his reply and to thank those who have spoken in this debate <e> <s> i still feel that these are anomalies that require thought <e> <s> the noble baroness lady faithfull pointed out that in schools and in community centres which are managed by local authorities one cannot beat a child <e> <s> why should a local authority which chooses to put a child in a foster home allow that child to be beaten <e> <s> if it puts him in the community centre he will not be beaten <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said that he will reconsider the matter <e> <s> there are many anomalies <e> <s> the situation is not clear <e> <s> i shall not press the amendment to a division though i should have liked to do so <e>", "<cs> i shall not do so because the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor has said that he will think about it again <e> <s> however i do not think that it is known how many anomalies there are <e> <s> do noble lords want to divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> this is the third time that i have tried to make provision for not allowing punishment through local authorities schools and so on in this bill <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor is not prepared to accept the amendment perhaps we should divide <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord for that <e> <s> i feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> i do not know who is advising these people but it is facts that one wants to consider <e> <s> facts condemn this completely <e> <s> i hope that if the noble and learned lord reconsiders the matter he will ensure that it is put on the table <e> <s> i shall not put the amendment to a vote now <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate my noble friend on that admirable account of what is happening <e> <s> will he give us some idea of how those figures compare with those of other industrialised countries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i congratulate the government on this very successful policy <e> <s> will the policy continue and are there sufficient houses to meet the demand which might arise <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say a few words with regard to scotland and regulation to which the noble earl referred <e> <s> the principle about which we wish to be sure is first and foremost the welfare of the child <e> <s> the situation in england is rather different from that in scotland <e> <s> scotland has the panel system <e> <s> the reporter has information from all sources including the child <e> <s> if he considers it unwise to report what the child has said he can keep this private <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may support this amendment <e> <s> for something like years or more i was responsible for a childrens home <e> <s> in no circumstances could the atmoshpere have been better as regards home family and so on it was wonderful <e> <s> if one suddenly puts into a home a child who is to be locked up then that sort of atmosphere will be absolutely impossible <e> <s> i believe that it would be madness to allow such a thing to happen in a home as described in the bill <e> <s> i hope very much that the noble and learned lord will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the third time that i have spoken on this subject <e> <s> i shall not delay your lordships for long because you must be rather bored by the sound of my voice <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the proposals contained in the amendment tabled by the noble lord lord henderson and the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> as the noble lord said the amendment does not trespass on parents common law rights but would i hope discourage them from inflicting moderate corporal punishment <e> <s> a simple slap would not be prevented <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> can he make any comparison with the employment of women in other ec countries <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble viscount for that answer and i welcome the fact that the percentage is rising <e> <s> in view of the enormous demand for skilled people and the fact that according to what one reads in the newspapers young people are required in all industries can the government encourage still more young people both boys and girls to stay on both at school and in technical colleges <e> <s> that would cost money but does the minister agree that that would be an investment in view of the enormous demand for skilled staff in industry today <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> for many years the question of training of social workers has come up at different times in this house and we have never really tackled it in the way i hoped we would <e> <s> it is vitally important <e> <s> social workers are an essential part of everything we have been speaking about and they have never had support for training in the way that doctors nurses or other professions have <e> <s> i support strongly what my noble friend lady faithfull has said on amendment no <e> <s> and what she repeated on behalf of the noble lord lord seebohm on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment and have done so during the passage of the bill <e> <s> i hope that the noble and learned lord with whose wisdom and views i agree will interest himself in the subject and see what influence he can bring to bear <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords answer is not exactly what i had hoped for <e> <s> will not the closure of the station and any others <e>", "<cs> my lords i like all other speakers wish to congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on putting forward this admirable bill <e> <s> it is a private members bill it is very difficult to get time in your lordships house to bring forward such a bill <e> <s> yet the noble lord has succeeded <e> <s> i am sure we shall all support the measure it concerns a vital subject <e>", "<cs> i should like to make one or two brief comments <e> <s> first i am delighted to hear that the noble lord lord ennals does not intend to push this matter to a division because i believe that would be great mistake <e> <s> this is a pioneering bill <e> <s> it is a bill that is badly needed not only for schizophrenics but for other kinds of mental illness where after-care is vital <e> <s> we all know that that is so <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i live in a very isolated agricultural area <e> <s> electricity makes all the difference in terms of farming equipment and the quality of life of people in remote cottages <e> <s> the words including rural areas would cover areas concerned with agriculture and possibly others as well <e> <s> this is terribly important <e> <s> when i first went to live in the <e>", "<cs> i strongly support the amendment <e> <s> i live in the border area where we <e>", "<cs> my lords i find the ministers reply most unsatisfactory <e> <s> who appointed the members of the national health service policy board without including the chief nursing officer when nursing is the most important or possibly the second most important aspect in the national health service <e> <s> it seems absolutely crazy <e>", "<cs> i wish to speak very briefly since i originally supported the first bill when it came through parliament <e> <s> as the noble lord said it was supported by the conservative party that there should be this child benefit scheme <e> <s> i agree with every word which my noble friend lady faithfull said on the subject <e> <s> she knows an enormous amount about it <e> <s> i spent a great deal of my life as chairman of a childrens committee dealing with these matters and i am certain that this is one of the very best allowances we have ever put into legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendments of my noble friend lord stanley of alderley <e> <s> we discussed this matter at an earlier stage and the minister said that he would reconsider the position <e> <s> i believe that the proposals that have been put forward today are very much in tune with what he would like and i very much hope that he will accept them <e>", "<cs> i wish to support the amendment because i am sure that it provides one of the ways in which money can be saved <e> <s> if handicapped people try to live in houses where equipment is not available for them they invariably end up in a hostel or home where it is much more expensive to cater for them <e> <s> the idea in the amendment is simply to draw attention to the fact that if we can make it possible for the dwelling to be provided so that people who are handicapped can live in it we shall enable them to lead an independent life <e> <s> also it will not be nearly as expensive because they will live on their own or with their families in a house equipped for them <e> <s> i very much hope that the government will appreciate this and give grants for the building of such houses and the installation of such equipment <e>", "<cs> i support very strongly the amendment moved by my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i am a perfectly ordinary citizen and have lived in london for a great part of my life and i had no idea that there was no organisation which could deal with the disasters which arise all too often and which occurred very recently in london and the metropolitan area and at lockerbie <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have of course had this debate before <e> <s> i supported the proposal when it was first put forward <e> <s> i have had a good deal of experience of housing conditions for handicapped people which i gained while i was chairman of the housing committee of roxburgh county council <e> <s> i am also concerned at present with a college for the handicapped in birmingham which is doing a wonderful job <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support the amendment very strongly <e> <s> it is vital <e> <s> it affects rural areas disabled people and any area where it is difficult to obtain houses and people want to live <e> <s> the government have an opportunity to include the amendment in the bill so that it is possible for disabled people and others to buy their own houses <e> <s> i do not understand why they cannot be allowed to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord layton for his maiden speech <e> <s> i had the privilege to know his very distinguished father and i am delighted that he is with us now <e> <s> i hope that he takes the opportunity to address us on many occasions <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with great interest to the whole debate <e> <s> it has been quite fascinating <e> <s> it also demonstrates the fact that we are all present in the house tonight enjoying the debate without being divided by any political division whatever <e> <s> i think that we have all been engaged in charitable work and we have all had experience of charitable organisations <e> <s> indeed we all speak with authority based upon our own experiences <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a very interesting debate <e> <s> i believe that i have listened to every speech <e> <s> i shall be brief because so much has been said and i am not a lawyer and cannot compete with the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce whose speech i found absolutely fascinating <e> <s> i learnt an enormous amount from it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i made that mistake <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak with some difficulty on this subject because i am not at all an expert in legal affairs <e> <s> i shall speak very shortly and not detain the house for any length of time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend the minister for that admirable reply <e> <s> however can he indicate by how much expenditure on social security benefit is estimated to rise over the next three years <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support the amendment <e> <s> i live in the middle of an important agricultural area where there is a tremendous number of cattle and sheep <e> <s> if no one can appeal against a proposal and there is nothing in the bill which would allow it to be questioned that would be most unfair <e> <s> the bill is designed to protect the consumer and also i presume the producer <e> <s> it would be unfair if the producer were criticised or made to pay if the decision were incorrect <e> <s> i think this amendment would help in that respect and it would be fair to the farmer as well as to the consumer <e>", "<cs> my lords i support what the noble lord lord grimond said <e> <s> on returning to the house this morning i found a very moving letter from the president of the students union at glasgow university <e> <s> that laid out very clearly what this bill will mean to them since so many glasgow students study for four years and if they are on a professional course for example a medical course they may stay on for five or six years <e> <s> it will make an enormous difference to them if they can have some relief for at least one year whether it is the first or fourth year so that they do not have to pay so much <e> <s> that it is extremely important <e> <s> i hope that the government because they do consider scotland on these occasions will think again and make some gesture towards the scottish students <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord stanley for introducing the debate <e> <s> i make only a very short intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with some diffidence that i take part in the debate as i have had some experience of working with the arts and the arts council but nothing compared with that of the noble lords lord rees-mogg or lord goodman <e>", "<cs> many times in the past four or five years resolutions and amendments to bills have been passed to make it clear that we do not wish to make any distinction between those who are handicapped and those who are not provided that they can meet the demands of their situation <e> <s> listening to the noble baroness lady darcy we clearly have another opportunity of doing something which will keep together the non-handicapped and the handicapped it will enable the handicapped to continue to do as much work and obtain as much help as they could if they were non-handicapped <e> <s> that is something which has been very satisfactory over a number of years <e> <s> here is an opportunity to do something which will enter into the same spirit <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to this debate with enormous interest and i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name down to speak in this debate but i shall be brief <e> <s> i wish to support wholeheartedly the bill introduced by my noble friend lady carnegy <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to support the amendment most strongly <e> <s> since its formation i have had a close association with a psychiatric association <e> <s> for many years i was chairman of a local health authority <e> <s> i assure the minister and the government that the amendment provides a way of saving money it is an investment <e> <s> if when patients are discharged into the community there are enough people to help understand and care for them they will be saved from returning to hospitals mental institutions and so forth <e> <s> we know it is one of the tragedies of life that once somebody is very ill or has a mental condition of some kind it is very difficult to help them except over a long period and if they are to be out of the hospital and out of care they will simply go back into a hospital again <e> <s> it is vital that they should be cared for by the community <e> <s> that can only be done if there is the closest association between the health authority the community councils and local government <e> <s> i hope that the government will accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i congratulate the government on that very satisfactory answer <e> <s> can my noble friend inform the house of the initiative that the government have taken towards these young offenders thereby reducing the number of those taken into custody <e>", "<cs> my lords in thanking the noble lord very much for that answer may i congratulate him on the fact that as a minister he has been able to help in these matters and has been so successful <e> <s> thank you <e>", "<cs> my lords i speak as a member of the select committee <e> <s> the noble duke the duke of somerset was also a member <e> <s> i wish to thank the noble lord lord middleton for the splendid way in which he chaired the committee <e> <s> the committees affairs aroused enormous interest <e> <s> we met a large number of people and many people expressed their views <e> <s> those views are all recorded in the report <e> <s> that is vitally important <e> <s> we are very much indebted to the noble lord lord middleton for the way he handled the report <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to the government on bringing forward this bill <e> <s> in particular i congratulate the noble lord lord strathclyde on his admirable presentation <e> <s> i understand how important and useful the measure will be <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael brought out some very good points and the noble lord lord grimond went in for a great deal of detail <e> <s> i shall not go into any detail at all today because i hope to do so at committee stage <e> <s> the bill is very important <e> <s> it is a very good moment to bring it forward and i hope that it will receive great support <e>"]
