["<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister very much for his answer <e> <s> have these recommendations which arc now coming from the department been discussed with for example the national farmers union or any of the agricultural organisations particularly of course the marketing boards because i have not as yet seen any published proposals from the five advisers <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are not going to discuss the matter with let us say the milk marketing board or any of the other marketing boards shall we in this house or in the other place be able to discuss the reports and the proposals before they are put into effect <e> <s> last thursday we had one recommendation which was put through which had not been discussed by anybody so far as i can see and it is something which has caused a certain amount of anxiety among agricultural people <e> <s> i am anxious that the agricultural community should co-operate with the government but i think that there should be opportunities for discussion and the reasons for the government taking certain action on the recommendations of these people should be made clear to us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord speaks i wonder whether i may say a word because i feel very strongly about this matter <e> <s> the marketing boards started and organised by the conservative party and supported by all the other parties are working extremely well <e> <s> they are subject to all the safeguards which noble lords want in connection with the agricultural marketing act <e> <s> suddenly therefore to include these boards in <e>", "<cs> my lords this report is excellent <e> <s> the noble lord lord sandford chaired the committee and although i may have one or two slight criticisms to make on the whole i agree with every word that has been said by those who have spoken on the report <e> <s> it is timely since those of us who live in a rural area know how every day there are temptations for people to leave the rural areas and go into the towns although at the moment possibly not quite so much because of a certain amount of unemployment <e> <s> but in my area there is not much unemployment <e> <s> it is something one continually has to look out for and hopes to be able to prevent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with that too <e>"]
