reflect on some of its underlying themes the unity of our nation the resurgence of national pride in the welfare state and an encouragement of the motives of social responsibility <e> <s> in that case

discussion than hasty <e>", "<cs> when the noble and learned lord lord simon spoke earlier on another amendment he was kind enough to quote something that i said at second reading that here is an evident case which we on this bench recognise for the reform of the act <e> <s> i hope that with amendments this bill will meet this need <e> <s> i hope that your lordships house may think that this amendment is one way of meeting this need <e> <s> the noble lord lord graham asked whether this is the right way of defining small shops <e> <s> at any rate it is a fairly easily verifiable way <e>",

shops which sell souvenirs very few of them have more than five full-time or part-time employees <e> <s> under the amendment introduced by the right reverend prelate the bishop of london those souvenir shops could be open for the whole of sunday <e> <s> most of such shops are small shops <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister says that tobacco or liquor could not be sold <e> <s> was he

have much sympathy with what the noble lord lord beaumont has said but i thought that one of the principles of the guidelines was that the severity of the pain would be matched by the importance of the project which seemed to me to be a very important aspect of the bill <e> <s> i think that many people would agree that there are situations in which it is appropriate to inflict pain on animals if

point <e> <s> i understood the minister to say at second reading that the bill must be understood in connection with the guidelines that will become codes of practice <e> <s> it will be difficult for

not really see the point that the minister makes <e> <s> if they will be available presumably they will be issued <e> <s> why can we not say therefore that they shall be issued as the noble lord lord beaumont wants in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i should be happier if the noble lord the minister could tell me why the secretary of state should retain his discretion not to publish codes of practice <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord lord adrian can reassure me about one point <e> <s> as his amendment now stands it seems to me possible that an animal might be kept under general anaesthesia for some time for a further project and i believe that this would be repugnant to many of our ethical senses <e> <s> i believe that an animal should be treated with respect and not be kept under general anaesthesia in that situation for a long time <e> <s> i should like some reassurance as to what is intended by this addition to the bill <e>", "<cs> may i explain to the committee what i had in mind <e> <s> i thought it might be possible that an animal was kept under anaesthesia for a week or so during a terminal experiment <e> <s> when the noble lord says a longish time i wonder whether he can be more explicit <e>", "<cs> i have reservations about this amendment because we have been insisting throughout on the discretion of the home secretary <e> <s> the noble lord the minister has not agreed to amendments which alter may to shall because he has again and again reiterated the need for the discretion of the secretary of state <e> <s> it seems to me that this committee is being appointed by the secretary of state and that his discretion should be unfettered in this respect if his discretion is unfettered in the other respects which we have considered and

code of practice <e> <s> a project licence shall not be issued unelss there can be satisfaction that it cannot be done by any other means <e> <s> so the principle is actually implicit in the code of

code of practice will not the noble lord the minister give consideration to the possibility of including it in the bill <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord the minister will take this suggestion very

<e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy on this occasion to find myself in full agreement with the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i should like to add one point to what the noble lord lord houghton said <e>

matter concerned with the dignity of animals <e> <s> it is derogatory to their dignity to keep them in a kind of suspended animation before further procedures are carried out <e> <s> there is an ethical point here not just an irrational point and i hope that the noble lord the minister will bear that in mind in responding <e>", "<cs> my lords i find myself in a difficult position in speaking to something that will be withdrawn <e> <s> i appreciate that the wording may not be correct <e> <s> it is however desirable that there should be freedom of information and that the codes that are used should be published not least because there is some around concerning the bill <e> <s> unless the facts are known things are made very difficult <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house <e> <s> i am greatly helped by the noble lord lord melchett <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise to the house for having spoken about this matter under the wrong amendment but i hope that i shall be allowed to take up a little of your lordships time to make two points <e> <s> first under subsection it seems to me essential in a bill which is really dependent upon codes of procedure and without which the bill makes no sense at all that justice not only should be done but should be seen to be done <e> <s> i cannot see and i hope that the noble lord the minister will tell us what objection there can possibly be <e> <s> it does not as i was beginning to say earlier impinge on the discretion of the secretary of state at all it is merely a question of publishing what is the case <e> <s> i should have thought that that would help people to have confidence in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord the minister said on report that codes of practice might be relevant for an offence under the protection of animals act <e> <s> they might be relevant but after studying the words of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway during the debate on codes of practice one wonders whether they have any legal relevance <e> <s> he expressly said that a type of code under clause of this bill is without legal significance <e> <s> the noble lord the minister seemed to think that it would be sufficient punishment in such a case to revoke a licence or certificate but one could think of situations where that is not sufficient <e> <s> therefore i hope that the minister will accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> in speaking to amendment no <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord meston for introducing this bill <e> <s> i should also like to thank the noble baroness lady seear
