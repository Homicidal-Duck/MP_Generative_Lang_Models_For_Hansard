flow under the bridges before the next budget <e> <s> many u-turns may be accomplished <e> <s> there are a number of factors of which noble lords opposite and their right honourable friends in another place may have to take some account not excluding the balance of trade at that time to which i shall refer later <e> <s> if i may i shall return to my main theme which is the principal tax changes <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble earl who could not have been listening to me <e> <s> i said points <e> <s> i did not say er

majestys government ministers at that particular time not of course excluding their advisers <e> <s> so where is the certainty that this money will find its way into productive investment <e> <s> the answer is that the government do not expect it to anyway and it is so incorporated in their own forecast <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls will forgive me if i do not pursue the matters that he has laid before your lordships in connection with the remarks of my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton relating to political funds <e> <s> this seems to me to be a matter which we should be capable of arguing more extensively in committee <e> <s> the house will be indebted to the noble viscount lord trenchard for the account that he has given both of the bill itself and of the reasons for its introduction in its truncated form <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble viscount <e>", "<cs> my lords in connection with the reply the noble lord has just given to his noble friend is he aware that the result of mr walkers abandonment of his previous stance of no increase in price in respect of items in structural surplus will be when the co-responsibility levy is taken into account in fact to increase the total community budget by some million out of which the united kingdom share will be something like million after taking into account the butter subsidy to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> is he further aware that the whole question of the study of the nature of individual contributions by member-states to the community budget has already been the subject of a study by the commission for the year <e> <s> is he also aware that if he got on the telephone now to mr christopher tugendhat he would be able to give him the approximate figures for and

me to elaborate on what i have already said on these two matters <e> <s> it is quite simple <e> <s> it is merely a question of what judgment one sees fit to exercise in the matter <e> <s> so it would

amendments <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> in view of the assurances given by the noble lord and without prejudice to our scrutiny of the amendment when it is brought forward by the government i beg leave to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> it would seem clear that the noble lord lord monson has not really read the terms of the amendment at all because all the amendment requires is that the directors of a company shall in addition to the duties they owe to the company owe a duty to the employees of the company to have regard in the performance of their functions to the interests of these employees in general <e> <s> it seems to me that <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> it is not needed <e>", "<cs> my lords the house would wish to thank the noble lord

principal offenders in this regard and of the flags under which they sail <e> <s> will the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house wish to thank the noble earl for having repeated this statement <e> <s> however i am bound to say that what connection the statement has with the government white paper itself to which it is

itself <e> <s> it is possible on only a cursory reading of it to get some idea of the plan that the government have in mind <e> <s> in view of the importance of the plan itself as outlined in the white paper we on this side will of course request that the house has an opportunity for a full dress debate in government time in order to discuss this most important document <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the reproof of the noble lord and i will be as brief as i possibly can in my remarks although i am hound to say that the very structure of the statement invites a certain amount of comment <e>

increase in rates of about per cent <e> <s> it is also clear that the statement anticipates cuts <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl indicate whether that is so <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a thoroughly unsatisfactory statement <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house and i am sure all noble lords wish to congratulate the noble lord lord greenwood of rossendale and his committee on the production of yet another excellent report <e> <s> despite its slimness this report is encyclopaedic when one considers the extent of the information that it contains <e> <s> after reading through it one is bound <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord inform the house as to whether the views of the board of inland revenue were sought prior to the governments total abolition of exchange control <e> <s> if their advice was sought what was the advice <e> <s> if their advice was not sought why not <e>", "<cs> my lords it may be for the convenience of the house if i respond somewhat briefly to the introduction of the bill by the noble viscount lord trenchard <e> <s> it is much easier for me to be short because so very many valuable contributions to the debate have been made by the noble viscount lord simon the noble lord lord campbell of croy my noble friend lord shinwell and the noble viscount lord rochdale and it would be presumptuous <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to reiterate the thanks which have been voiced this evening by so many speakers to the noble lord lord sainsbury for having so adequately dealt with the report of the select committee <e> <s> the select committee on the european communities invariably examines with very considerable thoroughness those regulations or proposed regulations or directives which come before it <e> <s> as i have said on many occasions in this house the select committee reports from this house as a consequence are held in very high esteem in europe itself and of course in the european parliament <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for having made a statement at such length <e> <s> we on this side of the house must express our appreciation that uniquely on this occasion the minister has not quoted precisely from that section of the conservative party election manifesto which foreshadowed increases of the magnitude that have been postulated <e> <s> we are indeed grateful for that small mercy <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl inform the house of the number of tonnes of sugar that are held in intervention at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i did not say and <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to echo the sentiments that have been expressed in the house to my noble friend lord kaldor for having initiated the debate in

not mentioned <e> <s> i must therefore with the permission of the house remind your lordships that one of the biggest problems in the whole of british industry over the past quarter of a century has been the chronic lack of investment in manufacturing industries in the united kingdom <e> <s> in the years up to we were investing as a proportion of the gross domestic product per cent <e> <s> less than france and per cent <e> <s> less than germany and of course as one would expect this attracted some attention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i cannot accept the noble lords well-known contention concerning the validity or otherwise of bretton woods and the gold standard <e> <s> i would be grateful if he would allow me to pursue my argument in my own way <e> <s> the astronomic rates of interest that are now already in force in this country have attracted considerable deposits from all over the world <e> <s> they have attracted hundreds of millions of pounds from all over the world into the country and these form the deposit base on which the banks advance money <e> <s> the noble lord opposite does not propose to nationalise the joint stock banks that would be heresy <e>

this side of the house must express our immediate dismay at the result of what must have been protracted negotiations with the european commission <e> <s> i say protracted negotiations because the statement mentions the term urgency <e> <s> dealing first of all with the tufted carpet quotas on which the government have not succeeded in obtaining any concession from the commission other than a promise of vigilance whatever that may mean in eec circles at the present time one might ask the government just how they view the commissions definition of serious injury <e> <s> the government are themselves satisfied that the existing arrangements will do damage <e> <s> what is the difference in their mind between damage and the commissions concept of serious injury <e> <s> we take the view that her majestys government would not have made application at all on the tufted carpet side unless they themselves had been convinced that there was the prospect of serious injury and damage to this particular section of the industry <e> <s> i ask the noble viscount to particularise a little further as to his ministrys discussions with the eec commission in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount will recall that at the conclusion of my remarks i asked him whether he would make some statement as to the attitude of our other eec partners on this whole question <e>", "<cs> my lords in the course of his reply the noble lord referred to the overriding necessity for reducing public expenditure <e> <s> he will doubtless be aware that in some areas particularly in regard to defence there <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the disposal costs for the purposes of the community budget are included in the storage costs under title no <e> <s> and that for the year the total storage costs including costs of disposal of surplus food products are million of which on the noble earls calculation the united kingdom is due to bear some million <e> <s> in view of the observations that have been made from time to time on the necessity to reduce public expenditure will her majestys government take the most energetic steps to see that the united kingdom is rid of this waste of money <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl for having explained so clearly the purport of the two statutory instruments to which he has referred <e> <s> in introducing the scheme he said that a total of rates would go up would go down and some rates would remain unchanged <e> <s> it was only at a later stage that we knew the total financial impact which he put at a saving of million in rising to million in <e>", "<cs> my lords are we to infer from the noble viscounts reply that the government will be extremely vocal at the next annual general meeting of british leyland <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lord noticed the reports that have appeared in <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for detaining the house on this particular point and also for a slight inaudibility which i think for me the house will agree is not quite customary <e> <s> i am still a little mystified by the situation with regard to this amendment that has been revealed by the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> let us take a circumstance where a director whose terms of contract or whose contract of service does not explicitly state that his work lies mainly overseas <e> <s> let us say that he is in the position of an executive director a sales director or a managing director and be goes abroad to negotiate a very large deal <e> <s> let us say that he takes with him a director who because his duties are explicitly within his agreement is required to perform his duties wholly or mainly overseas <e> <s> here we are then with a circumstance where two directors are involved in negotiations presumably with an important foreign customer <e> <s> the agents of the company concerned can go hack to london and if they happen to know a shareholder they can of course get full particulars of the managing directors contract including the salary the duration and everything else but in respect of the other director accompanying him they simply cannot get that information <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move as an amendment to the commons amendment amendment no <e> <s> d <e> <s> this amendment arises within the context of the governments expressed intentions to introduce at some future time a further companies bill dealing with the eec fourth directive which implies that the next bill will deal largely with accounting matters with the standardisation of a form of accounts and so on <e> <s> it also takes place at a time when the country in so far as it has been informed has had an opportunity of considering the implications of the dowgate report a report which your lordships will recall was made by mr joseph jackson qc and mr young a chartered accountant appointed by the board of trade under section b to investigate the affairs of a group of companies which for the moment we shall call the dowgate group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> what he has said reinforces my view that it ought to be incorporated in the bill <e> <s> if it is so unexceptional that it commends itself to the stock exchange in terms of their voluntary approval then there does not seem to be any reason why it should not be incorporated in the bill itself <e> <s> i do not think that the provisions of section of the old act at all cover the situation which is described here otherwise there can be no doubt that the inspectors would have referred specifically to that fact <e> <s> it is precisely because the inspectors appointed by the noble lords department thought that extra action was necessary over and above that which was incorporated in the existing legislation that they made the recommendations they did <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are most grateful to the noble lord lord byers for introducing the debate and we are more especially grateful to the noble lord lord banks who has voiced i believe a number of the sentiments that are shared not only by my own party but also by that section of the conservative party which is called the wet section <e> <s> it is amazing what varying <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that although heathrow may have a bad reputation for this in some quarters there are many other airports in the world that have a far worse reputation than heathrow <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord inform the house whether the reports in both <e>", "<cs> i should like to reinforce some of the arguments which have been put forward by my noble friend lord lee of newton in regard to the amendment which we are moving <e> <s> one of the functions of your lordships house many noble lords may perhaps think that it is the most important function when considering legislation that comes to it from another place is to give the government of the day an opportunity to reflect upon what has previously been done <e>", "<cs> i promise not to interrupt the noble viscount again but if what he said be the case then what is the reason for removing the words reorganisation of from section <e>", "<cs> i rise briefly to say that so far as i can see the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord rochester does not carry any reference either to trade unions or to co-partnership <e> <s> i prefer to think that the amendment means what it says <e> <s> i think there can be no doubt that we can all have own own views as to what industrial democracy may or may not be but there can be no doubt that over wide sections of industry in some of which i have myself had a managerial responsibility one of the problems leading to industrial unrest is the undoubted feeling by some workers particularly those in large industrial undertakings that they are alienated from the whole ethos of the firm in which they operate <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that anything which encourages a company or a works to operate more as a social organism for that is what in fact it is is something that ought to be encouraged <e>", "<cs> i rise to address your lordships on the <e>", "<cs> to deal with the technical point with which the noble lord dealt in regard to section of the companies act it should be noted that that section says <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble viscount on one further question <e> <s> i am sure that he would not wish to mislead the committee but he tended to indicate that the amendments put down by my noble friends and myself were technical amendments and that we were concerned with the question of nominees <e> <s> if the noble viscount looks at the second <e>", "<cs> i beg to move the amendments <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has himself said that in his view clause essentially follows clause <e> <s> this is a remarkable situation because here we have a situation where in clause he takes powers to direct the terms and everything else of transferring assets to himself and/or to his nominees presumably with the aim of disposal because that is the avowed policy of his party <e> <s> now we come to a situation where according to the note explaining the clause it <e>", "<cs> if the noble viscount will excuse me for a moment i am reading directly from the explanatory note to the bill <e>", "<cs> i can answer the noble viscount very quickly <e> <s> he should not exercise the powers under clause <e> <s> this is the very simple answer <e> <s> the noble viscount admits that the government are proceeding with such indecent haste for purely dogmatic and doctrinaire reasons to dispose of assets which are in either the ownership or the partial ownership of the neb and he wants to exercise clause with such haste that he thinks i need not bother about taking it over now because if i need finance to hold it over for a bit longer i can get it under clause <e> <s> i should have thought that that was a very unsound way of doing it <e> <s> the correct thing of course is that if clause <e>", "<cs> clause provides for the making of payments by the neb and agencies in reduction of their public dividend capital <e> <s> the neb and the agencies are empowered to make such payments with the agreement of the secretary of state and must do so if required by him <e> <s> i think it is remarkable that the secretary of state should seek powers of compulsion for an enterprise to reduce its capital and to pay over the funds doubtless for the pleasure of the noble lord lord cockfield for application to the consolidated fund or something like that when in the view of the company itself or the neb it is on purely commercial grounds not desirable that the capital of the company should be reduced <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount has made the point once again that this is a purely technical matter and largely a question of the presentation of accounts in their form <e> <s> may i draw the noble viscounts attention to the wording of the clause as it now stands <e>", "<cs> in addressing myself to clause i wish simply to deal with the aspect that reduces the limits of finance available to the two agencies as distinct from the national enterprise board <e> <s> i do not wish to discuss the board but wish rather to discuss the reductions that have taken place in regard to the welsh development agency and the scottish development agency <e> <s> the committee will be aware that the existing limits for the scots and the welsh are million and million but i believe there is power by order under the act to increase them to million and million respectively <e> <s> what the present clause does is to take the national enterprise board together with the two boards it lumps the whole lot together and limits them to million <e> <s> this is i understand the position <e>", "<cs> that might well be so <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me a question and i will answer him as i understand it <e> <s> i am not aware of the particular incident to which he referred if the noble lord had given me full particulars i would have replied to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord on one aspect of the statement he has made when he said that on our budget problem there was broad agreement on the methods by which the community would both reduce our contribution and increase the benefits to us <e> <s> would it be possible for the noble lord to provide the house with some particulars of the methods which were in fact agreed <e>", "<cs> i have one technical query to ask of the noble viscount <e> <s> at the end of clause in line on page of the bill it says <e>", "<cs> in accordance with the traditions of the committee it is necessary for me to make a statement of an indirect financial interest in some of the matters that may be touched upon by clause and indeed by earlier clauses <e> <s> i shall be quite specific to the committee about this <e> <s> i am partner in a firm of chartered accountants called halpern and woolf and we are acting for a company overseas which at the moment is seeking to settle in this country <e> <s> on their behalf i am already in correspondence with the department of industry <e> <s> i express the hope that those who know my political views as often expressed in this house will consider that my observations on the bill are unlikely to be influenced by the interest i have just disclosed <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to deny the noble viscount the pleasure of recording his partys victories at the polls <e> <s> magnanimity in victory is not seldom the truest wisdom so we are told <e> <s> even in defeat we should not wish to grudge him his temporary moment of triumph <e> <s> i should however like to deal with one or two of the observations that <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the chamber are indebted to the noble viscount for the explanation he has given of amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i must admit i was a little curious when i was tracing through the effect of this amendment back to the industry act because i found that it provided that for subsection section of that act there shall be substituted and then it quotes the rest of the amendment <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to wish to intervene in any way in the argument of principle that seems to have developed between one section of the noble viscounts party and the other <e> <s> i must say that when i saw the clause i glowed with some pleasure to feel that the government were so generously disposed in spite of the financial stringency which they have imposed to give advice presumably on the basis that advice costs nothing <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to the noble lord lord foot for having introduced this motion in these terms <e> <s> i think that most of your lordships would agree with the historical setting within which he put his remarks <e> <s> the motion itself deals with among other things the question of the effectiveness of central and local government <e> <s> it is one of the three topics in the motion <e> <s> i respectfully suggest to your lordships that we are indeed concerned with the effectiveness of both arms of government but effectiveness by itself may be a slightly misleading term because of course one can have very effective government indeed backed by all the forces of the law if necessary by armed dictatorship and by secret police <e> <s> it can be very effective at any rate in the short term <e> <s> that does not necessarily imply a good government however <e> <s> i would take it that for our purposes the terms of the motion do imply good and effective government <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not discussing of course whether the other place and this house were putting through too much legislation <e> <s> i assume that the effectiveness of government could be assessed against the ability of the administration to deal with the legislation that is passed through parliament <e> <s> i was not expressing a view as to whether we legislate too much or too little <e> <s> the short answer to the noble lordss question is that i think that in some fields we legislate too much but in other fields we legislate far too little <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of this side of the house i wish to say that we are very pleased to give support to the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> i have no desire to go over the ground that was covered at the committee stage when we were dealing with an amendment substantially on these lines but it is true to say that the amendment itself if i understood the noble viscount lord trenchard aright at the committee stage more nearly meets the objections which the noble viscount might have had to a clause of this kind <e> <s> as i recall the noble viscount expressed some sympathy with the views that were then expressed by the noble lord lord robbins who himself objected to the use of the word involved <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will recall that when we were discussing this particular clause clause in committee i urged upon the government that they should not close the door on the possibility of their having to extend public ownership into certain areas of manufacturing industry <e> <s> i said that i thought it would be unwise if they were to deny themselves that power <e> <s> it will be within the recollection of the house that i urged on the noble viscount to retain the flexibility afforded them by the existing industry act of being able to give the board directions in certain specific ways if they <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg your lordships pardon <e> <s> the gentleman i referred to as being the chairman of british shipbuilders should of course be mr atkinson he accepted a reduction in salary and expressed the sentiments to which i just referred <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i entirely accept that <e> <s> i appreciate and i agree that the noble viscounts department is not well placed to pick winners that is what he said <e> <s> i entirely agree that this point is within the context of selecting individual industries <e> <s> he may not believe that the choice of an important individual of this kind is of infinitely more importance in some cases than is the selection of an industry to receive research and i do not think that they are in a position to make a choice <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble viscount will allow me to interrupt him i think he will find when he reads <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate <e> <s> at one time it seemed from the tenor of the speeches of noble lords opposite that they were blaming noble lords on this side for having appointed the gentleman in question which rather <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted to do so my lords and i sincerely hope that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that when noble lords read <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to judge that because we do not know what the terms were anyway and we do not know the parameters <e> <s> how can we judge <e> <s> the noble viscount may have his own opinion on that <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house would not seek in any way to prevent the political will of the other place being accomplished in this legislation <e> <s> we on this side of the house have sought to make as many constructive comments and amendments as we have thought fit <e> <s> i feel bound to draw the noble viscounts attention to the fact that some of the amendments that have been put forward while not in any way obstructing the main political purposes of the bill would undoubtedly have improved it <e> <s> i refer in particular to the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord rochester which sought to secure the promotion of the involvement of the workers in the particular industries involved <e> <s> that amendment could quite easily have been accepted by the government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> as i explained to the house it is quite legitimate for this house before giving a third reading to a bill to consider the developments that have in fact taken place since the report stage of the bill which were not available at the particular time and which have very strict relevance to clauses and of the bill itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the views expressed by his noble friend lord harmar-nicholls will find very wide support on this side of the house <e> <s> is he aware that over two-thirds of the cost of the common agricultural policy is in respect of the storage of these vast surpluses and in losses on their disposal <e> <s> as i believe the prime minister herself has said they represent a complete absurdity

and social committee <e> <s> will the noble viscount agree that this particular body is all too frequently ignored by the council of ministers and i am bound to add also by the commission <e> <s> this

increased productivity to be discussed within a broad general political context <e> <s> everyone agrees that it is necessary to work harder <e> <s> much emphasis is laid on the need for incentives <e>

companies and even if one made allowance for a certain degree of multinational income within them nevertheless that does nothing to detract from the fact that these are british companies and that they in fact compete successfully with our leading competitors <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will forgive me for intervening will he tell the house whether he is aware of the provisions of schedule to the finance act and whether he has taken that into account <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord cause some consideration to be given to the finance acts and the taxation statutes which

to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answer will bring little satisfaction to small businesses in the country which are

firms although they apparently cannot afford to pay their bills to small businesses nevertheless make offers for their acquisition <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the replies he has so far given in this house are thoroughly unsatisfactory and do not indicate any real interest in or desire to alleviate the plight in which small firms find themselves <e> <s> will he take note and

community <e> <s> as i understand the position following the brussels conference some million to million was to be repaid to the united kingdom via the financial mechanism under title of the commissions budget <e> <s> however the remainder of the million to million was to be subject to some specific regulations under article <e> <s> can the noble lord give any indication as to whether the regulations proposed under article were given any discussion at the venice meeting and if so with what result <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble viscount whether he will inform the house as to

a step in the direction in which we must tread over the next few years if far greater calamities are to be avoided <e> <s> but it would be churlish to deny that the second convention presents a significant step forward and we therefore support it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are most grateful to the noble lord for having explained so lucidly the order before your lordships <e> <s> it is as the noble lord indicated an order with a very limited function affecting but a small area of the insurance market <e> <s> it would seem that the insurance community generally would be glad if it were approved <e> <s> it tidies up a situation and it will facilitate transfers in accordance with article to which the noble lord referred <e> <s> it reflects part of

earl give the house some idea of the criteria which were used to determine whether this centre was or was not cost-effective <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware of the repeated utterances of

on to the order paper at all and secondly for the detailed and constructive account he gave of his activities particularly in the budget committee of the european parliament and for the account he gave of the parliament as a whole in regard to the budget <e> <s> i am one of those who most certainly welcome the noble lord lord ohagan back in this house again <e> <s> i recall that when it was

committee on statutory instruments that these particular draft instruments were considered by the joint committee as not worthy of being drawn to the attention of both houses <e> <s> it therefore

about the eurocontrol immunities and privileges amendment order <e> <s> he said that there had been a certain reorganisation of the arrangements that were originally intended for eurocontrol <e>",

insure themselves thereby admitting the feasibility of error as indeed we do in our profession <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a matter for the insurance companies <e> <s> i know of no one <e> <s>

referred to parliamentary draftsmen <e> <s> the profession of parliamentary draftsmen is one for which every member of this house must have the most profound respect <e> <s> nevertheless if the judgments of the divisional courts of the appeal courts and of the house of lords sitting judicially are to he taken into account on a whole series of matters it is quite clear that over a considerable field and in quite a significant number of important instances parliamentary counsel have not always been beyond reproach in their drafting <e> <s> i need refer the noble lord only to certain aspects of the income tax acts and the subsequent finance acts which have been commented on unfavourably from time to time particularly in regard to their draftsmanship by noble and learned

reasons i have already described <e> <s> i would thank the noble lord for his courtesy and his department for the courtesy that they have shown to representatives of the accountancy profession with

frames <e> <s> would the noble lord agree on reflection that it was possibly not a good thing in this connection to abolish the price commission <e>", "<cs> my lords in his reply the noble earl appeared to cast doubt on the figures that were produced by my noble friend lord jacques <e> <s> he referred to the evidence at his disposal <e> <s> will he therefore undertake that the evidence at his disposal documented by source will be published by him so that we may know the facts <e> <s> will he give the house a further assurance that the governments own policy of artificially fixing gas prices as distinct from determining their cost may receive some reconsideration <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount is already on record as saying that mere changes of ownership have very little economic effect will he ensure that when a statement which might conceivably provide for what he calls privatisation is made the statement will at the same time also contain particulars of the advantages that might conceivably accrue to both productivity and employment as a result of any change that might be thought necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for having repeated the statement made in another place <e> <s> i am bound to say that the speed with which this satement was made after the publication of the accounts is really hardly fair either to the members of the other place or to the members of your lordships house <e> <s> the accounts of british shipbuilders to which this statement refers became available in the printed paper office only this morning moreover we on this side of the house were unaware until well after lunch that such a statement was going to be made <e> <s> this hardly gives time to be able to study the ministers

technical <e> <s> i observe that through <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that notwithstanding the fact that this draft has still to be considered by the european parliament it has been found in practice that after emerging from that examination it very rarely differs substantially from the original draft <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house the assurance that detailed discussions will be held with all those affected in the united kingdom including not only the legal and accounting professions but industry itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the events of the last few days including the publication of the figures show clearly that her majestys government have no control over the money supply and in the words of the <e>", "<cs> my lords arising out of that reply in which the noble lord admits that the government have been labouring under some illusions for at any rate the last six months will he give an undertaking that during the very welcome recess he and his colleagues will do a bit of homework and get their figures right <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl bear in mind that there have been other occasions when very considerable errors of mathematical calculation have been made <e> <s> notably in the assessment of the public sector borrowing requirement by treasury officials which in one year was million out and in the next year million out <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is a widespread opinion in industrial and commercial circles that the competitors of british industry in eec countries have an undue advantage over them in that when the projects are first mooted they seem to get via their respective governments to their own traders and their own trade associations and that so far we in this country seem to have adopted possibly quite correctly a policy of greater rectitude whereby only when the contracts are displayed is the information given to our trade associations and industrialists here <e> <s> will he agree that we really ought to be on the same basis and that since there is not very much security inside the european commission itself it might be wise to take steps to ensure that the british firms get the same advance warnings as continental firms do <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that my original question was not limited to aid funded projects to which the noble lords reply was confined <e> <s> i was dealing with the whole question of commercial contracts in europe that are out under eec auspices and they go far beyond aided projects <e>", "<cs> there is one question i have to ask the noble lord before we part with this new clause <e> <s> subsection of this new clause empowers a minister to give directions which specify <e>", "<cs> before we part with this particular clause it would be a good thing if the minister were to explain just how these various measures under this particular part of the bill have developed since they were first considered <e> <s> as i understand it when the consultations concerning this part of the bill originally took place they were on the footing which i think was agreed by all parties that it was desirable that the particular accounting requirements for local authorities should be as comprehensive as possible should if possible again be standardised and should be aimed at providing the maximum amount of necessary information which it was thought on all sides that the public and all those others interested should actually have <e>", "<cs> i want to ask the noble lord to whom i offer the same felicitations as those which he has offered to his noble friend whether even at this stage he could not reconsider this <e> <s> we are considering it out of the context of the remainder of the bill <e> <s> if we consider this bill as a whole in order to get its total context we find that out of the total number of clauses give the minister power to make regulations in over instances <e> <s> most of them are subject to the annulment procedure <e> <s> incidentally they also give him in the case of clauses powers in instances to make direct directions without regulation <e>", "<cs> on the basis of what the noble lord has said and on the understanding that the matter will be considered by him prior to report i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the house will receive that assurance with some satisfaction <e> <s> is he also aware that it has been widely reported in the press that the french prime minister has stipulated that there must be a settlement of the forthcoming price review before france for her part can concur in the refund of the million to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house the specific assurance that the repayment to the united kingdom of million will not in any way be made conditional on our advance agreement to any increases that the french may desire in the price review that takes place some time afterwards <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask once again that we receive the assurance of the noble lord that the payment of the sums due to the united kingdom or its timing will not be conditional on any negotiations over the annual price review <e> <s> since he has seen fit to introduce the party political atmosphere into this question will the noble lord note that at a time when most of us representing the united kingdom were creating quite a row in the european parliament about this deficit to which he has referred his conservative colleagues in the european parliament in another place and here were pretending that the deficit did not exist at all <e>", "<cs> in a mood of reciprocal courtesy may i draw the noble lords attention to the rubric which is almost opposite his new amendment which is to insert the word work and point out that the rubric at present reads <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will forgive me but i did not say naked profit <e> <s> i said naked cash nexus <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having agreed to reconsider this matter <e> <s> i cannot help feeling that after mature considerations have taken place with all the interested bodies we shall be able ultimately to arrive at a framing of this part of the bill which will be reasonably satisfactory to all concerned <e> <s> having said that and on the basis of the noble lords undertaking i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> if i may interrupt the noble lord in order to correct him i did not seek to imply and i must apologise if i did that the effect of merely ascertaining these particular figures would result in an increase of per cent <e> <s> i said that the new accounting arrangements taken as a whole in other words the entire accounting requirements of this part of the bill would necessitate an increase of per cent <e> <s> in the book-keeping and accounting staff of local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed that the noble lord has not seen fit to accept this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord will be aware that it is quite impracticable to take this particular step and that it is unfair to do so <e> <s> moreover he must know that it is completely unnecessary <e> <s> the provisions that have already been passed in this bill are uncontested <e> <s> they provide that each division of work and there are four shall provide a revenue account and a statement of return <e> <s> there is no reason at all why there should be all this contortion to produce a completely artificial figure that cannot be determined precisely because the capital involved in each particular department cannot be ascertained <e> <s> if the noble lord had said that the department as a whole should adopt current cost accounting <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord the minister indicates that he is quite willing to reconsider all the matters raised in these two amendments i would venture to put one or two considerations in his mind <e> <s> the amendment that has been moved so ably by my noble friend lord sefton supported by my noble friend lady denington seeks to question the right of the secretary of state to have unfettered discretion to require the local authority to deliver a report <e> <s> if the purpose of demanding a report is merely to ground the action to which my noble friend lord mishcon referred in subsection then at least we understand where we are <e> <s> we know that this request for more information for a detailed report is not really required for the information it contains it

"<cs> but i feel that the noble lord himself will be fully sensible of the issues involved here <e> <s> it is really the issue of a specific local activity on which local councillors are fully informed on which they have been advised by district auditors <e> <s> the councillors are subject to the will of the local electorates who are fully informed on these issues and will be more informed

activity you shall <e>", "<cs> there is an amendment down in my name to leave out clause which i beg to move <e> <s> i do not know whether that is in order <e> <s> i am very sensible of the constructive attitude which has been displayed by the noble lord in dealing with the vital amendments which are incorporated or ought to have been incorporated within clause <e> <s> i accept in good faith that he intends to look at the whole thing again and also to look at the form of words in relation to the two very strategic amendments which were so ably moved by my noble friend lord sefton

from the loss of amendment no <e> <s> in which local authorities are required to report <e>", "<cs> i do not feel very strongly about it <e> <s> so far as the noble lords remarks are concerned the difference is not great but in my view it is a straw in the wind as to which way the governments mind is going <e> <s> if there remained any doubt as to the real purpose of mr michael heseltine in this matter let us take the words of his colleague mr norman fowler speaking on rd october last when he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that a portion of his reply contains a considerable degree of reassurance <e> <s> however is he also aware that one way or another this matter

noble lord and his party have been in office already exceeds million and is now running at an extra rate after taking into account benefits redundancy payments and loss of taxation of about million per annum <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the noble lords reply to that last supplementary question which i presume was in fact relevant to the question may i ask whether the noble lord is aware that the unions are following out precisely the advice which was given to them by his right honourable friend in another place on th december <e> <s> is he also aware that the nature of his replies here this afternoon give the impression that the government are perfectly willing to publish figures when it suits them but that if they are inconvenient they do not publish them <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord the minister a question <e> <s> it may be that i do not understand correctly the full purport of the clause but as i understand it it transfers to the udc certain powers

assessed the effect on various factors in the british economy of high interest rates <e> <s> the answer as i gather from him is that they have made no such assessment <e> <s> therefore may i ask the noble lord whether he is aware that the treasury model computer has facilities whereby by feeding in alternative data as to interest rates the effects on various aspects of the british economy

accurately assess the disastrous results of the governments own policy determined by the treasury ministers of maintaining interest rates at an arbitrary and high level <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in the course of his previous answer when he was dealing with what he described as the three factors making for an increase in unemployment he did not mention the high interest

the first of a series of u-turns which will progressively increase as soon as the industrial deserts which the governments policies are creating throughout the country proceed to yield their results

brief statement that he has repeated <e> <s> he will of course appreciate that the matters and indeed the principles raised by this statement are just as large as those raised by the statement that he made last week concerning the future of british leyland <e> <s> i would therefore hope that the house will be afforded an opportunity to debate this whole question in very great detail <e> <s> i had an uneasy feeling last week when i showered congratulations on the noble earl in announcing his u-turn so far as british leyland are concerned <e> <s> i was a little suspicious at the time that there might possibly be a snag in it <e> <s> indeed the snag has now emerged the other side of the coin because of course the nissan motor company the makers of datsun are apparently going to be accorded

that there are always a number of people in this country who are quite prepared to be employed at rates of pay and under conditions of work which have been gained for the class as a whole by the trade union movement without at the same time accepting part of the responsibility themselves to aid in that particular process <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that translated into purely general terms

accounting which is raised by the next amendment <e>", "<cs> yes i was about to ask the leave of the committee to withdraw it <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> could the

leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord lord lyell has just said fills me with despair <e> <s> it looks very much as though having embarked on an unprecedented scale of legislating in the accounting field it seems likely that we are now going to have a spate of regulations amending the existing provisions of the bill which are themselves quite complicated enough <e>", "<cs> we take the view that creditors are also entitled to some information information that they have hitherto been able to obtain <e> <s> creditors as well as shareholders are interested in limited liability companies and ought to be able to obtain information of this kind <e> <s> it should be freely available <e> <s> shareholders and creditors are of course also more likely to be interested in the profit that emerges before directors emoluments have in fact been charged <e> <s> there is no reason at all why this particular exemption should now be granted <e>", "<cs> i am most reluctant to impose any extra burdens on small companies even small companies as defined within this bill <e> <s> but the idea that the insertion in the accounts of the total of directors emoluments imposes enormous burdens on company secretaries staff bookkeepers and everybody else is taking things a little too far <e> <s> all that happens is that the accountants who prepare the report just specially segregate this item <e> <s> there is no inconvenience to the company whatsoever <e> <s> to say that it is an extra burden on a company is stretching imagination a little too far <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down could he refer the committee to that portion of the eec directive which i have in front of me and indeed it would assist me where these exemptions are given to medium-sized companies <e> <s> so far as i am aware i may he wrong in the eec directive there are only two kinds of company the small company and the rest <e> <s> perhaps i am wrong in this but it would certainly be to my assistance if the noble and learned lord could refer me to it <e> <s> i have article in front of me in which it is said that member states may permit companies which on their balance sheet dates do not exceed certain criteria to draw up abridged balance sheets <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having directed my attention to those parts of the directive <e> <s> in so far as our affairs in this country are concerned i am still not convinced that we should of necessity keep meticulously to those items in the directive itself <e> <s> we still have a very wide discretion in these matters and i would have thought that the more information one can get about the performance of significant sections of the economy the better <e> <s> i am talking now of the practice of the art or science of econometrics where it is desirable to obtain national statistics in regard to the performance of various industries both as regards sales and even the division of sales where this can be done without adverse effect upon the companies concerned <e> <s> i would have thought that the more we were able to measure these various factors on a macro-scale taking into account the various component factors the better it is because there is already an exemption if any harm is going to be done to the firm concerned <e>", "<cs> there is one further point in connection with clause which i should like the noble lord to consider with a view to an amendment possibly being introduced by the government at the report stage or at any rate to consideration being given to it <e> <s> at the present time when we are discussing the exemptions for individual companies the exemption in the case of small companies means that if the provisions of this bill apply they will only have to file a modified balance sheet <e> <s> that balance sheet if the format is adhered to will not have to state what profit is made in the year <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the format for any of the balance sheets he will find that all that is required to be stated on the balance sheet is the balance on the profit and loss account <e> <s> consequently a small company will not have to give any indication on its filed document as to whether during the year it made a profit or not because all that will appear on the abridged balance sheet is the one item the profit and loss account <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the noble and learned lord very carefully <e> <s> there seems to be a complete misapprehension in his mind as to what constitutes a relief to small and medium-sized businesses <e> <s> no matter what form of accounts are submitted to the registrar of companies and what accounts are filed whether they are in a full or an abridged form the fact is that having certain concessions as to filing and making public certain parts of their accounts does not mean that the company itself or its accountants will be relieved of the burden of preparing the accounts as usual <e> <s> the accounts of the company in whatever form they may be filed with the registrar have to be prepared anyway and there may be many cases in which the submission of abridged accounts in addition to those already prepared on behalf of a small company by its accountants may represent an additional cost <e> <s> it does not seem to be appreciated that these so-called reliefs are more cosmetic reliefs than actual reliefs in any cost <e> <s> the exemptions merely mean that not quite so much information is available as was formerly available to creditors <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his courtesy in giving me time to reconsider <e> <s> i should like to assure the noble lord that i too have considered the competitive factor <e> <s> i have asked myself the question in regard to competitors overseas particularly in the eec on the other side of the channel what real competitive information would be conveyed to them by for example particulars of a companys turnover and factors of that kind <e> <s> in other words what competitive edge is given to overseas competitors by the inspection of statistics relating to turnover gross profit ratio and matters of that kind <e> <s> i have come to the conclusion that the risk is a comparatively small one in fact a very small one indeed <e> <s> i can understand overseas competitors wanting to find out details of secret processes <e> <s> i can understand them wanting to find out know-how and so on <e> <s> but i do not feel that the revealing of particulars of this kind could be regarded as exposing our companies to all that overseas competition <e> <s> if that be the case then successive governments back over many years stand very considerably indicted by the amount of statistical particulars relating to companies performance that already resides on companies files and has done for the past or years <e>", "<cs> simply because normally speaking the creditor himself has a financial relationship with the company <e> <s> the creditor is not in competition with the company as such <e> <s> he is very often a supplier to the company and is not trying to beat the company at its own trade <e> <s> the relationships of creditor and company and competitor and competitor are as i think even the noble lord must admit slightly different <e>", "<cs> before parting with clause which deals with the directors report i should like to have some indication from the government as to what additional information they would propose ought properly to be disclosed to the shareholders and indeed to the public in so far as the directors report may be made public even within the restricted circulation that is implicit in the classification of the grades of companies <e> <s> i have in mind that when the future of companies reports was being discussed in under the previous administration and i have before me command it was quite clearly in mind that much more extensive particulars should be provided either by way of the directors report or by way of annexed notes and statements than appear to be envisaged in the current bill <e> <s> in saying that i take account not only of the provisions of clause of the bill but also of the provisions of part iii of schedule <e>", "<cs> may i press the noble and learned lord to go a little further <e> <s> difficulty arises in that one must relate clause to the financial year in question <e> <s> if the word the is left as it is it may relate not particularly to the financial year and i think the insertion of such would more neatly relate to the financial year in question <e>", "<cs> i am obliged <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to question the noble lord a little on this amendment <e> <s> if this amendment is carried in the form in which it is now set down and the entire line is eliminated because that is what the amendment says leave out line <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i have line on my marshalled list <e> <s> i refer to page of the second marshalled list of amendments where it says under amendment no <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord for final clarification refer to amendment no <e> <s> as it is in the second marshalled list <e> <s> he will find that there are brackets round <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lyell has been a little ungenerous to the noble lord lord monson who as i recall explained at the outset that the clause was far from finally drafted and described this as a kind of probing amendment <e> <s> i should not have expected the noble lord lord lyell to go into such full documentation concerning all the technical defects of the bill in view of the very tentative way in which the amendment was proposed <e> <s> moreover the noble lord reacted a little sharply to the suggestion of the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that company reports tended to be a little on the lush side <e> <s> his reaction that it is unwise to go into the minutiae in a clause of this kind comes a little oddly from him <e> <s> after all in part i of the bill the government went into enormous detail in actually setting out the precise form in which company accounts should in future appear <e> <s> it does not really lie in the mouth of the noble lord lord lyell to accuse the noble lord lord monson of trying to legislate in too much detail <e> <s> the government are already guilty and over-guilty on that score in their treatment of part i of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich for providing the opportunity to ventilate this most important matter <e> <s> as we expected the noble lord has given the house the benefit of his further studies into this affair that he raised in question form in your lordships house on th february as reported at column <e> <s> the burden of the argument of the noble lord lord harris of greenwich as i understood it was that he was not going to discuss the merits or demerits of the closed shop as such <e> <s> his prime point was that the actions of the sandwell metropolitan borough council were unlawful <e> <s> the noble lord made that point in the course of his supplementary questions after the reply given to him on th february by the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> indeed he purported to quote i do not use the term purported in an at all

fair view <e> <s> i think it highly dangerous and i think on reflection the noble lord will agree that to call in aid the expression true and fair view every time a matter of detail is referred to is probably not the most appropriate way of using the term true and fair view which is designed specifically to reflect the situation of the accounts as a whole so that the totality is presented as a true and fair view of the state of the companys affairs <e> <s> i do not think we ought to call in aid true and fair view every time we get into a difficulty about specific wording relating to very specific and limited circumstances <e>", "<cs> my lords i am rather mystified by the ministers reply <e> <s> am i to understand that all the principles in ssap i refer to page paragraph of the <e>",

once the eec has spoken in words that it chooses to use they become immediately and automatically binding upon her majestys government <e> <s> it would be a shame surely if we were to accept as a precedent the wording used in every regulation that is brought forward by the eec on the basis that that wording because it is in a directive is the best wording to incorporate in our own legislation <e> <s> this is carrying imitation too far <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has really now explained it <e> <s> the noble and learned lord has used the term again the treatment of this item for taxation purposes whereas what we are concerned with is the treatment adopted in the companys accounts <e> <s> we are concerned with the accounting treatment as such and indeed the noble and learned lord has himself put it forward in his own speech <e> <s> i cannot understand why he should prefer the eec directives wording in this case which goes completely against all common sense <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is an entirely sensible one and we support it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not in any way dissent from the purpose behind this amendment but i would be glad if the noble lord could clear up a point for me <e> <s> when i was reading through sub-paragraph of paragraph i chanced on sub-paragraph and i always read previous sub-paragraphs because they tend to refer back or to make provisions which can easily fog one unless one is very careful <e> <s> i see that in the first line of paragraph which is line it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i was drawn to page on the basis that <e>", "<cs> my lords we support the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> perhaps i could enlarge on it by saying that this amendment was originally moved by me at the committee stage and the government undertook to give it favourable consideration <e> <s> the fact that the ministers name appears on the amendment is a positive indication that at least on one amendment they have accepted the advice proferred from this side of the house <e> <s> we thank them nevertheless <e>", "<cs> my lords we agree the purpose and wording of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i must once again express regret that the government have not seen lit to accept this amendment <e> <s> the suggestion that the disclosure of the profit made in a year by a medium or small-sized firm would somehow expose them to the unfair and harsh rigours of competition of the eec is if i may say so with the greatest possible respect a lot of nonsense <e> <s> it is stretching to an almost ridiculous extreme the whole circumstances of competition and the expression of interests of individual firms <e> <s> no question of lack of competitiveness arises on this <e>", "<cs> my lords i immediately accept the noble lords assurance <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we support this amendment <e> <s> at the same time we should like to draw the attention of noble lords once again and this will arise on succeeding amendments to the paramount necessity for some consolidation act of the whole series of companies acts as made abundantly clear by the whole series of cross-references and contortions which one has to go into to trace all the legislation through <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a nonparty question <e> <s> i think your lordships will agree that there is no question of party politics being involved <e> <s> it is a question of plain common sense <e> <s> there have been few occasions over the past few years when there has been such unanimity among the accountancy profession the legal profession the business organisations the consumer organisations all of which have put forward views which are firmly against the abolition of the registry of business names <e> <s> in fact among organised expressions of opinion in this country i would say that at present about per cent <e> <s> or possibly even more are in favour of the retention of the registry of business names <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for his informative and detailed response which will be welcomed by those concerned <e> <s> am i to understand from him that in the event of the three bodies to which he referred coming to an agreed and reasoned conclusion while the bill is still in progress in another place he or his department will be able to have consultations with them with a view to ensuring that if their agreed solution finds favour with the minister an appropriate amendment could be made in another place so that this question may be resolved while the bill is going through its normal parliamentary process <e> <s> if the noble and learned lord would give that assurance it would undoubtedly convey a sense of urgency to the three

amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> having listened to him he is halfway towards persuading me <e> <s> i should need to call in aid the wisdom of my noble

in the first place <e> <s> in the circumstances i think it would be entirely judicious i use that word advisedly to ask for the leave of the house to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s> i should like to emphasise that the accountancy profession is never reluctant to be put into a position where it has to express a positive opinion because in expressing a positive opinion it means that it is required to make a detailed investigation of all these matters in order that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that it is normally quite easy for an employer when proposing to take on an applicant if the interview is thorough to have a fairly good idea of the persons ability <e>", "<cs> my lords the house has already expressed its appreciation of the quality of the report on regional policy that has been produced by the select committee <e> <s> i too should like to commend the noble lord lord plowden for the lucidity of his speech which in support of the report itself gave one of the best factual analyses of the working of the european regional development fund that the house has had before it for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house will do everything we can to facilitate the passage of this bill trough your lordships house subject always of course to more detailed scrutiny

of new businesses it is necessary for us to bear in mind that the terms of the motion include existing businesses <e> <s> we are concerned here today not only with new small businesses but also with existing small businesses <e> <s> of small businesses it must be said that they are vital not only from the point of view of the economy but also in terms of the larger battle faced by all peoples in

reply to the question that has been put down by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for the st of this month which is now on the order paper they will be able to enlarge upon that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join many of your lordships in congratulating the minister on the manner in which he introduced this bill <e> <s> as always he addresses the house on these occasions with an attractive benignness which always wears the air of innocence in such a way that it reminds me of the art that one learned in another place that whenever one wanted to pull a political quick one one endeavoured to disarm the opposition by making the whole affair appear so innocuous that it did not even merit much attention <e>", "<cs> i am obliged for that support my lords and that is exactly my view in the countryside where cars are put to everyday and constructive use they tend to be used more wisely <e> <s> as the noble lord points out in part they are used as a tool of the trade and in

will take into account the views which have been expressed by the noble lady lady saltoun <e> <s> many of us on this side of the house felt that she raised some points of great significance which ought to be considered by the government <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee would like to associate ourselves with the thrust of the amendments which have been proposed by my noble friend

the life offices association and the british insurance association who are more particularly concerned with the changes that are proposed by the noble lord lord banks <e> <s> they of course fully support the amendments which he has put forward <e> <s> it occurs to me that it may be possible that if those two particular associations had had the advantage which your lordships have had this afternoon of listening to the long very detailed and clear exposition that the noble lord has presented they may possibly have thought differently <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee and as the noble lord has on various occasions in committee referred to eec directive nos <e> <s> and may i ask him whether he has any further news about the progress of the second directive which went to the council in and which i understand has recently been the subject of negotiations at council of ministers level <e> <s> perhaps i may draw his attention to the fact that under article of the draft second directive a provision is made for its provisions to come into operation two years after it has been ratified <e> <s> even on the assumption that the eec directive was approved this autumn it would be a number of years before it could be enacted in this country and that would be years of filibustering within the eec <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indicated to the house that he is

the noble lord give the house an assurance that if he considers some improvements in the existing accounting arrangements he will consult with the profession before he brings those improvements into operation <e> <s> and does he not agree with the cbi and indeed other bodies that there is now an overwhelming case for the purpose of determining the public sector borrowing requirement for treating capital investment for productive purposes differently from ordinary current revenue expenditure <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little disappointed by the reply that the noble lord lord lyell has given to my remarks in the course of which i introduced this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord spoke of no need having been established <e> <s> i should have thought that the events of in which thousands of people lost considerable sums of money in fact established a need <e> <s> the noble lord spoke of the interested parties as though they consisted entirely of the insurance companies or their associations involved <e> <s> when he spoke of consultation with interested parties he was talking of the professional men involved he was talking of the companies involved <e> <s> but surely the people ultimately involved are the public at large <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side are happy to support the amendment <e> <s> perhaps we may reflect as we consider drafting amendments of this type to an act of that at that time whichever government were in office they undoubtedly received the advice from their parliamentary draftsman that the clauses had been drafted impeccably and that no

applied and make economic nonsense <e> <s> is he aware that those views are shared <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will explain in those circumstances why it was that the investment programme of the gas board was restricted so that a poll tax could be obtained from the public as a result of the increased prices that were ordered by the government in order that more money could be

discussed the economic situation in these terms <e> <s> i would have thought that it was quite legitimate for my noble friend to make the point that armaments are an ingredient in inflation <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble viscount say how long he expects the investigations to take <e> <s> will he give the house an assurance that when the investigations are complete the house will be informed of the result <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for having moved the motion standing in his name <e> <s> with the broad general content of the proposed

addressed itself to the consideration of whether or not the regulation was <e>", "<cs> my lords with your lordships leave i accept immediately what the noble lord has said and i must say he has approached the whole question with the utmost generosity of spirit which i greatly appreciate <e> <s> however he said that paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house the assurance that the limited pledges that have already been made by her majestys government or on their behalf in regard to indexation will in fact be honoured in any event <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that all the equipments are available for this service to be put into immediate operation <e> <s> the terminal equipments are available and the mobile instruments themselves are available <e> <s> only the wavelength allocation appears to be the problem <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that at the existing rate of progress it will be between four and six years before the existing waiting lists can even be significantly approached <e> <s> does he think this a really satisfactory position <e> <s> can he undertake that a further and urgent review will be given of the existing allocations with a view to ensuring that the utmost priority is given to those waveband allocations that are most urgently required by british industry and by british commerce at this time <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord at least give the house the assurance that a further immediate and urgent review will be made of the existing users to make quite sure that the priorities are correctly evaluated <e> <s> is he further aware that even though the kilohertz band is adopted by british telecom it will go nowhere near to satisfying the demand and it will not substantially reduce the delay <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount yet in a position to say what effect he thinks there will be on the scheme due to the recent very large rise in interest rates <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask one final question in clarification <e> <s> would the noble viscount confirm that these new enterprises are paying precisely the same rate of interest as any other business <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the first question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while noting that the noble lord has not replied specifically to the question on the order paper may i ask him whether in view of the fact that statements similar to that made by the chancellor of the exchequer on th july were made by mr nott on th december and by the prime minister herself on th may last we can place any greater reliance on the statement of the chancellor on the th july than was evidently placed on the earlier statements to the same effect by mr nott and by the prime minister <e> <s> in view of the fact that since th july interest rates have gone up by per

noble lord for that uninformative reply <e> <s> may i ask him whether he has in his possession whether or not he reveals it to the house is another matter the amounts which have been saved or which have been gained by the government as a result of these particular interests <e> <s> is he aware that in the absence of his estimates one guess has been a gain of some million to the exchequer as a result <e> <s> would it not be fair to the motorist or even to the consumers of energy if the government authorised some reduction in fuel prices or in energy prices rather than put the money once again into the all-absorbing public sector borrowing requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask him whether he will say why in view of the fact that since the year the ecgd has accumulated reserve funds at an average rate of about million a year apart from the year it accumulated a small loss during that year of about - million it was necessary considerably to increase a whole range of ecgd premiums during the current year to the considerable disadvantage of many exporters in the united kingdom <e> <s> will he undertake to have a review of the situation since it must surely be clear that the reserves have been established after making due accountancy provisions for claims <e> <s> on the basis of one year balancing out another would it not be far better to refrain from increasing the ecgd rates and run a little upon the reserves that have accumulated over so many years to meet such a contingency as the noble lord referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord undertake to reflect upon the last reply that he gave to my noble friend <e> <s> is he not aware that since the ecgd has been operating the first loss or depletion of the reserves took place in the year <e> <s> will he bear that very carefully in mind <e> <s> in view of the interest of the entire exporting world in this very important question will the noble lord give the house an indication as to whether he would welcome a full-scale debate on the whole operation of the ecgd at the moment when the accounts become available <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for his very constructive reply may i ask him whether her majestys government will do everything possible to expedite the procedures in this case <e> <s> there is sometimes a tendency for them to be <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are most grateful to the noble lord for agreeing to reconsider this matter when it was raised on th july <e> <s> we realise

in conversation about this particular clause during the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords while welcoming the general thrust of the entire scheme may i ask the noble lord whether the government have given <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the assumption made in this question that our exports would be subject to a unilaterally imposed common customs tariff is a very fanciful one indeed <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that any examination of the figures will show that in effect the boot is on the other leg that we take from the community over million more in manufactured goods than we export to the community and that a customs tariff against fuel supplies to the continent would be extremely unlikely <e> <s> will the noble earl please bear in mind that it would perhaps be better if these very important eec matters which involve us all and concerning which the facts are fully known were discussed in a completely dispassionate atmosphere as distinct from being on the basis of an emotional spasm <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble earls reiteration of the prophecies of unemployment with which he has been kind enough to regale us will he bear in mind that the government have no credible record in the whole business of forecasting and that it would be wise for them to be extremely cautious <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the amount involved per annum which has been a charge on public funds is a very minute fragment indeed of the vast expense that has been incurred as a result of the pursuit by the government of their monetarist policies and the creation of mass unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble earl oblige the house with the calculations which he uses in arriving at his assumptions not necessarily now but perhaps in reply to a question for written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to ask the government a question on business of which i have already given notice concerning the business on tuesday th october on which day your lordships will notice that we are due to consider the commons amendments to the companies bill <e> <s> my principal question is to ask the chief whip or the leader of the house what further facilities they propose to offer your lordships in order that these matters may be properly discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why it is that the adviser to the prime minister mr alan walters at the time of his appointment went on the record as saying that high interest rates were in fact a contribution towards inflation <e> <s> will he endeavour to see that those views are reconciled with his own on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> would he inform the house of the date of the last occasion on which the representatives of the ccab met his officers from his department <e>", "<cs> my lords for the sake of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the intervention of noble lords

diabolical <e> <s> i did not say and the record will show this that a professional body said that <e> <s> what i did say was that i had been in conversation with a member of one of the bodies to whom these matters had been referred that i had received a telephone call <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow what the noble and learned lord has said in this matter <e> <s> i have not had time to consider the implications of these amendments in detail <e> <s> on the face of it and i commit myself no further it appears that amendments nos and the associated amendments are acceptable <e> <s> owing to lack of time i am not prepared to make any further definitive observations upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords we are glad that the noble lord has cleared up this point <e> <s> he will recall that the matter was raised here during the committee stage and that some of us ventured to express some doubts as to the eternal non-fallibility of the parliamentary draftsmen saying that perhaps some further thought could be given to this matter <e> <s> we are very glad that the government have done so and entirely support the amendment and the consequential ones <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has been kind enough to refer to the assistance he has received from the consultative committee and accountancy bodies <e> <s> i should like to reiterate their general support for the proposals which he has sought to incorporate in his amendments but on their behalf i should like to reserve their position until they have had an opportunity to examine them in detail <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble and learned lord the lord advocate finishes making his points i wonder whether he will inform the house if the proposals set out in amendment no <e> <s> and also in amendment no <e> <s> to which

followed <e> <s> this is very important because i do not wish the ccab to be saddled with the complete responsibility of approving every jot and tittle incorporated in both amendments <e>", "<cs> my

signatures of authorised people such as cheques or in the case of a companys corporate action there is a resolution of its directors or of its annual general meeting <e> <s> how is anybody going to determine what a companys principal purpose was <e> <s> if for example a company at a meeting of its directors were to put into its minute book and subsequently pass a minute saying that the principal purpose of the transaction is as follows that at the moment would appear in the absence of evidence in rebuttal to be conclusive evidence of what the companys principal purpose was <e> <s> how else is a companys principal purpose going to be assessed <e> <s> except as my noble friend has already pointed out in the undoubted litigation that will arise from clauses containing ambiguities of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble and learned lord for giving way <e> <s> would he also bear in mind that section of the original act uses not only the word purpose but also or in connection with which is the very phrase that has been used by my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed in the reaction of the noble and learned lord to the amendment moved by my noble friend <e> <s> it seems to me that the insertion of almost the identical words in subsection a <e>", "<cs> my lords i have hesitated to make the point more forcefully because i should not wish

move <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble and learned lord inform us whether this applies to companies of all kinds and not merely to plcs <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a question to ask on this <e> <s> it occurs to me not as a result of any profound study but because i have to read through these things while the noble lord speaks on them <e> <s> at line of amendment no <e> <s> one sees the phrase there will be no ground <e> <s> how can anybody say that there will be no ground <e> <s> anything might happen <e> <s> a bomb might drop on them <e> <s> surely the noble lord would be advised even at

"<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> will he bear in mind that according to the answer to the question that i put to him a few weeks back there are some million by way of reserves and provisions as at st march <e> <s> that is on the basis of his own answer <e> <s> in the interests of exporters generally would it not have been far better to draw modestly upon the reserves that have accumulated over the years rather than have this very drastic increase in the rate of premiums for these particular types of policies which has made it very difficult and increasingly difficult for the exporters and for the confirming houses <e> <s> is there not some other better way of taking one year against another rather than slavishly following the somewhat ambiguous form of accounting practice that appears to have been adopted so far <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that there is a view in export circles that the degree of investigation of the credit-worthiness of overseas clients for or on behalf of the ecgd has some shortcomings <e> <s> there is a feeling that if the investigations were carried out a good deal more thoroughly country by country risk by risk the claims that were ultimately liable to be paid would probably be significantly less <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that an amount not exceeding million out of the total expenditure of the ecgd is spent on investigation which seems to be a remarkably small sum <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house found so much of what the noble baroness lady seear said to be quite agreeable that we almost forgot what she herself would call the party tit-for-tat with which she commenced her speech <e> <s> i shall indeed return to some of the things that she was kind enough to suggest to your lordships <e> <s> before doing so i should like to offer our felicitations to the noble lord

will favour the house with their attendance at frequent intervals and give us many opportunities of listening to their views <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl inform the house whether her majestys government have yet formed a conclusion as to what industries are likely to be still in existence by the time their initiatives come into effect <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that my noble friend lord molloy of ealing is just as interested in the technical aspects of the oecd report as is the noble lord and is probably more knowledgeable about them than the noble lord as he would modestly be prepared to admit <e> <s> is the noble lord further aware that despite all the verbal dexterity that he exhibits from time to time in this house the fact of the matter is that both direct and indirect taxes have risen very considerably and are in complete contradiction to the election pledges of the party opposite which proposed to reduce taxation in order to release incentives among our people <e> <s> their performance suggests <e>", "<cs> my lords their performance suggests that the people who require more incentives are the higher paid in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl put golden handshakes in the same category <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that this massive outflow of capital from the united kingdom is merely a reflection by those sending it abroad of a lack of confidence in the control stimulation or activities of the government in relation to domestic economic policy <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are pleased to welcome the terms of the statutory instrument <e> <s> when it was first drawn to my attention i immediately started on some lengthy research because the instrument was short

the matter through <e> <s> but that was before i read the thirty-second report of the joint committee on statutory instruments which was published on th october and which unhappily escaped my attention in which it says that the committee had considered this particular instrument and <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble viscount aware that there is still a substantial amount of misgiving in the country at large about the treatment of these ex-prisoners of war <e> <s> does he not think it wise in all the circumstances to open up the inquiry to a far greater degree than was possible in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house would like to express our gratitude to the noble lord lord windlesham for having raised this subject this evening <e> <s> it is one of tremendous

broadcasting system it said <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that it would be a fair summary of his replies to my noble friend baroness phillips that the government are not going to do anything about it <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for the very lengthy and comprehensive statement that he has made <e> <s> i have said lengthy but we make no complaint about that <e> <s> the steel industry in the united kingdom is one of the sinews of its productive power and we should not cavil therefore when some considerable effort is made to help it

that on that occasion i raised a protest that we had to consider clauses occupying pages <e>", "<cs> my lords have any cases been reported to the noble lord of enterprises immediately outside the enterprise zones moving into them in order to incur the smaller overheads that would be applicable there <e> <s> would not such a move from the immediate vicinity of an enterprise zone into it by firms which want to establish that position be contrary to the whole purpose of the establishment of enterprise zones which we on this side of the house of course entirely support <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord explain the extent of the extra effort that would be required <e> <s> is he aware that to obtain any representative sample on which reliance could be placed for statistical purposes would also require a certain amount of effort <e> <s> is he completely satisfied that it would not be better and in the long run prove shorter for the actual figures to he abstracted <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that evidently if my information is correct these figures are available to eurostat which reproduces quite a number of the export figures relating to this country <e> <s> will the noble lord give the matter further consideration since as his noble friend said this is of some importance to the export industries of this country <e>", "<cs> but my lords the noble lord talks of confidentiality <e> <s> will he explain how in fact any question of confidentiality arises since if the figures are produced they will be published anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble viscount

contracts were involved in this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most reluctant to interrupt the noble lord but when he spoke about investment income he mentioned million <e> <s> should this not be million

jeger <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble earl lord kimberley for having put down this question <e> <s> it raises certain very important questions of principle and we on this

tends i hope that i have the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter with me so long as it is not followed by another one to be unique <e> <s> the noble lord ought to explain why there has been a departure from the principle but this he has not done at all <e>", "<cs> i want to ask noble lords opposite whether they still seriously think that it is right in all the circumstances that an increased burden in this respect should be placed upon employees particularly in the light of the taxation implications which sometimes tend to get overlooked <e> <s> it is of course i believe generally realised that employers are entitled to deduct their proportion of the employees national insurance contribution for income tax purposes and a tax relief is therefore obtained upon it <e> <s> i do not complain of that <e> <s> however when it comes to the question of old age pensions we find that these and as from i believe april unemployment pay will be subject to taxation even though under clause of the income tax act as amended by subsequent finance acts the contribution that the employee pays is not allowed for tax purposes is not deductible for tax purposes even though ultimately as of now the retirement benefit is taxed <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord cockfield will correct me but i think that as from april the present intention is to tax unemployment benefit as well <e>", "<cs> i beg to move that clause be deleted from the bill <e> <s> we on this side of the committee made it quite clear on second reading that we objected to the percentage contributed to the fund by her majestys government being reduced from <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear from what the noble lord has said that the idea of making class i contributors pay anything towards the redundancy payments fund has been misconceived from the outset <e> <s> it should never have been done at all in the first place because of course he knows perfectly well that there are bound to be a very large number of people who are paying amounts into the redundancy fund who under no circumstances are going to be able to get them out <e> <s> there is no point in fudging the issue by saying that of course if they did not pay other people would have to pay more <e> <s> there is already facility in the employment protection consolidation act clause <e> <s> schedule to the present bill refers to additional powers to be given

anybody who wants to resist greater accountability which i am quite sure the noble lord does not wish to resist after all he is one of its leading protagonists <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness <e>",

considered or that they should be excluded from the bill <e> <s> i entirely agree that they should be in the bill <e> <s> i am not suggesting for one moment that an auditor or firm of accountants employed by a local authority should not be responsible for doing precisely the things that the noble lord has set out <e> <s> let there be no doubt about that <e> <s> my noble friend seemed to be under the illusion that i wanted the outside supervisory or auditing interest confuted merely to legality <e> <s> i accept the purposes that the noble lord has in mind <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble lord <e> <s> all i am complaining of is that this is a matter in a statute <e> <s> i know exactly what i would do as a member of a firm of auditors engaged in a matter of this kind <e>

least i hope that it has <e> <s> i just want to know and my profession will be interested in the reply <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his response <e> <s>

do here and these amendments are moved with precisely that in view <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for his response and i shall certainly take advantage of his offer to pursue the matter further and in detail because it is a subject in which my profession is interested <e> <s> my interpretation of the amendment is not that of the noble lords and i was simply seeking to ensure that the decision itself should not be the subject of audit i can see that it would be the responsibility <e>", "<cs> i am again grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> i must say i find a little odd some of the statements that have been made by some of his noble friends this evening and some of the more blood curdling remarks of my noble friend lord houghton who i note is unfortunately no longer with us which would lead one to suppose that <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am in fact an <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his right honourable and learned

my lords i should like to reinforce the point made by my noble friend lady david <e> <s> would the noble earl not agree that the words of the amendment are such that a council shall take such steps as

it not also true that a good number of the civilians to whom very just tribute has been paid had redundancy notices in their pockets at the time that their services were called upon <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount for that reply may i ask whether he will confirm that the

the debate in which i participated in may <e> <s> is he also aware that at the time that that appointment was made it was not envisaged that there would be the mass redundancies on the scale already referred to by my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> is he also aware that one of the performance statistics that will presently be revealed is that there are more redundancies yet to be expected <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he inform the house whether he has had consultations with the gaming board about this bill and whether in general they approve its contents <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble baroness aware that the figures she gave us earlier omitted to say that when her majestys government took office in may the figure year-on-year was per cent <e> <s> it is now marginally below that figure <e> <s> but will the noble baroness bear in mind that it has been achieved at enormous cost at the cost of the devastation of our industries and a massive increase in unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that she was misinformed when she told the house just now that unemployment was on a rising trend under the previous administration <e> <s> if she will look up the figures she will find that unemployment in the last part of the last governments term of office was on a firmly downward trend so much so that it even continued for the first two or three months of the present administration <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> if i may say so the noble lord seems to have a touching faith in some of the legal decisions that have been made perhaps in more recent times in so far as they affect local authorities <e> <s> that is not a view that is entirely shared in legal circles themselves nor certainly by those of us on this side of the committee and therefore it is desirable that these matters no matter how difficult they can be to formulate should be put into the statute <e>", "<cs> i believe in the disclosure being specific for the avoidance of doubt <e> <s> the purpose of this amendment is to draw attention to the considerable difference that will obtain when this bill becomes law and the position as set out in the act <e> <s> the responsibilities of auditors have been significantly enlarged from the area which was formally covered under the act of <e> <s> i have already addressed the committee on numerous aspects of the enlargement <e> <s> for that reason it would seem that a scale of fees <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the noble lords reply <e> <s> as i indicated the amendment was a probing one <e> <s> i am sorry that i had to explain it even further in order exactly to elucidate the kind of information which the noble lord has been kind enough to give <e> <s> i am grateful for his assurance that he will take a look at it without commitment of course <e> <s> i fully understand that and i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg your lordships pardon <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press the noble lord but it is being a little disingenuous to say that the position is exactly the same as before because it is not <e> <s> when the bill becomes law there will be an audit commission which will result in a completely different situation <e> <s> i would not wish to query the competence of the audit commission to make such inquiries as it sees fit <e> <s> it is going to be a public body of some consequence and after the various consultations which are going to be conducted in the course of its formation it will undoubtedly comprise a very large number of extremely responsible people who are respected in their professions or occupations whatever they may be <e>", "<cs> i am constrained by the remarks which have just fallen from the lips of the noble lord lord mottistone to reiterate my request that the noble lord takes another look at this matter <e> <s> it is quite true as the noble lord lord mottistone says that when various public bodies are set up the responsibility of the secretary of state is very often enshrined in a bill in its imperative form <e> <s> this is what happens with some public bodies <e> <s> however it is not so with the comptroller and auditor-general <e> <s> no secretary of state can tell him what to do order him about or require him to do this that and the other <e> <s> here the body is the independent audit commission <e> <s> it is a completely impartial body <e> <s> it is not a creature of the secretary of state and it is not a public body in charge of a nationalised industry or anything of that kind <e> <s> it is comparable in most respects with the comptroller and auditor-general <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am of course fully seized of the point that he has raised in connection with clause <e> <s> i inserted the consultative committee of accountancy bodies in clause because a certain amount of co-ordinated work as between the various bodies that are named in clause takes place within the consultative committee of accountancy bodies <e> <s> they produce or tend to produce a consensus of view on a whole series of matters <e> <s> therefore in clause to which the noble lord has referred i would not wish to take away his obligation to consult with individual bodies <e> <s> i seek to emphasise that for the purpose of clause which is directly related to form of accounts and matters of that kind it might be for his greater convenience to consult with a body within which there is already a consensus of view <e> <s> it might also save time <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his undertaking that he will have another think about it once again without commitment <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes if the noble lord is finished with this particular question whether clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> and is about to proceed on to the next one <e>", "<cs> the noble lord puzzled me at one point <e> <s> he said when discussing clause and i think that the <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord misunderstood me <e> <s> i was referring to a limited construction of clause <e> <s> i know that we have passed it but what the noble lord said seemed to me to conflict with what he said earlier about clause <e>", "<cs> i should not like to stand in the way of another place having a look at this provision but this bill has been drawn up in a very odd way <e> <s> here we have clause which states <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will accept the amendment <e> <s> it would enable us to co-operate and get a good deal of the remainder of the bill through quite quickly <e> <s> after the very reasonable argument which we have just heard to which i shall not add i sincerely hope that the minister will agree to the amendment <e>", "<cs> in our debates this afternoon and indeed in the preceding debates the noble lord has always appeared to be the most reasonable type of person <e> <s> he says that he is perfectly prepared to be flexible and he waxed so lyrical about the virtues of local authorities when we were talking about five minutes ago that i really wondered why the bill was necessary at all <e> <s> according to the noble lord the local authorities were so virtuous that they really did not need all the regulatory provisions of the bill they would love them all responsible local authorities would adore them and completely understand them <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord looks at the record he will find exactly that <e>", "<cs> if i have used a slight hyperbole to which i am rarely liable as i am quite sure the noble lord will agree then i apologise <e> <s> however the general sense of what he said to put it in a more moderate form was at minimum well this kind of thing might happen i repeat might happen in the world of business enterprise but certainly not in local authorities <e> <s> thus he resisted the amendment <e> <s> i am going to approach the noble lord in exactly the same way as regards this clause <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord remains inflexible <e> <s> of course what he has not explained is why in that event it is all right to leave the position of the auditor undone in that it is not an offence and is not an offence under this bill to give incorrect information to the auditor <e> <s> the noble lord declined to make it an offence when we were debating this particular clause to which i have already referred <e> <s> there it was all perfectly all right there was no need to create an offence for making incorrect statements to an auditor there was no offence for falsifying documents to be given to an auditor <e> <s> the noble lord declined my invitation my amendment that would have made it an offence to do these things <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble lord has not seen fit to accept this amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord has said london transport is a trading organisation to which the canons of commercial auditing are much more appropriate <e> <s> to begin with unlike a local authority it produces a proper balance sheet and accounts for its assets something which no local authority does at all at the moment <e> <s> nobody at the moment knows what any local government authority assets really are but in the case of london transport they are already incorporated in its balance sheet and totally different concepts of auditing ought to apply to london transport than apply to local authorities <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for that sympathetic response and i am wondering whether to regard it as the iron hand in a velvet glove or an affectionate handshake but certainly i am grateful to the minister for carrying the matter as far as he has <e> <s> the noble lord well knows that the disadvantage both here and in another place of the negative procedure is that owing to the sheer pressure of business and the volume of work that all members of parliament have to undertake not forgetting the volume of work in which a number of noble lords are involved negative procedure resolutions tend to get lost in the rush <e> <s> on the other hand matters must arise on the affirmative procedure and they appear on the order paper and attract attention <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the noble lord has not seen fit to give way on this <e> <s> he really must not go on trotting this one out time and again because we are getting a bit used to it now <e> <s> although his advisers may supply it to him periodically it is becoming a little wearisome that is that directions might be on minor matters of detail only there will therefore be dribs and drabs of them and therefore they will not be worthy of a regulation anyway <e> <s> the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment <e> <s> the case is unassailable <e> <s> the amendment says that there shall be defrayed out of moneys provided by parliament any deficit incurred by the commission after deducting fee income from its expenses <e> <s> on the basis of the noble lords optimism there ought to be no deficit and therefore he should be in no particular danger regarding this clause <e> <s> therefore i would not have thought he would be exposing himself or his right honourable friend to any peril <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble lord for having given us a good explanation of the bill which indeed can hardly be said to be one which will have an earth-shattering effect upon the majority of the population of the united kingdom so much so that it had a perfunctory second reading in another place and i observed that its committee stage took exactly four minutes <e> <s> as a member of your lordships house i am very often a little suspicious of bills that go through another place with such alacrity and i think it is desirable that we have one or two matters clarified a little <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could put it back to the noble lord in this way if the noble lord himself does not consider it important why did his minister mr bruce-gardyne think it necessary at committee stage to give the specific assurance <e> <s> i put it back to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> however will he deal with the latter part of my request for assurance <e> <s> this is a very technical and complex bill <e> <s> the instantaneous transmission of information becomes itself the instrument of transfer <e> <s> this is the nub of it <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house an undertaking that this will not be cited as a precedent when other bills of this type come up so that it will be without prejudice to our considering the whole matter anew if any other circumstances arise <e>", "<cs> my lords when giving consideration to the question of the privileges enjoyed by commonwealth citizens in this country will the noble lord ponder deeply upon the action of mindless cruelty yesterday in deporting a -year-old canadian mother to the united states and leaving her six-year old daughter a british citizen here <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for having gone into such detail <e> <s> he will appreciate that we shall have to examine the full impact of amendment no <e> <s> which he will be good enough to explain at a later stage with a view to seeing whether it does in fact cover the point that we have in mind <e> <s> for the life of me i still cannot understand why the noble earl will not <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not wish to detain the house from dealing with the next business which i assume will be the statement to which reference has already been made this afternoon <e> <s> however this is a matter which we regard as being of some importance <e> <s> we do not take the view of the noble earl <e> <s> that the publication of an order with the memorandum to which we have referred in the amendment would in any way prejudice the issue of the correct prospectus in due course <e> <s> obviously the prospectus itself goes into a whole series of legal and contractual matters as well as highly sophisticated accounting matters which are required under those particular circumstances <e> <s> however i doubt whether any memorandum issued by a government could be misleading in its effect or have any extreme impact upon the prospectus itself unless the government were capable of issuing frivolous memoranda which bore no relation to the matters that were ultimately dealt with in the prospectus or in the accountants report <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular clause as a whole deals with the ability to manoeuvre and transfer assets and liabilities from one subsidiary to another as a part or as a whole of some projected disposal <e> <s> it is a kind of juggling clause <e> <s> i should like to know why it has been found necessary at this stage to insert amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i should like to know why it has been necessary at line to insert the words <e>", "<cs> my lords i am much obliged <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has been kind enough to range fairly widely over amendments and <e> <s> i note in particular his reference to paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> who has given a very modest explanation of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> when i see at the end of any clause or subsection of proposed legislation the phrase <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble earl for having gone into some detail in explaining the whole purpose of amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> as he said its application is limited to the operation of subsection of clause and in particular to the new subsections and <e> <s> i would have thought that this would prevent any wild excesses that might have been apprehended by the inclusion of words of this kind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord lord skelmersdale <e> <s> i was endeavouring to assist his noble friend lord mansfield by indicating that we on this side of the house appreciate the explanation he has given <e> <s> we were congratulating him in part on the fact that the effect of the amendment was not quite as wide as one initially apprehended <e> <s> however we on this side of the house would like to have an opportunity of studying in the <e>", "<cs> my lords may i question the noble lord a little further on this point <e> <s> it will be only a very short point <e> <s> my noble friend asked him how he was going to define administrative expense a term which will appear in the bill in due course and of course under clause of the bill the auditors will require some specific particulars on how this is <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are generally in support of the sentiments which have been expressed by the noble lord lord gainford in moving but we have some questions to ask which i am quite sure the noble lord will be able to answer <e> <s> could it be the case that is given by the noble lord who moved the amendment that the tenant would have his own rights under common law in any event if excessive deductions had been made or on the other hand the authority would have the right on the basis of the deductions being insufficient <e> <s> i just wonder whether the noble lord could answer that point and say that it may perhaps depend upon the nature of the contract between the landlord and tenant anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has indicated this matter was discussed in committee and the noble lord gave some explanation of the position then <e> <s> we are most grateful for the further explanation he has given today and for his additional clarification <e> <s> we feel that the amendment he has made adds to clarity <e> <s> we are most grateful to him for it and we on this side of the house will support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house would like to support the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord ridley <e> <s> throughout the whole passage of this bill the noble lord the minister has in the most reasonable and reasoned terms repeatedly assured the house that what the government really want to do in their benign fashion is to bring an element of certainty into local government affairs <e> <s> he uses his arguments most persuasively sometimes almost with an air of injured innocence which completely belies any intention to injure any local authority at all or to operate anything to the detriment of local authorities <e> <s> in fact the noble lord has almost appeared to be injured at any suggestion that the thought should be in his mind that there should be any uncertainties so far as local authorities are concerned <e> <s> if the noble lord really means this he must surely agree with the amendment that has been put forward by his noble friend lord ridley <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has made very heavy weather of the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord evans of claughton <e> <s> all that the noble lords amendment asks for is the publication that is all <e> <s> the work has already been done <e> <s> the actual work of determining and the reasoning has all been done <e> <s> of course if the ministry is functioning properly minutes will have been kept and memoranda will have been written explaining and arguing the various reasons and the various matters that have been taken into account <e> <s> all that work has to be done in any event if the ministry is doing its work properly <e> <s> certainly it must be done various matters that were discussed at a meeting with representatives or at staff meetings that the minister holds are not all left to vague memory <e> <s> it is very carefully minuted <e>", "<cs> my lords i willingly concede to the noble lord the necessity of making new arrangements following the appointment of the audit commisson for the continuation of audit policies that have hitherto taken place under the audit directorate <e> <s> as the noble lord has said this is undoubtedly a matter of some importance so much so that one wonders why it was not in the bill in the first place or why if it is so important it was not introduced at the committee stage <e> <s> but i suppose we cannot cavil at that <e> <s> the noble lords department has been under considerable pressure as have all departments <e> <s> however it lends some colour to the belief that we have expressed from time to time and shall probably express again at third reading that this bill has been very hurriedly cobbled together <e> <s> this matter is of such importance that of course it should have been incorporated in the original bill <e> <s> it does however raise certain questions <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house would like to say ditto to what the noble viscount lord ridley has said and what was said by <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e>", "<cs> my lords there is just one point that i should like the noble lord to cover before he sits down <e> <s> he seems to think that during an audit the auditor and the books and records are in separate rooms that the books accounts and documents are in the possession of the local authority not in the possession of the auditor at the time that he audits them <e> <s> as a matter of practice that is not the case <e> <s> when an auditor or his staff are engaged on the books the audit staff have in front of them the books documents and everything else <e> <s> so during the time of the audit the auditor himself has the effective custody of the documents because otherwise he cannot audit them

hope the noble lord will sec fit to accept this amendment <e> <s> i spoke about this at some length in committee and i do not propose to repeat it now <e> <s> all i propose to do in the interests of

well be as the noble earl says that the purport of the amendments as against the text of the bill as drafted is a delicate balance which can be poised one way or the other <e> <s> the question is which way it should be poised <e> <s> the noble lord lord skelmersdale was at pains to say that amendment no <e> <s> was already covered by undertakings given by the government <e> <s> the minister knows perfectly well that such undertakings even though they appear in <e>", "<cs> i was dealing with the question of legal construction my lords and the noble earl knows perfectly well that if these matters should ever be the subject of a court action that is what all statutes have to stand up to the interpretation of the measure comes under the interpretation of law legislation which was only recently passed through this house <e> <s> it is the text of the statute rather than the illumination that is put on it by speeches made here or in another place that is the operative factor <e> <s> as the minister pointed out the bill as drafted provides full opportunity for the corporation to be heard <e> <s> the responsibility we seek to lay on the government in amplification of that contains these important words in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl lord lauderdale is not the only one who is astonished and i must say that i shall address my remarks to your lordships house in what i consider to be the most economic amount of time consistent with making the point absolutely clear <e> <s> the noble earl himself has been known occasionally to be effusive and not always to good effect <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble and learned lord has himself just given an illustration of precisely the principle we have been talking about on previous amendments <e> <s> here is an amendment that has been introduced to clarify the position <e> <s> it had always been assumed that the petroleum did in fact belong to the crown and i have no doubt that either here or in another place assurances were given to that effect <e> <s> but a more detailed examination particularly after the case to which the noble and learned lord referred has placed this in some dubiety and so the noble and learned lord has brought forward this amendment <e> <s> incidentally one might almost have expected it to have been in the original bill or at any rate introduced in committee but here it is <e> <s> this is an illustration of how wise it is to have these matters of dubiety incorporated into the bill itself regardless of information and assurances given by ministers <e> <s> we entirely support the amendment but we hope that the noble and learned lord will take strictly to heart the lessons of this that it is desirable to have all these assumed things specially stated in legislation <e> <s> for that reason we shall not resist the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord is going to give very careful consideration to the amendments that are being proposed by my noble friend lord beswick <e> <s> as the noble lord knows perfectly well but the public at large may not know the difference between the negative and affirmative procedures is that if the government have to come to the house for an affirmative resolution it means that the instrument is brought before the house and must therefore be debated <e> <s> if on the other hand there is adopted a negative procedure the onus lies exactly the opposite way and with the mass of instruments coming before parliament under the negative procedure the chances of them being thoroughly dealt with are much less than if the government have to make time to bring forward these particular orders or directions for positive affirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the noble lords complimentary references to the activities of euro-control itself will he give the house an assurance that her majestys government will seek so far as they possibly can in conjunction with other members of the community to keep euro-control in existence and in fact to expand its activities <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that from a cursory examination of the report that has been possible so far it would appear to be a very valuable report indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the guidelines that are from time to time issued by hm customs and excise have no force in law and that occasions have been known when reference to the various finance acts themselves has proved that the guidelines have not always been correct <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene just briefly would it not be better to say the alleged offender rather than the offender <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for having introduced this amendment in order as he says to dot the is and cross the ts i therefore hope that the noble lord will not take it amiss if i endeavour to assist him even further in this process by raising some questions which may be of a little importance <e> <s> the provisions of clause require any information given to the secretary of state under the provisions of section of the local government planning and land act that is information for the purposes of block grants <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to ask a further question <e> <s> the noble lord said that there has been a degree of overlap between the application of section to section and to section <e> <s> would it not have been better to have singled out of section the specific matters that have to be taken into account in section and to have dealt with section of act the in the same way as section has been dealt with so that it was written into the text of the act itself <e> <s> he will find i think on reference to his own parliamentary counsel that there is likely to be some confusion here <e> <s> i should like it to be cleared up if possible <e> <s> at the moment it seems that we have one specific series of amendments to section and then a global inference that section is in its totality subject to the new <e>", "<cs> my lords as we on this side of the house made quite clear from the outset and we have no reason to change our minds in any way this bill is a thoroughly partisan bill <e> <s> it ranks with the other two prongs of the present governments attack on what they consider to be the targets which are worthy of their attention <e> <s> the other two are the publicly-owned industries and the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble earl for having given his explanation which was largely in technical terms <e> <s> however he still has not particularised the problems which his original phrase was designed to cover <e> <s> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord lord wilberforce for his very objective examination of the problem that the original phrase raised <e> <s> he was unable to go the whole way with me but one sentence of his impressed me <e> <s> it was a point which in less felicitous terms i myself had made at report that clauses such as this may always be quoted as a precedent <e> <s> the amendment which i have ventured to lay before your lordships severely circumvents the operation of this clause to the extent that it is not already covered by the companies act <e> <s> it is a matter which should be circumvented and i propose to press the matter to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords we are a little sorry that the noble earl has not taken a more constructive attitude to this arrangement <e> <s> when we get to third reading and amendments are put down they sometimes quite understandably tend to have a more technical flavour and are kept within a very narrow context of matters that have been discussed on report and in committee <e> <s> it is therefore necessary when we are considering this amendment to remember that what we are discussing are the principles that should govern the disposal by the state of interest in a highly profitable and highly efficient industry the british gas industry which has consistently made profits much to the chagrin of the party opposite and which has delivered to the public at large one of the best services in the provision of gas in the whole of the world <e> <s> this is indeed what we are discussing <e>", "<cs> i am most indebted to the noble lord for having

has in fact been no increase in manufacturing production <e> <s> is he further aware that most reputable forecasts do not predict any increase at all however insignificant until next <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble viscount take steps to ensure that his noble friend lord cockfield receives a copy of the reply he has given this afternoon since it is in complete contradiction to the predictions which were given by his noble friend some three months ago <e> <s> will the noble viscount accept as a matter of principle that we on this side of <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> i shall be delighted my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that part of the complication that arises on the drafting of certain of the forms comes from the complexity of the innumerable regulations that are issued by government departments and will she pay attention please to the necessity for simplifying a good number of the regulations with which the country is inflicted at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble baroness aware that the recruitment of accountants into the civil service is proceeding far more slowly than the government themselves envisage <e> <s> will she assure herself that there is no undue resistance on behalf of some of the administrative grades to the introduction of rather more accountants into the civil service which process at the moment as the noble baroness is aware is being conducted by mr kenneth sharp <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to enable citizens of the falkland islands to acquire british citizenship <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house some indication as to the endeavours that have been made by her majestys government to follow up the initiatives which were displayed by the council of europe in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house information as to whether this million charge was a negotiated charge between both parties or whether it was arbitrarily imposed <e> <s> it is important that the house should be able to distinguish between the two arrangements

second part of my noble friends question as to what action her majestys government are taking towards increasing production <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will permit me it was on st april that she notified the home office <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is so important <e> <s> could the noble lord say whether the letter which his right honourable friend sent to miss luczak on the th november was sent to her at the address she now occupied or the other address <e> <s> this is crucial to the case <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him one question which is rather crucial <e> <s> will he accept the fact that when his right honourable friend wrote to mr hattersley in april he was not aware at that time that miss luczak had not received the notice of the hearing had not been part of the appeal was not present and had not received any documentation in relation of it <e> <s> also is he aware that miss luczaks visit to germany was quite a <e>", "<cs>

to take advantage of them <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the area covered by eurocontrol is a comparatively small one <e> <s> is he aware that there is a growing volume of opinion that would welcome the extension of eurocontrol over a far wider area <e> <s> will his noble friend consider publishing a short white paper which shows quite unequivocally exactly what the policy of her majestys government is towards eurocontrol <e> <s> because so far it seems to be a little ambivalent where it is not obscure <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his governments approach to this whole matter is rather less than even-handed <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that whenever it comes to a question of wages as distinct from salaries the chancellor <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for his succinct reply <e> <s> when he said it would be open to any government to postpone <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement by noble lord lord selsdon which many of us may have thought erred slightly on the side of complacency that we had in his view reached a stable economic situation presents the precise reasons for the initiation of this debate by my noble friend lord jacques <e> <s> if wide sections of the conservative party are convinced that this is really a stable situation then the speech of my noble friend lord jacques in which he drew attention to the consequences of the governments policies upon certain sections of the community is more than abundantly justified <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord be good enough to explain exactly how i attacked imports from third world countries <e> <s> i shall read him in <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> if the noble lord will turn to table in the latest bank of england review he will find that of course that is quite true in the case of the united states dollar where the value of the pound has gone down significantly which of course affects the smithsonian index <e> <s> but if he will look at the case of belgium france italy the netherlands and germany he will find that the high exchange rate policy still obtains <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he give me one final answer <e> <s> i do not ask for it now <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that i made the point indeed i made a challenge about unit labour costs in the united kingdom about productivity by people belonging to our own country as compared with the united states and about labour costs <e> <s> these are contained at column of the <e>", "<cs> but my lords is the noble lord aware that there is hardly anything in the governments record that justifies their being able to give any advice to anybody <e> <s> would it not be far better if the noble lord decided to devote some interest to his own country and to its prosperity as distinct from the disaster into which his own government have put it <e>", "<cs> my lords does the figure which the minister has just given in respect of manufacturing industry include the production of oil and fuels or is it in respect of real manufacturing industry as we understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that the statistical material in the possession of the federation of british industries and the associated british chambers of commerce has indicated to them and they have expressed it publicly in the <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the house gave a first reading to a bill to amend the nationality act in order to accomplish the exact purposes which his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter has in mind <e> <s> will the noble lord make quite sure that the bill receives a speedy passage through the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be indebted to the noble lord for the very detailed and clear explanation he has given of these regulations <e> <s> it will not have escaped notice that although sometimes regulations meet with disagreement among those members of your lordships house who happen to be members of the legal profession when they concern the accounting profession as these regulations undoubtedly do there is a striking degree of unanimity <e> <s> in fact the explanation that has been given with his customary clarity by the noble lord enables me to agree with him entirely and to say that we on this side of the house believe that these regulations should be brought into force <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the recent experience of her majestys government in regard to the task force to the falklands would the noble earl not agree that it is time that the governments decision about the eventual running down of the portsmouth dockyard was reconsidered <e> <s> is it not quite clear in the light of the events that took place that the services of the royal dockyards whether they be at rosyth chatham or portsmouth are of the utmost importance to the country as a whole <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this question itself relates to manufactured goods <e> <s> will he not come absolutely clean on this <e> <s>

accession and also very substantial and considerable <e> <s> will the noble lord also bear in mind that the oil supplies from this country are so far as one can see not of indefinite duration <e> <s> will he take steps to cease destroying the manufacturing base in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord greenhill of harrow for putting down this unstarred question <e> <s> it will afford the noble lord opposite an opportunity which i am sure he will welcome of defining with his customary precision the objectives that the government have in mind when this conference takes place <e> <s> the noble lord himself i think would be the first to lay down that it really is no good talking of objectives in general terms because they can get so woolly at the edges that at the end of the generalised statement one is left with a feeling that perhaps there is more of an element of wishful thinking and hope than a specific series of objectives <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that his right honourable friend mr tebbit in another place when delivering a breakfast-time broadcast on the thursday of the conservative party conference answered the contention of his right honourable friend sir ian gilmour that the payments to the unemployed should in fact be increased by saying that that would cause widespread resentment among the lower paid workers some of whom were paid below that rate <e> <s> is it therefore the governments intention that wages should now be driven down to below the normal unemployment rates <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the question of unemployment that was raised by my noble friend lady jeger is of course very relevant to the items that he has been quoting <e> <s> is it not a fact that owing to increased unemployment and generally to the increased poverty and deprivation which has now come upon us since the government have been in office the demands on the social services have become much greater and are much greater than the percentage increase of the expenditure in real terms to which the noble lord referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will he indicate to the house whether he supported the government when they themselves deliberately ordered the gas and the electricity industries to put their prices up to a level per cent <e> <s> above that of inflation <e> <s> will he say whether he supported the government intervention to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords in winding up for the opposition in this debate which has been a very long debate it is my first and very pleasant duty to congratulate my noble friend lord gormley on a most notable speech indeed one which with its directness spoke absolutely straightly to the house <e> <s> the noble lord did not talk with a forked tongue he talked exactly as he felt and in a way in my opinion he set the tone for this debate in declaring boldly that what we want is earned money instead of dole money <e> <s> i hope the noble lord takes part in our debates again very soon <e> <s> i hope that he will favour us with many more direct observations some of which may not command universal approval but which will at any rate enhance the value of this house and the esteem in which this house is held by coming directly to the points at issue and approaching them on a basis which in his case rests on almost unrivalled experience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble viscount <e> <s> i hoped that i would be able to secure a united front on the other side by that very timely intervention <e> <s> so much for success <e> <s> is it a success for the government to create the environment within which total output has declined by per cent <e> <s> in the past three and a half years <e> <s> is that claimed as a success <e> <s> is it a triumph to create the climate i am using the noble lords words the environment within which industry functions during which industrial output has declined by per cent <e> <s> is that an achievement <e> <s> does anybody boast of the achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i was under the impression that the noble lords party many times before the last election emphasised its devotion to free collective bargaining and the repudiation of all incomes policies <e> <s> is he now complaining that before the election the rights he wanted to give to the trade unions and upon which he bribed them were exercised and they obtained wage settlements <e> <s> where is the noble lords blank cheque <e>", "<cs> if that were so why then did the noble lords own party deliberately add another per cent <e> <s> to the inflation rate which it most certainly did by its raising of vat increases in rents and interest charges and so on <e> <s> but i do not want to take away the credit for this per cent <e> <s> at all <e> <s> prices are still rising but they are rising at per cent <e> <s> instead of ten although that does not apply to old age pensioners who have a different spectrum of expenditure from the members on the other side of the house <e> <s> for them the inflation remains substantially what it was <e> <s> the noble lords own figures show that the standard of living has gone down during that period by almost the exact amount that the rate of inflation has been decreased <e> <s> so this is the achievement which they claim or do they claim the achievement of liquidations and bankruptcies a week <e> <s> do they claim that as a success <e> <s> i rather wonder where the claims for success come from <e> <s> of course the noble lord lord soames has a complete alibi for that because he said that is all due to the recession it is not due to the government at all <e> <s> in order to prove his point he made the same selective quotations from statistics as were made by his right honourable friend the prime minister the other day which related only to months <e>", "<cs> my lords i trust that the noble lord will read the figures tomorrow when he will regret what he has just said because they show that in comparison with the seven our position has deteriorated in all respects in the last three years more than the rest combined <e> <s> but i do not want to be too unkind to the party opposite because they know all this <e> <s> they know it all really <e> <s> they are putting on a very brave face which they have to do when elections come around and they think that by the sheer power of the media which they always have largely at their disposal the big lie can in fact be sold <e> <s> it is too late an hour to go into the very great detail which <e>", "<cs> my lords you must have a little more of it yet <e> <s> but i observe that one of the irrelevancies which were referred to in the gracious speech as being part of government policy relates to the continuation of the policy of privatisation and indeed my noble friend lord scanlon referred to the same point <e> <s> i am a little amazed at this <e> <s> how can it be imagined that the change of ownership of particular sections of industry usually the profitable parts will add one extra person to those numbers employed <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that on all sides of the house there is considerable anxiety lest any of these gallant young men should be left in uncertainty for a long period of time <e> <s> would not the noble earl consider it advisable within say one or two months to make a full statement showing exactly what provision is going to be made for those who served this country so well <e>", "<cs> my lords will this guarantee count as part of the public sector borrowing requirement and will it be deducted from that <e> <s> if not how does it differ from those other guarantees that are made for the loan requirements of nationalised industries <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord further on that <e> <s> i understand from his reply that the only occasion when this particular guarantee will become part of the public sector borrowing requirement is in the event of the guarantee being called upon <e> <s> is he aware that that is not the case when loans for nationlised industries are guaranteed by the government and may i ask him to explain the difference in treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the argentinian junta by its own communication to the political parties in argentina has already admitted that it itself is responsible for atrocities and oppression within its own country over <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his statement that the government have no exchange rate policy is merely an expression of present ambiguity rather than of past history <e> <s> is he further aware that in point of fact from the latter part of it has been the governments policy deliberately to drive up the rate of exchange by their extremely abrupt rise in the interest rates indeed so much so that the noble lords right honourable friend the prime minister was six months thereafter boasting of the high exchange rate that the pound could look the dollar and every other currency in the face <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for repeating the statement made in another place which statement indeed is one of the utmost gravity <e> <s> we are very pleased indeed to note that a further report will be made to the house and presumably to another place before christmas <e> <s> i put it to the noble lord that although these matters are resolved through the usual channels we on this side of the house regard it as of the utmost importance that a full public and informed debate takes place on the questions that have been raised by this statement <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his answer will be quite reassuring to millions of people including old-age pensioners and people on very low incomes for whom a halfpenny is a matter of some significance <e> <s> will he also bear in mind when reviewing the position of the halfpenny that as and when it should be abolished there is always a tendency to round upward rather than downward <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the concessions which he has repeated this afternoon and which as he said were announced in the budget are in the case of industry still far short of the artificial increases imposed by the government at per cent <e> <s> above the rate of inflation <e> <s> would he agree that there is still a long way to go before prices are reduced to those which are termed to be within the control of market forces <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will wish to thank the noble lord for the statement he has just made a copy of which reached me precisely nine minutes ago <e> <s> this short time limit does not really permit those in opposition adequate opportunity to study the content of it and i hope that on the next occasion when we have a fairly complex statement adequate time will be given to the opposition and to others interested so that we can respond to the statement in a constructive manner <e> <s> having said that i sympathise very sincerely with the personal position of the noble lord <e> <s> it is quite clear from what he has said that the negotiations upon which he has been engaged have been very arduous and i can imagine that he must be very tired after sitting up for long periods of the night i do not know whether the rooms were smoke-filled <e> <s> we all sincerely appreciate the endeavours that the noble lord must have made <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those who sit behind me i too would like to congratulate the noble baroness lady vickers on bringing forward her bill <e> <s> it is true that the bill bears substantial similarities in text with the one which i had the honour to put before your lordships at first reading shortly before the recess <e> <s> that is of small consequence what is of consequence is that as the house well knows the noble baroness had fought consistently aided from time to time by her noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for the principles involved in this bill <e> <s> for our part we are very grateful to her as will be the remainder of the peers of various parties who sought to sustain the noble baroness in the lobby and who did not regrettably include many noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble lord a little further on the answers that he has already given <e> <s> the noble lord referred to the desirability of a short transitional period for spain assuming the full responsibilities under her eec membership <e> <s> will he say whether the government envisage a progressive scaling down during the transitional period of this discrepancy in duty to which the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter refers <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord lord plowden for initiating the debate and will be grateful once again to sub-committee a for having drawn up such an excellent report <e> <s> the report must of course be taken as a sequel to report no <e> <s> printed on rd march the th report on group accounts <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree in discussing the position of default by a sovereign state or by an ordinary bankrupt that so far as a creditor is concerned a bankrupt position is a little more favourable because there is a chance of getting a dividend <e> <s> if a sovereign state defaults there is no way in which a creditor can get anything at all so is not the sovereign default worse <e>", "<cs> my lord i should like to add my thanks to those of your lordships to my noble friend lord lever for having given us the opportunity to debate this very important subject <e> <s> it is of course possible to overestimate its importance and perhaps there is a danger too of underestimating it but listening to your lordships tonight particularly those of your lordships who have banking experience and city experience i am persuaded that the international banking system is in very grave crisis indeed <e> <s> i am fortified in that belief by an analysis that appeared in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to press the noble lord too far but when <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the noble lords intervention <e> <s> i do not really believe that the population of san salvador for example wanted its government to have large loans in order to buy arms in order to oppress them and for murders to take place in the streets <e> <s> this is not merely a caricature it is exactly what happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept the position of the noble lord within the context that he has now set but it of course makes nonsense of the initial rise in interest rates by the government of up to per cent <e> <s> one of the most disastrous steps which has ever been taken since this government came to office the repercussions of which we are still in fact feeling <e> <s> but in due course perhaps he may denounce that <e>", "<cs> no my lords not a bit <e> <s> the noble lord will be well aware of the observations of the noble lord lord benson on inner reserves and matters of that kind <e> <s> he will know perfectly well that under the revised code in order to comply with eec regulations which are now enshrined in the companies acts we have to show a true and fair view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not endeavouring to cast any aspersions on british banks <e> <s> i entirely share the views of my noble friend lord lever on this subject <e> <s> but i am aware of a new vogue in the united states of which the noble lord himself must be aware called creative accounting whereby computed losses which ought on a prudence concept to be written off

of the house do not propose to dissent in any way from the content of the regulations that have been very adequately explained by the noble lord <e> <s> they add to the schedule of the regulations of last year certain words for the use of which companies or firms must obtain the consent of either the minister of the appropriate department the name of which appears in the second column of the schedule or the designated body <e> <s> i do not think that the addition to the list of the words chemist chemistry polytechnic and university will cause any particular tremors of anxiety on this side

pounds or dollars <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to the noble lord lord mottistone for having introduced this unstarred question because the noble lord always speaks with

lords again using the term community service in its widest sense will the noble earl agree that one of the best encouragements to young people in this regard and indeed to older people would be if the government themselves set an example <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee wish to thank the noble baroness lady vickers for the very thorough way in which she has pursued this important matter

and i shall not detain the committee for long <e> <s> but i think the point has to be made that history will pass a verdict on the provisions of the original british nationality bill that affect the falklands as indeed i hope it will pass a more optimistic judgment about the decision to support the noble baroness on this occasion <e> <s> we entirely agree with the noble baronesss amendments and we shall support them <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that the use of the word public in the question tabled by his noble friend is rather inappropriate in the circumstances and that it

questions of principle of the utmost gravity <e> <s> however first it is necessary for me to ask the noble earl to disentangle the somewhat circuituous route by virtue of which the central electricity

section of the act and a cut of some million to the british technology group do not seem to indicate an overwhelming enthusiasm by the government to come to the aid of industry generally bearing in mind that manufacturing production in this country has declined by about per cent during the governments period of office <e> <s> will he explain the reasons for these cuts in greater detail because at the moment they do not appear to be in the best interests of british industry or its further development <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he clarify one point that might be of considerable assistance to your lordships <e> <s> will he say that as part of the commercialisation to which he refers the accounts of the ordnance survey will be drawn up on normal commercial lines that its balance sheet will include all its assets and all its liabilities and that its accounts will be prepared on an income and expenditure basis as distinct from the cash basis upon which government departments normally work <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give the house an assurance that when the assets are assessed and valued as indeed they will have to be for the purposes of inclusion in the balance sheet the copyright values will also be assessed and stated in the balance sheet <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware as evidently his right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords finally on this one point following the noble lords assertion that the government had no right to interfere with the activities of commercial banks does that mean that the commercial banks of this country regardless of the national interest can lend exactly as they please <e> <s> in this particular instance and with regard to the million dollars loaned late last november were any conditions attached <e> <s> did the government insist on any conditions being attached and if not why not <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of the british taxpayer to whom the noble lord is

bill and indeed express a sense of relief i put it no higher that her majestys government have given every facility in assisting the noble baroness with the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble lord agree in retrospect that the lifting of the financial sanctions against argentina bearing in mind that according to his noble friend some per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of argentine

the noble lord for having introduced the second reading of the bill in this place <e> <s> as he says it follows true to form <e> <s> there are no more legal complexities in it than there were in the

he moved it if i may relieve his mind in terms of excessive moderation and the speech which fell from the lips of the noble lord lord diamond fully reinforced the conclusions at which my noble friend arrived <e> <s> we had a very interesting speech from the noble lord lord cockfield as indeed we always do <e> <s> the noble lord is always very sure of himself in fact if one goes back through his speeches over the last five years one sees how little they vary in tone or in content but they do express his ineffable confidence in his own implacable wisdom <e> <s> i shall refer to the noble lords speech in greater detail as i proceed but initially i should like to take him up on one point <e>", "<cs> well my lords i was just quoting the prime minister <e> <s> i will give a further quotation

the many provocative remarks that he made <e> <s> i trust that he will <e>", "<cs> no my lords quite the reverse is true <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks that he can get away with that one then he had better re-examine what he has said because of course it is not true in the slightest <e> <s> all that happened was that willingly and voluntarily we made the cuts before anybody else did <e> <s> that is exactly what happened and the noble lord knows it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am obliged to the noble viscount <e> <s> it is true that there were voluntary redundancies and it is quite true that for a large number of people the real uncertainties the evil and immediate anxieties of unemployment are alleviated by redundancy payments <e> <s> of that there can be no doubt <e> <s> i am talking about those millions of people who have not yet even entered into a two-year period after which redundancy payments become available for whom there is no relief and for whom there is no hope <e> <s> but i am very glad to accept the noble viscounts correction on that point <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that far more important than the role of gold in any future international monetary system is the role of the commercial and central banks which needs to be more carefully examined in the future bearing in mind that over the past few years many of them have behaved with the grossest irresponsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the governments attitude of caution <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm to the house that his department made specific inquiries on this matter of the british council <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl clarify one point <e> <s> is it to be the case that mr macgregor will continue to be the chairman of british steel corporation until the day he takes up his duties with the coal industry <e> <s> is there going to be any period of overlap at all <e> <s> perhaps the minister will care to clarify that point

find that the corporation can dispose of any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries with the permission of the secretary of state <e> <s> the duties given in the old act and set out in section did not act as an effective bar to british shipbuilders ceasing any of its activities <e> <s> it is clearly stated in section that provided the secretary of state consents it can stop <e> <s> the noble lord may say that the application to the secretary of state itself imposes a responsibility <e> <s> as the bill installs a whole new series of directions by the secretary of state which the secretary of state may give to british shipbuilders this seems to be small in comparison <e> <s> the same is true of other sections <e> <s> section states <e>", "<cs> the explanations given by the noble lord are not satisfactory as he must know <e> <s> there is no reason at all why british shipbuilders under the old act subject in some instances to the approval of the secretary of state could not do anything that it wished to do within its general objects <e> <s> i have the gravest misgiving for the reasons i have stated about eliminating the word duty in this instance <e> <s> the noble lord gave some clue about it in his last intervention when he was careful to point out that under the old act the provisions of section were strictly within the provisions of the section imposing the duty <e> <s> therefore he must regard the duty as being a bar of some kind to his own department <e> <s> i regret that we have to press the amendment <e>", "<cs> yes certainly <e> <s> even the noble lord should understand that when one considers the application of a particular clause which has for its purpose the need for the abolition of any move to industrial democracy it is quite proper and the noble lord

he was at that time <e> <s> i am sorry if he experienced any obstruction or discouragement from the unions involved <e> <s> he made an effort however and that is all this is about <e>", "<cs> the noble lord in his reply made no further mention of his advertised plans to dispose of certain parts of the warship division which were referred to by him on second reading <e> <s> for the record

other ministries <e> <s> will he confirm that that is the case or alternatively deny it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> my information is that the great bulk of the contracts of the warship division are in fact on a cost-plus basis <e> <s> therefore the element of risk is very limited indeed and the possibility of profit is rather more than a probability amounting almost to a certainty <e> <s> the noble lord did not refer in any way to the point that i made to him about the governments assistance to british shipbuilders or for that matter to any other public corporation when faced with unfair competition other than saying that they paid very diligent attention to it and would make the utmost representations that they could in conjunction with either their colleagues in the gatt or their colleagues in the european community <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows as well as anybody else that the intervention fund was established at a certain figure which takes into account some and only some of the adverse circumstances <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord informing the committee that after giving detailed information concerning this cable ship to the house at

loss of time in the process of determining a fair price certainly cannot stand up to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for the explanation that he has given which has supplied

of the imf are to some extent over-influenced by the present government and indeed by the government of the united states insisting on the more rigorous applications of monetary policy which are

intervene will the noble lord bear in mind that section of the telecommunications act is specifically repealed by this bill <e>", "<cs> i have been trying to follow what the noble lord has been saying in reply to the debate <e> <s> i found it difficult to discern when he was not supporting the amendment that is put forward <e> <s> he seemed to be indicating that all the safeguards are perfectly satisfactory and that the aims that are implicit in the amendment are in fact his own aims <e> <s> that being so there would seem very little reason for his being unable to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> the reply given by the noble lord exposes the whole weakness of this bill <e> <s> he referred to demand being essentially the demand of the market place in other words those who can afford to have it are going to have it <e> <s> the whole concept of a public service is essentially to supply reasonably the needs of the people <e> <s> this is exactly what the national health service was founded for and exactly the same principle was involved <e> <s> the noble lord is quite correct in saving that anybody can assess a subjective need but the words reasonable need would be there <e> <s> that is what the remainder of the bill and certain of the amendments seek to do to specify areas of need <e>", "<cs> the real purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the practice that is now in force so far as british telecom and its subscribers are concerned is continued under the new regime <e> <s> it is possible that the wording needs to be changed in order to accomplish this <e> <s> but there have been reports in the press which your lordships may have seen they may not be accurate stating that the government will hive off the printed directory service as something separate and distinct from the telephone or telecommunications system itself <e> <s> i do not wish to give credence to those reports <e> <s> i am not putting myself behind the assertion <e> <s> but those reports have appeared <e> <s> we want to be sure that the practice at present carried out by british telecom of providing printed telephone directories to subscribers probably on a local basis or whatever it may be continues in the future <e> <s> the bill at the moment contains no provision for that <e> <s> we should like to be reassured that the practice will continue without any extra charge to the subscriber <e> <s> that is the purpose of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the purpose of introducing this amendment at this stage is as the noble lord correctly apprehended in order to ensure that the secretary of state and the director <e>", "<cs> if i may reply to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter i am surprised that he should have criticised his government so vigorously because it is precisely his government that have produced this proposal in the licence <e> <s> when the government gave the undertaking that prices would not increase except within this particular format they made no such stipulation that the noble lord may have in mind <e> <s> they should perhaps have considered this prior to making the undertaking that they gave <e> <s> all the noble lord is now saving is that in effect the promise at the moment is only in the licence <e> <s> after considering the remarks of what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter may have thought wise they make take it out of the licence <e> <s> this is precisely why we want it in the bill so that there can be no reneging on the promise <e>", "<cs> the government in their reply have been most obliging <e> <s> they have revealed to the public at large that the undertakings they gave in regard to this matter which have been freely interpreted and which have been repeated many times are not sufficiently reliable for them to be put into a statute <e> <s> they still want some elbow room <e> <s> the noble lord has qualified many times what he has said <e> <s> he has referred to a draft licence which has not yet been finalised <e> <s> the public will understand from the governments declining to accept this amendment that the promises which they made in far more generous terms are quite baseless and that they have no intention ultimately of carrying them out <e> <s> on those lines i propose to divide the committee and to ask noble lords to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house some indication how these increased retail sales are reflected in the imports into this country of the goods that are sold in our shops <e> <s> will he also give the house an assurance that when his right honourable friend comes to consider his budget he will remove the vat disadvantage which gives a cash flow advantage to importers into this country of some thousands of millions of pounds for a period of between and weeks <e>", "<cs> those for whom i speak on this side of the committee wish to associate themselves with the amendment moved by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> as he has said clause purports to give authority to the secretary of state and the director to do all kinds of desirable things to promote the interests of the consumer to maintain <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> may i take up the noble lord on one point <e> <s> as i see it the amendment seeks to bring the activities of only the secretary of state in regard to parts iv v vi and vii under the scope of the clause <e> <s> it does not at any point seek to bring in the actions of the home secretary <e> <s> it refers solely to the bill and only to those parts of it in which the secretary of state has a responsibility <e> <s> i was most interested to observe that it is admitted that for the secretary of state to operate under part v of the bill which deals with the privatisation of british telecom would be considered repugnant in the context of clause in that that would not be consistent with promoting the interests of the consumer <e> <s> therefore i can quite understand why the noble lord wishes to remove part v from the ambit of the objectives set out in clause <e> <s> i do not know what the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran proposes to do with his amendment but if he is constrained to divide the committee we on this side will support him <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord somers i do not wish to make a second reading speech on this issue <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers and the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe have already put the point very adequately <e> <s> i do not propose to add to what they have said save to say that if the noble lord is constrained to bring this matter to a division as i sincerely hope he will do if the government do not accept the amendment we on this side of the committee shall most certainly support him <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i draw his respectful attention to the fact that this amendment is not designed to amend subsection <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord who has deployed his legal skills to such effect in explaining the precise legal significance <e> <s> i must say that i find his legal logic irrefutable so much so that it will be necessary particularly after having listened to the noble lord lord weinstock probably at report stage to provide a far more precise definition than the mere word manufacturers which has been inserted here <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble lord for the time and trouble that as a lawyer he has spent in explaining to a mere accountant exactly what this bill means in this respect <e> <s> with those pleasantries which i hope will continue i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the noble and learned lord has not been able to enlarge on this matter to explain just how these efforts are going to take place <e> <s> all he has really done is repeat the sort of magic formula that competition itself takes care of all these problems <e> <s> the noble and learned lord is rather less perceptive than his right honourable friend the prime minister and his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer who want to make money out of this deal of privatisation <e> <s> they have been selling the prospective investors the advantages of taking shares in a private monopoly in succession to a public monopoly which already has produced astonishingly good financial results has produced an astonishingly good performance and has given the consumer charges on a scale significantly less than those of most of their competitors in the west <e> <s> it has provided one of the most efficient telephone services in the world <e>", "<cs> it is becoming a little indelicate for the opposition to interfere in the lengthy argument that has suddenly broken out on the government benches and which so far has taken minutes of which not one minute of time has been occupied by this side of the committee <e> <s> may i quickly remind the noble lord lord mottistone who preceded his second second reading speech by an admonition against those who would venture to embark on such a task that the matter was covered by clause a fact that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was good enough to confirm when he spoke <e> <s> we on this side have no interest in this dispute that has broken out between supporters of the government and we should like to get on with the business <e>", "<cs> i trust that the noble lord who moved this amendment and the noble lords supporting him will bear in mind that businesses are comprised of persons and the persons appear to be covered by clause <e> <s> notably at paragraphs <e>", "<cs> the committee will be indebted to the noble lord lord howard who has very considerable specialist knowledge of these matters for his intervention in the debate <e> <s> it is unfortunate that more energetic efforts were not made in the past to obtain a greater allocation at the various berne conferences that have taken place <e> <s> but we are faced with the present position <e> <s> i do not know how on the assumption that this amendment were carried the noble lord would be able to increase the allocation that we already have and i do not know how he would <e>", "<cs> i should not like to put a figure on the number of individuals <e> <s> as the noble baroness says there are about per cent <e> <s> of households with telephones but that still leaves per cent <e> <s> of the households without any kind of installation at all <e> <s> the figures are not of vast importance <e> <s> if there are per cent <e> <s> of the households without a telephone that still implies a very considerable number of people without facilities <e> <s> they are not the only people who are deprived <e> <s> the ordinary citizen even though he may have a telephone in his own home very often wishes to use a call box and particularly in case of emergency for example if he is stranded in a rural area or in an area in which it is difficult to obtain access to an ordinary private subscriber <e> <s> the public telephone call box is a most important installation from the point of view of accessability to the network <e>", "<cs> i am naturally disappointed with the reply of the noble lord <e> <s> one matter struck me as very significant <e> <s> the financial point below which a call box will be removed differs very sharply from the conditions under which a call-box would be installed <e> <s> i have heard nothing so far that disputes the prospect of a year still remaining the operative figure for the installation of a new call-box <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can query that <e>", "<cs> your lordships may feel that this amendment has received adequate consideration from all sides of the committee <e> <s> speaking for my noble friends i have no wish to protract the discussion further <e> <s> we are not satisfied with the decision as it is now left and we shall probably return to this issue on report <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord thorneycroft as usual put his finger on the nub of the whole question when he said that it was of course far better that these matters are left out of legislation <e> <s> the obvious advantage of leaving matters of this kind out of legislation is that your foreign competitors in the ec countries cannot indict you before the european court or anywhere else on the basis of your legislation <e> <s> it means that it is very difficult for your competitors to do anything about it so long as it is done as a matter of understanding <e> <s> so long as british telecom was run as a public utility this was perfectly possible <e> <s> the aims of british telecom as a public utility were to provide services to the customer to run a public service <e>", "<cs> yes precisely so <e> <s> we can then expose the humbug of the other ec countries which as we all know do precisely the same whether or not it is in the ec legislation <e> <s> we always comply with it <e> <s> but we do not insist on anyone else complying with it <e> <s> however that raises a wider issue <e> <s> i have no desire to prolong discussion on this but we shall return to it again <e> <s> i quite understand the attitude of the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> i share his anxieties <e> <s> i do not think that the expressions that have so far emanated from both sir george jefferson and indeed from the government will materialise in practice in what we shall term for the moment the post-immediate future <e>", "<cs> i do not find the explanation of the noble lord the minister at all satisfactory <e> <s> he rather brushed off the reference to the national interest and to section of his governments own act of <e>", "<cs> we are not sensitive at all <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord cockfield for the very substantial concession he has offered the committee in relation to this particular aspect of the matter <e> <s> it rather seems to <e>", "<cs> your lordships will be aware that this bill was under considerable discussion in another place and so far it has gone through second reading and part of its committee stage here <e> <s> the committee well knows that the amendments so far made or proposed in committee by the government and their supporters vastly exceed those put up by her majestys opposition and by the liberal and social democratic parties in this house <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord cannot have it both ways <e> <s> either the matter is as the noble lord stated of some significance and this was the way the noble and learned lord conveyed it to the committee an important statement or it is not important <e> <s> if it is important it does not defy either the great departments of state or their parliamentary counsel to be able to incorporate the appropriate qualifications and clarity into the bill <e> <s> the noble and learned lord only has himself to blame or his department if the bill is so ambiguous or it leaves so much grey area that it has to be clarified at a later stage by an important statement <e> <s> this is not a very courteous way to treat your lordships committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord cockfield must have heard the exchanges across the committee on this matter over the last minutes <e> <s> in view of the fact that there is a possibility that the attitude taken by his noble and learned friend to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone may affect other amendments that are down in the name of the noble lord may i ask the noble lord lord cockfield whether he would consider the advisability of asking the committee to adjourn for an hour while the government make up their mind about what they propose to do with the bill <e> <s> they are evidently in some confusion <e> <s> i think the noble lord owes it to the committee to say after due consideration with his officials and colleagues how they propose to proceed <e> <s> i suggest that he considers asking for the adjournment of the committee for an hour and then comes back to make the statement so that noble lords on all sides of the committee know exactly how we shall proceed hereafter <e>", "<cs> this bill has been in gestation for well over a year <e> <s> there has been plenty of opportunity to consider these matters <e> <s> if the noble and learned lords government had made up their minds what they were going to do the statement could be made now <e> <s> i still think that the needs of your lordships should be considered <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> i should like to be of as much assistance to the noble lord as possible <e> <s> but in view of the remarks that have fallen from the noble lord i am bound to say that the principles are not the same since the amendment proposed by the noble lord lord mottistone seems to enshrine a principle of per cent <e> <s> which has nothing to do with the amendment which we are now discussing <e> <s> we on this side do not wish to be a party to the passing of an amendment which on the face of it gives consent to the per cent <e> <s> principle <e>", "<cs> i am greatly obliged to the noble lord for his very constructive responses to the amendments that we have ventured to put down <e> <s> they show a willingness i am glad to have it confirmed that the government are sensible of the very widespread view that parliament should be more intimately involved <e> <s> we should of course like to take a look at the amendment that the noble lord proposes to introduce on report <e> <s> may i tell him how much we would appreciate it if he were constrained to adopt the affirmative procedure rather than the negative that would sweeten it for us <e> <s> but in general and certainly without in any way committing ourselves to the principle enshrined in amendment no <e> <s> in the name of the noble lord lord mottistone we appreciate the concession and i ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> may i offer the noble lord a way out of the difficulty if he is so disposed <e> <s> i suggest that he retains shall in subsection <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble and learned lord will think again <e> <s> as he says a large number of licences may be granted <e> <s> as he well knows i do not mean what he would term the key or very important licences <e> <s> but the fact that an individual licence includes an arbitration clause on the lines set out here does not mean that arbitration will arise in every case <e> <s> we have numerous forms of contract for example the riba contract in the building and construction industry <e> <s> the number of cases that go to arbitration is very small indeed <e> <s> in some agreements the institute of chartered accountants is very often designated as the arbitrator <e> <s> the amendment would not expose anybody to considerable trouble <e> <s> i think that the condition should go in the bill in order to ensure that this is accomplished <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has shown a most constructive attitude towards this amendment and the earlier one which i had the <e>", "<cs> i speak on clause stand part if only to give the noble lord an opportunity of replying to the point put by the noble lord lord weinstock <e> <s> the noble lord lord weinstock may not have been aware of the precise terms of the debate in which the point of the earlier amendment in the name of myself and my noble friends was concluded <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope that the noble and learned lord will not be in a position to give his noble friend lord morris the assurance that he requires <e> <s> otherwise we on this side of the committee will feel constrained to oppose the amendment <e>", "<cs> i trust that when the noble lord replies to this amendment he will bear in mind his observations about needs which are incorporated in the amendment and his reaction to needs when it came to consider early amendments to clause which referred to the needs of people as distinct from the demand <e>", "<cs> i read through this amendment with some amazement <e> <s> your lordships will observe that in the last four lines of the amendment it says <e>", "<cs> yes the noble viscount does in part satisfy my mind <e> <s> all i can say as one who has had some experience in the preparation and presentation of accounts is that i sincerely hope that the accounts of the other licensees to whom he referred are of the same high standard as those published by british telecom <e>", "<cs> but is the noble viscount aware that the auditors of british telecom are entrusted with a very considerable responsibility <e> <s> is the noble viscount suggesting that the accounts as audited by an extremely renowned firm of auditors whoever they may be i think that the present ones are probably likely to continue will do anything other than present a true and fair view of the affairs of british telecom as required by the companies act <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful <e> <s> would the noble viscount being a very fair-minded person as i am sure from my own personal experience of him he is support an equal insistence that mercury which will also be one of the licensees for a long time shall show the precise advantage that it obtains in financial terms so far as that is ascertainable in battening like a leech on the whole system as established by british telecom <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee would sustain the noble and learned lord in his opposition to the amendment moved by his noble friend but we find the noble and learned lords remarks far more menacing than the amendment itself <e> <s> so far as we can see at the moment and we shall have to study what he said in <e>", "<cs> i query the phrase at some length <e>", "<cs> it occurs to us that this may be a matter of interpretation of the word running and i think that the word running is nowhere defined in the bill <e> <s> but i do not see how you could run a

think he is conversant with the basic canons of monopoly business and the effect that large undertakings have both upon the price structure and on the internal battle that goes on internationally between monopolies <e>", "<cs> i am still a little mystified by the observations of the noble lord on the amendment because clause provides for the transfer of all the property rights and liabilities other than the excepted liabilities to which british telecom was entitled or was so immediately before that date which by virtue of those provisions become the property of the successor company <e> <s> the subsidiaries which are described in the amendment as wholly owned are part of the property and assets of british telecom and with the other assets automatically pass to the successor company

considerate about this amendment <e> <s> the welfare of the employees of british telecom is of enormous importance and the character of the administration to which they will be subjected by the successor company a management with which i hope they will be able to co-operate as fully as they can is a matter of enormous importance <e>", "<cs> i shall allow the noble lord to intervene presently

spread for the purposes of the successor company <e> <s> all this i understand <e> <s> what concerns me is the ownership <e>", "<cs> i should like to go on record as saying that the noble lord has not given a categorical answer to the categorical question that i put to him on at least two occasions <e> <s> however i shall return to the matter <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>",

lords in his presentation of this amendment the noble lord lord cockfield has been at his most seductive <e> <s> in point of fact he has sought to produce a reasoned explanation for overturning an amendment admittedly imperfect in its text that passed through your lordships committee with quite a substantial majority against the government on the last occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords all that i wanted to ask the noble lord i shall not detain him for as long as he has been detained from other quarters behind him on this matter is why he assumes that use of techniques must result in the production of commercial products as distinct from pure experimentation <e> <s> you can use techniques not necessarily in the production of new products but even in future research and development <e>

support this amendment <e> <s> we do not consider that the explanation given by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran needs any further explanation from us <e> <s> in fact we entirely agree with the whole line he has taken in the matter and cannot do better so we would just support it <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are a little sorry that the noble lord should take this attitude <e> <s> if the noble lord looks at the bill as a whole he will find that it has been designed specifically to protect above all the interests of the future shareholders of british telecom <e>

committee stage without withdrawal <e> <s> if this is going to be the noble lords attitude towards the employees of british telecom then i warn the noble lord that both he and his government are riding for disaster <e> <s> you can drive people so far but if you try to drive them too far beware of what will happen the british people are known to be long-suffering to be tolerant but if they try to push them over the edge the government will reap the whirlwind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very surprised that the noble lord should have taken this attitude <e> <s> one of the earlier statements made by the noble lords right honourable friend the secretary of state was to the effect that the rpi minus <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful <e> <s> the noble lord compliments me <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in his statement said that conversations were proceeding with british telecom on this and associated questions <e> <s> we are reassured to some extent that this is taking place <e> <s> we would express our agreement with the noble and learned lord in resisting the amendment put forward by the noble lord lord mottistone and his group <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be relieved that the noble and learned lord has still left this matter open for possible alterations on third reading <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was kind enough to give his motivation in bringing forward these amendments and in the process mentioned amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> according to the second marshalled list amendment no <e> <s> is now no longer there so i presume the reference is no longer required <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of your lordships may i make one rejoinder to what the noble and learned lord has said <e> <s> the noble and learned lord was given full opportunity to answer quite concisely the points i made about the application of this particular amendment to the whole question of industrial relations <e> <s> he did not give any categorical reply to that so therefore we are left with the assumption which i did hazard at the commencement of the remarks i ventured to address to your lordships that the words likely to contravene most certainly would have an application on the industrial relations scene <e> <s> this is not satisfactory to us for reasons that i will certainly not wish to repeat to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment for the insertion of the words or provisional order in the space indicated by the noble and learned lord in subsection only goes to reinforce the observations that we made concerning the earlier amendments <e> <s> it now appears that a provisional order sharpening up the whole thing will be able to be made in conditions where there is likely to be or is deemed likely to be a contravention <e> <s> we only reiterate the same remarks that we made before upon this matter and undoubtedly as the noble and learned lord will realise this whole question will have to come up again when considering later amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble and learned lord give way on one small question <e> <s> when he was replying to my noble friend he said that the duty became established from the date on which the provisional order was made <e> <s> does not the duty under the licence remain there all the time <e> <s> is not there a breach of that duty the moment that it is apprehended that a breach has in fact taken place rather than when a ruling has taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the noble and learned lords confirmation that that is the case <e> <s> i am not a member of the legal profession and my advice up to this time was that the amendment was necessary in order to protect the rights of the telecommunications trade unions <e> <s> therefore on the assurance of the noble and learned lord that that is not the case and that section of the employment act does in any case apply i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house is obliged to the noble lord for having explained this series of amendments <e> <s> one aspect troubles us a little <e> <s> it may be that technically subsection does not meet all the requirements that the noble lord has in mind but it has the advantage particularly paragraph <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way and i must apologise for interrupting him <e> <s> he did say that the office of fair trading was part of the dti <e> <s> on reflection perhaps he would like to correct that because to the best of my knowledge it is quite independent of the dti <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with very considerable interest to the remarks that have fallen from the lips of the noble lord lord orr-ewing who i gather inserted the amendment at the request of an association whose name i have forgotten for the moment but which undoubtedly is one of the important organisations seeking to make itself articulate through the admirable agency of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation and for the detail into which he has gone <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendments to the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is at his most disarming this evening <e> <s> he is so sympathetic towards us that we are almost bowled over by the consideration that he has for our feelings in these matters <e> <s> when the successor company goes into operation we shall be in a different ball game particularly about information in regard to british telecom <e> <s> noble lords will be well aware that the accounts and reports published by british telecom go far beyond <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us who have had some experience of parliamentary life are well aware of the phenomenon that if your opponent makes a speech that is very severely critical of certain aspects of the legislation that has been laid before parliament the first epithet that can be levelled against it is that it is a second reading speech <e> <s> i do not propose to make a second reading speech but i do propose to address myself to the amendment itself which relates to the operation of clause of the bill and to the date on which as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is aware the assets and liabilities save for the excepted liabilities will pass over to the successor company <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> may i just say to him as kindly as i can that not even the noble lord and all the power that he and his government can carry behind them are likely to be able to shift a professional resolve firmly held in the stock exchange and in the accountancy profession to insist on the maintenance of accounting and prospectus standards which they have always insisted upon in the past <e>", "<cs> my lords both this and the next amendment are concerned with the operation of clause which describes the procedure by which the initial government holding in the successor company is established <e> <s> the decisions here are of some importance and very considerable sums are involved <e> <s> it is not merely the issue of shares that is involved but also that of securities and securities as the noble lord knows include debentures <e> <s> under later <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most indebted to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> of course i am not asking that at this stage he should embark on more detailed explanations of the application of paragraph of schedule and various associated matters which are the subject of later amendments <e> <s> my concern here is with the magnitude of the operation that is to take place <e> <s> it is one thing to privatise an organisation or a conglomerate with assets of up to million <e> <s> it is another thing altogether to embark on the privatisation of a company or corporation which after taking credit for the excepted liabilities will have a net equity in book value terms of something approaching million <e> <s> this is a very large operation indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for the comprehensive nature of his reply <e> <s> may i tell him on behalf of those who sit on this side of the house that his explicit undertaking is fully acceptable to us <e> <s> we are quite sure that he would not have given it without complete authority to put himself in that position <e> <s> however it indicates that my anxieties concerning the actual wording of the clause had their validity for otherwise it would not have been necessary to give the undertaking <e> <s> i quite understand that the noble lord is not in a position to give us further particulars at this time not even off the cuff concerning the debentures <e> <s> this may have to wait for two or three years time when the issue becomes feasible <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most disappointed with the noble lords response <e> <s> may i point out to him that had he taken the suggestion that all these matters be brought under parliamentary control his anxieties would not have existed because parliamentary control would have secured the operation of the ratchet clause as well as the other clause so that in rejecting my suggestion that the whole thing should be brought under parliamentary control he has only contributed to the uncertainty <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and learned lord the lord advocate for the remarks he made in response to the amendment that i moved <e> <s> i think there was a slight misunderstanding between us <e> <s> my proposed insertion of a reference to subsection of section of the companies act was to remind the general public that the secretary of state himself had the same liabilities as directors under the companies act for any misleading statements that are made <e> <s> it it rather an obverse way of putting it but that was my intention <e>", "<cs> my lords i am greatly obliged to the noble lord the minister for his very full reply <e> <s> i immediately concede that what i sought to achieve by amendment no <e> <s> is in fact achieved by paragraph <e> <s> therefore the disclosure particulars are satisfactorily provided for <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this would be a convenient opportunity on behalf of my noble

the noble lord lord cockfield a series of rhetorical questions which the traditions of this house would prevent him from answering at this stage of the bill <e> <s> what i wish to do is associate myself with the remarks that he made about the very fine job of work that all members of this house have sought to do on this bill <e> <s> i have always held the view that the main function of the

corrected this particular amendment which we made <e> <s> your lordships must indeed have been getting very tired at that time of night to have allowed this one to get away <e> <s> it is quite clearly

replies <e> <s> i shall not press him very much further but there are two matters to which i should refer <e> <s> the first is that the figures i gave with regard to the loans were derived from the

main a reflection on the gross incompetence of the government in pursuing policies which outside the limited number of economic acolytes close to the prime minister are elsewhere regarded as years out of date <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer which the noble lord has seen fit to give is rather ambiguous is it not <e> <s> is he aware that any reconstruction of british airways which involves the write

were put out in the prospectus that the capital worth of british telecom based upon the forecast projections was vastly in excess of the price at which the shares were sold <e> <s> moreover your lordships were told so in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble lord provide the house with the number of individuals who originally participated in these schemes but who are now unemployed

disposed of their shares on a stag basis <e>", "<cs> my lords for the record can the noble lord confirm to the house that all the commitments contained in the conservative partys manifesto are still fully operative <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble and learned lord for having taken us briefly through the extremely complex provisions of this bill which contains no less than clauses and some nine schedules <e> <s> for our part on this side of the house we find ourselves in general support of this measure and we shall seek to facilitate its passage <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indebted to the noble lord for having repeated the statement <e> <s> it is a somewhat surprising one <e> <s> the p shares in british aerospace were yesterday quoted at per share a drop of points on the day before <e> <s> one wonders at what price the shares are going to be offered to the public <e> <s> if they are offered to the public at the same time as a new issue is raised it should be quite clear that the sale will be part of what might be conceived as a slightly watering-down situation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord clarify one or two points <e> <s> as regards the golden share may we take it that the blocking mechanism would be used in the event of a british company seeking to take over british aerospace <e> <s> if so under what circumstances and under what criteria would the government consider using it bearing in mind of course that changes in ownership are quite irrelevant to the performance of the company concerned or indeed its public activities <e>

dilution of capital taking place on the occasion of the issue of new shares and the sale of the governments own holding which i should have thought at amounts to some million <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for having given a brief statement of the working and implications of this particular order which as he correctly pointed out illuminates the relevant portions of the act of as amended by the act of which we recently discussed <e> <s> now that we have had further information and now that we have had in front of us the maps and the various intentions of the government it also affords us the opportunity to review the implications of the whole scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl is not aware of it will he kindly do the house the honour of reading working report no <e> <s> published by oecd days ago which gives the figures which even he ought to be able to understand <e>", "<cs> i must apologise for that <e> <s> i wish to make it clear that i was speaking to both amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful for the explanation which has been given by the noble lord and oddly enough for the support which has been given to the noble lord by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> perhaps i was bending over backwards to ensure that the accountancy professions did not get a monopoly of these winding-ups and i rather sought to give the noble lord a way out if he decided that on the whole solvent companies ought to be exempt from this provision <e> <s> after all last year there were members voluntary liquidations that went through quite successfully <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it was of course quite clear from the moment that this amendment was tabled that clause would be involved in this because clause is the definition clause and any reference to an associate in this particular clause of the bill would automatically draw ones mind to clause <e>", "<cs> now that we have got the amendments on this particular section of the bill out of the way i wonder whether between now and the report stage the noble lord can give consideration to other matters <e> <s> can he give consideration to including within this clause minors and people of unsound mind <e> <s> will he consider giving that some specific recommendation <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has been advised on this point and i have heard his reply <e> <s> i ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for the doubtless painstaking reading of this very long statement <e> <s> it is noteworthy that whereas the former statement about <e>", "<cs> i am most indebted to the noble lord <e> <s> my intention where i have referred in detail to some of these matters on intermediate amendments is to refrain from duplicating those remarks when it comes to discussion on amendments nos <e> <s> and in the hope that noble lords will be able to express their views freely without being inhibited by any repetition on my part <e> <s> i shall of course reserve the right in moving amendment no <e> <s> to refer briefly to some of the matters that will not be covered in detail in the arguments that i now adduce <e> <s> but the noble lord may rest assured i have already given the noble lord the assurance that in this matter i shall endeavour to expedite the progress of the bill as much as is conceivably possible <e>", "<cs> my views on this bill are well known <e> <s> i regard it as a completely non party issue <e> <s> although there may be certain questions of vital principle to which all of us should give attention i do not regard it as necessary for me on this bill to adopt a posture of adversary politics to which i am accustomed and which of course is correct within a democratic assembly <e> <s> i shall endeavour to be as brief as possible but there may be some considerations that noble lords care to bear in mind when they come to consider the rather wider amendments <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord forgive me for interrupting <e> <s> i am most grateful to him <e> <s> if i may say so it is not only a question of directors of public companies <e> <s> indeed as i think will emerge later most of the directors likely to be involved in this are in fact directors of smaller companies and private companies <e> <s> it is very rarely that precedents of this kind are going to be brought to bear in connection with a large public liability company <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for pointing out a solution to the problem which really i ought to have thought of myself <e> <s> i must apologise to the committee for not having thought more constructively about this <e> <s> it seems to me that the suggestion put forward by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter is the most sensible one in all the circumstances and on the basis which i believe to be true that if i do not move the amendments in committee it will be possible within the rules of order within the rules of your lordships house to move them on report then i think that is a much better solution to the problem and i am perfectly willing to fall in with it <e> <s> is it in order if i do that <e> <s> i am just seeking advice as to whether that is in fact possible on the report stage if i have not moved the amendments in committee <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter has brought forward a suggestion and that possibility did occur to me <e> <s> however i thought that in view of the very important issues which were going to be raised today and the number of contributions which were likely to come from your lordships in all parts of the committee it might be wise to allow a lapse of time between the committee stage and the report stage so that mature reflection could take place based on the contributions which i hope will fall from the lips of noble lords and which i shall then be able to take into account over a rather more protracted period of time as i should like to do in order to study them thoroughly <e>", "<cs> i have listened to the observations that have been made by so many of your lordships on the vexed questions raised by clause and indeed my own suggested amendment to it <e> <s> i must confess that i am a little apprehensive about the absolute certainty with which the noble and learned lord lord templeman approached the subject more particularly in view of the fact that the noble and learned lord lord denning was not quite as definite as he <e>", "<cs> i immediately accept the noble lords explanation and his undertaking and ask leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee accept the reasons that have been given by the noble lord lord benson <e> <s> it is quite unnecessary for me to repeat anything that he has said <e> <s> we entirely concur <e>", "<cs> we on this side understand that it would be quite desirable for administrative reasons to allow a reappraisal of the situation to take place in some detail before we continue further with the bill <e> <s> we on this side think that the suggestion put forward by the government chief whip is a most sensible one and for our part are disposed to agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords we noted with some interest the observations of the government chief whip in which for reasons which seemed entirely proper to him and for which i have some sympathy he declined to give the house an assurance that the recommittal of the particular clauses in <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that one of the principal misgivings that we have in connection with this can be best expressed by some doubt as to whether in fact the government have either the will or the means to deploy the full resources of the law in prosecuting fraud <e> <s> this lies at the base of it <e> <s> there are of course cases in which there is pure inadvertence and which unfortunately lead to people paying deposits for goods and not receiving them <e> <s> some of those cases happen in circumstances which do not involve fraud but there are quite a number that do <e> <s> one is permitted to doubt <e> <s> i think whether the government really have the will to deploy their resources where fraud arises <e> <s> there are numerous cases even today where there is a marked disinclination to prosecute sometimes because of under-manning in the fraud squad itself in fact in practically all cases it is due to under-manning in the fraud squad and in cases where the office of the dpp is the appropriate one undermanning and understaffing in that department <e> <s> if the government were to give your lordships an indication that regardless of cost these frauds would be pursued it would do much to reassure the committee <e>", "<cs> one of the problems to which the cork committee addressed itself was the undue power that was apprehended in the hands of a receiver for the debenture holders <e> <s> complaints were laid and complaints continue that very often receivers for the debenture holders apply themselves quite ruthlessly to the realisation of assets in order to satisfy the charge comprising the debenture with in some cases scant regard either to the future of the business itself or even the plight in which creditors further down the line might find themselves <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful to the noble lord for answering in the way that he has <e> <s> it would seem that the wording of the amendment would not achieve the purpose i had in mind <e>

thank the noble lord for his co-operative response <e> <s> the noble lord will appreciate that in a bill of this kind it is very often a little difficult to be able to devise the precise wording to achieve the result one wishes for <e> <s> but i am grateful to the noble lord for his assurance <e> <s> on the basis of that assurance i ask for the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment

amendment <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that i had it in mind to argue with the noble lord opposite concerning what ought or ought not to happen during the period for which an administration order is in force until i heard the broadside that was delivered by the noble and learned lord lord denning against whom on political issues i am willing to argue at any time but against whom on matters of law i am certainly not qualified to argue and indeed do not intend to do so <e> <s> therefore i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to intervene on this very short point <e> <s> the noble lord has been kind enough to indicate that he will be giving his detailed views on these matters <e> <s> we on this side of the committee are most anxious to avoid the necessity of putting down a whole host of amendments at the report stage <e> <s> if the noble lord could give his views as early as possible in writing to my noble friend and to myself it would help towards the further easy passage of what is after all in the party sense almost a non-controversial bill <e>", "<cs> i could not possibly dissent from the observation of the noble and learned lord lord denning about the responsibilities of the administrator to the creditors <e> <s> however surely the business of an administrator is in a way twofold because the administrator is often appointed with the object of rescuing the business in any event <e> <s> therefore he has to have regard if i may be non-legal for the moment to the normal principles governing the field of management <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has not answered to my satisfaction the objections that i have raised and the alternatives that i have put forward <e> <s> in the circumstances i think the best thing to do is to leave them for the report stage because there will be <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having at any rate accepted the point that lies behind the amendment that i

amendment <e>", "<cs> we are grateful to the noble lord for that explanation <e> <s> the amendment provides the greater flexibility which the noble lord was describing and we support it <e>", "<cs>

this bill before the committee stage was reached <e> <s> repeated representations were made in the light of this <e> <s> it was pointed out first of all that the report of the cork committee itself was a very comprehensive document full of meat would be the ordinary conversational way of describing it and that although being very largely non-controversial it proposed far-reaching changes in the law which had been virtually unchanged in many respects for about years <e> <s> in short it was pointed out that the matter was one of great complexity <e>", "<cs> it is not moved <e>", "<cs> i have already spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> i

only one <e> <s> on the basis that it extends to both i am happy to beg leave to withdraw the amendment but i should like the point clarified <e> <s> at this stage i should hate to put the committee to the inconvenience of dividing on one matter because i cannot get a satisfactory assurance <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that he will accept amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am prepared to withdraw amendments nos <e> <s> and but i should be glad if he would notify his agreement to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the committee are at the moment discussing amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s>

been carried it would have had some relevance to it <e>", "<cs> the remarks that have fallen from the lips of the noble and learned lord lord denning leave me absolutely no alternative but to unequivocally withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we concur with the amendment <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee have some sympathy with the point made by the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe

those legal practitioners who deal with insolvency and in particular by those whom we hope presently will be called qualified insolvency practitioners is well known <e>", "<cs> i do not see why in view of the extremely simple explanation which has been given by the noble earl lord selkirk this amendment cannot be accepted out of hand <e> <s> is it really necessary to go all the way back to the

selkirk for having raised the matter again <e> <s> surely the words that he now suggests are much more suitable in all the circumstances <e> <s> does not the noble and learned lord think that without further ado having had two hours of cogitation we could now agree the noble earls amendment and indeed carry it back to the previous clauses where it is relevant <e>", "<cs> subject to the noble and

clause <e> <s> in view of the brevity of our support for this matter may we make the suggestion in respect of previous amendments that for the definition of supervisory committee the phrase monitoring committee is suitable to all the circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am very disappointed to have the reaction from the noble and learned lord and also from the noble lord opposite <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords last question i have always believed that all progress comes through conflict <e> <s> consequently the use of the dialectic within the text of this particular amendment acquire the

sectional interest <e> <s> we endeavour so far as we possibly can to strike a balance between interests that are often conflicting <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will welcome the noble earls assurance contained in his reply to my question <e> <s> is the noble earl aware that in the report specific mention was made of the refusal of the commission to account for in its accounts some billion of losses in connection with the storage of surplus stocks together with storage costs of over billion which represents nearly billion of british contribution out of the pocket of the british taxpayer <e> <s> will the noble earl give the house an assurance that her majestys government will pay very serious attention to this matter because it is not right that the accounts of the commission should be of a standard lower than is normally acceptable within the commercial community <e>", "<cs> it would be a very bold non-lawyer who would dare to dissent from the noble and learned lord lord denning on a point of this kind but with respect i cannot help feeling that the noble and learned lord misunderstood the purport of what i said <e> <s> i am not seeking in any way to take away from the right of the lessor to exert to the full his rights under the lease save in one particular specified instance where the lease provides that the lease itself is void by virtue of the person going bankrupt and in this case the appointment of an office-holder in his place puts him in an equivalent position then as against the office-holder or any form of receiver this should be void <e>", "<cs> i note with some wry amusement the arguments that are brought forward against the amendment which suggest that it is not a good amendment because it does not amend other parts <e> <s> that seems to indicate that if the amendment had been wider in its concept and had applied to bodies other than corporate bodies then it would have been acceptable <e> <s> i do not propose to make heavy weather of this <e> <s> i was trying to be helpful to her majestys government though there is no reason why i should continue my endeavours on their behalf if they are so ungrateful for them <e> <s> in those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord lord monson was

impossible <e> <s> you cannot within the time stipulated always find the particulars for which the noble lord is asking <e> <s> it is manifestly impossible <e> <s> i have known of cases going on for a period of three months and where it would be quite impracticable to produce the particulars that are set out here <e> <s> for example there are the occupations of creditors <e> <s> dear oh dear <e>

those circumstances i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have just one question to ask the noble and learned lord before responding to the statement that he has just made which i must say must be welcomed in all quarters of your lordships house <e> <s> the effect of the amendment that was moved by the noble lord lord noel-buxton is not only upon crown preference but by its very text eliminates from schedule any mention of rates <e> <s> therefore the passing of the noble lords amendment would mean that rate preference would go as well <e> <s> the noble and learned lord did

that of rates <e> <s> it would enable further consideration to be given to it by your lordships <e>", "<cs> at paragraph of the cork report we are reminded <e>", "<cs> we on these benches support this amendment <e> <s> it arises of course from the experience of the noble lord lord meston and indeed many of us that the proceedings in order to establish any liability by the director very often take a

standards here <e> <s> for the purpose of assessing what is a reasonable rate of return they are adopting the current cost accounting principle which is exactly the same principle that they adopted

lord said in regard to the clause <e> <s> it is quite clear that clause now would serve no useful purpose <e> <s> as the noble lord said in his remarks earlier the existing provisions that are

is able to provide this evening it may well be that the process of putting down amendments at report stage can be simplified that may be so the more informative the noble lord is able to be now <e>",

majestys government in not initiating a complete debate on the complete cork report itself <e> <s> it is quite clear that by selective quotations from the cork report either for or against any particular course of action one can adduce very powerful and logical arguments <e> <s> the noble lords reply reminded me of minestrone soup <e> <s> there was everything in it bar the kitchen stove <e>

regulations and the legislation which are referred to in this report and to which the noble lord has already referred went through both houses of parliament <e> <s> are we to assume that parliament approved regulations and approved restrictions for the good of society the good of society still matters to some of us the good of the whole society which were in themselves completely unnecessary at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his reply may i ask him whether when giving consideration to the matters raised in this most important report the government will take note <e>", "<cs> but my lords can the noble lord be a little more forthcoming than that <e> <s> in view of the urgent matters raised in this report when is due time <e> <s> how long will it be before her majestys government are able to announce to either house of parliament or to both houses or to the world at large exactly what is their own positive attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that he has had no formal responses from the building industry <e> <s> is he not aware that the building industry in its entirety has been almost unanimous in saying that the governments proposals are inhibiting that industry to the tune of roughly million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords now that the draft budget of the community for has been <e>", "<cs> may i <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the government chief whip has to say <e> <s> on reflection he may find that he has been overcome a little by the exuberance of his own verbosity <e>", "<cs> what i have been trying to do does the noble earl lord gowrie wish to say something <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl <e> <s> i shall take the opportunity of reminding him of that on a suitable occasion <e> <s> all i have been doing is trying to protect the government from the consequences of their own folly <e> <s> i get no thanks for this at all <e> <s> i perform this service entirely for the benefit of the government in the hope that they are sufficiently open minded occasionally to admit the possibility that they might be wrong <e>", "<cs> i did <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his most courteous and detailed reply <e> <s> i agree entirely with him that on the report becoming available it would be open to the government either to accept its recommendations in whole or in part or to reject them <e> <s> the important point about the report is that it would be a public document and it would be one against which the public would be able to judge <e>", "<cs> i am very relieved that eventually after reading something which had no relevance at all to the amendment the noble lord got down to the amendment itself <e> <s> i completely understand that the government are not intellectually capable of putting themselves into the position which this amendment seeks to put them in of thinking what the state of affairs would have been <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that this is quite elementary in business <e> <s> if he will consult with his business colleagues who are well familiar with the process of preparing cash flows on certain assumptions he will understand <e> <s> however the noble lord is apparently determined not to understand the amendment <e> <s> i deeply sympathise but i am merely trying to be helpful to him as many of his noble friends will be able to tell him afterwards <e> <s> what i said was perfectly reasonable and what i am asking for is even more reasonable <e> <s> i am only trying to help the noble lord <e> <s> he should not be so injured by it <e> <s> i really cannot understand it <e>", "<cs> in order to allow the government time to study the amendment i ask the leave of the committee to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell the house whether it is within the terms of remit of eurocontrol to publish the basis upon which air navigation charges are made <e> <s> if it is within its remit will he take steps to ensure that these are made public so that we can see exactly what is going on in this regard <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to press the noble lord further but is there any real valid reason why these matters should not be made public <e> <s> we cannot possibly determine the reasonableness of what is being done unless the various parliaments are aware of what in fact occurs <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that this country was in trade deficit with the soviet union in to the tune of million and that the average per annum over the last five years is a minus of million per annum <e> <s> does he not think that in all the circumstances it might be wise if a delegation from england and perhaps wales went over at the same time as a delegation from scotland in order that the trade between our two countries may be considerably increased on the lines proposed by president gorbachev <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the total expenditure envisaged under this head referred to by my noble friend lord hatch of lusby is approximately one-third of the amount that the japanese government paid in order to secure a contract for the bosporus bridge for their own companies <e>", "<cs> my lords we on these benches wish to thank the noble earl lord shannon for having introduced this debate <e> <s> we should like to join with him in extending our support to the excellent efforts that have been made and which will of course still be made by sir

me in that connection may i also say that i had a fairly protracted experience on the production line too <e>", "<cs> my lords on the basis that the noble lord admits that the interference by his own government inhibits private enterprise would not the noble lord advise his government to get off the countrys back and get out <e>", "<cs> my lords i find it difficult not to respond to an invitation

reached in the courts that the unauthorised removal of a film from a cinema for the purpose of piracy is not an offence of some kind <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be grateful to the noble lord for having repeated the statement made in another place <e> <s> it is quite clear from the statement and of course a number of matters are not yet clear that the government are in very urgent need of

lords will the noble lord please answer the question which i put to him <e> <s> i asked whether he would confirm that when the issue was complete the institutions and by institutions i mean those defined on page of the last accounts will hold over per cent <e> <s> of the equity and that the staff will hold under per cent <e> <s> of the total equity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his statement that the appreciation in the value of the shares since the flotation has been due to its privatisation is a lot of nonsense and that the change of ownership has had no effect in that regard <e> <s> is not the reason why the shares have appreciated because the issue was grossly under-priced <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that as a result of that the exchequer has been deprived of well over million and that had the government been the directors of a private company they would by this time have found themselves prosecuted under the companies act <e>", "<cs> my lords when the noble lord says that this is a matter in which we must proceed in line with our european partners is he saying that there is no virtue any more in competition <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that successive governments have not taken any account of the additionality principle as laid down by the commission and have in fact determined their own expenditure on the basis of what contributions were coming from the community in one form or another will the noble lord give the house an assurance that if the amounts received from the community are rather less than that for which the government budgeted when fixing their own expenditure the government will increase the expenditure by the amount by which the contributions from the ec fall short of the originally anticipated total <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that his notification that certain items will be on the next agenda of the council of ministers concerned with consumer affairs is not really very encouraging <e> <s> is the noble lord also aware that in another field the freedom to establish insurance services other than life assurance in various parts of the community has been on the agenda for the last years without any successful resolution and indeed has been on the agenda during successive british holders of the presidency <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the loss of confidence in the government to which my noble friend lord taylor of blackburn referred is now evidently shared by quite a number of the governments own supporters in another place would it not be far better to suspend the whole operation of privatisation which is quite irrelevant to the countrys needs and adds nothing at all to its output <e> <s> would it not be far better to abandon the whole silly and ridiculous programme <e>", "<cs> my lords what is a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side are grateful to the noble lord for having given an explanation of this order <e> <s> perhaps i may say at the outset that the information the noble lord has given your lordships house is somewhat more extensive than that given by the government in another place when discussing this order before the standing committee concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only two short questions to ask the noble lord <e> <s> the noble lord assured us that during the current year the constraints imposed by the budget will be adhered to <e> <s> can we therefore have his assurance that there will be no supplementary budget in respect of the current year and in respect of demand-led expenditure in the agricultural guarantee section <e> <s> can we have that undertaking and can he also assure us following what he said that it will now be subject to strict cash limits because that is what budgetary constraint ultimately means <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> since the government office was aware at the latest by am today of the existence and text of the manuscript amendment i am at a loss to understand why it took until the afternoon to reach the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes i have already apologised to your lordships about this matter and if necessary i shall repeat it <e> <s> unlike some i am always prepared to admit when i make a mistake and once again i am very sorry for it <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that in the field of financial control her majestys government have already surrendered the right to veto under article of the fontainebleau agreement where majority rule now has to be applied <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord

included in the community budget for or any payments under this head <e> <s> will he give some further indication of any amount that may have been earmarked for the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords for the convenience of the house will the noble lord consider publishing details of those proposals that still remain outstanding together with an indication of what action the government propose to take upon them <e> <s> in the meantime is he aware that many of us on this side of the house welcome the sudden access of wisdom that has led to the u-turn and the decision not to proceed with the nationalised industries board and express the hope that that will be the first of many u-turns over the next months <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house thank the noble lord for his explanation <e> <s> no words of mine are required in amplification and we support the amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the governments well-known history in a number of fields of intervention in the affairs of public boards that are ultimately responsible to the government could the noble lord say whether he has had any consultations with british rail about the subject matter of this question <e> <s> and could he say what advice the government gave to british rail on this matter in view of the very considerable social implications of the action taken <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are most grateful to the noble lord lord thorneycroft for having introduced the motion and particularly for doing so in such pleasant terms <e> <s> his remarks were not entirely devoid of the odd political crack that we have come to expect from him <e> <s> he did permit himself of the remark in one of his more controversial moments that the original idea of the labour party was if it moves nationalise it <e> <s> i can perhaps reply to that by saying from our point of view that if it moves well then the policy of the party opposite is to privatise it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is something over which they have no control <e> <s> if the noble lord is putting forward the capitalisation of some remote and ultimate interest in pension funds before he starts getting too definite about that he should consult his right honourable friend the minister for social services who at the moment is playing hell with the whole pension system in any event <e> <s> there is no security in that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the noble lord would not care for that very much but he made the definite statement to which i reply <e>", "<cs> my lords i note that the noble lord has described my remarks as irrelevant <e> <s> if they were irrelevant there is no reason why he should be stung like lightning into a response <e> <s> i am quite willing for the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> will the noble lord concede that cleaning is also part of the care of the patient <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house an assessment of his views as to the depth of differences that may divide certain members of the community <e> <s> are the differences on questions of principle or are they merely matters which after the lapse of perhaps a few weeks can be satisfactorily sorted out <e> <s> in short is there broad agreement with no basic difference between the members of the community on the proposals which have been put forward by the commission <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord confirm that our trade deficit with czechoslovakia for was slightly over million <e> <s> has his department drawn the attention of british industry to any specialist fields which the ministry itself thinks ought to be pursued more vigorously by industrialists in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords whatever the anomalies in the existing laws relating to sunday opening will the noble lord bear in mind that there is a very large number of anomalies in all legislation <e> <s> will he also bear in mind that whatever may be the anomalies in this particular regard they have at least secured a degree of serenity on sunday and many of us would regret it if that were impinged upon <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that the figure of per job given by my noble friend is substantially correct and that these are genuine jobs which therefore are likely to last for some time will the noble lord draw his ministers attention to the necessity for a very wide extension of government creative intervention in these matters by greatly extending the job creation scheme <e> <s> it seems does it not that the treasury is going to make money <e> <s> it will cost far less to create genuine jobs than the cost of unemployment itself <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are obliged to the noble lord for having introduced the bill in the way that he has <e> <s> the noble lord said that this is very largely an enabling bill and that it will be followed by a whole series we were not told how many of regulations in amplification of its basic provisions <e> <s> this house does not like legislation of this kind particularly where the regulations by statutory instrument are subject to the negative procedure <e> <s> it much prefers the affirmative procedure which on questions of principle gives rather greater opportunities both for notice of the items coming up and also for debating rather more widely <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> he implied in what he has just said that in the main this was a matter for lloyds themselves to resolve through their own disciplinary and financial procedures <e> <s> is he aware that the matter has been referred to the director of public prosecutions <e> <s> it is a question of when a decision will be made by the dpp as to what should be done <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that it would be of great assistance to the house and to the city community at large if his

chancellor is prepared to stick to through thick and thin instead of varying it whenever it suits his purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that under the treaties the commission itself is charged with interpretation of ec law would it not be unfortunate if in the event of the commission itself drawing up a regulation to eliminate restrictive practices in the european airways business the council of ministers decided to overthrow that decision <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl then confirm formally that the fixing of arbitrary cash limits is in the final analysis the essence of the governments wages policy <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord aware that the assurances given by his noble friend lord cockfield in the course of the debate on the bill relating to british telecom were sufficiently favourable to secure the wholehearted support of his noble friend lord orr-ewing to the entire privatisation measure <e> <s> therefore the assurances must have been very firm <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that the anxieties that have been expressed today and which have been expressed over the past few weeks are only an illustration of how effectively when british telecom was accountable to the public it was possible for british telecom to play a part in support of british industry similar to that played in japan germany and france <e> <s> in the circumstances will the noble lord see his right honourable friend the prime minister to ask whether she will apply the same degree of pressure to british telecom to comply with the national interest as she did recently in the case of courtaulds where an unemployment situation arose in wrexham <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps on reflection the noble lord will consider revising somewhat his downgrading of two famous british companies gec and plessey whose workers and management have contributed significantly to the development of the electronics and telecommunications industry in this country <e> <s> are we to be given to understand that it is money power overseas in the large conglomerates that will feature largely in government considerations on these matters <e>", "<cs> so what my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has just made a most extraordinary statement on what we must assume is official government policy towards plessey and gec <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord think that in the existing climate for british manufacturing industry which has been so seriously damaged by government policies it lies in his mouth in effect to denigrate two leaders in the field in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords in those circumstances and in view of the fact that the house would not wish to continue the discussion of such an important matter at question time i put the government on notice that this matter will be raised in full debate in order that the elucidation that the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that in an answer to his noble friend he placed a figure on the

activities in which these teams have been engaged with reference to particular areas <e> <s> does the noble lord not agree that that may be helpful to your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware if only for the avoidance of doubt that we on this side very much support any effort that is made by her majestys government whether in collaboration with a development corporation or with a local authority to increase employment in this country <e> <s> the fact that they have only just made a modest beginning in this respect which we hope will be <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this

development service as set out in this amendment <e> <s> it may not be as good as the amendment i have just moved but at any rate it is a step on the way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has not replied to any of the arguments that have been advanced from this box and therefore there is no point in detaining the house further <e> <s> i am quite content to allow the matter to rest on the record in the hope that tomorrow if this matter is of some interest your lordships may read the speech of the noble earl my speech and those of my noble friends <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two short questions to ask the noble earl but if he does not find it convenient to answer them now perhaps he would care to write to me <e> <s> will he inform us of the form and composition of the audit committees that he has mentioned and their terms of reference <e> <s> will he also give the assurance that there will be complete facility for interchange of views between the audit committees and the auditors of the bank itself <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware as the noble viscount lord st davids reminded him that it is vitally necessary to retain the goodwill of tourists coming to this country <e> <s> while it may be good commercial practice never knowingly to undercharge it is of vital importance that the actions of a minority in this country in not giving a fair deal to the tourists should be stamped on as firmly as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble baroness give the house the governments views as to the situation that arises when a person with diplomatic immunity incurs civil debt in respect of goods supplied and then declines to pay the bill or to settle the account <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his most informative reply <e> <s> is he not aware that the unresolved scandals of have still to be attended to <e> <s> is it not also clear that

very wide sections of members of lloyds in london will the noble lord please see to it that the relevant documents and in particular the price waterhouse report and the report by sir peter green are made public <e> <s> therefore instead of being able to judge matters on leaked reports people will know exactly what is happening in what appears to be a highly privileged institution <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the noble lord aware that the underwriting syndicates concerned for a number of years have been in breach of section of the act <e> <s> is he also aware that the auditors of the syndicate were drawn from a list specifically approved by lloyds as a precondition for their appointment <e> <s> will the noble lord at least consider the appointment of auditors who are subject not to the authority of lloyds but to the authority of his own department <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl answer the question as to whether it is the intention of the government to ensure that there is no loss falling on public funds either directly on the government or indirectly on the bank of england <e> <s> also will he answer the question as to whether it will be insisted upon that no loss is occasioned on the sale back to the private sector of jmb <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble earls attention been drawn to the views of <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are grateful to the noble lord lord grimond for having given us the opportunity of discussing this motion tonight which is essentially concerned as the unstarred question on the order paper makes quite clear with the promotion of the interests of the individual shareholders and by implication

order paper make it quite unnecessary indeed i would not wish to do so to enlarge on the economic significance of the big city institutions the way they benefit the country the way that they operate the degree of essentiality that they have to the economy as a whole <e> <s> the comprehensive nature of the speech of the noble lord lord grimond with which i very largely agree enables me to avoid if only in the interests of time dealing with the matters with which he dealt so very clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i accept the point which the noble lord has made <e> <s> we shall have to wait until the figures are available to show the degree of stagging that has taken place <e> <s> but the noble lord will be well aware that in previous privatisation issues the stagging rate has been roughly per cent <e> <s> of the original applications <e> <s> i do not know what is the stagging rate in the case of british telecom but i should imagine in view of the very lush profits that became immediately available there would be quite large numbers of investors who would be only too happy to get a profit <e> <s> but even so even on the assumption that they are all new shareholders it is quite clear that the individual investor in this country the individual shareholder is a minority of the population not that they are not important as i shall endeavour to show <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that before the privatisation bills are formulated in respect of those industries which for some obscure reason the government wish to privatise it would be better to have a debate on the whole question of the consumer councils in the industries affected <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that we had some difficulties during the passage of the british telecom bill where the position of the consumer councils was not made clear until well after the bill had been published and debated <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the very worthy sentiments that he has just uttered in practice affect manufacturing industry only <e> <s> is he further aware that in fact one of the difficulties in negotiating satisfactory reductions in tariff barriers is the protectionist agricultural policy in europe which has forced up prices to the consumer and which is one of the principal reasons why it is impossible for the noble lord to do anything other than give ground when it comes to ordinary manufacturing industry trade imports and exports in this country <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true as the noble lord the minister said that this order has been before the joint committee of both houses and that in its view the special attention of either house is not to be directed towards it <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for his reply <e> <s> in the first part he dealt with some of the safeguards including for example the public accounts committee and the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> of course i accept that <e> <s> the only thing

charges to residential and small business users for calls will go up and that is a result of exactly the factor he has mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords is not part of the trouble that under the treaties the commission is entrusted with the task of interpreting the treaties and that according to the commission air transport is specifically excluded from the competition articles within the treaties <e>

neutrality as between the consumer councils on the one hand and the industries on the other <e> <s> surely the noble lord will agree that when all logic all right and all justice lie on the side of the consumer councils on particular issues it might not be too much to expect that her majestys government exercise a little pressure on behalf of the consumer councils <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that in his answer to the noble lord lord grimond he said what these public bodies must do <e> <s> is he aware that government policy on this matter has already been enunciated in this house by the noble earl lord gowrie who said that it was government policy that the price of electricity should rise by per cent <e> <s> above the rate of inflation <e> <s> if the noble lord will consult the records he will find that that is absolutely correct <e> <s> will the noble lord give the house an assurance that no special levy will be laid either on the national gas authority or on

to move amendments nos <e> <s> a b and c to which i shall speak together <e> <s> the purpose of these amendments is to take steps to establish common standards <e> <s> your lordships will be aware

however they will be taken into account by different bodies with different standards <e>", "<cs> my lords to pursue that point a little further may i ask the noble lord a question as to whether he considered the fusion of the joint interests of the four inns of court which operated quite separately at one time with each qualified to be a recognised body into one organisation was or was not a desirable thing <e> <s> this involves exactly the same principle <e> <s> this is exactly why one body was established to incorporate the interests of the four inns of court and that happened a long

that the removal of exchange controls in itself was not such a valid factor <e> <s> what i am concerned with and what was clearly revealed in evidence before the select committee of your lordships house is the very substantial rise of interest rates from per cent <e> <s> in may to around per cent <e> <s> later on in that year which caused an influx of money into this country that had to be re-lent <e> <s> the influx itself together with the growing production of north sea oil helped to force up that rate of exchange to an unacceptable height <e> <s> that very severely inhibited our competitiveness <e> <s> moreover it had its side effects in the united kingdom <e> <s> from the point of view of the chancellor of the exchequer it was extremely advantageous because the rate of exchange encouraged imports into this country at a price with which it was virtually impossible for many manufacturing firms in the united kingdom to compete <e> <s> hence there was the spate of

astonishing in view of the vacillation and the conflicting statements that have been made both here and in another place concerning these various competitive offers <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the truthful way in which to answer the question put to him by his noble friend lord soames is to say quite frankly that the governments final decision and their u-turn took place immediately following representations by conservative members of parliament in the west midlands to the chairman of the conservative party the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster mr tebbit who then decided that the political interest lay in the direction of the decision which the government then reached <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the ministers endeavour to prove that the essence of my noble friends question is not a matter that he would like to answer will he now proceed to answer quite factually the question <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that most of the local enterprise boards have proved themselves to be very successful and are in the governments terms highly cost-effective in creating new jobs in the areas covered by them will not the government consider giving active financial support on the ground of pure cost-effectiveness to those boards which have shown as a matter of experience that they can create jobs at far lower cost than some of the other enterprises that have the support of the noble lords department <e>", "<cs> my lords why should support taper off <e> <s> if the enterprise boards are so successful surely the government should seize the opportunity with both hands to stimulate employment in their localities albeit in agreement with private <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of those more favourable developments does the noble lord

in <e>", "<cs> my lords although i appreciate the positive news that the noble lord is able to give us will he take the opportunity at some time of reminding some hotels and particularly those in

leave to ask the first question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord realise that the existence of the international tin council and indeed the validity of its corporate entity depends upon the degree of integrity of the member governments comprising it <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that the default of most of the members of the international tin council has left the british creditors of the itc in a very sorry condition a condition in which owing to the terms of the statutory instrument granting the immunities there are three kinds of creditor the first a series of creditors who arrived at private agreements with the itc agreeing to a waiver of their immunity the second those who had concluded a contract subject to arbitration and the third unsecured creditors <e> <s> is the noble lord aware that owing to the refusal of the government to eliminate the immunity the provisions of the insolvency act relating to the fair distribution of assets among creditors has ceased to have any effect whatever <e> <s> what do the government intend to do to redress the unfairness that has arisen <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble

to ask the second question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that the industry itself will gain but little comfort from his statement which restricts any aid that may be required to the operation of the appropriate industry acts <e> <s> is he also aware that what is required in this instance is a substantial injection of funds in order to maintain the employment of over people in this industry which is vital to cornwall and so as to save the government approximately million a year in expenditure on relief which would otherwise be paid to those people <e>", "<cs> my lords we for our part would like to offer our felicitations to the noble lord on having piloted this bill through so smoothly <e> <s> we noted with some anticipation that the

himself in what he said previously beyond where he wanted to go <e> <s> if the committees recollection agrees with mine he said that in the event of the director general being dismissed on grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour he would have a legal remedy in the courts against the minister <e> <s> will the noble lord confirm that he said that and that that is the case <e> <s> will he also say what grounds the director general would have for bringing such a case before the courts <e>", "<cs> the noble lord rejected the amendments that were put forward by the noble lord lord diamond in his unsuccessful attempts to get some clarity on the phrase incapacity or misbehaviour <e> <s> indeed he sought further explanations when he tried further to clarify what the government themselves meant

particular act that he cited <e> <s> will he inform the committee under which schedule for income tax purposes his emoluments will be assessed <e> <s> because schedule e concerns emoluments from employment <e> <s> will the person be employed or not <e> <s> if he is employed and his salary is assessed under schedule e that surely makes him an employee and therefore brings him within the act

flexibility <e> <s> there has been some flexibility in the privatised industries <e> <s> one finds for example that sir george jefferson of british telecom somewhat surprisingly immediately the

in the bill <e> <s> there is now no difference in principle between us <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord has found it necessary to respond in that fashion <e>", "<cs> we on this side would like to support the amendment that has been moved by the noble lord lord diamond <e> <s> when the successor company takes over and the successor company will be the company to whom the authorisation

the meaning of a clause or a subsection and the reason the amendment was put down in the first place was to afford the government an opportunity of explaining what subsection meant <e> <s> i now raise it formally on the question whether the clause stand part so that before we part with the clause we can have an explanation of just what subsection means <e> <s> that is all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord

proposed authorisation which is being authorised to gas suppliers and which contains the formula in which an interest rate is used as part of the formula in certain circumstances <e> <s> the specified rate under the definition clause of the particular condition contained in the authorisation is quoted to mean the average of the treasury bill discount rate expressed as an annual percentage intrest rate published weekly by the bank of england during the period in respect of which the calculation falls to be made <e> <s> would there be any objection in principle to adopting that as a base with the addition of a specific percentage which bankers are sometimes constrained to pay as an extra amount above the discount rate itself <e>", "<cs> it is published weekly <e>", "<cs> may i ask the

conditions exist i would have no objection to a special clause or provision in the bill dealing with that specific case <e> <s> i object to the generality of the whole provision being destroyed simply

ohagan has raised it because the act of accession was passed and as was said was approved by a majority in the subsequent referendum on the specific undertaking which will become the subject of a later amendment which i hope will be discussed resolutely when we arrive at it on the basis that any british national interest was fully protected <e> <s> the act was passed and confirmed in exactly on the basis that the national interest would always be protected by the veto <e> <s> that is the difference between then and now because now we have the experience that the veto is useless <e>",

ministers as in the case of this particular bill did not notify parliament in advance <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble baroness may feel constrained to answer in greater detail the points that have been made by the noble lord lord tranmire <e> <s> it is quite clear from the reading of the report of the select committee that the final report although it deals to some extent with the adequacy of

case that the recent increases in the interest rate will do nothing at all to relieve the rate of inflation and that on the contrary the recent increases will tend to exacerbate the growing deficit on

clean as to whether or not the government accept the principle of additionality <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has expressed the governments satisfaction <e> <s> are he and his noble friends satisfied with a situation in which this country finds itself with an increasing trade deficit presently running at over billion a year <e> <s> is he genuinely satisfied with a situation in which in

percentages which cover totally different categories <e> <s> can the minister not give us precise answers to precise questions in the house <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are well aware from

countries of europe including as the noble and learned lord lord hailsham pointed out our own but also third countries <e> <s> in these circumstances will the noble lord explain why both the dti and

the noble lord inform the house whether his noble friend lord young of graffham who answered a question on this subject on th july his department and the treasury have been able to identify the

perhaps a spokesman should convey her fury about such a development <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those who sit on these benches and i am sure on behalf of all members of your lordships house wherever they sit i should like first to congratulate the noble earl lord caithness on his timely <e>", "<cs> i am sorry the chief secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the statement that he has just made that three-quarters of the deficit is due to the importation of goods and investment is grossly inaccurate and should be withdrawn <e> <s> is he further aware that the correct figures were those which i gave in the course of the debate on the finance bill on th july which remain uncorrected as brought up to date by the noble baroness lady seear <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that although the united kingdom receives some billion by way of income from investments from overseas during the same period it also paid out some billion in respect of assets

majestys government accept full responsibility for it <e>", "<cs> my lords further to the question put by the noble lord lord ezra are the government able to give any explanation of why the ratio of personal savings to personal disposable incomes has declined from a norm of somewhere between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> of disposable income to per cent <e> <s> in the latest quarter <e>

adversely upon the governments policies it is now standard government practice to seek a change in the basis upon which those figures are compiled <e> <s> is there not evidence for that for example in the th amendment that is now to be made to the definition of unemployment <e> <s> is it not the case that the government of the present day spend far more time departmentally and ministerially on fiddling the figures than on dealing with the problems to which the statistics relate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has indicated in his first reply that the interest rate rises were necessary to protect the strength of the economy <e> <s> will he explain how this is accomplished <e> <s> when his government first came into office in they hiked interest rates up to per cent <e> <s> produced a rate of inflation of per cent <e> <s> a rise from per cent <e> <s> and thereafter precipitated one of the worst depressions that we have had in this country <e> <s> will the noble lord explain how the rise in interest rates will protect the economy <e> <s> to which is he referring <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that it is not the responsibility of the inland revenue but of the taxation statute itself by virtue of which this state of affairs has been in operation since the fiscal year when the composite rate was first introduced <e> <s> it was clearly stated at that time by the government that the tax would not be repayable <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware that the question put by his noble friend the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter related exlusively to bank interest and that therefore i was quite correct in saying that that part did not come into operation until the fiscal year <e>", "<cs> my lords on the assumption that the replies given by the noble earl today are taken in conjunction with those he gave previously and that they represent the collective policy of the government including that of the prime minister in the interests of free speech will he give the prime minister the opportunity to explain after due consultation with sir alan walters exactly what she meant when she said you cant buck the market <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble earl believes that the tax reforming zeal of his noble friend lord boyd-carpenter needs encouragement will he consider asking his right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer to amend the existing tax law <e> <s> under the current arrangements executives earning million a year are enabled so to arrange their affairs that they pay no tax <e>", "<cs> my lords has the noble lords attention been drawn to an interview given to <e>", "<cs> my lords we are most grateful to the noble earl for having made a long and detailed statement <e> <s> obviously we should like to have time to consider it in greater detail before passing judgment upon it <e> <s> as i listened to the noble earls concluding remarks i very much doubted whether he was living in this world <e> <s> so far as he is concerned there has been an economic miracle which seems to have eluded the perception of the great bulk of the people in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the matter some thought <e> <s> i have already used well over per cent <e> <s> of the time that i propose to take <e> <s> i propose to treat with contempt the forecast section of the governments statement <e> <s> it

require us to abolish this frontier requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords for our part and on behalf of the majority of your lordships i should like to join in the tributes that have been paid to the noble lord lord kearton and his committee for the very thorough report that has been produced <e> <s> no greater tribute could have been paid to the report than the fact that the variety of views expressed
