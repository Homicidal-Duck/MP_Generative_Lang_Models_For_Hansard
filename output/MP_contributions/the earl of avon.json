["<cs> my lords i should like to join in supporting the government on the motion and to speak to the second part of the subject namely to strengthen our contribution to the nato alliance <e> <s> i have recently been appointed a delegate to the north atlantic assembly and many of my remarks will be based upon facts which i gathered at their last meeting <e> <s> nato is in need of encouragement not only with words but with action to suit the words <e> <s> it is my belief that europe owes the last years of peace within its boundaries to nato <e> <s> it is also my belief that peace within europe can continue if nato is properly supported <e> <s> there is not too much need to worry about which side has too many of one missile or too few of the other <e> <s> i agree with the admirable speech of the noble and gallant lord lord hill-norton <e> <s> the amount of personnel on both sides is vital and of course we are falling behind <e> <s> it is the readiness to defend which is the deterrent <e> <s> a common purpose and a declared determination for preparedness of all nato countries is so vital <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been my shall i say <e> <s> privilege to follow the noble lord lord wigg quite constantly in this house sometimes on gambling and sometimes on defence <e> <s> if i may i should like to return rather to our reserve army and leave the battles of the world to others <e> <s> it might interest the noble lord lord wigg to recall that the birth of the territorial army after the war was really in when conscription ended because up until that time people were drafted into the territorial army and the real volunteer force started only in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord lauderdale for introducing this short debate today and i am happy to follow the noble lord lord hinton of bankside in virtually everything he said <e> <s> the debate is very timely because today constant attention and discussion are needed to remind everyone of the need to conserve energy on both a personal and an industrial basis and also for pressures to be kept up on all governments be they north atlantic african south american far eastern in fact world-wide for the need for co-ordinated policies towards this end <e> <s> i should like to concentrate my brief remarks on the international scene for i believe that an international group very much on the lines put forward by my noble friend lord lauderdale for this country is needed to co-ordinate a policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not attempt to follow the noble lord lord shinwell in his discussion with his fellow peer on the other side of the house but i hope that he will approve of some of the things i am going to say <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in welcoming the presentation of the defence estimates <e> <s> like my noble friend lord cathcart i too would encourage wider publicity of the document even to producing a shortened version for general circulation <e> <s> i understand that a shortened version has been produced in some other languages <e> <s> perhaps we could have a shortened version in english too <e> <s> i believe it is vital to the health of the country that every possible effort is made to educate people in the need for defence in the value of our defence and its importance for the survival of our country <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment delayed publication of revised proposals for a wildlife and countryside bill in order to consider and develop new ideas put forward during consultations <e> <s> in august he published the major part of the promised information paper on nature conservation and also a paper inviting comments on new proposals concerning public rights of way <e> <s> these were followed in september by an information paper on the problem of bulls in fields and public paths <e> <s> copies of these papers have been placed in the library of this house <e> <s> my right honourable friend intends to make a further statement about other countryside matters <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i thank the noble lord for three thank yous first to myself secondly to the people who produce the bill and thirdly to the department down at bristol <e> <s> to answer the supplementary questions my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment intends to introduce the wildlife and countryside bill as soon as parliamentary time permits <e> <s> we are well aware of the closing date for april next year <e> <s> i cannot promise anything more than that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his kind words <e> <s> my lords i cannot at the moment speculate in which house the bill will commence <e>", "<cs> my lords we certainly take note of what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendations in the strutt report were mainly of a non-statutory nature <e> <s> the government have already endorsed its central proposal that as resources allow the agricultural development and advisory service should extend its existing knowledge of environmental matters and develop its capacity to provide guidance to farmers on conservation <e> <s> the report has no specific implications for the proposed wildlife and countryside bill <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord mansfield explained to the house on th august that some of the savings achieved by reducing the administrative burden on adas staff would be used to increase the services <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give the noble lord every confidence that there will be no cutting back at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody could possibly deny my noble friends assertion <e>", "<cs> once again my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his kind remarks <e> <s> i am also grateful <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords i am aware of the urgency which the noble lord expressed <e> <s> i hope he will bear in mind that we have moved very fast during august and september <e> <s> i cannot promise because of parliamentary time more than that but i think he will find that the signs are that we are moving fast and i am sure that will be continued <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his kind remarks my lords <e> <s> perhaps we should leave the problem of foxes until we come to the wildlife and countryside bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his kind remarks <e> <s> is it poacher turned gamekeeper or vice versa <e>", "<cs> scotland is covered by the grant provision by dint of clause of the bill that is scotland is not excluded from part vii <e> <s> i have not got the information for which the noble lord has asked but i will let him have it <e>", "<cs> the provisions of part x are not intended to apply to the private sector only to public sector bodies <e> <s> there are however bodies which straddle the two sectors in a variety of ways <e> <s> there are certain bodies which would be regarded as essentially within the private sector yet which carry on statutory undertakings <e>", "<cs> i am not absolutely certain whether the noble viscount has looked at the next amendment which we believe rather more covers his point <e> <s> i shall certainly look at this again but we believe that the next amendment is the one that we would rather more like to accept <e>", "<cs> we seem to be in danger of going backwards <e> <s> we have already dealt with amendment no <e> <s> inasmuch as the noble viscount has withdrawn <e>", "<cs> speaking off the cuff which i do not like doing we think not <e>", "<cs> i take the point behind the amendment in that if a public body has only just acquired underused land they do not want to be directed to dispose of it <e> <s> i doubt however whether the amendment is necessary <e> <s> it would require the secretary of state in deciding <e>", "<cs> i share my noble friends concern to prevent the unnecessary loss of agricultural land to development <e> <s> this is very much in the mind of the secretary of state and the register proposals are in fact one of a number of measures the cumulative effect of which will we hope be to reduce the pressure to take more agricultural land away <e> <s> i am afraid however that in practical terms the amendment confuses what is a process of registration with the use to which land is put <e> <s> clause empowers the secretary of state to keep a register of land which satisfies the conditions in clause <e> <s> briefly those conditions relate to the ownership and location of the land and to its being unused or insufficiently used for the purposes of the owning bodys functions or their undertaking <e> <s> clause empowers the secretary of state to register so much of that land as he sees fit <e>", "<cs> in spite of the late hour i presume that your lordships would like me to reply in some way to your comments <e> <s> i should like not to take up too much time in talking about dictatorial powers because i think that the noble lord lord mishcon has spoken of them in regard to quite a number of other parts and has been answered by my noble friend <e> <s> but i would take issue a little on the register itself <e> <s> i was under the impression that land registers featured in the labour partys manifesto <e> <s> i am therefore rather surprised that there is not more wide-ranging support for land registers <e>", "<cs> i come back again to the dictatorial point <e> <s> but equally noble lords spoke of innovative proposals which i took to mean the register of land <e> <s> however it may be that when i read the report tomorrow i shall see that noble lords did not mean that <e> <s> anyway something has to be done to solve the problem and in making known the existence of such land through registers we feel that we are taking a positive step forward <e> <s> the processes leading to registration should create a situation in which the holding bodies become more aware of the potential of their land <e> <s> there is nothing dictatorial just awareness <e>", "<cs> i am afraid there are three reasons why i cannot recommend acceptance of the amendment moved by the noble viscount lord simon <e> <s> first as a matter of government policy the intention is that the territorial secretary of state should consider against the wider policy objective of activating unused public land the case for and against directing a disposal <e> <s> it would be unacceptable to have appeals on a measure of policy beyond the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving me a little time on this <e> <s> as we are dashing about as it were on part x i should prefer to answer it when we take it more specifically <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may agree with the noble lord lord davies of leek on this <e> <s> the government have listened carefully to the noble lord and are willing to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> as i think the noble lord is aware it is no part of the governments policy to undermine the structure and local plan system through which a local community determines where development shall take place in its own area <e> <s> the purpose of clause is simply to give the secretary of state a reserve power to direct a local authority to carry out a site-by-site assessment of land for residential development in its area in collaboration with local builders <e> <s> local authorities were requested to carry out such assessments in the departments circular <e>", "<cs> at in the morning i am only sorry that i cannot be very helpful in response to the noble lords impassioned appeal <e> <s> there is no statutory definition of derelict land <e> <s> now however to be rather irish i will give one <e> <s> contaminated land is included within the definition of derelict land for administrative purposes <e>", "<cs> let us end on a happy note <e> <s> i accept the point made by the noble lord that one effect of clause as presently drafted will be to deprive the london authorities of grant under section of the local employment act to which they might otherwise have been entitled <e> <s> this was certainly not our intention and i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing the point to my attention <e> <s> i gladly agree the amendments which he has proposed <e>", "<cs> i am happy to be speaking to the noble lord lord avebury again just hours and minutes since we were last talking to each other <e> <s> first may i talk about the green belt and then come more generally on to this amendment <e> <s> there are two forms of land under the green belt first the land designated as such in the green belt london and home counties act and secondly land in the context of green belt land which is designated as such <e> <s> there are two different pieces but schedule will have virtually no effect on either in the context of green belt land <e> <s> land in this category is of two kinds and the relevant development or structure plans apply to them <e> <s> a departure from the plans would require advertisement and reference to the secretary of state for consideration before it could be called in <e> <s> we have already made it known that we should want the strongest possible restraint on development in such areas <e>", "<cs> if i may correct the noble lord it was this morning not yesterday when we talked about the structure plan <e> <s> the only way the secretary of state could give any meaningful effect to this amendment would be by way of imposing a condition on any sale limiting future development of the land to that which may best promote the policies adopted in the relevant structure plan <e> <s> it is difficult to see how this could produce any worthwhile effect <e> <s> since development outside the policies of the structure plan is unlikely to be permitted there would seem little point in suggesting that disposals should be subject to conditions requiring development to be within these policies <e> <s> moreover the amendment only has the impact of an exhortation as the section itself allows for a wholly permissive disposal arrangement which the amendment does not seek to alter <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of transport made regulations on th august which reduce the maximum noise levels permitted for new motor-cycles from <e> <s> he is considering still more stringent limits for longer term <e>", "<cs> my lords in amplification of my first point it is hard to make regulations to be enforced any earlier than because manufacturers themselves have to plan how to make motor-cycles in the future <e> <s> so far as statistics are concerned in recent years there have been successful prosecutions a year for all types of vehicles for offences concerning noise <e> <s> during the year which is the last year for which we have figures available motor-cyclists were killed in pedestrians were killed in motor-cycle accidents and were killed by all types of vehicles <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed that is true <e> <s> perhaps here one can voice concern about the fact that one of the major difficulties about noise from motor-cycles concerns those who tamper with their silencers <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only agree with the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> as i said in my previous reply it is the tampering with silencers that really causes concern <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may ask the noble lord lord avebury to clarify one thing <e> <s> he said fairly early on in his speech something about amendment b and some amendments to it <e> <s> if there are any i have not seen them <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> it is rather difficult to answer on certain points of this kind <e> <s> may i also say to the noble baroness lady david that i think we should be speaking to amendment a as well as the ones she mentioned <e> <s> it is only a small technical one on the schedule <e> <s> i am happy to commend all the amendments of the noble lord lord irving which were so ably spoken to by the noble baroness <e> <s> these are nos <e> <s> b through to g a a and b together with a <e> <s> i am happy to recommend these to the committee together with the amendments of the noble lord lord avebury to amendment no <e> <s> c which are amendments nos <e> <s> cb through to ce <e> <s> having said that my noble friend lord ridley has also put down some amendments which are amendments nos <e> <s> to a and <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot recommend these but i shall come to them later <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> i rather agree that it is consultative that is really what i was saying <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness will let me get a little further i think that i shall come to that point <e> <s> if i do not i ask her to get at me again <e> <s> they do of course consult the department on levels of provision that might be suitable for designation and this can be the subject of useful discussion <e> <s> but the initiative must come from local government and we do not wish to interfere by central <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer the specific point raised by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> this amendment seeks an extension of the powers of a highway authority to construct maintain and remove humps by enabling them to apply them to highways which are not maintainable at public expense as well as to highways which are maintainable at public expense <e> <s> highways not maintainable at public expense are private roads where public rights over them have been established usually by usage <e> <s> if humps are to be used on such roads then the scope of this bill will have to be extended <e>", "<cs> this amendment would amount to the rendering ineffective of highway authorities powers to construct humps in accordance with the requirements of regulations when these are made <e> <s> i think i can set the minds of members of the committee at rest on this point <e> <s> the highway authorities will not want to put a road hump where there is already a speed restriction without having a full cost-effective survey to see whether the hump is necessary in addition to whatever is there at the moment <e> <s> what we do not want to do and what the noble lords amendment does is to restrict the highway authority from doing what they think is best <e> <s> i think that is as far as i can go <e>", "<cs> i think the committee is getting into a bit of a muddle <e> <s> there are two separate things depressions and humps <e> <s> this particular amendment deals with depressions <e> <s> there have been no depressions made there have been no experiments with depressions <e> <s> depressions is in this bill and i will quote the ministers assurance the minister has not as yet experimented with depressions and unless and until he has done so there will be no question whatever of his legalising by means of regulations the construction of depressions by local highway authorities <e> <s> the possiblity should however remain <e> <s> here your lordships may disagree <e> <s> the minister should retain the freedom he has at present to experiment with depressions as well as with humps and lie should be able should he do this and find that depressions rightly used can be even more satisfactory than humps to prescribe the requirements compliance with which would authorise local authorities to construct them <e>", "<cs> i said the majority i hope i did not say all <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is incorrect there <e> <s> there was some interesting drafting i do not think error is the right word in the previous <e>", "<cs> on the surface i quite agree that what the noble lord lord airedale says makes complete sense <e> <s> however when looking at it in more detail the amendment seeks to treat traffic warning signs for road humps <e>", "<cs> i am sure that what the noble lord has said will be read with interest later <e> <s> i think that the noble lord lord underhill has had experience of jumping over humps in holland was it not <e> <s> i do not know whether there were any signs there <e>", "<cs> i do not think that there is very much doubt that we all agree with the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth that there is no contemplation of putting these humps in the middle of motorways <e> <s> it is more than unlikely that ministers would contemplate providing for the construction of humps on motorways trunk or principal roads and it is likely that they would at any rate consider confining hump installations to miles per hour speed limit roads <e> <s> this is a matter for consideration in the context of regulations on which and i hope that this will make my noble friend lord lucas happy representative organisations will have an opportunity of commenting as indeed the bill provides <e>", "<cs> i apologise i did rather bring them together yes <e>", "<cs> i have only one short point to make <e> <s> we still seem to be unduly suspicious of humps as regards the minister and his regulations <e> <s> i do <e>", "<cs> i certainly agree with what the noble baroness has been saying about this <e> <s> once again we feel that this is not the right place to insert an amendment of this nature <e> <s> when talking about other one-way streets and other ideas one does not for instance actually put in the legislation that you should consult people owner-occupiers of properties surrounding them <e> <s> this is not a matter to put in the legislation <e> <s> it is something that obviously when the regulations are drawn up might well be commented on <e> <s> more especially of course it is for the local authorities themselves to take into account what the local people feel and when the highway authorities and the local authorities consult together that surely is the moment when this will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> perhaps i can now come back to the amendment and reply a little more directly to the points made by the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth <e> <s> the amendment seeks to insert into the bill an obligation to include in the regulations made under it such advertising and objection-considering requirements as there are in respect of proposals to impose speed limits <e> <s> but there are no main legislation requirements as to the advertising of proposals to impose speed limits or the consideration of objections to them <e>", "<cs> i apologise for not replying to that point i did make a note of it <e> <s> i wanted to take it in the context of time and time wasted which the noble lord lord lucas seems to think we might be doing <e> <s> this is not time wasted <e> <s> everything here will be considered by the department and all comments will be taken into account <e> <s> as my noble friend lord kinnoull has been stressing this is an enabling bill <e> <s> when the regulations come to be made surely will be the time to try to include that regulation <e>", "<cs> i think that if one looks at this from the point of view of the local authority one will see the danger that it is creating <e> <s> it would create a liability for any authority that constructed a road hump to pay compensation for any damage or injury allegedly attributable to that hump save in the improbable event that the authority could prove that the damage or liability was unconnected with the hump or if connected with the hump was attributable to the road users negligence <e> <s> the hump is to be deemed guilty unless its innocence can be proved <e>", "<cs> this is an area which requires some slight crystal-ball gazing <e> <s> i can do little but agree with my noble friend on his various suggestions <e> <s> i am not able to comment on the standard or state of road maintenance <e> <s> there is no evidence to suggest as the noble lord himself said that local authorities will rush to install a multitude of humps <e> <s> they will be after all only one more weapon in their armoury in the battle against road accidents and would be used only if they were the most appropriate solution to a particular road safety problem <e> <s> it may be that humps will be installed only where their cost could be quickly recouped in accident costs saved <e> <s> here i should like to refer him to the cost-effectiveness remarks i made earlier <e>", "<cs> i think that when i have finished speaking my noble friend will agree that this is probably already happening <e> <s> the bill as drafted would give my right honourable friends all the bringing into force powers that might be desirable <e> <s> the power for highway authorities to install humps will be incapable of implementation until regulations have been made and my right honourable friends might therefore decide that there was no point in bringing clause or even perhaps the whole act into force until they were ready to make regulations <e> <s> the power to bring different provisions into force on different days might be useful if for some reason ministers wished to undertake further experiments with humps before they were ready to make regulations <e> <s> in that event they could by order bring clause into force so as to conduct the experiments under it <e> <s> but no circumstance can be envisaged in which they would want to have the act or some parts of it in force in some parts of the country but not in others <e> <s> the regulations when made would of course apply throughout the <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister of transport published a policy paper in august which proposed new arrangements for the testing of both passenger vehicles and heavy goods vehicles <e> <s> the paper was circulated widely throughout the road haulage and passenger transport industries and a programme of consultative meetings is now under way <e> <s> my right honourable friend hopes to circulate draft regulations on the new bus testing arrangements early next year <e>", "<cs> my lords during the consultations we are of course aware that there are some people who do not like all that is being put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the nature conservancy council have indicated to the local farming and landowning interests that unless arrangements can be devised to enable them to be consulted about proposals for agricultural improvements on west sedgemoor they will no longer feel able to justify deferring their proposed notification of a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind my noble friend that i am not speaking on behalf of any ministry but of course on behalf of the government <e> <s> the particular site in question was noted in since when it has always been in mind to notify it as an sssi <e> <s> the reason for the delay is the consultation with farmers and landowners and at this moment we are awaiting the results of a somerset county council working party <e> <s> i think that it is a little early to prejudge the maff scheme <e> <s> it came into operation on st october which was very recent <e> <s> i am happy to tell noble lords that the ministry of agriculture is watching developments very carefully <e>", "<cs> my lords if we are talking about the site mentioned in this question i do not think that i can go along with my noble friend <e> <s> there has been plenty of consultation both with farmers and landowners and we see no reason why this process should not continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall bring the question of an appeals procedure to the attention of my right honourable friends but quite honestly with all the consultation that takes place i do not think that there should be any necessity for one <e> <s> once again the nature conservancy council should not be prejudged in this particular case <e> <s> the scheme has only just recently started and i am sure that the council under its new chairman should be given a chance to prove itself <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we recognise that there is a delicate balance between the needs of agricultural production and nature conservation and every possible effort is made to take all views into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure my noble friend is well aware it is for the railways board to decide how they wish to respond to the stimulus to competition given by the transport act <e>", "<cs> my lords the board are aware of the effect of fares <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend will be happy to know that on a number of occasions the board have considered a general reduction in fares on the same lines as in sweden <e> <s> however they estimate that any increase in the number of passengers would not be sufficient to cover the losses involved let alone improve their overall financial position <e> <s> instead their policy is to offer substantial reductions to specific sectors of the market and this appears to be very successful <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be happy to draw that matter to the attention of british railways <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather think that at the moment sir freddie laker has enough on his plate <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i can really accept that point but i should like to take it up on another occasion if the noble lord cares to put down a question <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i had better come in here and say that noble lords have stolen a lot of my thunder <e> <s> i was going to say to the noble lord lord airedale that despite the care with which he has drafted it in fact since the introduction of national speed limits no highway in this country is unrestricted <e> <s> therefore in point of fact the amendment as it is drafted would not work <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may at the outset deal with the remarks of my noble friend lord lucas because he gave me notice that he would ask me about the blair atholl and m roads <e> <s> as the information was given to us only recently we have not had much time to do our researches but i have discovered something delightful called a rumble strip <e> <s> these apparently illegal humps on the a these so-called road humps which are not road humps in the context in which we are speaking about them are in fact rumble strips <e> <s> we believe a rumble strip has been used at the junction of the m and the access road before the length covering glenfarg which was recently opened <e> <s> we are not sure about the kingussie situation but i suggest that we should not think of these as road humps but as something which sounds to me to be illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords the provisions in clause already provide for the secretary of state where it appears to him that the body may hold land which might be registrable to call for such information as he specifies about that interest <e> <s> this would include information on whether the land is for the time being used or was last used for agricultural purposes <e> <s> it is not therefore necessary to particularise this in the legislation <e> <s> the secretary of state really will call for such information <e>", "<cs> my lords first on behalf of my noble friend who is sitting next to me i should like to thank my noble friend lord stanley for that unreserved apology <e> <s> so far as this amendment is concerned once again i must stress that the register proposals are in fact one of a number of measures the cumulative effect of which we think will reduce the pressure on agricultural land and not take more <e> <s> we share my noble friends concern to prevent the unnecessary loss of agricultural land to development and we believe that these registers will provide the information for the secretary of state to ensure that no land is lost to agriculture <e>", "<cs> my lords to come back to the opening remarks of the noble lord lord mishcon we remain firm on this side too <e> <s> i feel that i must run through some of the processes of registration as i think that it is fundamental to the argument from our point of view <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advised that it is an unnecessary provision the noble lord is advised that it is a worthwhile provision <e> <s> at the moment that is the gap between us on that particular point <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i should like notice of that but i think yes <e> <s> it is accepted that such terms and conditions will not always be in the best interests of the body concerned <e> <s> it is because of that that a power of direction is required <e> <s> however it is the governments intention that disposals should normally take place at a price determined in the market <e> <s> this clause protects public bodies against being required to dispose of land on terms and conditions such as to cause serious detriment to the public body concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i thank the noble lord for being so helpful about it but i think the points raised by him and by the amendment are more than adequately covered <e> <s> under clause an owning body is entitled to make any representations to the secretary of state which can be copied to the appropriate minister as to why the direction should not be given or as to the terms or conditions which it is proposed to attach to a direction <e> <s> the secretary of state will consider these representations in relation to his proposals <e> <s> he may seek the advice of the appropriate minister since the direction cannot be given except where the appropriate minister certifies against the test in clause and that the land can be released as proposed without serious detriment <e>", "<cs> my lords yes i think so <e> <s> it is what we have been trying to do <e> <s> i will look into the point that the noble lord has raised <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment was clause of the previous goverments caravan sites bill which was introduced into this house and then lost <e> <s> that clause sought to implement recommendations contained in the cripps report <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would enable a person charged with obstruction under section of the caravan sites act as set out in clause of the bill to plead in his defence that he had reasonable grounds to believe that one or more caravans on the land were so stationed in consequence of illness mechanical breakdown or other immediate emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment makes it clear that in connection with designation adequate provision for the accommodation of gipsies has to be made in the area to which the application for designation relates and not in the designation order <e> <s> the amendment corrects an error in the bill and i am happy to recommend its acceptance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i shall not be quite so accommodating on this one <e> <s> i do not think that i led the noble lord lord avebury astray because i think it was the previous amendment that i said i agreed to <e> <s> we find this amendment hard to accept because at the moment it is difficult enough to ensure that gipsies in designated areas are made aware of designation <e> <s> even if one could be sure of informing the right gipsies outside designated areas that is those who were thinking of moving into the designated area it has to be borne in mind that in so far as the designated area may consist of a district or districts district boundaries are not indicated by road signs and it will be difficult for gipsies coming from outside the area to know whether they are in it or not <e> <s> another consideration is that the boundary of the designated area may be wholly or partly contiguous with the county boundary and the amendment does not seek to require that gipsies in the adjoining county should be informed <e>", "<cs> my lords we have already spoken to this amendment from this side of the house <e> <s> i am happy to accept the proposed amendment together with the consequential amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords the ordnance survey review committee which was set up under the previous government was specifically required to report on the basis that the ordnance survey would remain a government department <e> <s> thus the committees report valuable though it is in other respects lacks any review of other structural possibilities <e> <s> my right honourable friend is considering the future of the survey against the full range of possible structures inside and outside the civil service with a view particularly to a more enterprising role and independent status <e> <s> some preliminary studies are in hand to this end and if my right honourable friend decides to make a more detailed examination there will of course be wide consultations on any resulting proposals for a change of structure <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill is going too fast <e> <s> at the moment there is no firm proposal whatsoever for privatisation <e> <s> as i said earlier the government are aware that this report was purely on terms which do not include privatisation <e> <s> therefore there will be lots of consultation before going any further <e> <s> the government are well aware of the importance and value of the ordnance survey <e>", "<cs> my lords the government fully endorse what the noble lord has said about the ordnance survey <e> <s> they have no wish whatever to harm it <e> <s> however i cannot give an assurance about whether or not it may later be considered for transfer to the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is speaking of conservatism with a small c and not a capital c <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there need be any fears in relation to the grid system either staying where it is or being moved to the private sector <e> <s> so far as staff implications are concerned should there be any progress on this there will be full consultation with the trade union representatives on any proposals affecting their interests <e>", "<cs> my lords while i cannot give any absolute assurance to the noble lord yes it is our intention that should there be changes contemplated every opportunity will be given to debate the matter particularly in your lordships house <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that your lordships will give the bill a third reading <e> <s> first i should like to apologise to the noble lord lord airedale for what must have seemed to be and probably was bad manners on thursday afternoon <e> <s> i understand that we did think that the noble lords concerned with this bill had been consulted about the change of time from last friday until today and it was actually only when the noble lord lord airedale himself told me on thursday afternoon that i was aware of the change <e> <s> can i assure your lordships in all sections of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer to that in deference to my noble friend on my left is the usual channels <e> <s> the usual channels informed me that my noble friend lord kinnoull was going to be in touch with other noble lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble viscounts point but while debating these amendments we have been trying to break them down <e> <s> i think the noble viscount would agree that with regard to the larger number we have said we think these are for regulations we have taken on board the points made and will make regulations about them <e> <s> i have given an undertaking on the mile an hour limit which was one of the major points in the previous debates <e> <s> there are one or two amendments i do not want to anticipate the debate because i know that the noble lord lord airedale has two amendments down for consideration later which we think are already incorporated or are in the wrong place or are not quite right so i do not think there is any amendment which fundamentally the house would have carried <e> <s> however the house may have to call me wrong and vote on one of the next four amendments <e>", "<cs> or less my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may come in here on this amendment generally because i think perhaps i can satisfy my noble friend lord lucas by saying that i think that under section of the highways act the powers which he wishes are already there <e> <s> the decision whether or not to install humps on a particular road under this bill rests with the highway authority concerned <e> <s> as i said at the committee stage one of the factors in this decision will of course be the cost and each authority will have to decide in the light of the potential cost-effectiveness of the humping proposals and i spoke to that at some length and of competing demands on available resources whether an installation is justified <e> <s> if humps are likely to be cost-effective in accident prevention then the community as a whole will benefit and it would be right for the community to pay <e> <s> this is a principle which is implicit in all existing highway and indeed traffic management legislation and there is no reason or justification for treating hump installations differently <e> <s> there could be situations where hump installations would benefit the general community but where some or all the owners and occupiers of adjacent property did not see themselves as receiving benefit it would seem unreasonable in these circumstances that they should be required to contribute towards the cost of installation <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i cart clarify something here <e> <s> there are two clauses involved clause and cause <e> <s> whereas clause is about consulting for the regulations clause is about consulting with the local authorities <e> <s> to answer the question just now from my noble friend of course this would come under clause when the local authorities are consulted <e> <s> i did speak to this on the committee stage and i must say to the noble lord lord airedale despite his pressure on me that the wording of this clause is in a standard form for provisions for consultations on regulations made under an act <e> <s> it is a standard form <e> <s> he may press the amendment but there is nothing exceptional in this particular clause <e> <s> it is standard practice when making regulations to spread the consultation net as widely as possible to include all representative organisations and bodies who might have an interest in them <e> <s> if i can give an example that includes the rha the aa the rac the freight transport association and the institute of motor cycling <e>", "<cs> my lords i must <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is a revision of one which the noble baroness lady stedman moved at report stage <e> <s> in the bill as drafted paragraph subparagraphs a and b of schedule i of the act as amended by clause are intended to close a small loophole in the present statutory provisions on empty property rating whereby unoccupied electricity and gas showrooms are able to avoid paying empty property rates <e> <s> the loophole came to light in a court case concerning tower hamlets london borough council and it was thought that the clause would close it <e> <s> the noble baronesss amendment at report stage which the government agreed to consider led to investigations into the need to ensure that empty offices as well as showrooms of electricity and gas boards should be liable to rates <e> <s> there have been discussions between officers of the association of metropolitan authorities and the department about this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords the british railways board announced on th october that they had decided to withdraw freight services from the manchester/sheffield/wath line that is the woodhead tunnel route from st june <e> <s> since only freight services are involved ministerial consent is not required to the closure and there is no provision for a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the system of electrification on the woodhead route is already outdated it was actually put in in the early s <e> <s> i am informed that there has been no expense on the tunnel other than routine expense since that time <e> <s> as the electrification is now outdated it is in need of renewal and this would cost about million <e> <s> it is in view of this that the railways board have decided on the closure of this route which will save them some million a year and i believe that this is the best option <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard the noble viscount right he said sheffield and wath <e> <s> this has nothing to do with the hadfield/penistone line about which the question is asked <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a map in front of me and there is a lovely station called hadfield another called penistone and another called wath which is where the woodhead tunnel is <e> <s> you then turn right for rotherham to get to sheffield <e> <s> with all respect to the noble viscount i do not think he is correct <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to that is that when a passenger service is affected there is a public inquiry <e> <s> when a freight service is affected there is not a public inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to introduce a bill to make amendments relating to the winning and working of minerals in the town and country planning act and the town and country planning scotland act and for connected purposes <e> <s> i beg to move that this bill be now read a first time <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer to the noble lords question is no <e> <s> as i am sure he is aware it is for the railways board to decide whether to offer additional reduced rate travel <e> <s> besides the concessions to senior citizens british rail have introduced among other ideas a family railcard and a new young persons railcard <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i did reply to a similar question from my noble friend lord orr-ewing on a previous occasion <e> <s> the railways board have considered a general reduction in fares on a number of occasions <e> <s> however they estimate that any increase in the number of passengers would not be sufficient to cover the losses involved let alone improve their overall financial position <e> <s> instead their policy is to offer substantial reductions in specific sectors of the market and this appears to be very successful <e> <s> there can at the moment be no question of an increased government subsidy to help <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a successful experiment but it is an experiment which is a once-and-for-all scheme at the moment <e> <s> it will run only until th december and at present british rail have no plans to extend it further <e>", "<cs> my lords it is at the moment legal for unregistered new cars to be driven with their speedometers disconnected <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister of transport is aware of the loophole and on rd december he laid before both houses am amendment to the regulations making this undesirable and unsafe practice illegal <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the fifth time that this subject has been before your lordships house and the ninth time that it has been before one or other house <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk made the point that these debates do a little advertising on the cheap for seat belts <e> <s> therefore this is not a subject where the arguments are novel or unfamiliar <e> <s> they are very familiar <e> <s> dare i say that i felt rather as if i was listening to a gramophone record when the needle had stuck in a groove <e>", "<cs> my lords i too commend the initiative of the right reverend prelate the bishop of london in introducing the bill <e> <s> a small reason why t could be replying other than being a junior minister is that i am a trustee of a st georges hanover square trust which is funded by the burial ground which the right reverend prelate mentioned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other members of the house in congratulating my two noble friends lord halifax and lord peel on their maiden speeches <e> <s> it seems to be that one ought to try to find some relationship with them so i am happy to tell the house that my mother was a yorkshire lady and born in the north riding <e> <s> i thought the noble earl lord halifax made some very wise remarks about farming and forestry whereas the noble earl lord peel brought us up to date on national parks and particularly upland industries <e> <s> both their contributions are of considerable value to the house and i hope we can drag them down from those wonderful moors of yorkshire as often as possible <e>", "<cs> i have indeed my lords <e> <s> it actually comes at the end because it is not in parts i ii or iii <e> <s> on sssis some noble lords have raised doubts on the habitat protection measures saying that they do not go far enough and that the government should be seeking to protect all sites of special scientific interest to the extent that owners should notify the ncc when they intend to vary the way in which they are currently managing the land <e> <s> at the last count there were such sites and the government do not wish to impose what might be an unreasonable and unnecessary burden on farmers and land-owners <e> <s> the success of nature conservation in britain depends not so much on statutory provision as on the continuation of the goodwill of those who earn their living from the land and those who are concerned that its wildlife resources should remain unimpaired <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have it at the moment the authority would be able to contradict it but since i have not yet seen the amendment perhaps we can leave that point until next time <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of noble lords on this side of the house may i reciprocate the good wishes for the new year <e> <s> the answer to the noble lords question is that the report in the <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the government are fully aware of this and are proceeding at what i think the noble lord will find to be very satisfactory speed <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for the railways board <e> <s> i understand that the board expect to submit soon to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport a proposed scheme for improving the rail services to the airport which would include the provision of trains equipped with a public address system <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the modified rolling stock used on the gatwick airport service has now more luggage capacity than normal <e> <s> however because of the make-up of the trains that is the airport stock is attached to and detached from through trains at gatwick station i understand from the board that there will be operational difficulties in providing a public address system on only the airport portion <e> <s> there is insufficient justification for the expenditure now needed to equip those trains with a public address system <e> <s> may i assure the noble baroness that the new scheme put forward seems to produce a satisfactory answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of those points <e> <s> i am grateful to the noble baroness for bringing them to my attention <e> <s> so far as gatwick airport is concerned the station is under rehabilitation at this moment <e> <s> the lifts should be in by the spring and the station undergoing a million refit should be ready by <e> <s> i am sure that that will be something that we can be proud of at gatwick <e> <s> so far as this end at victoria station is concerned the scheme which is under consideration at the moment has considerable improvements for victoria as well <e>", "<cs> my lords on any question where the railways board is concerned i have to reply that it is a matter for the railways board <e> <s> the point the noble lord now raises is outside my purview <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that british rail are proposing to use multi-lingual tapes <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question is a slight digression from the original question but i am sure that british rail will bear in mind what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords an important step was the governments decision to ask the monopolies and mergers commission to investigate the efficiency of british rails london and south-east services <e> <s> in their report published last october the commission made a number of detailed and constructive recommendations for improving the performance of these services most of which the railways board are now implementing <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport will be discussing with the chairman of the railways board the progress that is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords the commission concluded that in providing the london commuter services the board are not pursuing a course of conduct which operates against the public interest <e> <s> indeed the report praised a number of achievements of british rails management <e> <s> but the commission did identify a number of serious weaknesses and made positive recommendations for eliminating these faults <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot of course comment on the figures which the chairman gave on tv <e> <s> i should however like to say that the proportion of the budget which goes towards london and the south-east area is per cent <e> <s> and that has stayed more or less constant so that the south-east does get looked after well <e> <s> as regards the level of money which the government give to british rail this has stayed at a constant real figure and is the same as was given by the last administration in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted to take part <e>", "<cs> my lords the investment by british rail in commuter services generally is a constant figure and is certainly not being stopped at the end of this year or any other year <e> <s> the government have maintained british rails investment ceiling at the same level in real terms that is million <e> <s> the board itself must choose its priorities within the investment ceiling but the monopolies commission found no justification for any conclusion of bias against the london commuter services <e>", "<cs> my lords rather like the recent press reports the noble lord is slightly exaggerating <e> <s> the board have now published their proposals for changes to the southern region commuter services next june <e> <s> these are much less severe than the impression created by the early press reports <e> <s> the boards announcement explained that the already existing excess capacity on some london commuter services and the recent fall in demand for rail travel resulting from the recession means that like any other business they must act to bring supply more into line with demand <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble viscount has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome this opportunity to speak on the control of pollution special waste regulations <e> <s> they bring about important changes in the controls over disposal of hazardous wastes <e> <s> we are taking a step forward and not a step backwards <e> <s> there have been extensive and protracted consultations with public and private sectors which have preceded the laying of these regulations and any criticism over consultation being made in haste is unfounded <e> <s> although these bodies have not always agreed with each other or with the department there has been considerable uniformity of view in terms of general principles and objectives <e> <s> i have before me as have most noble lords the papers from the acc <e> <s> and i have the essential matters to be resolved <e> <s> they have listed nine such matters <e> <s> if i could break them down quickly and say that four of those the government are either doing or will be shortly done three of them the government do not agree with and i think the government are entitled to disagree with one or two of their points <e> <s> of the other two points outstanding one at the moment is a matter of interpretation and the other a matter of law <e> <s> so out of the nine we are dealing with four <e>", "<cs> my lords i could tell you at the end but if i read them all now it would take a long time <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> is being done <e> <s> no <e> <s> is being done as already promised <e> <s> no <e> <s> will be done quickly and no <e> <s> is being done already <e> <s> i should like to sympathise with the noble baroness lady white over the short period of notification she had in this matter <e> <s> i could say i was in the same boat and have spent the weekend up to my eyes in waste <e> <s> she also made the comment that there were very few people present tonight <e> <s> i think that the speeches have all been so formidable that what we lose in numbers we gain in knowledge <e> <s> having said this about the association of county councils i think i ought to say that they have been hardly fair in their comments as there has been considerable give and take between divers bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for making that point <e> <s> but we seem to be getting away from the fact that the step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords british rails manpower productivity has improved substantially since the early s but the rate of improvement has slowed in recent years <e> <s> the latest information available indicates that british rail generally compares well with other european railway undertakings in this area <e> <s> nevertheless both the government and the board recognise that there is considerable scope for further improvement and that this is vital to the future business prospects of the railways <e> <s> we therefore welcome the boards commitment to productivity and efficiency improvements set out in their corporate plan published last december <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i too have the european railways performance comparisons in front of me and i agree with all that she has said <e> <s> i assure her that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is bearing this report very much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord underhill has looked at these comparison tables as i have <e> <s> they are interesting but they do not produce any particular trend lots go one way and lots go another way <e> <s> the government have adopted a realistic attitude towards railway finance <e> <s> we have increased the boards external finance limit for the current year to compensate for traffic losses due to the recession <e> <s> we have increased the limit for next year above previous plans <e> <s> we have increased the cash ceiling on subsidy for to help the board to maintain the -month interval between fare increases <e> <s> both the government and the board recognise that productivity improvement lies at the centre of this <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend ought to read this report <e> <s> all i can say is that comparisons <e>", "<cs> my lords then may i ask the noble lord whether the product is the same at the end of it <e> <s> i think he will find that british rails labour productivity measured in terms of output of train kilometres per staff employed is broadly comparable with other european railways <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that question <e> <s> i have no statistics of relative cleanliness as between our country and european countries but i do know that in our country british rail is paying particular attention to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord lord avebury is very much using the same equation as the noble lord opposite <e> <s> the answer is that you need every single one of these statistics to make the final equation <e> <s> that is very difficult to do <e> <s> anybody can try it on an accounting basis <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for his excellent remarks about british rail <e> <s> i feel sometimes that they are being hit on all sides <e> <s> if we look at the pamphlet which we have <e>", "<cs> my lords although i thank my noble friend for that question i feel that it falls a little outside the topic of the present question <e> <s> however i will bring it to the attention of the railways authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport bill which received its second reading in another place on th january contains proposals that the railways board support to remove four of british rails non-rail subsidiaries from the public sector sealink hotels hovercraft and non-operational <e> <s> although there are at present no firm plans to introduce private capital into the boards other subsidiaries the government believe that there may be a role for private investment here especially in british rail engineering limited and this is an issue which we shall be considering with the board at a later stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the proceeds of disposals will go to the railways board as owners of the businesses <e> <s> these will however form one element of a financing forecast which the board will submit to the government <e> <s> it is not possible to say at this stage what effect this will have on the boards external finance limit in future years but i think the boards continuing effort towards increased productivity is itself the answer to my noble friend on the question of over-manning <e>", "<cs> my lords it is true that taken together these businesses have been profitable in recent years but before we go into a full debate on it on this occasion i think we might leave it until the transport bill comes to this house <e> <s> in so saying i feel that we may have different figures from sealink for the current year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted with the intervention of my predecessor <e> <s> i join with him in saying how good we think british transport hotels are <e> <s> however as he is well aware they are in need of quite a lot of capital expenditure and perhaps this is the moment to think of getting rid of them <e>", "<cs> my lords these are not included in the present transport bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord on part of his remarks <e> <s> at the moment i do not know the ultimate conclusion because it has not been arrived at <e>", "<cs> my lords that is rather wide of the question and i should like it to be tabled as a separate question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that the british railways board have any intention of proposing the closure of these lines <e> <s> but if they do propose closure and there are objections from users then the final decision will rest with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport <e> <s> my right honourable friend has made it clear on many occasions that he is not prepared to see substantial cuts in the passenger railway network <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lords remarks will be taken into account in any decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i cannot but repeat the first sentence of my original answer that the government are not aware that the british railways board have any intention of proposing the closure of <e>", "<cs> i have listened with considerable attention to my noble friend on this very learned point <e> <s> i am sure that the counsel will take note of his points and when we return to the matter at a later stage give me some advice <e> <s> as regards the amendment as drafted it would make it an offence to be in possession or control of any wild bird or egg of a wild bird not shown to have been killed or taken otherwise than in <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for their contributions on this interesting topic <e> <s> i particularly thank the noble lord lord donaldson for his comment about the legal onus being on the museums <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend lord montagu for tabling this amendment although i shall ask and try to persuade your lordships to reject it or my noble friend to withdraw it <e> <s> i am grateful because we are aware that there has been some concern in museum circles about their position under the provisions of clause <e> <s> it may be helpful first though to mention the technicality which concerns us with this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord renton once more for raising an interesting topic <e> <s> at the outset may i say that the differences between the various fines are intentional because there are some things which we think are much worse than others and they are graded for that particular reason <e> <s> having said that this special penalty which has a maximum fine of and three months imprisonment as my noble friend said already exists under the protection of birds act and to abolish it at this time when there is a growing demand for tougher penalties for offences against birds would be an unacceptable and retrograde step <e>", "<cs> i do not have figures in front of me but i will let the noble lord know <e> <s> i read in the newspapers the other day of a fine and a two months suspended sentence being given <e> <s> i am told that the going price for the sale of some rarer birds to be afforded special protection is already approaching the level of the maximum fine and i was grateful to hear from my noble friend lord onslow that it is already above the maximum fine so the point is doubly made <e> <s> however the government feel it is essential to maintain this penalty <e> <s> i will take advice from the home office on the points raised by my noble friend lord renton and no doubt on later amendments we shall be discussing whether or not the figures should be increased <e>", "<cs> i appreciate and sympathise with the intention behind the amendment namely to ensure that the young which leave the nest very shortly after being born and consequently may be found neither in or near a nest receive protection against disturbance <e> <s> as i think my noble friend anticipated there is some difficulty in finding words which will ensure that protection is given to both the nidifugous young and the remainder <e> <s> i fear however that the word dependent may give rise to problems in deciding which young are dependent and which young are not dependent <e> <s> there may also be a question as to whether protection should be confined to dependent young <e> <s> the answer may perhaps be to refer simply to disturbing the young of such a bird without reference to its nest <e> <s> i should like to invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment on the basis that the government will give the matter further consideration <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friends for those comments and since we are considering redrafting this particular sentence perhaps we could leave it to then <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> this amendment would of course have the effect of giving a higher level of protection to offences in relation to vagrants <e> <s> vagrants are classified with individuals which have usually become disorientated and have little chance of surviving to find their way back to their proper range <e> <s> a variety of north american birds occur in small numbers in britain each year but there is only one proven breeding record in britain by these birds <e> <s> it is our contention that the birds have no conservation importance as they are very unlikely to survive to breed <e> <s> giving them special protection would not alter this though like all birds that come to our shores they automatically receive ordinary protection which makes it an offence to intentionally kill them <e>", "<cs> we have gone through this very thoroughly but there are one or two points which i do not think have been raised <e> <s> i was expecting to have to deal with lots of chairmen and vice-chairmen of various conservation groups but i was not expecting to meet the chairman of the courting couples association <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is probably better informed than i on what took place then <e> <s> i shall be happy to take his point <e> <s> there are two other points which i should like to underline <e> <s> first it should be remembered that climatic conditions for birds in the united kingdom are generally easier than in continental countries <e> <s> we like to think in a way that we lead the european community and i do not think we should feel that we have to follow them in the way that some noble lords have suggested <e> <s> secondly we must also remember that in practice shooting under the moon is possible on only a few nights in winter <e> <s> its practitioners are few and for the most part the most skilled of wildfowlers <e> <s> indiscriminate and unselective shooting is far more likely from those who know little about the sport or about birds <e> <s> i very much hope that after hearing the views expressed in the committee the noble lord lord beaumont may feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the intention behind this amendment is to apply the clause provisions to captive bred birds <e> <s> we want wild birds not to be coupled with them <e> <s> may i just say a word about pheasants because they are covered by the game act and this clause would have nothing to do with the breeding of pheasants <e> <s> so it is the captive bred birds which we are discussing <e> <s> does that help the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i think it is the position but if it is not i will get in touch with the noble lord again <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to place the burden of proof on alleged offenders to show that a bird is captive bred <e> <s> if this is claimed to be the position it is unnecessary <e> <s> clause in fact places the burden of proof in respect of possession or control on the alleged offender and it would be mere duplication to repeat that requirement in clause <e> <s> it would not be sufficient for a person simply to say i bred them or a friend bred them <e> <s> with that explanation i hope that the noble lord may feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> it is my case that without the subsection it could be argued that birds in schedule part i were specially protected at all times and not just in the close season <e> <s> it is equally possible to argue the other way but i think it would be unsafe to rely upon this <e>", "<cs> before the report stage i will look at the noble lords comments on nests <e> <s> i believe we have improved the clause this afternoon and that your lordships recognise that even in this apparently straightforward general prohibition we have struck a balance between a general intent and the detailed needs of those whose legitimate interests could bring them into conflict with the law <e> <s> this balance is important <e> <s> if as we go though the bill we may seem sometimes to favour minority interests it is because we know that the best hope of this law being effective is for those active and interested minorities to join with the majority in helping with its enforcement <e>", "<cs> if i may follow on that point of the noble lord lord donaldson i would submit that there is already a provision in the bill to achieve the purpose behind the amendments tabled by my noble friend lord mountgarret <e> <s> the licensing provisions contained in clause would enable a licence to be issued for the killing or taking of the birds in question <e> <s> that provision will also cover consultation with the advisory body and the nature conservancy council <e> <s> the issue of such a licence within the framework of the system applicable to all other species would we feel be much better than a special procedure for these certain species <e> <s> it would also ensure that the birds retain their special protection and that offences against them would attract the special higher penalty <e> <s> with these words i hope my noble friend will be able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i think i am obliged to oppose this amendment because with great respect to the noble <e>", "<cs> i have very little to add to the arguments which have gone backwards and forwards <e> <s> i was interested to find that we could get a little political argument into the birds <e> <s> i do not think that there is very much to say for the amendment except inasmuch as it makes all the customs equal <e> <s> we have equally heard that scotland might be changed to accommodate england and wales instead <e> <s> there are as the noble lord lord melchett said various areas in england and wales mostly in wales and a few in the north country where sunday shooting is prohibited <e> <s> this flexibility is reflected in the present protection of birds acts by the secretary of states ability to make orders in respect of pest and quarry species <e> <s> under the <e>", "<cs> perhaps it is time that i declared a slight interest i am very fond of eating woodcock and it is one of my specialities to cook them <e> <s> however i never buy a woodcock in september <e> <s> they do not seem to be obtainable in london <e>", "<cs> we seem to be running into a considerable problem on the subject of the snipe season <e> <s> i think probably the best solution would be to refer this matter to the advisory committee to seek their advice and i would undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> before going into this matter in some detail may i refer to the question of the snipe and suggest to the noble lord lord donaldson that we can of course always shorten the other end of the season under clause by a similar form of protection <e>", "<cs> while there may be instances when more than one advisory body would be able to give good advice on the making of an order or more especially on the granting of a licence i anticipate that on many occasions the secretary of state will have insufficient time to consult more than one body <e> <s> in fact the amendments do not appear to achieve the intended result since the remaining words <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has pinched some of my ammunition <e> <s> he is correct <e> <s> as we understand the position clause paragraphs <e>", "<cs> i will of course look at it again but i look at it with not a tremendous amount of optimism for two reasons really <e> <s> the intention and effect of the two amendments which have been tabled is to require the secretary of state to consult a protectionist when considering the making of an order to prohibit the shooting of birds in open season <e> <s> we have just heard from the noble lord lord melchett and from behind me that in point of fact the protection of birds act has been working very well on this and as the provision as now drafted has been taken from that act i feel that it should be good enough but i will certainly have a look at it <e>", "<cs> yes we are taking on board the points being made and when we look at it again we will consider them <e> <s> so far as the amendment moved by the noble lord lord kilbracken goes clause obliges the secretary of state when considering the making of an order to consult a representative of those interested in the shooting of birds to be covered by the order <e> <s> i am sure he must be able to go to those who are most responsible and representative and i fear that the amendment as drafted by the noble lord would really create a rather haphazard arrangement <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> the or is there in the last but one paragraph it is always in the penultimate paragraph <e>", "<cs> i have clause in front of me and <e>", "<cs> yes i see the point we have a lot of ors in that area <e> <s> we will look into it <e>", "<cs> can i ask the noble lord why he does not want an or at the end of paragraph <e>", "<cs> we have of course sympathy with the feelings behind this amendment but the government are nervous that by adding catapult to the schedule we might be downgrading the substantial weapons which we already have <e> <s> we are also nervous about children and whether or not the catapult is an adult weapon which should be included here <e> <s> on the whole we should prefer to leave this out but if the noble lord were to press me i should offer to consider it further <e>", "<cs> it may be for the convenience of the committee if i came in now to say that we too are sympathetic with the thoughts behind the amendment <e> <s> like my noble friend i would draw attention to the consequential amendment no <e> <s> which reads <e>", "<cs> we are required to ban the use of automatic and semi-automatic weapons with a magazine capable of holding more than two rounds of ammunition that is three in total with one in the breach because of our obligations under the european com <e>", "<cs> there are two points here <e> <s> i obviously did not make myself clear <e> <s> it would be the semi-automatics which would have to be licensed <e> <s> it would be a general licence and not a specific one <e>", "<cs> in the view of the government it is objectionable to presume the guilt of someone who may be guiltless and to reverse the burden of proof in the manner proposed <e> <s> it is difficult to see what reasonable precautions an employer could take to cover himself in all cases <e> <s> an owner or occupier should be liable to conviction only if it can be shown that he instigated encouraged or connived at the offence <e> <s> the position should in practice be adequately covered as my noble friend lord onslow asked by section of the magistrates courts act which provides that <e>", "<cs> it would depend whether the noble lord lord melchett thinks counsels is tipping a wink or whether tipping a wink is less than counselling <e>", "<cs> i do not think i know of anybody who tips a wink but if one knew of anybody who was counselling one could rightly take action <e> <s> with that proviso i hope that the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley will not press his amendment <e>", "<cs> it is extremely unlikely that any prohibition methods would be removed <e> <s> however the words are needed in case some future prohibition is more comprehensive than an existing one <e> <s> that is the point behind it <e> <s> it is most unlikely that a government would want to do away with any of the prohibitions listed <e> <s> however the words the amendment seeks to delete are necessary in case it is wished to replace an existing prohibition by a wider one including that prohibition <e> <s> without the power to remove an existing prohibition the redundant wording would of necessity need to remain <e> <s> i am fairly certain that this would be by negative resolution but i should like to check that <e> <s> i hope the noble lord will feel content with that to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government fully appreciate the value to the education service of the slide loan arrangements at present operated by the victoria and albert museum <e> <s> it is the intention of my right honourable friend the minister for the arts that an alternative means should be found of continuing the loan service when it ceases to be operated by the museum after march <e>", "<cs> my lords first perhaps i should explain that the closure of the victoria and albert museum slide loan service is not directly related to the shortage of funds <e> <s> the victoria and albert staff are part of the civil service and because of the reduction of the civil service the museum will operate with fewer staff <e> <s> given that all the options for staff savings were difficult the director decided with regret to close the slide loan service which is a self-contained unit <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it must be left to the director of the v and a to deal with his staff and his organisation as he thinks fit <e> <s> however the government agree with the noble baroness that this loan service is extremely important <e> <s> as i have already stated it is intended to continue it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his intervention <e> <s> i do not think that i can comment on it but i am sure that the director of the museum will read what he has said with interest <e>", "<cs> my lords there are a variety of interesting and constructive suggestions for operating the service in the future <e> <s> these have not been costed out and it would be prejudging any costings to reply to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of order i think that at this stage we should have only questions to the minister and not statements <e>", "<cs> the government also see no objection to these amendments and like the noble lord lord strabolgi see them as improvements to the bill <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate has pointed out the new clause would not alter the substance of the bill in any way <e> <s> it aims to cover more prominently and more precisely a provision which is at present tucked away <e> <s> the new clause would make it quite clear that if a church sells a disused burial ground before carrying out the procedures laid down in the bill the new owner will have to complete them before building can take place <e> <s> we would agree that the words which the right reverend prelate proposes to delete in clause about the position of subsequent owners are in consequence otiose <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a welcome addition to the wildlife and countryside bill to be talking today on the trees replanting and replacement bill instead <e> <s> having earlier today talked about the sites for burial grounds being unused i felt that this bill might be rather applicable to that motion as well <e> <s> while the government are very keen that a great many trees should be planted both in urban areas and in the countryside we do not believe that this bill is the right way of achieving this objective <e> <s> the bill is similar to the one introduced by the noble lord lord somers in the previous session <e> <s> certain changes have been made which are an improvement on the original bill but i would remind your lordships of what was said by my noble friend who was standing at this dispatch box on that occasion my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton in the committee stage last may <e> <s> he said that we in the government do not see much point in trying to turn this measure into one which we can support because at the end of the day we shall probably not be supporting it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the name of my noble friend i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> taking first the point of my noble friend lord renton i would say that we shall come to the question of licences when we reach clause <e> <s> a great number of amendments have been put down regarding that and i believe and hope that when i speak on clause i shall to a large degree be able to make my noble friend happy on that point <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord lord kilbracken that when i say we consult the advisory committee i mean exactly that <e> <s> they are meeting as we are going through this very committee stage and all the points that we took on board last week will have been discussed by them with our officials before we get <e>", "<cs> i disagree with my noble friend for much the same reasons as he has put forward but let me try to explain <e> <s> my noble friends amendment seeks to apply the prohibition on the use of any net for birds in flight or the use of any rocket-propelled or cannon net for taking birds on the ground to the whole of clause and not of course merely to subsection <e> <s> as a matter of drafting it will not work to say in subsection that nothing in the section shall make lawful the use of any net for taking birds in flight or of any rocket-propelled or cannon net for taking birds on the ground <e> <s> the reason is that subsection <e>", "<cs> i think i agree with every word that the noble lord has said <e> <s> section is a clause and therefore we do not use it <e>", "<cs> i think we are all going along the same route <e> <s> i should like to concede to my noble friend that we now believe in the need for a negative resolution for all changes to orders schedules and regulations and what we should like to be able to do is to bring this forward as a government amendment at report stage <e> <s> i hope that with that in mind my noble friend will feel able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as nobody seems to be coming forward to help me on this i must say that it is a very intriguing idea <e> <s> i have managed to talk for long enough to get a note which says that the suggestion to insert this provision arises from part of a european community directive <e> <s> with that in mind i hope the noble lord will accept it <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to look at it again <e> <s> clause shows how the world moves on and the list of prohibited methods has increased greatly since so much so that we thought it prudent to <e>", "<cs> it might be to the convenience of your lordships to take the statement now <e> <s> i beg to move that the house be now resumed <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord lord kilbracken would give way <e> <s> we shall discuss the schedules after clause and i think that this particular point will arise then <e> <s> perhaps he would leave it until that time <e>", "<cs> this provision is identical to one found in section <e>", "<cs> this is something we do not feel particularly strongly about but i should like to read what the noble lord has said in more detail before i offer to go any further <e> <s> it was originally proposed to reduce the period during which a bird could be confined from to hours and this was dropped with the agreement of the advisory committees the ncc and rspb because the new provisions for showing contained in clause should ensure that only captive bred birds well used to small cages are eligible for showing <e> <s> the amendment would result in the loss of the restriction of hours on the time during which a bird may be confined in a small cage for the purpose of public exhibition and also seeks to prohibit the com <e>", "<cs> in view of this dual result it is difficult to see why the amendment has been suggested <e> <s> the government considered amending clause when drafting this bill but the new rules on exhibition should ensure that the only truly captive bred birds well used to small cages are eligible for showing <e> <s> there was no strong welfare case for changing the existing transport rules in the protection of birds act <e> <s> this is already supported by the protection of animals legislation <e> <s> if i could ask the noble lord to withdraw i shall look at his remarks again and perhaps he will be kind enough to do the same with mine <e>", "<cs> we were as the noble lord lord donaldson said going to change the word probationer <e> <s> we have looked at the amendment of my noble friend lord cork and orrery and have listened carefully to what he said <e> <s> we think the whole question should be considered further so we shall be looking to redraft this sentence in any event and that will include changing probationer to practitioner and i hope with that assurance my noble friend will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> to begin with perhaps i may put the record straight <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned that she was speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i believe that should have been no <e> <s> <e> <s> it is a very small point but it is one for the record and i of course should like to speak to the same amendments as the noble baroness mentioned <e> <s> i understand the purpose of these amendments as twofold first to apply general protection of the kind applied in the protection of birds acts to all wild animals other than some listed ones and secondly to extend clause to be capable of covering all creatures other than birds which are already covered elsewhere and not just mammals <e> <s> first may i say that it may well be necessary to include other creatures in clause and it is as the noble baroness said slightly difficult to speak to the mammals now when we are going to have quite a large go at them later <e> <s> while the government do not really take this amendment to their hearts in view of its context i shall certainly take this point for future consideration <e>", "<cs> if i could have the numbers of the amendments to which the noble lord is speaking i should be grateful <e>", "<cs> perhaps i should speak briefly with regard to the two schedules and then take some of the species in detail <e> <s> i should like to tell my noble friend lord chelwood that he has altogether too unbecoming an idea of your lordships importance in this debate <e> <s> not only were all the amendments looked at by the advisory committee before i came to the dispatch box on this occasion but i can assure him that the members will read this debate with particular interest and indeed it is possible that some members are even listening to it now <e> <s> so i can assure him that every single thing which has been said during this debate on the schedules will be taken into account by the advisory committee and if necessary amendments will be made at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i take the points of the noble lord lord melchett <e> <s> i had on my speaking list that we would also consider moving from schedule to schedule <e> <s> i am not sure whether i actually said that in my speech but i have made a note of the point <e> <s> as regards the advisory bodies there are as he said quite a lot of different bodies who can advise <e> <s> as i also said the advice is not always the same so from time to time the ncc has to make a decision <e> <s> therefore when one gets from one side of the chamber or the other certain views from certain bodies although we accept that as coming from a particular body there may have been contrary advice from another body <e> <s> so not everybody can be satisfied all the time <e>", "<cs> i think i said that everything will be considered <e> <s> a good number of different points have been made from eating to hunting as well as various <e>", "<cs> in the first place i do not think schedule i would be the right place to put the blackheaded gull <e> <s> secondly i take the points which have been made about egg collections and culling generally <e>", "<cs> while i am not qualified to take issue with the noble lord on this particular point may i tell him why it is listed as it is <e> <s> as he knows very well many species have more than one name <e> <s> for example i am told that a hen harrier has over names <e> <s> for the sake of simplicity and standardisation we have followed the ornithological worlds advice and adopted a sequence and scientific nomenclature of professor k h voous list of holarctic species <e> <s> as your lordships will know helarctic covers both paleartic and nearctic which is most of our northern hemisphere <e> <s> in any event the latin name also used alongside in the schedule we hope will avoid confusion <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken is all too pessimistic <e> <s> it is one which has been agreed to at the last advisory committee <e> <s> when i spoke about the schedules there was an advisory committee on th january when they did agree to the scaup and this particular swan <e> <s> it generally was and still is the practice to restrict schedule to breeding species or species which look as though they are about to breed in britain but there is nothing to stop the addition of species which do not breed here but are regular or scarce winter visitors <e> <s> the general question we all ought to consider as i have said before is that by making schedules too long we devalue it <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> we talked about the hen harrier and other similar birds earlier when i said that they were on the european directive and therefore must be included <e> <s> i equally said that i know that people are worried about the hen harrier and this is where the special licence provision will come in if there is a need to deal with them <e> <s> unlike my noble friends lord onslow and the duke of atholl i am told that the population of the sparrowhawk has now recovered to and it is considered an excellent example of what putting a species on schedule i can do <e> <s> the advice at the moment is that as they have recovered so well there is no need to put them on the schedule <e>", "<cs> clause deals with licences and i am sure we shall be coming on to that in due course <e> <s> may i take the brent goose first <e> <s> this is a fully protected species included in the threatened bird list of the council of europe bern convention on the conservation of european wildlife and natural habitats <e> <s> i shall come to more general points later but may i speak to the brent goose for the moment <e>", "<cs> it is obviously reaching that area <e> <s> on the amendment on the canada goose and the bullfinch i should first of all explain the thinking behind the new list of species <e> <s> our intention is to comply with the eec birds directive by strictly controlling derogation under article of the directive <e> <s> part ii of schedule has been reduced to those species which constitute nationwide pests and are too widespread to be covered by licences <e> <s> here i shall try to deal with lord caithness point about how many counties constitute a general licence <e> <s> listening to the speeches on this subject this evening the canada goose does not yet need a nationwide blanket <e>", "<cs> it is on the current pest schedule schedule to the act <e>", "<cs> so far as this particilar bird is concerned i seem to be against the whole committee <e> <s> my information is that very little information exists on <e>", "<cs> my figures range from to <e> <s> the killing figure is and the sell figure is <e>", "<cs> this rather funny way of doing it is because of the european directive <e> <s> i will try to explain <e> <s> under the present legislation pest species may only be shot by authorised persons <e> <s> this remains the case in the bill <e> <s> although all species listed in both parts of the second schedule are species which may be shot the circumstances in which they may be shot are fundamentally different <e> <s> part ii species are birds which can cause damage though not necessarily in many ways and they are allowed to be shot by the people who are harmed by the damage caused for example the farmer and his employees <e> <s> part ii effects a derogation under the birds directive <e> <s> that is a european directive and must therefore be so limited <e>", "<cs> i think i had better speak to the two birds separately on this occasion <e> <s> to start with the dove the stock dove is not listed in the bill on the advice once again of the advisory committee the ncc and maff who are all agreed it is not a nationwide pest <e> <s> the species can harm mans interests in special situations or limited areas and if a case is shown control will be permitted under an appropriate form of licence <e> <s> the species is on the increase but some years ago the population was at a very low level following a dramatic and largely unexplained fall in their population in the middle and late s <e> <s> we will obviously keep this one under review <e> <s> bearing that in mind i hope my noble friend will withdraw that amendment <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i have been saying all along that the advisory committee is the main body and although we may pressurise them i would still like to go to them in the spirit of this debate <e>", "<cs> it is all three <e>", "<cs> if your lordships are not prepared to follow the spirit in which we debated the other birds it would probably be best to put the question on the amendment <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton for bringing up this subject which is so important <e> <s> to put the record straight i should like to remind both him and the noble lord lord melchett that when we spoke on this during the second reading debate i did say that there was a consultation paper coming and i asked people to be patient until it arrived <e> <s> in fact both my noble friends quoted quite a lot from the consultation paper proving that it has been read and that it is of interest <e> <s> i think i can say that we have done what we said that we would do on second reading <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is showing navety about the complication of this issue <e> <s> i do not think that he is beginning to realise the complexities which are involved here <e> <s> perhaps i may give an indication <e> <s> for instance it involves the maff the scottish department the department of trade the department of energy and the department of industry <e> <s> this cannot be done overnight <e> <s> i think it would have been wrong to have asked us to proceed much faster <e> <s> anyway as noble lords now know the government are currently in the process of consulting the interested organisations about legislation to provide for the statutorily protected marine reserves <e> <s> we shall of course study the proposals put forward by my noble friend lord mowbray and stourton and also by my noble friend lord craigton <e>", "<cs> i think it was spoken to with amendments nos <e> <s> and when lord cranbrook moved his earlier amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i have not yet spoken although the opposition front bench has spoken quite a lot this afternoon <e> <s> of course we are going to delhi with a good plan and of course we are going to delhi hoping to lead as we have done before <e> <s> there is no doubt that this governments attitude will be as it was at the last conference and we hope to achieve as much and to lead as we did at the last conference <e> <s> having said that we shall certainly read what my noble friend lord craigton said and of course we shall see whether we can adapt in some way <e> <s> but i must back up my noble fridnd lord cullen about the washington convention it is there to be our guideline <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley has raised an interesting point <e> <s> i have raised it personally and so far i have had no satisfactory answer <e> <s> i would therefore ask the noble lord to withdraw his amendment at this stage and if i still do not have a satisfactory answer by report i shall ensure that the offending few words are removed that is not the gulls eggs for human consumption part of it but the ornamental side of the amendment <e> <s> as i say i have been trying to find the answer but have so far failed to do so <e>", "<cs> i think that i can help the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley a little on this matter <e> <s> this new purpose has been included as a consequence of the restrictions placed on the competitive showing of wild birds in clause which limits such showing to specimens of species listed in schedule part i and would permit the showing of captive-bred specimens of other species under licence subject as usual to consultation with the nature conservancy council <e> <s> we would not normally expect to issue such a licence for birds which have not been captive bred <e> <s> as aviculturists improve their ability to breed certain species this licensing provision will be of value in monitoring the progress of certain species from the category that cannot normally be freely exhibited to the ultimate addition to schedule part i that is something which my noble friend lord cranbrook may rather like <e> <s> i hope that i have clarified this point sufficiently for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the nature conservancy council has been empowered to give approval to the photographing of wild birds since the offence of disturbing birds while nesting was created in the protection of birds act <e> <s> there is therefore an established procedure for authorising photography <e> <s> the offence of disturbance will under the bill be extended from nesting birds to include young birds that is in schedule <e> <s> there is a need therefore to modify the arrangements for authorising photography and it is sensible to incorporate them within the licensing procedures <e> <s> the availability of a licensing arrangement will enable the nature conservancy council as licensing authority to determine who would be a suitable person to be allowed to photograph specially protected birds during for instance the breeding season and to assess the circumstances in which photography should be allowed <e> <s> i would submit that the alternative to a licensing system would be a total disregard for the disturbance of the birds which i think some noble lords have already been hinting at <e>", "<cs> the idea is that the definition that we now have of livestock will be withdrawn <e> <s> there will therefore be no definition of livestock on the grounds that the normal dictionary definition will be used rather than a definition especially intended for the bill <e>", "<cs> this really is consequential on the one before because having put in by amendment no <e> <s> the word livestock sheep and lambs are of course included <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i think it was my noble friend lord stanley who told the committee when we were considering clause that he considered that the revised provisions in that clause would not adequately provide for emergency control to deal with all forms of serious damage if these words were omitted <e> <s> we are looking at that again <e> <s> we believe that all situations where control measures require killing or taking are covered by one or other of the purposes listed in clause <e> <s> however i know of my noble friends concern and i will let him know by letter if i am wrong <e>", "<cs> may i respond to lord donald-sons amendment no <e> <s> and speak as he did to amendment nos <e> <s> and first <e> <s> on the territorial matters the aim is to have a great british licence and a great british licensing authority as such <e> <s> i feel that i should open by saying a few words about the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> i should like to allay what i think are groundless fears by <e>", "<cs> if i could repeat myself this is an administrative agreement an internal agreement <e> <s> regarding licensing my noble friend lord home asked whether the ncc could give a licence <e> <s> i nodded the wrong way at the time <e> <s> they can give licences <e> <s> as my noble friend lord chelwood mentioned they have been giving licences for photography and will continue to do so <e> <s> as one or two noble lords pointed out the responsibility rests with the government no matter which part of it is the licensing authority for any particular purpose <e> <s> however we have attempted to give the responsibility to that branch of government which is best equipped to exercise it <e> <s> thus while licences for the photography of birds which are based solely on the scientific judgment has been allocated to the ncc licences for precautions against spread of disease or the safeguarding of crops will go through the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food whereas for all other purposes they will go through the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend for speaking to this amendment and perhaps i might also speak to the other three amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these four related amendments would effectively oblige the secretary of state to make regulations covering the procedure for the granting of licences for all the purposes listed in clause of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for that intervention <e> <s> i did actually refer to aspects to consider illustrated in this section but i think that the nature conservancy council might well wish to consider the idea of publishing certain of the basic criteria and perhaps we might leave that to them to consider <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord lord donaldson <e> <s> one is entirely sympathetic to the amendment <e> <s> my main argument would be that it is rather unnecessary <e> <s> i should like to open by saying that of course we understand the requirements of the european communitys directive and indeed have to comply with it and will do so <e> <s> this amendment seeks to impose the specific requirement that an applicant for a licence shall satisfy the licence issuing authority of the need for its issue <e> <s> but if we think of this deeply the amendment is unnecessary as the licence-issuing authority responsible will not issue a licence if it is not required <e> <s> in any case it would be totally wrong to place the onus on the applicant who would not necessarily be aware of other alternative methods <e> <s> the licence-issuing authority will have this information and will advise the applicant on the use of these other methods before issuing the licence <e> <s> i hope that that rather brief explanation may satisfy the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes i take the noble lords point <e> <s> but i honestly think that the licence-issuing authority will have the information and will therefore advise the applicant on the use of other methods <e> <s> i am rather back to front with the noble lord on this amendment but i will find out why we have not used the exact words and will have another look at it <e>", "<cs> i did not hear the consequential numbers <e> <s> however the noble lord mentioned amendment no <e> <s> which has been withdrawn <e>", "<cs> i think it really is a case of which way round we play this particular one <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned herons and if i may take that as a specific point of the policy on licences for each species it is the intention that it will be worked out with the ncc with maff and with my department and for herons it is expected that licences will be granted to individual fish farmers and only when other types of deterrent have already failed <e>", "<cs> yes if the noble earl considers a general licence to be particular it will <e>", "<cs> i was getting perturbed that the specific licence was almost reaching my general licence <e> <s> obviously we want to retain the word general <e> <s> i take the point made by the other side <e> <s> i do not think i can say that i am going to consider it again but i shall read in detail what has been said and see if we can get a little closer because we are very close on this <e>", "<cs> it is the governments policy to ensure that they are not inhibited by law from making charges for issue which place additional costs on all taxpayers for the benefit of a few where such charges are appropriate <e> <s> this provision does not itself mean that licence fees will necessarily be levied but it is considered essential that the government should not be restricted in their ability to do so <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for clarifying the point <e> <s> this matter is under discussion at the moment <e> <s> i will make sure his point about timing is fed into the discussion if it is not already there <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friends will be satisfied with the same answer as i gave to the previous amendment <e> <s> this matter is at the moment under discussion <e> <s> i have been reading the documents which have so far been produced and i have not seen a suggestion on the lines of my noble friends <e> <s> i will make sure that these suggestions are brought to the attention of the appropriate people and undertake that we do look at this <e>", "<cs> we have already spoken to this subject in some detail <e> <s> this amendment relates to and seeks to delete one of the aspects designed to achieve flexibility in the system the proposal that a licence may be issued to enable a person to authorise others to undertake the activity specified in the licence <e> <s> i can assure your lordships that we do not intend to use this power to do some of the more extreme things which have been bandied about <e> <s> as i said it is designed to give an extra flexibility to the system <e> <s> if i may give an example we might wish to make an arrangement whereby the british trust for ornithology could authorise its qualified members to ring birds <e> <s> the alternative to this would be a welter of individual applications with all the attendant bureaucracy <e> <s> that is not of course what we want and with that in mind i hope that i have said enough to persuade my noble friends that the government really would rather like to keep this in the bill <e>", "<cs> i congratulate the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but i forgot to say anything about the ncc <e> <s> as noble lords know we have given the ncc one factor on which to do their licensing <e> <s> i understood from what my noble friend lord chelwood said that the ncc could not cope with the licensing of all this <e>", "<cs> i have said before that the government are the government and therefore speak for both the department of the environment and the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> therefore we say that we speak with one voice <e> <s> i have also said that the ncc is the advisory body for both the maff and the doe <e> <s> the government will take advice from all three bodies at all times <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further than that <e> <s> we have great faith in our ministry of agriculture <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this point <e> <s> we are in sympathy with the intention of the amendment and accept that there should be a similar requirement relating to the licensing functions <e> <s> we intend to place it with these departments where the need is to consider action against it on schedule animals and schedule mammals <e> <s> we will undertake to put down a government amendment if the noble lord would withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> on the whole there is only one objection we have to this which i shall come to but we feel that quite a lot of this is already covered in the bill <e> <s> there is a clear duty imposed on the secretary of state by the registration provisions of clause in respect of taxidermists and clause in respect of registrable birds to keep the type of records required in the amendment <e> <s> subsection would impose a statutory duty but in practice records would of practical necessity be maintained <e> <s> subsection would allow unrestricted access to the records and this is the part we find objectionable <e>", "<cs> the government believe that the appropriate penalty for offences against protected species is <e> <s> the term statutory maximum is reserved specifically for linking the maximum summary penalty for offences triable either summarily or on indictment to the inflation-proofed prescribed sum as defined in the criminal law act and that is currently <e> <s> maximum penalties for all new summary offences in both local and national legislation have since the criminal law act been fixed according to the relative gravity of the offences concerned on a four-point scale and <e> <s> under normal circumstances is currently the maximum financial penalty which may be imposed by magistrates courts and is thus reserved for the most serious offences <e> <s> i hope that with that clarification my noble friend will not wish to press his amendment <e>", "<cs> speaking from this dispatch box nobody wants to see anybody going to prison on these sort of charges <e> <s> my noble friend behind me said that on a matter like the ospreys offenders might be sent to prison <e> <s> my noble friend lord onslow raised the point of whether or is enough <e> <s> here we get into trouble when another noble friend says that it is worth <e> <s> the rarity value and the amount of the fine really cannot be argued <e> <s> the penalties in clause <e>", "<cs> with the permission of the committee i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> before we get too involved there seem to be two issues here first what we passed earlier and secondly the question of imprisonment <e> <s> of course we have not had time as i too grabbed a sandwich in the interval to discuss the consequences of the amendment in increasing the fine from to which the committee has passed <e> <s> it will be for the government to move the necessary amendments to go with it or try to make other arrangements and the house will know later which way we are going to go <e> <s> on the question of imprisonment which noble lords behind me particularly raised we are looking at this <e> <s> it was raised with me earlier <e> <s> the two departments concerned are looking at the question of imprisonment <e> <s> i hope to be able to come back to noble lords with this decision when we reach that stage which i think will probably be on thursday <e>", "<cs> if the decision is made by then i certainly shall but it is a very complicated question which the two legal departments are in discussion about <e>", "<cs> i am sure we shall know by the end of the bill <e> <s> i said thursday because i am not sure where the next amendment about imprisonment comes in <e> <s> i think it is on clause <e>", "<cs> i do not think we have said that we shall redraft it <e> <s> the purpose of subsection is to ensure that the provisions of the schedules apply in their amended form <e> <s> that is all it does <e> <s> if the noble lord wants some simplification in it i must say that we shall of course have a look at it although i think that we are looking at so much at present that i cannot guarantee to come back with anything more favourable <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness has slightly bowled me out on that one <e> <s> i think i shall have to write to her about it <e>", "<cs> think that it is done by order but f would like to come back to it <e>", "<cs> i think that in point of fact we have given this matter quite a good airing today <e> <s> i believe that all the arrangements envisaged by these amendments already exist and will continue to do so <e> <s> we have already said that both the minister of agriculture and the secretary of state are working together on all these matters with the help of the ncc <e> <s> this amendment causes a slightly unhappy result in terms of drafting because while the term secretary of state is not limited to enable the secretary of state for the environment specifically to act the reference to the minister of agriculture which it would be coupled with would be limited to that minister alone <e>", "<cs> this amendment would enable an advisory body not only to give advice on any question pertaining to the protection of birds upon which its opinion had been sought but also upon any such matter upon which it may feel it should profer advice <e> <s> although there is a provision similar to this in the endangered species import and export act which when i quoted it to the noble lord lord melchett he said was not a good thing but slightly more recently when it became more profitable to him he rather enjoyed it more there has not been one in a protection of birds act <e>", "<cs> although i cannot go along with my noble friends when i have completed my reply i think that they will realise that this is not necessary <e> <s> the responsibility for advisory bodies rests with the department including the publishing of any report prepared by these bodies <e> <s> but government would not wish to accept that the executives hands should <e>", "<cs> i rather suspect that we may not have thought through how what may become the two sub-societies will report <e> <s> i think we can take on board what the noble lord has said and see to it but i do not honestly think it need be written into this bill in this way <e>", "<cs> one of the features of the advisory bodies which have been so valuable in making the working of the protection of birds acts as effective as they have been is the range of experience and interest of their members conservationists protectionists farmers aviculturists and many other groups of people concerned with and affected by birds have known that the advisory committees on the protection of birds look at matters not with a sectional or limited view but to achieve a right balance between the many competing and proper concerns in our community <e>", "<cs> i should like to read what my noble friend lord cranbrook said since i am not absolutely certain that what i am going to say covers his point entirely <e> <s> the nature conservancy council will be the overall body i hesitate to say mother body which will be looking after the scientific authority for animals and to that extent anything which applies in clause would of course apply equally to the scientific authority for animals through the ncc <e> <s> if that is not entirely what my noble friend was getting at i shall read his speech and let him know <e>", "<cs> now he can do it twice <e>", "<cs> i gladly undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> i think that perhaps my noble friends point could be covered by the fact that we can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett is quite right when he says we like voluntary bodies but we also like giving people a free hand and not putting too many obligations into a bill <e> <s> as the noble lord is well aware and as my noble friend behind me has just said the nature conservancy council at the moment consults individual experts scientific bodies and voluntary organisations with the relevant knowledge <e> <s> i am advised that the ncc in arriving at its advice to the secretary of state already consults all these experts possessing relevant knowledge and is indeed greatly dependent upon and appreciates the advice so freely given <e> <s> we consider that a statutory requirement for the council to consult voluntary organisations interested in wildlife conservation to be unnecessary and that the extent and manner of consultation carried out by the council before giving its advice to the secretary of state is a matter which can safely be left to the councils discretion <e> <s> in this we would prefer as one of my noble friends behind me said earlier to trust the ncc <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend lord craigton will agree and that the noble lord lord melchett will not wish to press this particular point <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could say quickly to my noble friend that under the clause that we have just been discussing the advisory bodies are very much working with the secretary of state <e> <s> if he found that the advice coming was not correct then he would have ways and means of changing it <e>", "<cs> we are quite happy to consider this amendment <e> <s> there is no problem on that at all <e> <s> i was vaguely turning over in my mind some of the remarks which the noble baroness made <e> <s> there are so many voluntary organisations that one cannot tell whether the one which she had in mind might be spoken to at that time <e> <s> we shall certainly have a look at this and see whether we can write anything in <e>", "<cs> we are very happy with the principles raised by my noble friend lord craigton on behalf of my noble friend lord milverton and we are pleased that they accept the principle that the police and customs are the proper enforcement agencies for the provisions in this bill and in the endangered species import and export act <e> <s> we are also receptive to the concept of the nature conservancy council investigating alleged offences <e> <s> the council already provides advice towards these ends and we see it playing an increasing part in doing so <e>", "<cs> i have listened with interest to what the noble baroness said <e> <s> some of it seems very foreign to the ways of this country <e> <s> as i said earlier i appreciate fully the need for the enforcement but i believe that for the moment we must leave it to our own law enforcement officers to carry on and see whether the extra enforcement to be put into this bill will help in any way to control the poachers or whatever they be <e> <s> we believe that local authorities can and should play a positive role in bringing home to the general public what is going on in their own areas but i think that at the moment we must leave the law enforcement officers to carry on and to see whether the better powers contained in this bill will be effective <e>", "<cs> we can well sympathise with the intention of this amendment and i was indeed interested to hear lord melchetts comments about how children got into it in the first place <e> <s> farmers and landowners of course have a key role to play in wildlife conservation <e> <s> however farmers and landowners are members of the public and would be included in any steps which local authorities thought it expedient to take to publicise the provisions of part i of the bill and any orders made thereunder as required by clause <e> <s> schoolchildren are only specifically mentioned because it is <e>", "<cs> i shall take the opportunity to ensure that it is not missed <e> <s> i must confess to having been attracted by this amendment when i first read it on the marshalled list <e> <s> not only does it make clear that the officers of the organisation which is established by the minister of agriculture fisheries and food under the provision of section of the agriculture miscellaneous provisions act must take into account nature conservation wildlife and landscape interests when giving advice on agricultural matters but it also makes clear to the general public that the obligation to do these things has indeed been placed upon the officers of adas <e>", "<cs> i quite understand that the noble lord should expect the forestry commission to pay proper regard to wildlife <e> <s> if it did not do so it would be right for the government to issue the necessary instructions or to provide for it in legislation if not necessarily in the form of this amendment <e> <s> however the commission has a well-established policy of nature conservation which it has recently set out in its annual report for <e> <s> it fully recognises the importance of preserving wildlife and managing it effectively where management is necessary but as all foresters will know and there are many in this house there are species which have to be controlled in order to safeguard the plantations or the interests of neighbours and it would be wrong to inhibit that <e> <s> the commission maintains close touch with the nature conservancy council and other countryside agencies and has its own qualified wildlife officers within its research and development division to advise its forest managers <e> <s> it also has some trained field staff concerned with woodland protection and wildlife management which in itself is a reflection of the commissions commitment to the preservation of wildlife <e>", "<cs> no for the following reason <e> <s> we have spoken to similar amendments and i think that the government have to oppose them because we do not want orders under clauses and of the bill made if they have to be approved by each house of parliament <e> <s> that procedure is reserved for orders such as those which would amend acts of parliament <e> <s> without wishing to denigrate their importance i would say that to inflict upon both houses the necessity of considering one affirmative resolution on what would amount to a number of relatively minor matters especially when parliamentary time is under such pressure would be unreasonable <e> <s> i have indicated that the government will be bringing forward an amendment to make orders subject to the negative resolution procedure and i hope that with that in mind my noble friend will be able to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord rightly said this is a rather technical point <e> <s> the secretary of state will always consider proposals from a local authority in respect of areas of land and water within its boundaries <e> <s> the proposed amendment seeks to widen the scope of orders without attending to such matters as the extention of the police powers to act in relation to the sea <e> <s> as it stands the amendment is defective and i shall have to resist it <e>", "<cs> that is an excellent question <e> <s> it is defective because it would not be reasonable for a local authority to have added powers outside its area but i shall come back to the noble lord on this one <e>", "<cs> as i think i said to the noble lord lord houghton when he spoke to this matter earlier the government accept the idea behind it and we propose therefore to put down a suitable amendment on another occasion <e> <s> that still holds and i am having a discussion on it with some people again tomorrow <e>", "<cs> as i said to my noble friend when he moved a similar amendment on i think the first day we are required to ban the use of automatic and semi-automatic weapons with a magazine capable of holding more than two rounds of ammunition that is three in total with one in the breech because of our obligations under the european community directive <e> <s> the weapons can be permitted to be used under licence against birds and we intend to allow their use against most pest species that is those birds in schedule part ii <e> <s> their use could also be authorised as appropriate on licences issued in respect of other species <e> <s> however as i said before we are confined to this definition by our obligations under the european community directive and therefore i cannot help my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that the noble lord lord kilbracken is trying to clarify this particular position <e> <s> as he says the definition of game bird which appears in the bill is identical with the one in the protection of birds act and is taken from the game act which is still in force <e> <s> i understand that the noble lord wishes to modernise the wording but to do this would mean amending the definition in the game act at the same time <e> <s> it would seem to be a pity to have to go back to <e> <s> as the noble lord has seen we have tabled a government amendment to delete the words in scotland which are confusing <e> <s> i hope that that little bit of clarity may persuade him not to press me on the remainder of the definition <e>", "<cs> as it is now with all other grouse yes it would <e>", "<cs> i do not think that one can call it closing a loophole to stop a genuine gift <e> <s> if the gift is not genuine for example money has been paid or another item given in exchange and can be shown an offence will have been committed <e> <s> there is a loophole in the current definition of sale in that people can claim to hire out birds and thus get around the sale provisions this we have closed by the addition of the word hire to the definition <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that if a bird or any part thereof is legally in possession then it will be a legal gift <e> <s> does that make sense <e>", "<cs> i would certainly think so <e> <s> if i am wrong i shall come back to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> we considered when drafting this bill inclusion of as it happens an identical definition of the term semi-automatic weapon but were advised that it was unnecessary as it does nothing since it merely sets out the ordinary meaning of the expression semi-automatic <e> <s> so far as i am aware there is no other meaning which might be confused with the ordinary meaning <e> <s> i therefore invite my noble friend to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i take the noble baronesss point <e> <s> i am not quite sure that one can uproot something which has no roots but i will certainly look into her suggestion <e>", "<cs> i was rather hoping that this would be put down for income tax purposes as i gather that ordinarily means out of the country for more than one year <e> <s> however i gather there is another reason <e> <s> the noble lord lord kilbracken has expressed concern that the definition of wild bird as drafted might exclude a species such as the dartford warbler which is ordinarily resident on the continent <e> <s> however this does not prevent its being ordinarily resident in great britain as well <e> <s> in any case where there might be doubt the species would be protected as a visitor <e>", "<cs> i take both noble lords points <e> <s> i am virtually certain that they have no need to worry but i will certainly check on it and let them know <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have received representations from the city councils of manchester and liverpool in which they call upon her majestys government to refrain from the manufacture or positioning of any nuclear weapons within city boundaries <e> <s> i understand that other local authorities have passed similar resolutions <e> <s> the government are however responsible for national security and we will continue to take any steps which we consider necessary to maintain this <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original reply her majestys government have received representations from two cities only <e> <s> all that i can offer to the noble lord is the fact that the government are responsible for national security and they will continue to take any steps necessary to maintain it <e>", "<cs> my lords as members of the north atlantic alliance we are always conscious of the defence of this country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen a copy of their <e>", "<cs> my lords i can but repeat that her majestys government are responsible for national security <e> <s> in these terms i might quote part of a supplementary question put by the noble lord lord shinwell to a question asked by lord brockway on nd february last <e> <s> lord shinwell said in col <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord is aware this government are pursuing all the targets of disarmament which the previous administration did both in geneva and in vienna <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a free country <e> <s> i would not like to comment on that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that is a rather different question from the local one on yorkshire that was raised originally <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> the aim of the amendment is to require owners or occupiers of land which forms part of a site of special scientific interest to notify the nature conservancy council of any operation specified by an order made by the secretary of state <e> <s> currently more than sites would be involved <e> <s> as your lordships will be aware the governments proposals on clause encompass a wide range of powers including substantial cost implications for the most threatened and important of these areas of special scientific interest which have been identified by the nature conservative council i mean conservancy council as requiring super protection <e> <s> to apply this concept of super protection to all the or more sites of special scientific interest would be a draconian measure <e> <s> it would also mean that both the physical and financial resources of the nature conservancy council were so strained that the whole object of the governments intentions might well be jeopardised <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to hear that <e> <s> as we are coming to this question later in the debate i hope the noble viscount will be pleased by what we are proposing <e>", "<cs> we have had a very good innings at the start of part ii <e> <s> i should like to start by saying <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for confirming that <e> <s> the nature conservancy council accepts that the afforestation of certain kinds of ground can increase its wildlife content but where afforestation affects sites of special scientific interest it invariably reduces the scientific interest <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord but i think he muddled the committee by the use of the word notification instead of designation <e>", "<cs> that is correct after all agreements and everything else has been discussed <e> <s> my noble friends amendments seek to deal with the rest of the sites of special scienctific interest which would not be covered by such super protection <e> <s> my noble friends lord middleton lord sandford and lord burton spoke on this as did the noble viscount lord thurso <e> <s> first the amendments impose a duty upon the nature conservancy council to notify all owners and occupiers of such land that the land is of special interest <e> <s> secondly the landowner is to be told precisely why <e> <s> thirdly he is to be told what operations will be damaging to that interest <e> <s> the amendments also require owners and occupiers to give days notice of any of the potentially damaging operations during which time the nature conservancy council must either reach agreement with the owner or ask the secretary of state to impose super protection which he must also do within the period of days otherwise the owner is free to proceed <e> <s> finally they propose that all sites of special scientific interest should be a land charge <e>", "<cs> to take first the points raised by my noble friend yes <e> <s> to take next the point raised by the noble baroness i probably went into that sentence too quickly <e> <s> the government will be tabling amendments for the three facts which cover my noble friends amendment <e> <s> i then said after a long full stop i should make it clear however that whatever happens it will not be possible for the nature conservancy council to notify everybody of all these things the day after the act is passed <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure to which amendment my noble friend is referring <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could come back to that in a minute <e> <s> with regard to capital transfer tax as your lordships have been made aware by my noble friend lord caithness there is a provision for the treasury to agree exemption from the application of capital transfer tax in relation to a site of special scientific interest <e> <s> i can assure the committee that an sssi can be expected to satisfy the criteria under section of the finance act <e>", "<cs> the land charges will affect any restriction which is placed on the land for future use in other words it would be the and also the ctt <e> <s> what it does not affect is where there is an agreement which does not bind ones successors <e> <s> of course there is no land charge then <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is correct although quantifying these things is slightly difficult as we have already discovered once or twice <e>", "<cs> it is a little difficult with questions coming left and right <e> <s> my noble friend lord chelwood asked for clarification on ctt <e> <s> i was not aware of the <e>", "<cs> once again the noble lord is using the word notification rather haphazardly <e> <s> as i have just informed the committee we are progressing because we are doing notification by the ncc to landowners on three different points <e> <s> when it comes to designation orders that is somthing different <e> <s> designation orders are new in this bill and they are the basis of clause and those orders which we are bandying about as being or can be any number <e> <s> there is no reason why it should not be more and as my noble friend lord de la warr has said we do not know how many more <e> <s> if the government turn the economic corner by october we may have a lot of money and be able to expand the ncc and we may be able to designate more but at the moment this is our plan <e> <s> we think it is a good plan and we think it goes a long way to meet most of the points which have been raised today <e>", "<cs> rather than protracting this argument i would prefer the noble lord to move the amendment <e>", "<cs> i can assure my noble friend that those three points which i made in my speech do cover that first amendment and the government will be tabling amendments to that effect <e>", "<cs> first i should like to respond to the noble baroness <e> <s> we were really trying to tidy up this section and not in any way trying to restrict it <e> <s> she mentioned the words national interest <e> <s> those words were difficult to define and i hope that the words national importance give as it were a little more flavour <e> <s> certainly all sssis are eligible for it <e> <s> your lordships may remember that during earlier discussions in the committee stage we had some arguments about owners and occupiers <e> <s> for that reason we have put in at present the word persons <e> <s> we have no wish whatever to narrow the definition <e> <s> the aim was to tie it in with conservation <e>", "<cs> i can only say that it is certainly not the governments intention to narrow it <e> <s> certainly all sssis are there and obviously we prefer this amendment to what was in the bill previously or we should not have tabled it <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett made a point about <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee perhaps i might suggest to my noble friend that he could speak to these amendments when we come to amendment no <e> <s> and then he can either retable them or withdraw them <e>", "<cs> may i say a word about the amendment of my noble friend before moving on to lord melchetts amendment <e> <s> the difficulty about site of special scientific interest is that it is a term used by among others local planning authorities water authorities and conservation movements <e> <s> to use the term solely for those areas which have been designated by an order made by my right honourable friend would we think cause considerable confusion <e>", "<cs> i actually said order but i think area would be much better <e>", "<cs> perhaps i might just say in reply to the noble lord lord melchett that we accept this in principal and will consider tabling an amendment along the lines of this point <e>", "<cs> from the governments point of view that would be perfectly in order if the committee so agrees <e>", "<cs> the intention of the amendment is to give publicity locally and nationally to an individuals intention to change the way in which he is currently using his land <e> <s> it will become a requirement for the nature conservancy council to publish notices in the local papers on two successive weeks and in the <e>", "<cs> i very much take the point that the noble lord has made <e> <s> thinking through the matter as he was speaking i wondered whether the nature conservancy council itself might read about it and take it on board <e> <s> perhaps the point does not require legislation in this particular bill but i shall certainly think about it <e>", "<cs> the government have not really considered this particular proposition in isolation from the package originally presented by my noble friend <e> <s> however i undertake to consider this addition as a separate matter and then let my noble friend know the solution <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble lord lord melchett has behaved a little like a chameleon because a little while ago he was pleased with me but now he has changed <e> <s> however i should like to bring the committee back to discuss this particular amendment slightly more dispassionately than the whole of clause because what we do not want to do is to put on the ncc a task which it would be difficult for them to carry out <e> <s> i take my noble friends point that some things happen to ancient monuments and historic buildings and therefore why should not small sssis be treated in the same way <e> <s> the answer is that they have got to become an sssi at some time and i think they ought to become it directly they are not an ancient monument <e> <s> this may sound a strange remark but later on in the case of some of the amendments set down i shall be referring to the ancient monuments in regard to some of the points raised <e> <s> we honestly believe that it is difficult to justify one mechanism for large areas and another for small areas because our aim is to protect all areas of special scientific interest whether large or small <e>", "<cs> what they would want to do <e>", "<cs> i certainly take the point made by the noble baroness on this issue <e> <s> i think it would be difficult to tie the penalities for the offence to the area involved as is suggested <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is obviously basing the argument on the principle of each egg as in an earlier case <e> <s> quite honestly where there is power to proceed by way of indictment with a view to seeking the penalty of imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or an unlimited fine i think that is serious enough <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord did hear me say not exceeding two years or an unlimited fine <e> <s> the position as i think the noble lord is well aware is that i am trying to get clear what will actually happen with regard to imprisonment and if we can get agreement that imprisonment is not the right answer then we should take into account the fact that a fine could be increased <e>", "<cs> i had not realised that this amendment was following so quickly on the one moved by the noble baroness lady david <e> <s> my answer is basically the same <e> <s> i am trying very hard to get rid of imprisonment <e> <s> it is being considered at the moment by the various government departments and as soon as i have a solution i shall come back to your lordships <e>", "<cs> the idea is attractive <e> <s> but although the noble lord was quite convincing i think in conservation terms this may be a little unrealistic <e> <s> i have sympathy with the amendment <e> <s> i think it is designed as the noble lord said to bring home to potential offenders the seriousness with which the committee would view their transgressions <e> <s> i am hopeful that we have provided sufficient deterrent in the penalties contained in the clause <e> <s> i am still doubtful of the practicality that the land can be reinstated although the noble lord said it would be at the judges discretion to one which approximates to that state in which it was before the operation was carried out <e> <s> therefore it is really on pragmatic grounds that i would ask the committee to reject this amendment <e> <s> having so said and without giving any undertaking i should like to bear this in mind if we do change the penalties generally as something which could be brought up with the legal people <e> <s> i do not think i could give any better undertaking than that at this stage <e>", "<cs> as i said right at the beginning the government are quite attracted to this and bearing in mind what noble lords and the noble baroness have said of course we will have a look at it and see how we can package it up if at all with the other parts <e>", "<cs> the effect of subsection as drafted is to allow emergency operations to be carried out on land designated by the secretary of state under clause otherwise than in compliance with the ordinary requirements of the clause <e> <s> in emergency situations it would be unreasonable to expect compliance to be in accordance with the ordinary requirements relating to written consent <e> <s> however the person carrying out the operation would be required to supply particulars of the operation including details of the emergency as soon as practicable after the commencement of the operation <e> <s> it might not be feasible to consider other possible means of meeting the emergency which would result in the land not being damaged and this is what we are really looking for and we would not wish to place obstacles in the path of people who are seeking to deal with a real emergency <e> <s> i would hope that they would consider the effects of their actions on the features of scientific interest but in these situations the objective must be to act quickly <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point <e> <s> as we have it at the moment the person carrying out the operation would be required to supply particulars of the operation including details of the emergency as soon as practicable after commencement <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord donaldson got carried away quite a bit there because we undertook to table some amendments if my noble friend withdrew his <e>", "<cs> the governments state of mind is not confused at all <e> <s> i am perfectly happy about these land charges <e> <s> the obvious safeguard is the fact that we are now tabling these three amendments which will notify the owners of the property if it is an sssi <e>", "<cs> i am sorry but the noble lord lord melchett did not acknowledge that point in his argument so the situation is not as it was yesterday it is as it is tomorrow <e> <s> if the bill as drafted goes through there will be notification to the owners of sssis as to that for which they are responsible and as to what it is which has not happened in the past as a number of noble lords mentioned <e>", "<cs> i have written down such remarks as thank you for nothing and worse than useless <e> <s> it really is ridiculous <e> <s> here we have a piece of legislation aimed at conserving and aimed at conserving sites of special interest <e> <s> people are going too far in the wrong direction over this <e> <s> we have had a great deal of talk from the conservationists today <e> <s> may i remind everybody that this bill was not drafted by a pen in minutes <e> <s> there was a lot of prior consultation <e> <s> the aim of this bill is to conserve and to get a balance of conservation among all the people who use the country <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to believe that any order under clause would make land unsaleable as is implied by the terms of the amendment <e> <s> neither are the government convinced that an order is likely to result in any appreciable reduction in the value of an interest in land when one weighs the advantages of designated land <e> <s> in this respect as i have said previously we consider that the right to compensation for loss or damage arising from enforced delay in being able to carry out a specified operation after the service of an operations notice constitutes a valuable right and that is what my noble friend lord craigton rightly mentioned <e>", "<cs> personally i have not <e>", "<cs> i think that we might already have covered this point to a certain degree <e> <s> the amendment seeks to provide for the payment of compensation in respect of a reduction in the value of an interest in land resulting from the making of an order under this clause <e> <s> if the effect of making an order is in itself such as to cause a reduction in the value of land we consider that any such reduction <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome back the noble lord who has not been here all day nor was he <e>", "<cs> i am informed that the purpose of this amendment is to add the further restriction that compensation shall not be payable in respect of any loss in potential revenue arising from an activity which has not been carried out on the land in the previous years <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be i believe to rule out of consideration most circumstances in which compensation for the loss of potential revenue would be payable and we must accept that when in the national interest a person is prevented from carrying out an operation which but for the making of the order he would have been able to execute without let or hindrance and with the expectation of increasing his revenue he should be able to have the opportunity to obtain compensation which we think this amendment also rules out <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord is producing an area of deviousness which the government have not been devious enough yet to have looked at <e> <s> i will certainly have a look at it <e>", "<cs> i do not think that compensation comes into that particular paragraph <e> <s> i will take what the noble lord lord beaumont has said into account with the remarks of the noble lord lord melchett and the noble baroness lady david and their amendment <e> <s> the purpose of this clause is to provide for compensation in those circumstances where a landowner has suffered financial loss because of a restriction imposed upon him as a consequence of the imposition of an order under section <e> <s> it is not to provide compensation by virtue of the need to notify certain operations except in those cases where he had already incurred expense before the need to notify arose and that expense had become abortive <e> <s> neither is it intended to provide for a hypothetical loss or gain in the value of land as a result of designation alone i mean without subsequent restriction <e> <s> such compensation would be both contrary to government policy and precedent and almost impossible to establish <e> <s> in this we have a duty to the taxpayer as well as to the owner <e>", "<cs> that would be entirely crystal gazing <e>", "<cs> my lords in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could intervene at this stage with the governments view <e> <s> i should like to answer one or two points which have been made <e> <s> of course the government accept that there is damage to the countryside but i do not particularly want to rehearse the arguments that i made yesterday about the very fact that we are producing the bill and debating it to this degree shows our interest <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill mentioned the people <e> <s> of course all people can go to the countryside <e> <s> we are all gods people both farmers and conservationists <e> <s> he also mentioned the ncc <e> <s> we have a very close relationship with the ncc and in fact unless i am very much mistaken there are probably two members of the ncc in the box at the moment <e> <s> they advise the government and we accept their advice wherever possible <e> <s> we have to keep a balance between all people <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment is intended to bring agriculture and forestry under planning control throughout the country by means of a basic amendment of the town and country planning act <e> <s> may i just mention that i think the correct reference should be section <e>", "<cs> if that minority is outside the sites then they are outside the sites and there is nothing of specific scientific interest to watch over them with <e>", "<cs> in answer to that i must say that nature over the last few years has continued to produce the added carrots that bring people into this country and although many noble lords have said that the countryside is disappearing and of course it is these are special arrangements for things which are disappearing for which we are trying to make special conservation arrangements <e> <s> but if the noble lord is talking about the whole countryside of great britain outside the sssis then we trust in our people <e>", "<cs> one of the difficulties of this amendment was that until my noble friend moved it we were not quite sure which way he wanted to go <e> <s> having heard it we can of course consider it <e> <s> as my noble friend lord burton intervened there i was not sure if he paraphrased his remarks by saying what kind of road he was talking about <e> <s> if he was talking about motorways we agree with him entirely and that is what we said <e>", "<cs> we all welcome this excellent introduction to clause by the noble lord lord winstanley who is such an expert on the subject and who has spoken so persuasively <e> <s> the amendments proposed by him as i am sure he realises will completely change the sense and scope of clause <e> <s> there will be a compulsory notification requirement within the act itself not imposed by an order made by the ministers at discretion when and where necessary <e> <s> this would apply over an enormously wide range of land all national parks and all areas of outstanding natural beauty in england and wales <e> <s> the requirement <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could ease matters here by just saying what is the governments view <e> <s> afforestation proposals are already covered by the agreed arrangements involving consultations between the forestry commission agricultural departments and <e>", "<cs> we are slightly surprised by the amendment although we realise the reason for it <e> <s> ever since the moorland notification system was proposed in the former governments countryside bill over two years ago the idea has been that the farmer should know where he stands within three months of informing the national park authority of a proposed agricultural operation and should be free to go ahead if he has not by then been refused consent <e> <s> here we have a proposal to reduce that period to two months <e> <s> apart from what my noble friend has said in this debate there has been no pressure for this change although the reason is fairly plain <e>", "<cs> we are surprised that this amendment should arise when a similar existing power embodied in section of the countryside act has the negative resolution procedure <e> <s> that procedure was considered appropriate for moorland notification orders during the debates in another place on the former countryside bill <e> <s> there has been no pressure until now for anything different <e>", "<cs> of course we agree to this in substance <e> <s> the desired effect is achieved automatically under section of the local land charges act <e> <s> i am informed that it is not the practice to provide in statutes for items to be local land charges where they are already local land charges by virtue of the act <e> <s> therefore there is no need for the amendment <e>", "<cs> first i should like to thank my noble friend lord ridley for introducing this amendment so calmly so reasonably and in such a well-balanced way <e> <s> he said that it was going to be a battle but he did it in a very nice way <e> <s> i recognise that these three new clauses and associated amendments are designed to incorporate into the bill the moorland conservation order provisions of the previous governments countryside bill <e> <s> but before i explain why the government do not wish to accept these amendments i must draw attention to one aspect of the proposals <e> <s> by following in other respects the pattern of a former bill as amended in a commons committee these proposals fail to contain an important safeguard which we understand the previous government intended to introduce at a subsequent stage of the bill a provision that the national park committee must offer the farmer a voluntary management agreement before the compulsory moorland conservation order power would be usable <e>", "<cs> the question of french aid is a matter for the governments of france and vanuatu <e> <s> however despite the fact that the french ambassador to vanuatu has been declared <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a delicate matter and i do not particularly wish to be drawn into these issues at the present time <e> <s> the french officials arrived in vanuatu only last saturday and as i said in my opening reply the question of co-operation at the moment is still on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for the tenor of his remarks and his wise advice <e> <s> i think i can say that her majestys government fully appreciate everything he has said and are on course with what he says <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand the noble lords question it is about a million post-independence agreement <e> <s> at the moment that agreement has not been signed by either party and still lies on the table <e> <s> that is why at the moment it is a very delicate situation to comment on from london <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are sympathetic to this bill and have adopted a neutral position <e> <s> the right reverend prelate the bishop of london explained to the house at an earlier stage that there are rights of objection and other safeguards in the bill for the relatives of those buried in the disused burial grounds concerned <e> <s> the bill also provides for recording the removal of human remains and memorials and for the copying of inscriptions <e> <s> the technical amendments agreed to by your lordships in committee now make it quite clear that the duties and obligations in the bill apply equally to a subsequent owner if the land is disposed of by a church before the prescribed procedures are completed <e>", "<cs> my lords as stated by my noble friend lord carrington on the th may we have proposed that diplomatic relations should be restored without waiting for a resolution of the financial problems which have so far stood in the way <e> <s> regrettably the albanians have not agreed but the offer remains open <e> <s> meanwhile we are continuing to pursue a resolution of the financial questions <e>", "<cs> my lords the compliance by albania with the judgment of the international court of justice would help but there are a number of claims upon the gold <e> <s> there are two other members of the commission involved and the solution of the problems does not therefore depend on the british government alone but i should like to repeat what i said in my original answer that the offer to the albanians is still on the table <e>", "<cs> my lords there is none <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this stage since i feel that otherwise we are in danger of rehearsing what we discussed on the third day of the committee <e> <s> first with regard to my noble friends amendment i should like to deal briefly with the question of the phrase other living thing <e> <s> the government are satisfied that the term flora and fauna which is used throughout the bill covers all living things in respect of which consultation is required and that the words suggested in the amendment are not necessary <e>", "<cs> i must interrupt my noble friend <e> <s> it is not the same argument is it <e> <s> i would ask your lordships to think just a little <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i draw attention to section of the water act which specifically lays down the duties with regard to nature conservation and amenity <e> <s> it reads <e>", "<cs> speaking first to amendment no <e> <s> b as the noble baroness pointed out this would delete the existing sub-paragraph and insert a new sub-paragraph in its place <e> <s> the government think that the existing sub-paragraph provides a clear no worsening guarantee for any person who is transferred from the civil service to the employment of the commission on the appointed day provided of course as the noble baroness pointed out that he continues to be engaged on reasonably comparable work <e> <s> the effect of the amendment would be to link the terms and conditions of service in the commission with those prevailing in the civil service for all staff and for all time <e> <s> the government believe that it would be quite wrong to tie the hands of the commission in this way <e> <s> i think that is where i differ from the noble baroness <e> <s> the existing sub-paragraph is in a standard form and has been applied in other cases where civil servants have been transferred to the employment of an independent body and the government can see no grounds for making a change <e>", "<cs> perhaps i shall be able to in one second and in the meantime i will get on to the other amendment <e> <s> that concerns consultation and the government fully accept the need for regular consultation between management and unions as part of good industrial relations practice <e> <s> however we are not persuaded by the precedents which in fact the noble baroness has cited that it would be either necessary or indeed right to include in the bill specific provisions on the lines proposed in the amendment <e> <s> for one thing it is not easy to see how the provision for arbitration operates in relation to a requirement for approval of levels of remuneration by the secretary of <e>", "<cs> the government of course recognise and indeed sympathise with the objectives of the amendment <e> <s> the duty laid upon ministers and others by section of the act of is a most important one and my colleagues in government are firm in their determination to abide by that duty <e> <s> i find it slightly difficult to introduce accountability in the form of an annual report to parliament in that i would have thought the secretaries of state were in any event accountable to parliament <e> <s> the idea of producing an annual report on what they do strikes me as being slightly strange <e> <s> i have not got the background the noble lord produced for me so i would like to look at this again <e> <s> i am not terribly hopeful for that reason but i will investigate it and let him know how far i can go <e>", "<cs> i take most of the points which have been made but i did not like the reference to not seriously <e> <s> we have taken the matter very <e>", "<cs> i take the point of the noble lord lord winstanley <e> <s> of course clause catches us a little on government policy which i explained when we went through clause <e> <s> equally of course we had a vote on the matter and the voting figures will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords the promised increase in defence spending has taken place <e> <s> the defence budget for will be per cent <e> <s> higher in real terms than in the last year of the previous administration <e> <s> in the same period substantial increases in our teeth arms have been achieved <e> <s> the regular armed forces are stronger and the volunteer reserves higher than when we took office <e> <s> the government have announced the decision to purchase trident as the replacement for polaris and other major new equipment programmes <e> <s> an additional armoured regiment has been formed in baor and the number of tanks manned has risen from to <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble and gallant lord for the compliment about a rise in the peerage <e> <s> i did state that the regular armed forces are stronger and that the volunteer forces are higher than when we took office <e> <s> i also said that an additional armoured regiment had been formed in baor and the number of tanks manned has risen <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as naval arms are concerned we have as i am sure the noble earl is aware planned orders for ships for next year and tenders for the coming year under consideration include a nuclear-powered fleet submarine two frigates and minesweeping trawlers among other vessels <e>", "<cs> if it is convenient to your lordships that we should now take the statement i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> perhaps at this moment i could put the governments view <e> <s> of course the government are sympathetic to the wish to reduce livestock-worrying by dogs <e> <s> this new clause would make it an offence for any person to allow a dog to stray from the line of a public path in a field or enclosure containing sheep or lambs <e> <s> under subsection it would be a defence in any proceedings to show that the dog was under control on a lead of reasonable length <e>", "<cs> may i just clarify the point for the noble baroness <e> <s> the countryside commission publishes a code which is a code of advice and that covers scotland <e> <s> i am sure that they will take note of the fact that it does not seem to be reaching the noble baronesss part of scotland <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord milverton has said this is acceptable to the government in principle and we will consider drafting something on these lines at the next stage <e>", "<cs> this starts by saying the government fully recognise that this subject is highly controversial <e> <s> i think that is a masterly understatement <e> <s> the present situation in england and wales is regarded as unsatisfactory by all major interested parties <e> <s> some areas have total ban bylaws others have bylaws which permit a bull of any breed to be at large with cows or heifers and some areas have no controls at all on bulls on public footpaths <e> <s> in fact east and west sussex have two different regulations so either a walker or a bull in east or west sussex would have difficulties in knowing whether he could go into a field or not <e> <s> as my noble friend lord bellwin said at second reading to have different rules applying in different counties is confusing and unsatisfactory and as the bylaw-making powers are now vested in district councils the position may well get even more confused in the future <e> <s> the noble lord lord melchett made a considerable case of the august agreement between the ramblers association the national farmers union and the county landowners association but both the ramblers association and the nfu later withdrew their support and furthermore the association of county councils has expressed strong opposition to those proposals <e> <s> so when we came to this bill we were faced with having to make the decision ourselves <e>", "<cs> quite obviously with this one if he had his spectacles broken there would have been even more difficulty <e> <s> i think it is also pertinent to point out that section of the health and safety at work <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl says this is a drafting amendment <e> <s> i do not feel at the moment that it is quite necessary but i will certainly take it back and have a look at it to see whether our draftsman agrees <e>", "<cs> the government are not unsympathetic to this but as your lordships will see from what i am about to say there are a number of difficulties <e> <s> careful consideration has been given to the possibility of having a system of temporary diversions but there was strong opposition from a wide range of interests including not only the local authority associations but also bodies representing the farmers and the path users to the departments th august consultation paper <e> <s> the proposals included <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords point that if the amendment we have discarded before goes on that is the government policy goes on there is now a new situation <e> <s> this is a good point <e> <s> i think that what the noble lord has suggested on consultation will take longer than between now and report stage <e> <s> if they come to a solution satisfactory to all parties this could be added in the other place on this particular issue <e>", "<cs> if i may intervene with the governments view we have an open mind on this <e> <s> i understand that the informal spicer committee in another place has just produced a report on it favourable to the amendment of lord spens <e> <s> we shall certainly consider the amendment in the light of the spicer committee and if on that undertaking the noble lord is able to withdraw the amendment then so much the better <e>", "<cs> if i may put something on record before i agree that the government will consider this we appreciate that in places like urban fringes some local authorities have to grapple from time to time <e>", "<cs> like the noble lord lord underhill i understand that the rights of way review committee under michael spicers chairmanship have discussed a number of these proposals <e> <s> i put it in the past tense so that your lordships will realise that we actually have got proposals on paper here which represent a package for dealing with problems caused by ploughing on public rights of way <e> <s> the government would certainly be willing to consider suitable amending legislation but before going any further i should like to be satisfied that these amendments are generally acceptable <e> <s> we will of course consult with farming and local authority interests but we should like to have time to digest these and bring forward something on report <e>", "<cs> i can well appreciate the reasons why the noble lord lord underhill has put forward this amendment <e> <s> i hope the committee will not feel me to be ungenerous at the moment if i say that we prefer not to have it and i will explain why <e> <s> when a highway ceases to exist as the noble lord has said through natural causes it is clearly right that consideration should be given to whether it ought to be replaced but whether the highway authority should in all circumstances be obliged to replace or restore it is debatable <e> <s> for example there may well be cases of land-slip where restoration or replacement is impossible or pointless having regard to the continuing nature of the problem <e>", "<cs> i see the point made by the noble lord lord melchett and equally i hope that he will see mine <e> <s> we are getting very nervous about things on the highway and so on coming into this bill which we do not consider should be there <e> <s> i take his point about the replacement of bridleways and footpaths and we will see what can be done on that issue <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett was quite correct when he said that this would give effect to section of the highways act a power to highway and local authorities to require operators on land to abate any nuisance caused by barbed wire fences <e> <s> this would now do it with electric fences as well <e> <s> the government take much the same view as they did on the last amendment <e> <s> we feel that this is too wide in that it affects the highways act <e> <s> equally however as i said on the last amendment if the committee are referring to bridleways and paths which we are discussing more in this bill i should be quite happy to take it back though i am slightly less optimistic regarding this amendment than the previous one <e> <s> however we will certainly have a look at it <e>", "<cs> the amendment put down by the noble lord lord avebury concerns the preservation of boundary features to rights of way <e> <s> the previous amendments of the noble lord dealt with wide unmetalled tracks or greenways which were of special interest or value on landscape or other grounds <e> <s> the clause which we are now considering however has much more extensive application <e> <s> it applies to all <e>", "<cs> i fully recognise that the sign posting and waymarking of rights of way is of considerable benefit to path-users and that it also benefits landowners by helping to prevent trespass which is often unintentional <e> <s> i believe it was originally hoped that the task of signposting required to be carried out in accordance with section of the act would be substantially completed within four to five years but although some counties have now almost completed the task others unfortunately have made very little progress <e>", "<cs> the proposed new clause covers highways and is not confined to bridleways or similarly unmetalled ways <e> <s> the amendment is therefore a matter really for general highway legislation and as with amendments nos <e> <s> and the government do not want to put these matters into the countryside bill <e> <s> having so said the government have been keeping a careful eye on this particular situation <e> <s> they note that the spicer committee is now expressing its support but equally that the british horse society has set out some counter-arguments <e> <s> we shall look very carefully at what has been said today <e> <s> i was going to ask my noble friend not to press the government to put this amendment into the bill because we would hope that it would be included in a suitable transport bill <e>", "<cs> i think i said in my remarks that the spicer committee were supporting it already <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> the amendment makes it clear that the right to ride a bicycle over a bridleway <e>", "<cs> it is drafted this way purely because we thought that only parts ii and iii can have any relevance to section of the act <e> <s> parts i and iv which we omitted deal respectively with the protection of birds other animals and plants and miscellaneous and general matters <e> <s> the government submit that there is little or nothing to be gained by the amendment put forward by my noble friends but if they are not prepared to withdraw it at this stage certainly i will not fight against it <e>", "<cs> it is very nice to have the noble lord lord renton speaking as both alpha and omega <e> <s> i believe that he launched amendment no <e> <s> and here he is tonight with the final one <e>", "<cs> i am very grateful for the remarks of both noble lords opposite <e> <s> i should also like to thank very much the team which has been helping me on the front bench and those wonderful people who provide me with all the information from the box and who have worked so hard <e> <s> while speaking about ones own supporters i think i may have to ask the noble lord the leader of the house if i can have some driving mirrors here so that i can see what is going on behind me sometimes it seems to be applause and sometimes it is not quite so happy <e> <s> i look forward to the report stage <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister for the arts is still considering what alternative arrangements he should make in order to ensure that the slide loan service will continue <e> <s> he intends to make an announcement as soon as the details are sufficiently settled <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot say yes or no to some of the statistics of the noble lord but may i remind him that the slide service is still going on <e> <s> the government are conscious of the need to maintain it in an uninterrupted form <e> <s> to permit a period of closure would inconvenience all the users whether lecturers teachers public school pupils students or <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for those remarks <e> <s> not only are the government aware of future contracts being in jeopardy but they know that present contracts are in that situation as well <e> <s> that is why i said that the government were conscious of the need to maintain the service in an uninterrupted form <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have confidence in the director of the victoria and albert and on this issue are trying to find an alternative solution <e>", "<cs> my lords the director has made a decision of his own with regard to the slide museum and one within his own province <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has asked a number of different questions <e> <s> perhaps it would be easiest if with the leave of the house i repeat what <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are most grateful to the select committee for the work that they have done in producing this report <e> <s> it is a <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying his point <e> <s> i must confess that i had an answer to that but i seem to have missed the point <e> <s> i know that his comments on that subject will be read with interest <e> <s> my noble friend lord buxton of alsa mentioned a north sea convention <e> <s> i am sure that this too will be taken on board and i see no reason at all why such a convention should not be called <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i possibly rather purposely skated round the noble lords point when i said that the current review of the environment action programme takes place in a rather bleak economic climate <e> <s> however i am aware of his question on this and i will find out what the correct answer is and let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords resolution / adopted by consensus at the thirty-fifth session of the united nations general assembly in december requested the secretary-general to undertake the necessary studies for the consideration of the united nations committee on information <e> <s> her majestys government await the outcome of these studies <e>", "<cs> my lords this is of course one of the matters which will now be looked at by the united nations <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord that <e>", "<cs> my lords the united kingdom delegation to the tenth session of the law of the sea conference will continue to work towards the conclusion of an acceptable convention as soon as possible and will consult with other delegations as appropriate on how this objective can best be met <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble lord for his earlier remarks i cannot go along at all with his final sentence <e> <s> since the recent press statement by the united states government her majestys government have not had time for formal consultations about the convention with other commowealth governments as a group but the united kingdom delegation will be sounding out other delegations at the conference including those commonwealth countries for their views <e> <s> i am sure that what the noble lord said in his earlier remarks will be taken into account <e> <s> equally may i remind him that the conference started only today <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that a great deal is being based upon the press statement which was made only on rd march last <e> <s> the united states statement does not mean that the united states will block all progress on the convention <e> <s> we hope that negotiations on outstanding problems can continue <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in an earlier reply this conference is meeting again today <e> <s> at the moment we do not know how the countries are going to react and it would be unwise to prejudge that at the moment <e> <s> her majestys government are firmly committed to the achievement of a comprehensive law of the sea convention which fully safeguards our defence economic and commercial interests <e> <s> we hope to see early agreement on these negotiations <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her support <e> <s> i hope there was no levity on my face <e> <s> i was trying to listen <e>", "<cs> my lords the government quite appreciate what the noble lords lord beaumont of whitley and lord melchett have done since the previous time that we discussed this <e> <s> we have tried in the bill to regulate the minority interests and treat birds differently from the rest of the community but still in the case of night shooting we have not so far been persuaded that the action is required <e> <s> this shooting occurs only for a fortnight of the year that is true but further to restrict the few occasions when it can occur in this way seems to us to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment has the effect of applying clause provisions to captive-bred birds which escape or are released to the wild <e> <s> these birds are not covered by clause because if a clause did apply to them it would mean that a person <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been recognised the noble lord lord melchett has tabled a modified version of an amendment put down in committee <e> <s> it seeks to prohibit the shooting of schedule species in england and wales which would as he said bring the position in line with scotland <e> <s> the scottish advisory committee in considering the scottish position suggested no change <e> <s> but they did not go further than that they would not advise south of the border and the present position namely a total ban in scotland and a prohibition in certain areas in england and wales reflects traditional practice and custom and the government do not feel there is any reason to alter that position <e> <s> there is of course no conservation case for any form of prohibition but we accept it is appropriate to continue to allow for traditional practice and beliefs <e> <s> we have also retained the power to allow the secretary of state to make orders prohibiting shooting of quarry species on sundays in any area and we believe that this reflects the right balance and i therefore hope the noble lord will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and which as the noble lord lord kilbracken has explained are consequential <e> <s> the government as he has also explained really do not accept that the result of these amendments would be better than the present position which is carried forward in the bill from the protection of birds acts <e> <s> we regard it as right to provide that the sale season is longer than the open season to allow persons to dispose of birds killed legally and many of your lordships would not regard birds killed on the last days of the season as edible until the end of the sale period anyway <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not want to get involved in amending the game act and take the point that this is a conservation bill and should not interfere with the game act <e> <s> i should like to come back to the capercaillie because if i understand my noble friend lord burton correctly he has an interest in the conservation of the capercaillie and i fail to see why putting it in the game act would help to conserve it <e> <s> if we lengthen the season it will be shot more and the nature conservancy council have said that that is a bad idea <e> <s> if it becomes subject to game shooting probably it will be more widely shot <e> <s> bearing that in mind i should have thought that if my noble friend were to leave it with us it might be advisable to go back to the ncc and get their advice on the capercaillie with regard to making sure that it is not over-shot <e> <s> with that i hope my noble friend will feel able to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if my noble friend will give way may i remind him that these amendments are not about the jack snipe <e> <s> we are at the report stage and if we could try to speak to the subject i think it would be helpful <e> <s> if i may reply to the noble baroness lady phillips who noted the point concerning christmas day and sundays that is a carry-over from the act and these are the traditional practices carried over into the wildlife act <e> <s> if i could now turn <e>", "<cs> no my lords and what is more the amendment we have just passed means that there will be no shooting of quarry species anywhere on a sunday <e> <s> regarding woodcock the government carefully considered the advice given by the ncc but concluded that they could not accept the recommendations as we were not satisfied that an adequate conservation case had been put forward <e> <s> that is basically what my noble friend lord onslow said <e> <s> we believe it is inappropriate to make a change for reasons other than those concerning the conservation of the species <e> <s> as regards snipe again the government believe it to be wrong that one should extend protection to a species essentially for the protection of others <e> <s> this is what we believe a major case was made on <e> <s> i should like to speak only to those two now and to speak again to wildfowl later <e>", "<cs> my lords i have very little to add to what we said at committee stage <e> <s> we do not think that a conservation case is fully proven in this case either and i said then that licences would be available at this end of the season though not of course at the other end of the season <e> <s> the noble lord lord donaldson spoke about shooting in cold spells which is particularly bad and we would of course issue a ban under clause to cover this <e> <s> i believe he also said there was little conservation need but that it was purely a matter of disturbance of other creatures at this particular stage <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house may i clarify one point which the noble lord lord melchett made about the period <e> <s> the ban is after days but we can have a period of restraint after seven to days <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house as the noble lord is aware i replied to the first two i think probably on purpose <e> <s> i have in front of me a long paper on this subject but i am not sure from whom it comes so i cannot give him an answer <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it is a duplication of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the government continue to resist this amendment for the reasons given at the committee stage on the grounds that we want shooting to be included here because it is specifically the shooter that we are intending it against the basic point being that the nature conservancy council is the adviser throughout this bill <e> <s> however in view of my unsatisfactory reply on the previous amendment i should like to take this back and look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords having checked up on this as opposed to the one before i can say that it is in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord melchett has rehearsed all my arguments not only about amendment no <e> <s> but about my words of warning in this context <e> <s> as he said it is purely that parliamentary counsel advise that it would not have the effect he suggests but the noble lord has argued the case on that point and i must leave it to him <e>", "<cs> my lords certainly my reading of the bill is as the noble lord lord melchett has stated and i shall check as to whether i am correct <e> <s> certainly the governments view is as has been stated but if the position is otherwise obviously we shall have to do something about it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could intervene here <e> <s> i think sentimentally we are all against catapults and i should like your lordships to consider very seriously whether in this bill on conservation we should include catapults <e> <s> as the noble lord lord houghton has mentioned we discussed this in committee on an amendment moved by my noble friend lord gibson-watt <e> <s> the government have again considered the question of adding catapults to the prohibited methods listed for birds and mammals in both clause and clause <e> <s> we asked the advisory committees for their views <e> <s> they considered that a prohibition is not justified in present circumstances and we are in agreement with this <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in considerable difficulty <e> <s> at one stage and quite genuinely we wrote to the noble lord lord melchett saying that we liked the words causes or permits and would see what happened <e> <s> however they have come back very much on the same point as my noble friend lord belstead has spoken about <e> <s> i am advised that these words would not add anything to section of the magistrates courts act which provides that any person who aids abets counsels or procures the commission by another person of a summary offence shall be guilty of a like offence <e> <s> inclusion of the words would not be meaningful for absolute offences which do not involve intention <e> <s> the offences in the bill of course all require intention <e> <s> that is the advice which we have been given and i shall have to ask the noble lord to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords though i appreciate the reasons behind lord swanseas amendment i am not satisfied that to provide in the bill for an exception of this nature is the best way of proceeding for three reasons <e> <s> first this bill like the protection of birds act is likely to be in force for a considerable period of time and we do not think that to build in this inflexibility is desirable <e> <s> secondly we do not know how the european community directive on birds will develop over the years and thirdly we also do not know though no difficulties are anticipated the reaction to our allowing use of these weapons against pests <e> <s> while we are satisfied that a statutory exception would not be contrary to the directive as presently drafted it might create unnecessary difficulties for us in europe <e> <s> here i must say to my noble friend that we are a member of the european community we join in the debates on their directives and we are of course party to this directive <e> <s> with the greatest respect i think that we should make sure that this directive works <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilbracken has suggested that it should not be an offence to have in possession a young bird that has not been registered and ringed <e> <s> the government cannot accept this since it would create a loophole for the unscrupulous and would undermine the provision <e> <s> we accept that persons will have in their possession birds that have not been registered and ringed because for example they have only recently been hatched <e> <s> suitable provision for this situation probably in the form of a reporting duty will be made in regulations to ensure that it is possible to breed in captivity while complying with the law <e> <s> i hope that in light of that explanation the noble lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that that was more or less the tenor of my reply <e> <s> that is exactly what we should be aiming to do probably in some regulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend has summed up the feeling of the house <e> <s> the first schedule is mainly a list of birds with a small breeding population and i am advised by the ncc that the hen harrier is such a bird <e> <s> the population represents only a small fraction of its numbers in the last century <e> <s> research has shown that the reason for its decline and for its failure to regain lost ground is due almost entirely to persecution by man <e> <s> this species has had a considerable amount of work carried out on it and as the noble lord lord melchett has said there is further research going on at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not going to argue with the experts on figures <e> <s> according to my brief the bird population is estimated at about and is still increasing <e> <s> maybe they are all up in one part of scotland <e> <s> as the noble lord lord melchett has said the sparrowhawk was once listed on schedule of the protection of birds act and was put on schedule following the catastrophic decline in the late fifties and early sixties due mainly to the organic chlorides <e> <s> we have proposed it for removal from the specially protected list on the advice of the advisory committees <e> <s> this is past history because at the committee stage we took it up again <e> <s> the whole matter was referred back to the advisory committees and the ncc following lord melchetts suggestion that the species should be retained on schedule because it was still persecuted in some areas and rare in others <e>", "<cs> my lords did my noble friend ask whether there is a decline or why there is a decline <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think my noble friend will bear me out this is such a secretive bird <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could say a little about the thinking behind schedule part ii which is the new list of pest species <e> <s> our intention is to comply with the european community birds directive by strictly controlling designation under article of the directive <e> <s> part ii of schedule has been reduced to those species which constitute nationwide pests and are too widespread to be covered by licence <e> <s> to deal with species that have been omitted from schedule part ii as drafted and that includes the three species which are the subject of my noble friends amendments and other species which can be pests at particular times of the year or in particular circumstances or in particular areas we would have an appropriate form of licence <e>", "<cs> my lords when speaking to this point during the committee stage my noble friend lord cullen told the committee of the practical problems which result when animals turn up at a port not nominated in any order made under section of the endangered species act <e> <s> those problems remain but we have of course had a lot of thought given to this subject since the committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has bowled me a fast one on the point about making blackbird pt which i must confess is something had not thought of in relation to this particular amendment <e> <s> the amendment seeks to allow the secretary of state to issue licences for human consumption for gulls eggs only <e> <s> as i said in committee while the government will not issue licences that would go further than was allowed by the protection of birds act as amended by the act the amendment we think is too restrictive <e> <s> subject to the statutory consultation procedures we intend to issue licences for the taking of lapwing eggs before th april and the taking of young gannets on sula sgeir by the nessmen <e> <s> neither of these traditional practices does any conservation harm though in the case of lapwing licences it is unlikely that licences will be issued for areas where the bird is in decline and there is no justification in stopping them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a <e> <s> i think i may well have said a <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give a guarantee at the moment on the latter although when we come to costs i think my noble friend will find my answer as satisfactory as it could be <e> <s> obviously the renewal of a licence causes much less palaver than having a new licence so i think i can give my noble friend an undertaking that if it is legitimate it will be done speedily <e>", "<cs> my lords it is my understanding that there will be no problem for the dyers and vintners companies and a licence could be issued under section if needed <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may come first to my noble friend lord onslows amendment this is identical to one put down in committee <e> <s> i am afraid that i can add little to my remarks at the time <e> <s> it is government policy to ensure that they are not inhibited by law from making charges for the issue of licences which place additional costs on all taxpayers for the benefit of the few where such charges are appropriate <e> <s> charges will not necessarily be levied but the government should not be restricted in their ability to charge an appropriate fee <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord melchett said the words that he proposes for inclusion in clause are similar to those found in the <e>", "<cs> my lords this was a point which my noble friend lord gibson-watt raised in committee <e> <s> i had rather thought that at that stage i had satisfied him <e> <s> i explained then that we have included the provision to give greater flexibility to the system and i quoted the example that it would enable us to make an arrangement for instance with the british trust for ornithology to authorise its members to ring birds <e> <s> the alternative is the present system of a mass of individual applications with all the attendant bureaucracy which i know my noble friend does not like and of course the waste of valuable nature conservancy council resources <e> <s> avoiding this kind of bureaucratic nonsense is dear to the governments heart <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood my noble friends point correctly he was slightly worried about an emergency or some new form of occasion which might arise <e> <s> i do not think he need have any worry but i will look at it again when i can read his comments on another day and i will write to him if i have any doubts <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give the noble lord the assurance he wants although i cannot say it would be a per cent <e> <s> assurance because one <e>", "<cs> my lords i also should like to thank noble lords for their co-operation <e>", "<cs> my lords i was rather thinking that everybody was getting far ahead of their guns <e> <s> i too am grateful for the co-operation from the front benches opposite and from my colleagues who have taken on a great burden today <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that further consideration on report be now adjourned <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport only has records which show the total expenditure on maintenance as opposed to that relating solely to structures <e> <s> for the midland links motorways in the west midland metropolitan county council area this expenditure amounts to l million since for the five years <e>", "<cs> my lords i was with the noble lord right up to his final remarks which i think are slightly excessive <e> <s> but having listened last night until oclock this morning to the songs of the redshank it is even more delightful to hear the noble lord this afternoon <e> <s> the consulting engineers were appointed on behalf of the department by the west midlands metropolitan county council and work started in <e> <s> the inspections were substantially completed <e>", "<cs> my lords from the end of march the bbc external services broadcasts in russian will be increased by minutes a day to a total of hours a week and their broadcasts in turkish by minutes a day to hours a week <e> <s> a new daily -minute service in pushtu will be introduced during the summer <e>", "<cs> my lords we attach the utmost importance to the audibility of the bbc external broadcasts and feel that although of course they have been subject to cuts which are common across the board at the moment they have done extremely well <e> <s> to improve their audibility satellite feeds to the relay stations in the eastern mediterranean and the middle east are being introduced and four new transmitters are planned to be in service by mid- <e>

friend mr ridley is in consultation at present <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the minutes is a complete increase <e> <s> last summer the russians began jamming the bbc russian broadcasts and they were then increased by a further four hours a week to help counter that <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have never had any plans to reduce the world service in english <e>", "<cs> my lords when this subject was discussed during the committee stage we expressed our disquiet at a concept that law enforcement duties should be placed on the nature conservancy council <e> <s> i am glad to see from this amendment that the noble lords moving it have accepted this situation <e> <s> i am sure that the nature conservancy council would be willing to perform the functions proposed in this amendment so far as it was possible to do so within <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just correct one thing that was wrong in my earlier speaking note <e> <s> i should have referred in my second sentence to orders made under sections and <e> <s> i said and i should have read <e>", "<cs> indeed i will my lords <e> <s> to comment briefly on what the noble lord lord kilbracken said in our definition of poultry at present as noble lords now know when we say <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord knows the answer already <e> <s> although the amendment would modernise the definition wording similar to that employed in the definition has been used in the game act and the protection of birds acts for many years without giving rise to any of the problems the noble lord lord kilbracken fears <e> <s> to alter the definition in the bill would therefore be likely to cause confusion <e> <s> the home secretary is firmly opposed to government involvement in the amendment of the game laws and the home office emphasises that it would be most unfortunate if anyone gained the impression that the government were contemplating the amendment of a similar definition of game used in the act or any revision of the game laws <e> <s> it is for that reason and not because we are out of sympathy with the noble lord that i hope he will not press the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the house will be happy to know that the government accept the principle of the inclusion of enabling powers in the bill to allow the provision of statutory protective marine nature reserves and will consider further with a view to resolving any outstanding difficulties <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord will allow me to intervene we are trying to find out more about this <e> <s> the whole point is that we cannot find out where this advice to cumbria came from <e>", "<cs> my lords one discovers something new every day in this particular debate <e> <s> in this case i have discovered that if one writes to a noble lord he may read out my letter and most of my speaking notes will go by the board <e> <s> the government holds in high regard the various voluntary organisations which contribute so much to the cause of nature conservation organisations such as the national trust country naturalists trust and the royal society for the protection of birds which manage extensive nature reserves of a very high quality <e> <s> it seems only proper that a similar status and degree of protection should be available to the best of those reserves as is available to those reserves managed by the ncc <e> <s> that is the purpose of clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way the noble baroness moved her amendments <e> <s> we take it that the third would be as effective as the other two <e> <s> when i wrote to her exactly what was happening <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave and briefly it was nice to have the countryside commissions ex-chairman make

the recipient plans comply with lawful obligations in this and other ways <e> <s> if the noble baroness wishes to press her amendment we shall see what we can do about getting the lawyers right <e>", "<cs> my lords this clause seems identical to that tabled to the forestry bill in the other place on the fifth sitting of the house of commons standing committee on th february <e> <s> at that stage the government resisted the proposed clause <e> <s> the governments case against the new clause was set out by my honourable friend the parliamentary secretary to the ministry of agriculture <e> <s> he said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to say that i will look at it <e> <s> i should also like to know how an owner could prevent the forestry commission from going to the ncc <e> <s> it does not seem possible <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may reply to my noble friend first i can give the assurance he seeks <e> <s> the phrase natural beauty has been used in our countryside legislation since and it

the relevant provisions of the highways act would effectively place a duty on highway authorities to provide boundaries in the style and materials used in the area <e> <s> the first point on which the government wish to stand is that highway authorities have no responsibility or legal obligation to provide any kind of boundary for private land bordering on their highways <e> <s> this is entirely a matter for the landowner <e> <s> perhaps this might be illustrated by <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is any onus on them to do so but as the noble lord has rightly said it normally happens and the occasions are very rare when it does not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount lord ridley put down a similar amendment in committee which l undertook to reconsider <e> <s> we have done so but as i explained in committee the fact is <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know at the moment but i will find out <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it may be for the convenience of the house if

present believe that a working group on this subject in the committee on disarmament would be likely to advance the prospects for a treaty until the negotiating nuclear weapon states have reached a

states participate <e> <s> they do however agree that the confidentiality of the tripartite negotiations should be preserved <e> <s> i do not have the noble lords advance notice of either the chinese or the french reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords we expect the scale of technical co-operation to be similar to that available in the current financial year which we estimate at something like <e> <s> this

and personnel that will be carried forward into the next year <e> <s> as i said in my original answer we do not intend in any way to cut back on what we are already doing <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed continuing to look at the agricultural picture <e> <s> as my noble friend will be aware the boars and five gilts which have been provided since with the aim of trying to improve the quality of the malagasy herd have helped <e> <s> we understand that a proposal has been worked out by the malagasy government seeking our help for butter bean growing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness lady white was very kind in her introduction <e> <s> i nearly interjected when she said that we were last discussing this matter on friday the th because of course we have now passed friday th march and on

place in the cricket field i would need to be if i needed a long-stop whether i would be a wicket-keeper in which case i might be offended whether i might be a bowler in which case i might be slightly offended but as a batsman i do not think i would mind too much <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this clause has been given a general welcome <e> <s> the idea is that although national park authorities have a general power to do anything to conserve natural beauty and a number of specific powers to do various things they have never been empowered specifically to assist the activities of others who are also moved by conservation objectives like farmers and landowners <e> <s> there could be circumstances in which another party <e>", "<cs> my lords under the relevant provisions of the act all national parks must at present be extensive tracts of country which meet two criteria natural beauty and the <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we recognise the intention of this amendment and in our discussions at the committee stage i promised to look further into the question of its desirability and did so <e> <s> moreover as the noble lord has said i also put my thoughts into writing <e> <s> as the noble lord has explained his purpose by this amendment is to implement the recommendation of the strutt committee that the role of adas should be extended to include conservation advice to farmers <e> <s> our case continues to rest with respect with the view that this does not require fresh legislation <e> <s> as i explained when we debated this earlier section of the countryside act already requires that all ministers government departments and public bodies including adas should have regard to the needs of conservation in pursuing their functions related to land <e> <s> in fact implementation of this aspect of the strutt report is dependent not on statutory changes but on the availability of resources to enable adas to extend its existing knowledge of environmental matters and develop its capacity to provide guidance to farmers on conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i have noted with great care the terms in which the noble lord lord melchett has couched this revision of his earlier amendment in committee <e> <s> however i am afraid that the government still consider this amendment to be at best unnecessary and at worst an embarrassment particularly in relation to the duty to promote public enjoyment of all wildlife <e>", "<cs> my lords when a similar amendment was discussed in committee we undertook to consider whether it would be useful to have one or two people with expertise on nature conservation on each of the water authorities <e> <s> the government fully recognise the importance and relevance of wildlife and landscape conservation to the work of water authorities and it is our aim to achieve a reasonable balance of interests in the membership of each authority <e> <s> to some extent however the overall size of the water authorities membership which varies considerably between authorities imposes a constraint <e> <s> for example although the secretary of state appoints members to the thames water authority which is the largest to the smaller ones for instance the south-west and wessex he appoints only four <e> <s> this illustrates how difficult it would be to meet a requirement that a particular interest will always be represented on every water authority whether it be the conservation of natural beauty and wildlife or some other like the needs of industry commerce or recreation <e> <s> that is why we do not think it would be right to introduce a statutory commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords the danger of writing to the noble lord lord melchett with ones argument is that one gets the argument thrown back along with the answers as well <e> <s> i recognise that the amendment is a sincere attempt to overcome the objection which i explained in committee <e> <s> the proposed annual report to parliament by the secretaries of state would cover not just their own activities but those of other ministers and all public bodies <e> <s> while the earlier amendment had less point because the secretaries of state are themselves accountable to parliament this one would impose a burden on the department of the environment the welsh office and the scottish office <e> <s> it would be necessary for them to monitor the activities of all public bodies throughout the course of the year in order to provide an annual report on what has or has not happened because of the provisions of section of the countryside act and section of the countryside scotland act <e>", "<cs> my lords of course we go along with the noble lord lord melchett about the incompatibility of the words special scientific interest late at night and a term which produces no beauty at all when one wants to try to get a term which conjures up what it really means <e> <s> i would go along with what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i should like to suggest myself that perhaps one might have them called habitat protection sites and geological protection sites as yet another alternative <e> <s> i have also had put before me areas of wildlife importance and areas of geological importance <e> <s> we shall look at all these and see which we think is best <e> <s> one slight trouble about the phrase a wildlife conservation area is that it becomes a wc area and i am not quite sure whether or not people will pick that up <e> <s> having said that i am sure that noble lords will realise that the government are giving it thought and are moving along the same lines as the noble lord opposite <e>", "<cs> my lords if it is for the convenience of the house i beg to move that we adjourn further consideration of the wildlife and countryside bill until minutes past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords there is provision under the road traffic regulation act for highway authorities temporarily to prohibit by order the use of a road by vehicles and pedestrians <e> <s> the noble lords amendment seeks to introduce somewhat similar provisions for equestrian traffic on rights of way by a new clause in the highways act <e> <s> his proposal makes no provision for the temporary prohibition to be by an order or for any notice to be given <e>", "<cs> my lords we seem to have gone a long way off the amendment to the amendment which is really waymarking <e> <s> although the

opportunity of considering representations that the spicer committee has made on the subject and that committee apparently holds the view that riders can be subject to considerable risk where <e>", "<cs> my lords i must first say to the noble lord lord melchett that it is clear we all agree that after ploughing it is preferable to reinstate on the same day <e> <s> he asked me about the spicer committee <e> <s> i gather that that committee was not agreed on the timescale for the reinstatement of ploughed paths <e> <s> under existing legislation farmers and landowners are required to restore a ploughed path not later than six weeks from the date of giving notice of intention to plough or where no notice is given not later than three weeks from the time the farmer began to plough the path <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather they were not happy but i understand other parties were not happy either <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not understand what the noble lord is getting at because in his own amendment he refers to a period of not later than three weeks <e> <s> he has just said that he would be quite happy to have a proviso about bad weather <e> <s> i informed him that the spicer committee could not agree on this matter in any case and so i am not quite sure that i can give an undertaking to make the committee agree in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to press the amendment rather than come back to it on third reading i shall look into it but i cannot give any undertaking that i can meet the noble lords point <e> <s> i must say that i really do not feel

not be so connected <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not need to say more than we accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that this amendment is more restricted in scope than the amendment which the noble lord lord underhill moved during the committee stage <e> <s> since that debate the matter has been discussed by the rights of way <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said at the committee stage we did not include parts i and iv of this bill in our amendment to the act because the government thought that there was little or nothing to be gained by so doing <e> <s> this in point of fact is still our view <e> <s> of course we accept that ministers need to bear in mind all aspects of government policy when taking decisions and this would happen whatever was written into the act <e> <s> what we would not expect is that the ncc in relation to those judgments which are purely scientific concerning species should confuse their advice by reference to other matters <e> <s> however in view of my noble friends arguments i will undertake to give further consideration to the possibility of tabling an amendment at the third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords in part this amendment is designed to place the same conservation obligations on the inland drainage boards as already apply to the water authorities under section of the water act <e> <s> that was the purpose of our amendment no <e> <s> which as the noble lord has kindly said is acceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords we come back to our last discussion on much the same points as we have had quite frequently throughout the bill <e> <s> although we have absolutely no objection to it we do not think that the amendment is really necessary <e> <s> it was argued that the phrase a proper standard of behaviour is a little old-fashioned <e>

provocative <e> <s> if he will await the statement of my right honourable friend i hope he will find something to his liking <e>", "<cs> my lords may i remind the house that it was in that the first report was made and so far we have been unable to find the monies to do it <e> <s> therefore it is not altogether this governments responsibility <e> <s> i am glad that the noble baroness reminded me

informed public debate on arms control and disarmament issues <e> <s> to meet the demand for regular information the government publish a quarterly disarmament newsletter which describes developments

prohibitively expensive to publish everything that was said even if this were thought desirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend and i agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree

particularly fitting time to consider these matters as the publication of the report marks the th anniversary of reports by the hydrographer of the navy <e> <s> my noble friend may be assured that her

one <e> <s> i will come to another point in a moment about another department <e> <s> i have said something about the requirement for hydrographic surveying and the resources available to the ministry of defence to meet it <e> <s> there is also a need to analyse the data which the surveying flotilla obtains and to record it on charts <e> <s> this is primarily the job of the hydrographic department a thousand or so strong at taunton <e> <s> to give some indication of the growth and scale of the departments operations a comparison between and might be instructive <e> <s> a or so years ago for example about notices to mariners were issued and close to charts printed <e> <s> in the figures were nearly notices to mariners and over charts <e> <s> in this case more does not mean worse <e> <s> improvements in surveying equipment and techniques and greater use of automation have resulted in the production of charts of far greater accuracy and detail than it was possible to produce a years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords all national museums and galleries in the metropolitan area were closed on the may day bank holiday on th may last <e>", "<cs> my lords to take the last point first no <e> <s> as i believe the noble lord is well aware it is for the authorities responsible for the museums and galleries most of which are run by independent boards of trustees to arrange for opening or closing on public holidays in the light of their own priorities and following previous practice <e> <s> the directors of the trustee museums and galleries established a central negotiating team to act for all national institutions <e> <s> it was their decision on the may day bank holiday in to proceed after discussion with civil service unions to close on the may day bank holidays <e> <s> if i may remind the noble lord i believe that in he was in a position of responsibility then <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment we believe that we ought to leave this matter with the directors of the trustee museums and galleries in view of their established practice and their own con <e>", "<cs> my lords on this side of the house we could not agree more with the noble lord <e> <s> however it was introduced i think probably in as the may day bank holiday and it is the unions bank holiday and this is the day that they have asked that the museums be closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the sentiments of all that the noble lord has said <e> <s> i am not willing to comment on the pressure that anyone may have put on one department or another but the directors of the trustee museums and galleries on which of course as the noble lord is aware the gallery he mentioned is represented are the ones which have negotiated these terms with the civil service unions <e>", "<cs> again my lords all i can say is that there is a set body the directors of trustee museums and galleries who established the central negotiating team and it is up to them whether they want to keep to that or negotiate separately <e> <s> i should say at once that it is the may day bank holiday about which we are talking about which the unions have put on particular pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly draw the noble lords remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no evidence of any recent unusual military activity in the trans-caucasus region <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will appreciate that he cannot expect me at this stage to go into detail on this matter <e> <s> i am afraid i can neither confirm nor deny his figures <e> <s> i can only confirm that we have no reason to believe that significant changes in military activity have taken place in this region recently <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say again what i said to my noble friend <e> <s> i hope the noble lord does not expect me to go into detail on this matter and i can neither confirm nor deny his figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord in his usual clever way has put his finger on one of the points why i cannot really answer this question <e> <s> it is impossible to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords intervention and i am sure he will appreciate that i would prefer not to be drawn into speculation on these hypothetical scenarios <e>", "<cs> my lords we view the report without enthusiasm <e> <s> her majestys government cannot support any proposal which would oblige us to place limitations in the movement of our sportsmen and women or to interfere with individual liberties <e> <s> we do not believe that the naming of individuals in this report will contribute towards the solution of a difficult and sensitive international problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends three supplementaries first my right honourable friend the minister of state at the foreign and commonwealth office made clear in another place on th may the governments attitude and the united nations special committee against apartheid can be in no doubt about our views <e> <s> with regard to advice to specific athletes that the government do not do but they are of course in contact constantly with the sports council as regards the noble lords final supplementary her majestys government are encouraged by the reports that they have heard but no details are yet to hand <e> <s> however if they are true those reports of initiatives would certainly represent a step in the right direction <e>", "<cs> my lords this subject was raised in your lordships house only two weeks ago at question time on th may and my noble friend lord bellwin replying at that time did say at col <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and i fully agree with all that he has said <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends intervention i can only reiterate what i have said which is that we know that the united nations are fully aware of the governments position and that is as far as we think that it is necessary to go at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for trade will make an announcement as soon as the complex issues described in the inspectors report have been fully considered <e> <s> it is hoped that this will be in a very few weeks time <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think my earlier reply indicated it is a joint decision between the secretaries of state for the environment and trade <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that my right honourable friends are well aware of the need to give the parties to the stansted inquiry time to take full account of the implications of the decision on the second terminal at gatwick in preparing their evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says but i am sure he would not expect me in any way to prejudge this present decision <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously i cannot commit my right honourable friends and it is difficult to be precise about a timing of a decision but in view of the broad agreement between the two departments it should be possible to announce a decision within the next four or five weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords we must be realistic about what the government can do to control the actions of their citizens when they are abroad <e> <s> where football supporters are concerned i must emphasise that the responsibility lies with the football authorities and not with government to take precautions necessary to ensure that the disgraceful scenes witnessed at the switzerland <e>", "<cs> my lords while i cannot speak for the entire house i assure the noble baroness

noble lord will know that my honourable friend the minister is of course a fellow countryman of his <e>", "<cs> my lords i of course agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i should also like to remind him

lords my honourable friend the minister for sport has asked for a report directly the secretary of the football association returns <e>", "<cs> this might be a convenient moment to take the statement

that the whole committee will be grateful to <e>", "<cs> there are difficulties involved in splitting amendments when they might be considered together <e> <s> be that as it may the point which the noble viscount lord simon is raising would be true if a subsidiary were taken over as a whole subsidiary but we have been talking of for example the gleneagles hotel which would have an entirely different aspect which one would not expect a whole subsidiary to have and one of the problems is trying to cope with all the situations that can be envisaged <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mishcon made a remark about the supporters behind me but i cannot quite see the supporters behind him either <e> <s> if i may say so amendment no <e> <s> produces an interesting proposal but for the same reasons as before i should like to advise your lordships not to accept the amendment <e> <s> the first reason is one of principle <e> <s> here again the noble lords opposite are seeking to impose a statutory pension straitjacket on private sector companies and this is not something that the government can support <e> <s> the second reason is one of practicality <e> <s> the amendment tries to lay down a single pension solution for each and every one of the railway boards subsidiaries into which private capital is to be introduced <e> <s> we are not prepared to do that because this legislation would have to cover a number of different subsidiaries whose individual circumstances will be different <e>", "<cs> i am slightly surprised that the noble lord finds me intransigent because having read as he has the committee stage proceedings in another place i know that the argument has been thoroughly gone through <e> <s> i believe that the government spokesman at committee stage in another place was quite as firm as i have been today <e> <s> however so far as employees protection is concerned <e> <s> of course the government are aware of this point and i was under the impression that i had given an indication that both the government and the british railways board will do their utmost to protect employees pension rights and will ensure that the employee is protected in any prospectus <e> <s> i shall certainly have a word with my secretary of state and establish whether he feels there is any need to make a special statement about the protection of employees at shall we say the end of the committee stage <e>", "<cs> the addition of this amendment really once more highlights the thinking of the opposition <e> <s> they want private companies to be placed under a pensions obligation and they want a piece of what i should like to call legislative make-believe saying that that obligation does not make the company worse off <e> <s> let me emphasise that we do not resist such an amendment because we envisage employees having their pension rights attacked <e> <s> in truth the employees through their unions are already equipped to look after themselves <e> <s> i could go on longer but i think i should end by saying that we merely want to leave employers in the same position as any other private sector company <e> <s> that really sums up the thinking from this side of the committee <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure whether i am allowed to speak on this amendment as it has already been withdrawn but perhaps on this amendment i might be slightly more forthcoming <e> <s> i think i drew the noble lords attention to this one earlier <e> <s> it is my belief that the orders we are discussing would all be made under section of the transport act and so far as i can see section <e>", "<cs> i apologise for replying in the place of my noble friend lord bellwin <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill will know i am very intransigent this evening <e> <s>

road humps <e> <s> we had quite a lot of discussion on them last year which i enjoyed very much <e> <s> my only sorrow is that i think we lost at the last hurdle <e> <s> i am rather surprised that this evening your lordships are treating the subject as a challenge to speed because the whole idea of road humps is that they are not a challenge to speed so much as an opportunity to stop people from speeding <e> <s> to take up the point of my noble friend lord lucas the idea of a road hump is that it should be an alternative in the armoury of the people who are looking towards road safety <e> <s> we are not trying to take away steel posts or barriers <e> <s> what we are offering is a new alternative which everybody who is interested in road safety feels is necessary <e>", "<cs> i am equally aware of the question and answer given in the other place earlier this year <e> <s> chief officers of police are responsible for law enforce <e>", "<cs> i mentioned that money was a factor but

recommended by the judge in the gwent case is now going to be incorporated in the operating procedures though not strictly necessary on technical grounds <e> <s> the acpo will ensure uniform procedures and the present instructions for muniquip will be improved <e> <s> i hope that that answer will give my noble friend a little more confidence <e>", "<cs> quite right <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for explaining his amendments because as i believe he is aware the wording of his amendments does not make tremendous sense <e> <s> it is true that the only experience we have had with road humps so far is in connection with roads subject to a miles per hour limit <e> <s> at present we are not planning any experimental humps on roads not subject to mph limits but we are not legislating for just the next year or so and do not know what road safety needs may arise in future <e> <s> we cannot show that it is impossible that road humps perhaps of a design and subject to requirements different from those in urban areas could benefit safety on lengths of road which do not meet the criteria for a mph limit <e>", "<cs> i believe the answer to that question is yes but i will certainly let the noble lord opposite know if it is not <e>", "<cs> good <e>", "<cs> perhaps before i respond to the noble lord lord underhill on this amendment i might just

be dealt with in regulations <e> <s> i am also a driver of a car and have driven for some years in london <e> <s> i have seen road humps in london during the experimental time <e> <s> i have also seen the making of one-way streets the banning of right turns road closures and the banning of traffic for the benefit of pedestrians in whole areas <e> <s> the other four have been just as annoying as road humps to me <e> <s> i really do not see why you should differentiate between them in this particular case <e>", "<cs> there will be proper road signs and if you obey the road signs you will not

car slowed down before because there was a hump <e> <s> however i understand that most of my noble friends are more accustomed to being behind a driving wheel than behind a perambulator <e>", "<cs> i noticed the wording to which the noble lord lord underhill drew my attention and thought it must be a point he carefully put down to get the sympathy of the government which indeed he has on this and

the committees report and the various proposals submitted <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that in the debate on st january my noble friend spoke against the channel tunnel but reading the report of that debate i also found that most of my other noble friends spoke from a contrary viewpoint <e> <s> i do not particularly wish to comment on the finance at the moment <e> <s> as i have said my right honourable friend has invited proposals and those submitted are under consideration <e> <s> he will also consider the option of relying upon development of existing services <e>", "<cs> my lords as

noble friends interest in the project <e> <s> i can confirm that my right honourable friend said at that time that private risk capital would be involved and that it would be commercially profitable

consideration and i think my noble friend is slightly jumping the gun <e>", "<cs> my lords i must bow to my noble friends long knowledge on this subject <e> <s> it was in when we very nearly got the last proposed channel tunnel <e> <s> in fact i do not think the men of kent were responsible for our not building the tunnel it was once again a matter of finance <e>", "<cs> my lords whether i agree

for his advice and i will bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be delighted if i am still on this earth to answer my noble friend <e>", "<cs> i should like to stick to the words which i said on second reading as recorded in <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to the two amendments to which my noble friend lord fisher spoke the government do not think it sensible to take the words or continuance out of clause because a local authority would then be obliged to give a licence to an existing zoo even if they were satisfied that the zoos operation was injurious to public health and safety <e> <s> i also think it is right that local people should be able to make representations in respect of existing zoos if they are genuinely concerned about its effects on their health and safety <e> <s> having said that the government do not anticipate that local authorities are going to refuse licences because of petty complaints if the inspectors report recommends that a licence should be granted <e>", "<cs> the government have considered further the proposal put forward in another place by the honourable member for bristol north-west mr colvin to amend clause as now proposed by my noble friend lord fisher <e> <s> we have concluded that it is too restrictive <e> <s> it would mean that a licence could not be refused to someone who had for example shown a flagrant disregard for the provisions of the endangered species import and export act <e> <s> however the government intend that the guidance to be issued will indicate the type of offences that we consider to be incompatible with the proper conduct of a zoo and which would justify refusal of a licence and we shall be taking into account any representations made by the zoo organisations on this point <e> <s> the guidance will also point out that local authorities should be guided in their decisions by the reports of the inspectors on the standards of management now obtaining in the zoo <e> <s> i hope that with this assurance my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> the government will be taking into account any representations made and when drawing up guidelines they may well try to involve the two bodies he mentioned <e> <s> on the second point i do not think that i can go further than say that the government will take into account what has been said today and when they are producing the guidance on offences they will obviously take the minor ones into account <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord melchett and others asked during second reading whether the conditions listed in subsection would be mandatory <e> <s> my understanding is that the local authority is not obliged to impose such conditions but if it does the zoo would be obliged to comply with them <e> <s> i agree that it is sensible that all licences should include conditions about safety precautions records and insurance against liability for damage and we shall be covering these points in the secretary of states conditions under subsection <e>", "<cs> clause provides for the secretary of state to specify standards of modern zoo practice <e> <s> i indicated during the second reading debate what kind of things the standards would cover and i in fact quoted from col of <e>", "<cs> clause deals with the secretary of states standards and he is going to put down some specific standards which i think we now all agree the zoo industry will be consulted over <e> <s> they will be very much based on the codes of practice which we have now <e> <s> he is also going to produce guidance for the councils <e> <s> this will obviously be something which one might say is to be put into laymans english <e> <s> on all these stages of course the bodies mentioned by the noble lord lord melchett will be consulted and although i cannot promise they will be shown the draft i hope they will be there before the draft and agree it at that stage <e> <s> it is the intention to produce the most full and comprehensive guidelines for the local councils as well as the secretary of states standards for zoos to look towards <e>", "<cs> in speaking to these two amendments the government do not think it is reasonable to restrict the local authoritys inspectors to one vet in all cases <e> <s> local authorities should be able to satisfy themselves that a zoo is properly conducted and that the facilities provided for the public are adequate as well as to the care and treatment given to the animals <e> <s> however i sympathise with the view that inspections should not impose unnecessary costs on zoos <e> <s> the bill has already been amended to provide that small zoos may at their own request be inspected by a smaller inspection team than that proposed by the local authority where the secretary of state considers this appropriate <e> <s> the guidance to be issued to local authorities will stress the importance of keeping down the costs of inspection and suggest that in many cases it will be sufficient for the local authority to send only one inspector who must under the present terms of the bill be a vet <e> <s> i must again stress as i did a moment or two ago the importance we attach to the secretary of states standards and guidance notes which will be prepared in full consultation with the industry before the measure is brought into force <e>", "<cs> i am happy to assure my noble friend lord craigton that the guidance to be issued to local authorities by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment will suggest that they should make informal inquiries to satisfy themselves that a complaint is valid before undertaking a special inspection <e>", "<cs> the effect of this new clause would be that the local authority would have to send to the zoo copies of all the representations it receives no matter how trivial and whether or not the local authority has any intention of acting upon them <e> <s> i think this is unnecessary and undesirable and likely to involve the local authority and the zoo in additional expense <e> <s> the government also have to consider the possibility that the local authority might be required to pass over to the zoo material which is libellous and may form the basis for legal proceedings <e>", "<cs> first in answer to my noble friend lord craigton i am happy to assure him that the guidance to be issued by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment will indicate the criteria by which we will judge a small collection to be suitable for exemption from inspection or licensing requirements <e> <s> we shall also include criteria for those animals which are not considered wild <e>", "<cs> i should certainly like to be able to give that assurance to my noble friend but i do not think i can order them about that matter <e> <s> i think that i can advise them and i believe that my right honourable friend the secretary of state will have that in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords the british waterways board decides its own priorities within the resources available to it <e> <s> we are aware of the importance that the board attaches to repairing and reopening blisworth tunnel <e> <s> we are already considering a request by the board for extra grant towards maintenance in future years <e>", "<cs> my lords the british waterways board has a large number of items requiring urgent attention within the limited public funds available to it <e> <s> my understanding is that the repair work on this tunnel could spread over two years at a possible cost of million <e> <s> the board intends to start as soon as its budgets allow but is unlikely to commence this year <e> <s> i was aware of the oxford canal and i know that it remains an alternative but not a very happy one <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i do indeed <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord who asked the question i will go back to my original answer which says that the government are already considering a request by the board for extra grants towards maintenance in future years <e> <s> therefore we are considering the matter <e> <s> so far as the noble lords diversion into the commercial aspect is concerned i must stress that this is a cruising not a commercial canal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that suggestion <e> <s> i am sure that the department will bear it in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords this comes back to the question from the noble lord on the cross-benches it is a question of where the priorities for money lie <e>

lord is referring to the frankel report of which said that a lot of money was necessary for what one might call long-term maintenance and it still is <e>", "<cs> my lords in england out of structure plans submitted have been approved <e> <s> in scotland out of nine plans submitted seven have been approved <e> <s> in wales out of plans submitted six have been approved <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends three supplementaries the numbers of plans still to be submitted are in england three in scotland seven and in wales none <e> <s> the structure plans take some time to be submitted because the introduction of the new system was delayed by local government reorganisation and often i regret by over-concern for detail <e> <s> my noble friend asked what happens if a structure plan becomes out of date <e> <s> the structure plans give a general indication of where developments should be located and on what scale and will usually remain operative for some time <e>

honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has issued no such general instructions the department has requested the removal of litter bins from trunk road lay-bys in north yorkshire and sanctioned this practice in a number of other counties in order to reduce the cost and nuisance of litter in lay-bys <e> <s> the difficulty with litter bins is that they can lead to indiscriminate dumping of refuse for which they were never intended <e> <s> this is unsightly and can be a hazard to health <e> <s> the department is therefore examining the alternative of withdrawing litter bins

supplementary question <e> <s> it sounds a good idea but it is slightly wide of the litter bin question <e>", "<cs> my lords although i agree with my noble friend it is equally the case a point which

capital expenditure allocation <e> <s> however the council for small industries in rural areas for example contributes its views on structure and local plans at the draft stage when it thinks that the

anything but underline it <e> <s> i am sure that the airing this question has had in this house will be most helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a general presumption against most kinds of

environment <e> <s> the statement reads <e>", "<cs> my lords first to answer to the two questions posed to me opposite regarding the judgment and regarding money the government are <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said the government are considering their response to the judgment <e> <s> what i read out was in order to illustrate to the noble lord lord ponsonby that the percentage of the judgment is not against the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just go on to reply to the other noble lord before we go any further <e> <s> so far as i know the statement was in anticipation of the fact that it might be asked for <e> <s> had it not been made no doubt the noble lord would have asked for it <e> <s> to the second question i have to give the same response that the government are considering their reply <e>", "<cs> i would willingly read all the pages my lords <e> <s> i am delighted that the noble and learned lord has found just about the two sentences which are critical <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when the noble lord has read the judgment he will wish to rephrase that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that when this matter is raised again the noble lord lord jenkins will raise that point <e> <s> but i would stress that central government in this case do not want to put restrictions on local government and are trying not to do so it is only the ones who do not abide by the guidelines who get into trouble <e>", "<cs> my lords only to a very limited extent <e>", "<cs> my lords a package of measures to improve the orange badge scheme and to eliminate abuse was announced by my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for transport on th july <e> <s> the introduction of a separate offence for misuse of an orange badge by able-bodied people became operative earlier this week <e> <s> the other changes include new regulations for the issue and use of badges and further guidance for local authorities on the administration of the scheme generally <e> <s> interested organisations including those representing the disabled have recently been consulted on the draft regulations and we are now considering their responses <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and i can give him a yes answer to both his questions <e> <s> first the name is and will be on the badge secondly there is an idea for the future that badges are removable in plastic containers <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister of transport has been trying to keep a balanced appreciation of this and of course the ministry of transport is in contact with local authorities and road users <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed they can and they can at the moment <e> <s> as a result of the new regulations being drafted at the moment we hope that this will be even easier for the police and wardens to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i am fairly certain that that will be the case but i shall check on it and make sure that her remarks are brought to the attention of the proper authority <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport decided that the route between the m and inner london could best be improved by improvements along the existing line of the a <e> <s> construction work is in hand on the a to enable traffic to flow more freely at purley cross and further improvements are

considerations rather than the ones he mentions such as housing and environment <e> <s> all these have to be taken into account <e> <s> it is as long ago as that the then secretary of state for transport decided on the abandonment of the m north of hooley and only this september that the government announced following a public inquiry the revocation of the orders relating to the extension

underlining what the whole house knows that the recovery of this country is so well under way <e> <s> so far as the traffic from gatwick is concerned we are expecting that british rail who as my noble friend is aware are considerably improving their services will help to cope with a great deal of it <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with what the noble lord says but there are enormous complications over extending this particular motorway into london including the orbital routes at the end of it <e> <s> it is this consideration as well as the outside ones which have led to the public inquiry coming down the way that it did <e> <s> however the government intend to keep the route under review to see what further improvements may be made from time to time <e>", "<cs> my lords that is slightly outside the terms of this question but i remember answering a question fairly similar to that a little while back and if my memory serves me correctly the new plans do indeed envisage what the noble lord wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords any question about the factual content of an advertisement must be referred to the advertising standards authority <e> <s> however the government would deprecate any impression given to novices that riding a motor-cycle requires little or no skill <e> <s> the noble lord is however aware of our policy <e> <s> it is to provide much stronger inducements

march next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> however as i said in my earlier reply questions of factual content in advertisements are referred to the advertising standards authority and of course that line should be followed in this case <e> <s> i think the dangers of motor-cycling which we brought out in the debate in june of this year should certainly never be understated as it is the most dangerous form of road transport <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be in the public interest to disclose details of security arrangements whether for use in war or in peace <e> <s> security arrangements involve transport safe keeping storage guarding and many other matters which if disclosed would prejudice the safety and security of the items for which the arrangements are made <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to comment on the first part of that supplementary question <e> <s> i said before that it is not in the public interest to disclose details of security arrangements <e> <s> successive governments have decided against an official programme of purpose-built shelters because of the enormous cost set against the slight risk of war <e> <s> the home office published this year booklets giving guidance to the general public on domestic shelters suitable for protection in a nuclear war and detailed design outlines of certain types of shelter <e>", "<cs> my lords i must leave the noble lord to use his own imagination on it <e> <s> as i said before in the public interest we will not disclose details of security arrangements <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble lord has answered himself <e> <s> it would be an impossible subject to go into at question time in this house and i do not wish

do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming the report of the select committee on science and technology and the opportunity for this house to have a full debate on a subject of very considerable significance as we have discovered this evening in the environmental field <e> <s> any industrial country produces a wide range and a large volume of wastes <e> <s> those wastes must be managed with the same rigorous attention that characterises the manufacture of the goods that give rise to them <e> <s> the government are most grateful to the noble lord lord gregson and to his sub-committee for preparing a report of the highest standards and also to the noble lord lord gregson for introducing it today so clearly and in such detail <e> <s> the government recognise the work and thought that have gone into it and that it makes important and challenging recommendations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are considering the report of the public inquiry and hope to announce their decision shortly when the report will also be made public <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has raised this question at a very sensitive time in that the report which was received on th june is at this moment being considered by my honourable friends <e> <s> i hope he will bear in mind that i cannot prejudge their decision at this particular moment <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> i did say that this report was received only on th june which is not very long ago <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is making his point very well <e> <s> i presume that he does not want an answer for the next two and a half years otherwise if he is fishing he will be unsuccessful <e>", "<cs> my lords traffic regulation in london is the responsibility of the greater london council which has powers under the road traffic regulation act to regulate the movement of lorries and other heavy vehicles <e> <s> lorries of more than feet in length not requiring access are already banned from the central area of london <e> <s> i understand that the greater london council has appointed an independent panel of inquiry into the effects of bans on heavy lorries

is a power for my right <e>", "<cs> my lords concerning whether this house debates it or not i am sure that is for the usual channels to negotiate <e> <s> so far as the matter stands at the moment the government are still considering the issue of heavy lorries <e> <s> we are certainly moving towards decisions and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has made it clear that he expects to announce the governments intentions fairly soon <e>", "<cs> my lords there is no change at the moment <e> <s> we are as i said awaiting my right honourable friends statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble baronesss question <e> <s> subject to the availability of adequate funds and the satisfactory outcome of statutory procedures my right honourable friend expects the m to be completed as an orbital road in <e> <s> it has the highest priority in the national trunk road programme <e> <s> perhaps the noble baroness may have seen that even yesterday a new section was opened between the egham and yeoveney sections <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of my noble friends assertion and i am grateful to her for drawing it to the attention of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords both hms norfolk and rfa tidepool will be delivered to chile during <e> <s> this sale was agreed only after full consideration of all relevant factors and we are content that it should proceed <e>", "<cs> my lords we share the noble lords concern about abuses of human rights in chile as elsewhere and we shall continue to take every appropriate opportunity in our bilateral contacts as well as in the united nations and other international fora to apply constructive and effective pressure on the chilean government in this respect <e> <s> her majestys government are fortunate to have an ambassador there to give our points more force <e>", "<cs> my lords while repeating that of course we share the concern about the abuses of human rights i take my noble friends point <e> <s> of course when we had the embargo such countries as germany france and israel did not have an embargo and benefited accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always difficult to balance the two but it is the view of government that applications for export licences for the supply of defence equipment to chile should be treated on their individual merits <e> <s> all relevant factors including human rights considerations are taken into account in each case and in this context we agree to the sale of defence equipment only which in our judgment is not likely to be used for internal repression <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may echo the last remark made by the noble lord lord kennet judging by this debate i think that everybody is going to have a free vote at the end of it <e> <s> the noble lord lord beaumont in moving the second reading of his bill today has shown his concern for the environment for resources and for waste <e> <s> i personally am grateful to him for his clear exposition at the beginning <e> <s> these are concerns which the government share <e> <s> protection of the environment avoidance of waste the responsible use of energy and materials and the economic recycling of waste materials are all important objectives for the nation <e> <s> it is important for our society to have a sense of self-discipline in all these subjects since the supply of goods and services in our economy is essentially free of state direction <e> <s> under our system the state does not have a major role in deciding what shall be put on the market <e>", "<cs> my lords far from being skullduggery i suspect that it was because no decision was made on what would happen to the council <e> <s> the noble baroness lady white also asked me a follow-up question about the national anti-waste programme <e> <s> this i am informed was a team of officials which was really the secretariat for the council <e> <s> it does not exist any more because the council itself does not exist <e> <s> but both the department of industry and the department of the environment continue to have units with responsibility for reclamation and recycling <e> <s> but the governent look principally to industry to take steps to ensure that waste materials are recycled where it is economic to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be right <e> <s> but i have th june for one and april for the other <e> <s> however i shall not press him on the point <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friends question has been answered during the course of the debate <e> <s> i think it was the noble lord lord jacques who went through the differences over the past years <e> <s> the noble lord lord sainsbury described the tremendous progress that a firm which i hesitate to mention in this house any more has also made on this very point <e> <s> there is also the probability that as a result of the bill consumers will suffer reduced choice <e> <s> this point has already been spoken about <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a matter for london transport but i understand that the payment was agreed during the wage settlement negotiated this summer <e> <s> it is payable to all london transport employees except the top management and will form part of their taxable emoluments <e> <s> the greater london council are only directly involved through the revenue support they pay towards london transports operating deficit <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think this is a question of by-laws this is a question of a negotiated settlement between the interested parties and in particular of course it takes london weighting in view <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friend is a little wide of the mark here because this is a taxable emolument and it is part of a negotiated settlement <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why although we deprecate it in some terms we do not deprecate it in others <e>", "<cs> my lords this particular settlement was of course a matter for london transport and the ratepayers are affected because they are the people who give london transport the subsidy <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not necessarily say so but if the noble lord were to suggest that to old-age pensioners they might agree <e>", "<cs> i think they are getting away with quite a lot already my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble viscounts culinary expertise

appreciate with him that the duties we take are very broad <e> <s> i am delighted that he can switch from cows and pigs to tower hamlets and the isle of dogs with such facility <e> <s> the noble lord asked me some specific questions <e> <s> he asked about the private and public sectors <e> <s> the london dockland development corporation will concentrate on providing service sites for private sector and housing association development and the boroughs will remain responsible for the provision of public sector housing <e> <s> he also asked whether it would not be better for local authorities to do the job <e> <s> noble lords will recall that it was on this very issue that the select committee recommended that the urban development corporation should be established and agreed that the lddc is more likely to engender the confidence that generates private sector investment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the second motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords after that round of seven minutes i feel slightly punch drunk myself <e> <s> i think i ought to start by saying what is the purpose of this bill <e> <s> it is to stop any boxing match either professional or amateur from being arranged for profit <e> <s> that would include charitable or sponsorship events for profit <e> <s> some noble lords were slightly awry in their descriptions <e> <s> another thing i noted is that my noble friend lord belhaven and stenton twice mentioned a five-minute round <e> <s> in fact no round ever goes more than three minutes i understand <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble earls point but i think he was talking also about audiences generally <e> <s> i should like to refer to audiences generally in all sport and i do not think there are any that are particularly nice except perhaps the royal box at wimbledon which is always very attractive <e>", "<cs> my lords not yet <e> <s> during the debates on the disabled persons bill the government agreed to undertake widespread consultation on this matter <e> <s> noble lords placed particular emphasis on the importance of this consultation and we are considering now how best to reach the widest possible range of interested parties <e>", "<cs> of course my lords i totally agree with my noble friend and indeed would like to endorse those sentiments <e> <s> as he knows this is a difficult subject as regards the number of bodies that have been consulted and i am sure that his question will have stressed the urgency of the matter and served as a stimulus <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful for the noble baronesss question and of course i will make sure that her remarks are brought to the right authority <e> <s> i think the difficulty is that the disabled persons act contains provisions on many different aspects of access and section requires implementation by statutory instrument but that other sections have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his suggestion and will think about it myself <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment of course the noble viscount is a bit ahead of the gun and i do not think that if a quango were thought to be necessary the government would necessarily reject it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for that clarification <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to say that the arts councils grant for which was announced by my right honourable friend the minister for the arts on th december will be increased from million to million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed grateful to the noble lord for his two cheers <e> <s> as far as the theatres trust is concerned i understand that the present grant was a once-and-for-all one <e> <s> while we fully recognise the difficulties which the trust faces in these difficult times we cannot undertake any continuing commitment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend for adding the third cheer <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a slightly different question <e> <s> but basically anything in which the government have been interested in this particular round has been increased by the same percentage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not of course quite sure to what the noble lord refers but if he is referring to what i am thinking of i do not think the government give a grant towards it <e> <s> if i may say so to the noble lord lord strabolgi i think that this is a question for the arts council itself which actually gives to the live orchestras rather than for the government <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are in danger here

acquisition of lands end and subsequent restoration of the site <e> <s> my right honourable friend hopes to respond shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to pour cold water on such a nice response from the noble lord lord molloy but i must say that all i went as far as saying was that my right honourable friend hopes to respond shortly <e> <s> there are quite a number of hurdles to go before any final decision is made <e>", "<cs> my lords with all due respect to the noble lord there are many miles of difference between lands end and battle abbey <e> <s> one of the difficulties about lands end is that it is difficult to know what actually we are trying to preserve <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says come on <e> <s> but perhaps he can tell me whether it is an hotel the land itself the car park the litter bin or what <e> <s> what i am trying to say is it is clearly up to the countryside commission and the national trust to advise us in this matter which they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed and in fact i took advice from my noble friend lady faithfull before this afternoons questions when she told me that she had been there during the war when the hotel was actually bombed <e>", "<cs> no my lords i can only tell my noble friend where it ends <e>", "<cs> my lords that is indeed an interesting suggestion which i shall bear in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the government are concerned i understand that the national trust is meeting on th december and it is hoped that all decisions will be made before that day <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my

right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has invited views on this proposal from the public generally from local authority associations and others with an interest in the enforcement of traffic regulations and from a wide range of representative organisations of road users including motorists and freight and public transport operators <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original response we shall be consulting widely and i shall take note of what my noble friend has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of what my noble friend says and i am sure that this is one of the considerations which will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i recall the debate on th june last during which i think the noble lords noble friend lady denington raised this question <e> <s> this is one of the matters which has stimulated the review which is now taking place <e> <s> as regards whether we can get this in time for the next bill that will depend on whether

them out first in areas <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful for the noble lords comments <e> <s> i am sure that they will be borne much in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that everything would be greatly eased if everyone actually obeyed the laws <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall bear the noble lords comments in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened to the speeches this evening with

should also like to join with the noble lord lord underhill in thanking the noble lord lord kings norton for his comprehensive introduction today because it has set the problem in a realistic perspective <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments prime concern is that drivers with citizens band radio equipment in their vehicles should not let it interfere with their concentration while at the wheel <e> <s> the voluntary code of practice issued by the government warns drivers against using their equipment in such a way as to impair their ability to drive safely and i am glad to take the opportunity of re emphasing this advice today <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed take note of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> we would of course advise most strongly against operators making calls while on the move <e> <s> however as the noble lord is aware it is really too early to predict how far citizens band radio is likely to be used by drivers and we will certainly keep a close watch on the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to enter into a debate with my noble friend on this subject <e> <s> i have also seen recently shaving done at the wheel as well as reading newspapers at the wheel <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that those with experience and particularly emergency drivers too would agree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments main measures to reduce motor-cycle accidents and casualties are contained in the transport act <e> <s> these are designed to improve the safety of the young and inexperienced rider who is the most vulnerable by restricting him to a smaller machine more appropriate to his level of ability and experience and by encouraging him to take training and pass his test <e> <s> these measures will come into operation this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble baroness that of course the figures are very distressing <e> <s> i also agree with her that there is little doubt that the conspicuousness of a motor-cyclist or rather the lack of it is a major problem <e> <s> research by the transport and road research laboratory suggests that some per cent <e> <s> of accidents involving motor-cycles also involve another road user although it is unable to apportion the blame <e> <s> work by the trrl into the relative merits of different conspicuity aids has demonstrated that a pair of special daytime running lamps is significantly more effective than even a single powerful lamp <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is looking into this situation and he has deferred a final decision to enable the trrl to carry out further research <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the question is slightly wide of the original question but i shall certainly look into it

examine the candidates machine-handling abilities to be taken normally with an authorised training organisation although there will be limited opportunity to take it with the department will come into

the result that they can be used more <e> <s> so far as cones are concerned the fact that no work is visible often hides the presence of plant and equipment uncompleted repairs damaged barriers or sections of relaid carriageway which are still drying out <e> <s> it is the new policy that only a limited distance will now be done at any one time which i hope will mean that my noble friend will not see such a plethora of cones being laid <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall study the noble lords figures <e> <s> i do not think i have them in front of me at the moment <e> <s> the overwhelming evidence

existing roads <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that at the first public inquiry which was probably way back in late or early they did set out the alternative routes <e> <s> the noble lord shakes his head so i shall have to confirm it as i was not there <e>", "<cs> no my lords it does not <e> <s> at the same time my right honourable friends also took account of the substantial local

uncertainty which my right honourable friends felt could simply not be justified <e> <s> i should add one further point on the procedures <e> <s> some including the noble lord have suggested that objectors in this case should have been given the opportunity to comment on the decision not to hold a public inquiry <e> <s> ministers considered this point but given that they were already satisfied that no inquiry was necessary they saw no useful purpose in asking for such comments <e> <s> and there was of course no legal obligation to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been an increasing awareness of the problems and needs of rural areas and communities over the past few years even to the extent that the term rural deprivation used by lord bishopston has been coined to describe the various factors which have combined to put pressure on the social and economic basis of village life <e> <s> this was ably illustrated by the right reverend prelate the bishop of hereford in his lucid and far-seeing speech <e> <s> these trends are familiar and have been debated before now in this house <e> <s> above all there has been the steady loss of jobs in agriculture resulting from the major advances in productivity which have been acheived in farming since the second world war which was mentioned by my noble friend lord sandford in his knowledgeable and constructive remarks <e> <s> village life is no longer as it once was centred on the land <e> <s> in turn this has changed the social structure of many rural communities <e> <s> for example often the young people of a village

holiday use <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i could intervene briefly and it will be briefly at this stage to give an indication of the governments views <e> <s> before i do so i should like to add my congratulations to my noble friend lord shrewsbury on his excellent maiden speech on this very apt subject <e> <s> it was a refreshing interlude to be taken on such an instructive and charming tour of

fact address itself to an aspect which has caused the government some concern <e> <s> the promoters of the bill might like to bear in mind what has been said by my noble friend lord digby about the definition of the term treasure trove because he was asking for a definition of treasure trove rather than of antiquities <e> <s> this bill seeks to amend the definition of treasure trove <e> <s> the present definition is not clear and perhaps needs clarification anyway quite apart from the purposes of this bill <e> <s> it may be for consideration that it would be helpful to see a redefinition of treasure trove as amended by this bill <e> <s> to this extent the noble and learned lord lord elwyn-jones who has just returned <e>", "<cs> may i respond to just a couple of remarks made earlier <e>

you cannot define <e> <s> that is the point i was trying to make <e> <s> with regard to what the noble baroness lady white said i worded my earlier remarks i hope carefully to say that if the promoters felt so inclined to accept this change perhaps we could be in contact later <e>", "<cs> i am not quite sure of the answer to the question which the noble baroness has raised <e> <s> i do not think it really applies because as the noble lord lord abinger has said there is nothing written about this <e> <s> it is something which has happened that is my understanding <e>", "<cs> absolutely <e> <s> this comes back to defining and to a degree to definitions <e> <s> i do not think that i want to add anything to what i said on second reading on this subject <e> <s> the house knows that the government are a little worried about the right of property owners without compensation and also probably remain to be convinced that the crown right should be extended <e> <s> however having so said i do not wish otherwise to be drawn <e>", "<cs> the government welcome a more realistic time allowed for reporting finds <e>", "<cs> i shall not detain the committee very long but i would like to remind the committee what i said about the definition earlier on <e> <s> i think it can be said that portable is better than small but still the word portable leaves stonehenge ready to be taken away

lords the m one of our oldest motorways and in use for over years now needs extensive repairs <e> <s> both major structural repairs and routine maintenance operations are in hand all of which require lane closures <e> <s> the reason for these closures which are necessary to protect the travelling public and workmen as well as to allow work to proceed may not always be apparent to the passing

question asked by the noble lord lord beswick in this house as recently as th february when we talked about the maintenance work then and i note that there were some nine supplementaries on that occasion <e> <s> the government are always striving to reduce delays and accidents at repair sites <e> <s> this year some new measures are being introduced on the m <e> <s> for example improved

with other noble lords in their tributes to lord butler of saffron walden not so much about central africa where i was not connected with him but as more of a personal tribute for he was of course a family friend for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think i can add anything to what i said about that which was a straightforward reply to the noble lords question regarding the present governments actions <e>", "<cs> my lords there has recently been useful progress in devising methods to control spray from lorries and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is urgently examining how this can be translated into a technical standard which could form the basis of regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords there will be a lot of consultation before any such legislation can be introduced and the preparation of such a standard would naturally involve industry and other interested bodies <e> <s> a result would not be ready i am afraid for some time <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i was aware of all the three points that he made <e> <s> as to the latter point i understand that vehicle weights depend on their aerodynamic qualities <e> <s> i was not aware that southampton university had done anything in this connection on th february but i know that they have undertaken a research programme in which we are interested <e> <s> what has highlighted this at the present moment are some very interesting new inventions which have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we are aware of that <e> <s> one of the ministers in the department has already looked at this particular system <e> <s> however if we are to legislate we must do so by reference to a standard which will allow a range of designs and products <e>", "<cs> my lords in may last year the government announced a reduction in the maximum permitted lead content of petrol from to grammes per litre to take effect by st december <e> <s> the government chose this option as the quickest way in which to achieve the largest reduction in lead emissions <e> <s> a european community working party is however assessing the need and scope for and consequences of a reduction in polluting exhaust emissions from vehicles including lead and the united kingdom is taking an active part in this study <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i would not agree with the noble baroness that the evidence is unequivocal <e> <s> high levels of exposure to lead are certainly dangerous but the working party on lead and health chaired by professor lawther reported that the evidence of harmful effects of low level exposure was not conclusive <e> <s> more research work is in hand in a search for greater certainty and as a further indication of the governments determination to tackle the problem root and branch a wide range of measures is being taken to abate lead pollution from a variety of sources <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i take note of my noble friends remarks <e> <s> it is important to reduce peoples exposure to environmental lead as far as possible and as quickly as possible and that is what the government believe they are doing <e>",

of the environment are both supporting specific studies on the effect on children of low-level exposure to lead <e> <s> we still believe that the steps the government took last may are the most apposite for us to take at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the noble baroness may <e> <s> the two i have in mind are the united states and japan <e> <s> i believe australia also has it and i think there is one other country <e> <s> but if the noble baroness wishes to draw from the fact that they have lead-free petrol that that is because of health hazards she is of course wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure the noble lord is quite able to translate it himself <e>", "<cs> my lords it is because of the smog the catalysts which are necessary in order to get rid of smog are no use when there is lead in petrol <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it means having larger engines but it does mean considerable research and this is one of the reasons why the government took the steps they did in order to get the position of two-thirds less as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords of course the government are aware of the public pressure <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed it has a health factor but not i think the noble lord would agree as lead has <e>", "<cs> my lords in may of last year the government embarked on a positive policy <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will remember the statement made at the time which set out what that was <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baronesss original question was about the european community and we do have to go in step with them <e> <s>

<s> this is on target in fact it is slightly ahead of the targets set for the government by themselves at the beginning of their term <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult problem because as lower paid staff are rather more numerous in the department than higher paid staff it is obviously difficult to compare <e> <s> but the policy of reviewing the departments work function by function will mean that as functions are cut senior and junior posts will go <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have in front of me any comparable figures for the other departments <e> <s> but of course it is the policy that redundancies should be by normal wastage wherever possible <e> <s> in point of fact of the figures that i have produced for your lordships only per cent <e> <s> were redundancies <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the figure which i have just given the noble lord lord molloy it is per cent <e> <s> of the total of which i gave earlier for the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important to recognise the difference in the functions duties and responsibilities of central and local government when we are making these comparisons <e> <s> however there are some district councils such as eastbourne which has reduced by per cent <e> <s> and blackburn which has reduced by per cent <e> <s> which lead one to think that some of the others must have had very small savings or virtually none at all <e> <s> the government believe that there is scope for greater reductions in local government manpower overall which can be achieved by improved economy and efficiency <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging and well-informed debate and as i have found is usual when this house discusses transport problems it has produced a lot of original ideas <e> <s> i join with other noble lords in saying how grateful i am to my noble friend lord lucas for raising and introducing this subject and also to other noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> it is a topic on which it is particularly useful to have such an exchange of ideas <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate my noble friend lord cayzer on his modest and most informative speech <e> <s> he seemed to cover a great deal of ground in his speech of some minutes <e> <s> i am sure that the whole house looks forward to hearing him often in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood my noble friend aright i think he will discover if he reads the report of my remarks that i have been stating a reasoned and general policy <e> <s> if i may continue from where i was we are not prepared to legislate to turn back the clock <e> <s> but the government have taken urgent action to resolve the immediate problems <e> <s> we introduced the travel concessions london act to enable the glc to support concessionary fares <e> <s> and we offered legislation which the glc declined to enable the million deficit from the low fares policy to be spread over five years cushioning the impact on fares <e> <s> i must make it clear that the government support the payment of a reasonable level of subsidy to maintain essential transport services <e> <s> last year some million was paid to london transport in various grants and a similar level of subsidy will he available in <e> <s> about million of this support comes from the national taxpayer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his advice <e> <s> i had come to the end on that point <e> <s> noble lords have mentioned the levels of subsidy paid to the public transport systems in various european cities and we feel that such comparisons are often made on a rather selective basis <e> <s> for one thing the comparisons are invariably over-simplified and misleading because it is virtually impossible to transpose the accounts of foreign transport undertakings so as to permit a thorough and accurate comparison <e> <s> for example the figures quoted often omit capital grants which obviously make a difference <e>", "<cs> my lords the board are currently preparing this programme and will consider it as soon as it is available <e> <s> the approval of individual electrification projects within the programme depends not only on the profitability of the investment in question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> we do think that this is important <e> <s> i cut out the last four pages of my speech because i thought that minutes was enough <e> <s> if i may i will go into that question on another occasion <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in the general appreciation of the house for the way in which my noble kinsman lord henley introduced the second reading of the bill and explained it to us <e> <s> i shall speak very briefly to give an indication of the governments views <e> <s> being surrounded by so many distinguished experts whom i am delighted to find in agreement on this occasion i should not dare to intervene on the subject of horseracing nor for that matter to expound on the charms of epsom and walton downs or ewell when other noble lords have such first-hand knowledge <e> <s> however it might be helpful if i confirm and endorse what a number of noble lords have said that so far as the government are aware racing at epsom and in particular the derby will continue as it has always done and that we know of no intention to abandon or disrupt epsom as a training centre for racehorses <e>", "<cs> i think i can set the noble lords mind at rest and i shall try to do so <e> <s> the government freely put down what is now clause in the other place to make provision for the uprating of housing benefits and i am sure the committee will understand why we could not mortgage the future by making provision for automatic index-linking of the needs allowances <e> <s> but the government freely put down a provision that where the secretary of state considers that some or all the needs allowances have not retained their value over the course of a year but decides not to increase some or all allowances or only to increase some or all of them by part of the amount required to restore their value then he must report his reasons to parliament <e> <s> i feel that this is surely what the opposition would most wish us to do and it is in fact what this clause does do <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i intervene now <e> <s> clause carries forward authorities discretionary powers to make at their own expense more generous local rebate/allowances schemes than the provisions of statutory schemes <e> <s> may i first make it clear to the committee that the government wholeheartedly agree with my noble friends that authorities should be able as now to disregard war pensions completely when they assess claimants under local schemes <e> <s> nothing in the housing benefit scheme will prevent authorities from doing so <e> <s> in fact local authorities will have power under clause to frame more generous schemes within their areas which disregard war widows and disablement pensions completely <e>", "<cs> the governments position is that local authorities will be fully compensated for additional costs incurred as a result of the provisions of this bill <e> <s> that remains our intention and i have no hestiation in repeating that pledge <e> <s> the order to be made under clause in due course will ensure that authorities receive full reimbursement not only for the extra benefit costs arising from the new scheme but also for any additional expenses in administration which they need to incur in dealing with the extra work which the new scheme brings them <e> <s> this clear undertaking could be no more generous than this <e> <s> where authorities costs are forced up by this bill they will be met in full by central government <e> <s> but nothing in the bill provides any justification for increasing the rate of subsidy for existing cases or for those cases which will be dealt with by an authority irrespective of the new scheme <e>", "<cs> i have not got that figure with me but i am told that the amount suggested by the noble lord is correct <e>", "<cs> if the noble baroness would speak to those amendments rather than move them it would be helpful <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government intend to lay the code of guidance before both <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of my noble friends remarks but of course this is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very sad to know that the noble lord lord leatherland did not attend the few days we spent on the wildlife and countryside act <e> <s> sssi stands for a site of special scientific interest <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be impossible for me at question time to comment on all the various sites which are at the moment under discussion <e> <s> however as the noble lord is aware we are progressing quite speedily in this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords as soon as we can <e>", "<cs> i think that this might be a convenient moment to resume the house <e> <s> i beg to move that the house do now resume <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to respond to some of the points which were made during the debate <e> <s> although i am sorry to see that some noble lords particularly the noble baroness lady birk and the noble lord lord hooson are not yet reconciled to the principle of fees for planning applications i hope that they will understand if i do not seek to traverse again that well-trodden ground <e> <s> we discussed the principle at length during the passage of the local government planning and land act as the noble baroness lady birk said and section of the legislation gives the secretary of state the necessary enabling powers <e> <s> i note however that there has been a general welcome for the detailed changes introduced by these amending regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i included the noble baroness in my remarks when i said that i would write to anyone whose questions i had not answered <e> <s> i think that quite a lot of her questions were covered in my reply but until we have discussed with the local authorities i cannot go any further <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are aware of previous representations on this case and i understand that in dealing with it the board have reaffirmed their policy of resisting the extension of horse-drawn services unless there are particular and compelling circumstances <e> <s> i also understand that this policy was arrived at taking into account the cost of maintaining tow paths and the possible effect upon the safety and convenience of other boaters and of anglers and walkers who are the major leisure and recreational users of towing paths <e>", "<cs> my lords while it must be of course for the board to take day-to-day responsibility for licensing controls my honourable friend would be willing to discuss the boards general policy with them <e> <s> i cannot of course say what the outcome of such discussions will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble lords experience but i do not think i was saying that <e> <s> i was saying that it is the anglers and other people who are put at risk by the horse <e>", "<cs> my lords before i came to give my answer i looked up to see when this question was last answered <e> <s> it was last answered by the noble baroness lady stedman who gave an answer very much the same as my own from this particular dispatch box <e> <s> may i say that in its recent review the government have in fact given a lot of money to the support of the canals and i believe that the policy is changing <e> <s> in fact i believe that the noble viscount lord st davids is actually quite pleased with the present governments activities <e>", "<cs> my lords when it comes to equalling the expertise of the noble lord lord wigg i think that my own colleagues are very good <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that scottish aphorism <e>", "<cs> the noble viscount is indeed quite correct my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness did not feel that we had gone far enough in this amendment <e> <s> she said that schedule was perhaps cumbersome and unworkable <e> <s> we do not think so <e> <s> we believe that schedule is a more comprehensive provision than is to be found in local legislation covering the permitting of things which are not even covered by local acts on wider classes of highways <e> <s> moreover local acts would appear to be unworkable with the repeal of section of the town and country planning act which was included in this bill from the outset <e> <s> i would remind the noble baroness that it was the local authorities through their associations which pressed the government originally to legislate on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather lost the noble lord when he went to singapore <e> <s> if i understand him correctly this is a clause enabling the council to require indemnities <e> <s> if they have indemnities obviously the council will be in a position to do what the noble earl asks <e>", "<cs> my lords experience has shown that the public often pay little attention to notices posted in streets hence the need for supplementary provision for notifying materially affected owners and occupiers <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may speak with the leave of the house i was really stressing another point which i do not think the noble baroness referred to in her original remarks <e> <s> i was stressing that this is an addition to notices posted in the street on lampposts <e> <s> but it is still necessary for the other <e> <s> however i hope l have answered her own question at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords the existing procedure in clause h provides for the posting of a notice in the affected highway and for owners and occupiers of materially affected properties to be notified <e> <s> it would be unduly fastidious to extend this procedure to other organisations who may not be directly affected <e> <s> incidentally it might be rather difficult to distinguish which ones should be subject to such a procedure <e> <s> where desirable such consultations can generally be left to the good sense of councils <e> <s> in the governments view it is for the bill to specify the essential requirements alone <e> <s> otherwise all sorts of interest groups would be able to lay claim to a place in the bill <e> <s> i hope that on reflection the noble baroness might agree that this could he so <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not feel particularly strongly on this one <e> <s> if i could first answer the point put by the noble lord lord davies of leek about the newspaper shop for a shop that had frontage consent would be required if anybody proposed to trade outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i will certainly have a look at what the noble baroness has said and see whether it is thought necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may try to answer some of the questions which have been asked the noble baroness lady fisher was quite correct in talking about highway legislation because in that any obstruction of the highway is a nuisance <e> <s> whether that obstruction actually impedes the passage of traffic over the highway is irrelevant hence the expression that we have used <e> <s> the provision seems more accurately to be aimed at preventing actual or likely interruption of use of the road or the causing or likelihood of causing danger on the road <e> <s> there is a precedent for this in section <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is saying that nobody should sell anything along the highway but surely there could be exemptions <e> <s> if it is properly sited it is not causing an interruption <e> <s> however i will pursue the noble baronesss remarks and see what i can do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord foot in his customary way might have been reading my brief in front of me he has demolished my arguments one by one as he went along <e> <s> as he rightly said there is such a proviso in section of the public health act <e> <s> however it is now considered to be unnecessary and for that reason i shall try to explain has not been included in the bill in the new section <e> <s> demolitions being carried out in pursuant of a demolition order made under the housing act which accounts for the bulk of demolitions initiated by a local authority have been specifically excluded from the notification requirements of section <e> <s> the proviso in section of the act is itself taken from earlier local acts and is not necessarily considered to be the best precedent on which to base our views <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might reply to some of the points raised by the noble lord so that we can mutually be considering the matter between now and third reading <e> <s> i am grateful for the noble lords appreciation of these amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords i was actually moving amendment no <e> <s> and i think that the noble lord lord foot was actually speaking to amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it will be convenient if we deal with amendments nos <e> <s> and and then the noble lord lord foot will be able to speak again on amendment no <e> <s> in order to reply to me <e> <s> therefore with the leave of the house i beg to move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords if we were perfect there would be nothing for us to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that it is not now the policy to direct any civil matters to the magistrates court those courts are overburdened with work and at least since those matters have been so dealt with <e> <s> i shall of course look at what the noble baroness said <e>", "<cs> that is so my lords and i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords the government recognise that these amendments have been prompted out of a very real feeling of care and concern both for dogs and for people by those sections of the community most involved with the problems <e> <s> i recognise that this prompted similar proposals at the committee stage <e> <s> i appreciate as the noble lord lord houghton said that the amendments have been changed since we last looked at them <e> <s> i know as the house does of the great conviction with which the noble lord speaks from both his heart and mind <e> <s> i am not sure that my noble friend lord bellwin is a very dog conscious man <e> <s> however i am so perhaps i can reply with as much understanding anyway as my noble friend lord bellwin <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was asking me about the scottish situation and with the <e>", "<cs> my lords amendment no <e> <s> would make very little change to existing legislation <e> <s> as i have already said the licence fee can be raised by order under existing primary legislation <e> <s> i should point out that there is no exemption for hounds in a pack under the age of months as at present <e> <s> however it does provide a new exemption for dogs for the deaf which of course we would welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as he said himself my noble friend has moved an amendment similar to that which he moved to clause of the bill in committee and he has used all his customary persuasiveness and tenacity in support of the proposed change <e> <s> with his usual courtesy my noble friend also gave me advance warning of his intention to raise this issue again this evening and of the arguments that he intended to use in support of his case <e> <s> my noble friend lord bellwin and i always listen with great respect to everything that my noble friend lord ridley says about local government issues especially when they involve anything to do with national parks and in this context i also listen to my noble friend lord sandford and the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i know that my noble friend lord bellwin considered this amendment with great care and deliberation when it was tabled at committee stage and that he resisted it then only because on balance he was not persuaded that it was desirable to amend clause in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords let me first say that the government recognise that this is a matter which the noble baroness is quite right to raise <e> <s> we have gone to some trouble to find out what a few authorities already do to deal with something which everybody dislikes <e> <s> we have found even in the absence of specific statutory powers for this purpose that certain authorities are already taking remedial steps to deal with this nuisance <e> <s> when it appears on buildings the authorities own on housing estates or in other places the cleansing department goes into action to remove it <e> <s> and when it is a publicly-owned building belonging to some other public body or it is a building in private ownership the local authority will again go into action but they will quite properly try and recover the cost from the owner of the building for whom they have in effect provided a service <e> <s> what i am describing is the practice already adopted voluntarily as part of their normal functions by just a few of the best authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i apologise to the noble baroness lady david for not giving her the credit for what i now see appears on the previous page <e> <s> i do so now <e> <s> may i also confirm that what she said about a boards is correct <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk raised the question of reasonable inquiry on the part of local authorities <e> <s> as she is well aware this will be a matter for the courts to determine in any action where a person claims that his interest has been prejudiced by the councils failure to inquire thoroughly into his whereabouts <e> <s> however i will inquire into the point which she has raised and ensure that it is properly looked at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house be now adjourned during pleasure until ten past eight <e>", "<cs> my lords i add my gratitude to the noble lord lord kearton for introducing this debate and for enabling us to consider the future of the coal industry and its environmental consequences today <e> <s> in fact i also thank him for initiating this lively and informative debate <e> <s> the noble earl lord halsbury by referring to gardens in my family name has made me rather nervous in case i should find there has been some acid rain in my garden <e> <s> however the noble lord lord wynne-jones was kind enough to say that there were no ministers of the department of energy <e> <s> i do assure him that sitting on the benches <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me the opportunity to express the appreciation of her majestys government for the magnificent support given by the civilian workforce in the present crisis <e> <s> throughout the ministry of defence the response was immediate and effective with significant numbers of both industrial and non-industrial employees working long hours and shift duties to prepare the task force for deployment to the south atlantic <e> <s> civilian employees continue to make a sustained and significant contribution in support of the military operations and a number are serving with the task force in royal fleet auxiliary vessels and on ascension island <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends remarks <e> <s> perhaps i may say that in addition to the staff employed in the naval areas of the department other civilians at army and raf establishments and also staff at headquarters divisions have responded magnificently to the additional demands made upon them <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed some did <e> <s> the issue of redundancy notices at chatham and portsmouth was recently postponed for the immediate future to enable us to take stock of the effects of the falklands crisis <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i warmly agree with my noble friend lady faithfull <e>", "<cs> my lords if i did not include them in the earlier ones i certainly do now <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for their general support and thanks to the government for working this one out so speedily and i shall convey to my noble friend lord bellwin the kind of remarks that have been made <e> <s> this short debate has been constructive and as in the past the issue has been fairly provocative <e> <s> to the noble lord lord northfield whose speech was i thought slightly oliver twistish in asking for a little more i would stress what i have said that we shall keep the subject under review <e> <s> the p limit under section can of course be varied without further legislation as the noble lord himself pointed out <e> <s> we think that in keeping to the general limit of p rather than the figure in the consultation paper we have moved sufficiently far in the direction he would wish <e> <s> i would stress again that the p limit operates on a net basis and need not provide for the msc schemes <e> <s> i hope therefore that for the time being we can leave that as it stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the way that the noble baroness introduced the amendment <e> <s> i do not doubt that the clause would be useful to local authorities because it would enable them to obtain information which would assist them in the performance of many statutory functions <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord houghton said by way of preview as it were it would breach the principle of confidentiality which is of fundamental importance to our taxation system <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i would say that i do not think that the government could at the moment accept the amendments because of the reasons that i gave in particular the fundamental point that it would breach the principle of confidentiality <e> <s> the great difficulty is that confidential information cannot be dissected from non-confidential information except at great expense and i think that it is a fundamental principle that we have to get over <e> <s> what i do not have is an answer to the noble baronesss narrower point and if i may i should like to pursue that further after the debate is over <e>", "<cs> my lords i join in thanking my noble friend lord sandford for his balanced introduction of the second reading of the bill <e> <s> i also add my tribute to my honourable friend the member for salisbury to whose determination and persistence over years we owe the appearance of this measure today <e> <s> i should make clear that the government in no way oppose the bill <e> <s> indeed the government attach great importance to the principle of the bill that is that planning inquiries should be held in public and in that they are following in the footsteps of previous administrations <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord just give way <e> <s> i think that he is speaking to amendment and that no <e> <s> has been spoken to already <e>", "<cs> my lords the government share the concern of the central transport consultative committee about the level of expenditure on track maintenance <e> <s> to avoid further reductions in expenditure on necessary renewal and maintenance of the infrastructure my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has announced his intention to earmark part of this years public service obligation grant for this purpose <e>", "<cs> my lords i follow the noble lord in his three supplementaries though i am not quite sure what he means by the contingency fund and perhaps we could have a look at that afterwards <e> <s> we agree entirely with the idea that british rail present a wonderful option for transport in our country <e> <s> like the noble lord i have read the figures and i was delighted to see that over the last two years punctuality has remained more or less constant <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not seen the figures which the noble lord lord underhill has just quoted to me but of course i shall look into them <e> <s> perhaps i may just say that in point of fact a renewal of track does not count against the investment income so this is a separate item which i believe ought to be spent on renewal of track which was the point of my earlier answer to the noble lord lord davies of leek <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that what the government are proposing will equally catch both the imagination and support of the house <e> <s> i should like to say how much i appreciated the way in which the noble lord lord wallace of coslany presented his arguments and i shall try to do the same <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord wallace said my noble friend lord bellwin explained in committee at some length the governments reasoning on the amendment and that actually followed discussions with the local authority associations and voluntary organisations most concerned <e> <s> the government therefore decided that the most practical way of helping boarders in receipt of supplementary benefit was to provide for them to continue to receive their housing assistance via the supplemantery benefit scheme <e> <s> i should emphasise that the term boarders includes but does not refer exclusively to hostel dwellers so there is no question of singling out hostel dwellers as a different class for different treatment <e>", "<cs> my lords there is very little in my brief which has not been quoted at me from one side or the other during the course of this debate <e> <s> having sat through the discussions when we in this house talked about devolution i wonder what would happen to my supporters if we had lost scotland at that particular time <e> <s> of course there is nothing economic or political in this as noble lords know <e> <s> i think i must stress just one or two things particularly as my noble friend lord drumalbyn asked me about one point <e> <s> the government wholeheartedly agree that authorities should be able as now to disregard war pensions completely when they assess claimants under local schemes <e> <s> nothing in the housing benefit legislation will prevent authorities from so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords as was announced during the committee stage in another place the social security advisory committee will assume responsibility for advising ministers on housing benefit when the new scheme is introduced <e> <s> i should not like noble lords to think that the social security advisory committee will not have available the expertise to cope with the new benefit <e> <s> department of health and social security ministers and the chairman of the social security advisory committee sir arthur armitage agreed that the membership should be increased by two specifically to allow the committee to be strengthened for its new responsibilities <e> <s> but both ministers and the chairman of the committee take the view that the social security advisory committee should remain a fairly small committee in which all the members are involved in all the main subject areas if it is properly to fulfil its role of advising ministers <e> <s> we believe that it would obviously weaken the committees ability to advise on specific issues in <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the victoria and albert museum used to operate a programme of loan exhibitions but this was run down during the period of the previous government <e> <s> nevertheless extensive arrangements for loans to the regions are already operated by the national museums and galleries and my right honourable friend will look for every opportunity to encourage this <e>", "<cs> i would indeed agree with the noble baroness my lords <e> <s> she might like to know that i am told that loans of various kinds will be going this year from the victoria and albert museum either directly or under the auspices of the arts council to many regional centres including birmingham bradford burnley cambridge bristol and scotland <e> <s> indeed just starting at the victoria and albert and then going to bristol and southampton under the auspices of the arts council is an exhibition of cotman water colours <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course draw my noble friends remarks to the attention of the director <e> <s> i understand that in point of fact on occasions they lend the odd piece as it were rather than a full-scale collection <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think the government agree in any way that anything is being run down in these terms <e> <s> in fact we are very proud of the record of our museums at the moment <e> <s> i of course cannot comment on a report that is being issued tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords again of course i will bear the remarks of the noble baroness in mind and bring them to the attention of the director <e> <s> i think the difficulties will probably be in the scope and the security of such an operation but i quite take her point <e>", "<cs> of course my lords directly i mentioned scotland i knew i might be in danger from other sources <e> <s> i am sure that will be borne in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with other noble lords in expressing gratitude to the noble baroness lady stedman for raising this subject this afternoon and for the thorough and helpful way in which she introduced it <e> <s> i shall of course convey her thanks to sir peter baldwin and others for what the department is doing <e> <s> i also very much welcome the contributions from other speakers to what has been a well-informed and wide-ranging debate <e> <s> we have this afternoon heard many ideas and suggestions all of which will continue to stimulate the department <e> <s> i shall comment on as many of them as i can in the short time available but i assure the house that the government will carefully consider everything that has been said <e> <s> i should like to extend my good wishes to my noble friend lord crawshaw and i hope that we shall soon see him again in the chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that there are two breaks in the middle so we have to move one amendment at a time <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord lord gifford that it is the intention that information about planning decisions and the reasons for them in the form of planning decision letters are always made available not only to those parties who have a statutory right to receive them but also to the press and anyone else who asks for them <e> <s> this will continue to be the practice and we do not feel that there is reason for a statutory provision <e> <s> in the light of this longstanding departmental practice and the extreme rarity of any complaints of the kind to which the noble lord lord gifford has referred the government cannot accept that a need arises to provide a specific right for members of the public and press to receive reasoned decision letters on request <e> <s> even if need for such a right were established arguably it would be more appropriate by amendment of the statutory procedural rules governing many classes of planning inquiry which already deal with details of this kind rather than through primary legislation <e> <s> i hope that this explanation will allay any fears the noble lord has <e>", "<cs> my lords the case for a theatre museum has been recognised by successive governments in recent years <e> <s> it was previously decided in principle that the proposed museum as a department of the victoria and albert museum should be accommodated in the former flower market in covent garden <e> <s> the recently published report of a rayner scrutiny of the victoria and albert museum however included certain recommendations on the future of this project <e> <s> the government are consulting interested parties on these as well as other recommendations in the report <e> <s> final decisions will be taken after the consultation period ends in august <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks particularly for the first ones of which i am not aware and the second of which of course i am aware <e> <s> i will just say that of course we are making no decisions until august <e>", "<cs> my lords again i shall bear the noble lords remarks in mind but of course i cannot prejudge any decision <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am well aware of the noble lords interest in this matter in that he did indeed start this project when he himself was a minister for the arts <e> <s> the fact that the lease with the glc has still not been finished was partly due to the flooding during the noble lords term of office in i think <e> <s> but negotiations are still going on and i do not believe that the present consultations will make any undue delay at all <e>", "<cs> my lords as fully expected the debate has been very stimulating informed and generally constructive and has demonstrated once again the great interest generated in this house by transport issues <e> <s> there have been a number of worthwhile contributions from all sides which my noble friend lord bellwin and i will of course study in detail <e> <s> i shall try to answer as many of the major points made as is possible within the time allotted to me and shall leave the more detailed points to the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is aware the primary responsibility for traffic in london is vested in the greater london council <e> <s> the government for their part have placed a high priority on the completion of the m which will reduce through traffic in london <e> <s> the fixed penalty for illegal parking has recently been increased the recruitment of traffic wardens improved and powers are being sought in the transport bill which is at present before your lordships house which include making more difficult the avoidance of penalties as well as allowing the use of wheel clamps on an experimental basis in selected areas <e> <s> all of those measures are designed to reduce congestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not responsible for what the glc do and we have as my noble friend probably knows glc proposals to ban lorries in london <e> <s> these are at present under <e>", "<cs> there has indeed been an increase in bicycling my lords and we are well aware of that <e> <s> some studies have been done on it and a number of authorities arc following the ideas which the noble lord has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord underhill in thanking my noble friend lord balfour of inchrye for instituting a debate we had some months ago <e> <s> i also endorse everything lord underhill said about the progress that is being made including the fact that the glc has the wood committee at present sitting on this very subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure those are the sort of conditions and situations which are being discussed at the moment by the committee set up by the glc and i am sure they will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the date of completion of the m for which we are hoping is <e> <s> i have i am sure like other noble lords sat in a traffic jam on the <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord has said my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord obviously speaks from putney where such boxes would be very unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends intervention <e> <s> he may care to know that at present about only per cent <e> <s> of londons freight is carried on the river <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the glc has indeed considered such things but i have a feeling that the administrative costs would be prohibitive <e>", "<cs> my lords these regulations are being prepared and we hope to have ready soon a draft for consultation with representatives of outside organisations which is required under the act <e> <s> the rate of progress thereafter will inevitably depend on the results of the consultation but the regulations will be made and laid before parliament as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite understand the noble lords point and in fact i looked for him towards the end of last week to see whether i could supplement the answer that was given to me <e> <s> what has happened regarding the regulations is that technical advances were made by the end of last year and instructions were ready by the beginning of january for the legal department but unfortunately we have had a little trouble with the legal department because of pressure of work <e> <s> it may seem strange but the lawyer in question was <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend has said and i am sure that it has nothing to do with the term sleeping policemen <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know that there is any necessity to come back to the house to do any such thing <e> <s> there are no serious shortcomings at all <e> <s> this is one particular case where one man has to do two jobs and i am sure the noble lord would not wish a whole series of lawyers to be sitting there ready to do anything which comes up <e> <s> this gentleman has had to do the motorcycle test which i know my noble friend lady macleod is very interested in and of course it is impossible for one man to do everything at once <e> <s> i would have thought that at the moment the department of transport has just about exactly the right number of people it should have <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> if i could repeat what i said to the noble lord lord beswick indeed we are just about to hold the consultations which are required by the act <e> <s> because of unforeseen circumstances we are about two months behind what was our own plan <e>", "<cs> my lords whether you like to push a pram along a road or across a sleeping policeman is up to you <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> courses have now begun at all five locations and every place on every course is now allocated <e> <s> the courses are going very well and many of the young people have commented on how enjoyable and rewarding they have found the training <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards next year the scheme was set up this year because there was spare capacity in the training organisation which may or may not occur to the same extent next year <e> <s> the decision on whether to repeat the scheme will be taken in the light of such capacity as is available and other relevant factors including its success <e> <s> so far as the medical situation is concerned i understand that the young people are given a fairly full army medical before they go on the course <e> <s> i have no statistics on the failure rate i do not believe that they are kept <e> <s> some of the boys on the course go back early because they are not fit enough <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no statistics on that but i am sure that my right honourable friend the prime minister will bear in mind the noble lords remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the full numbers for the courses will be about <e>", "<cs> my lords at the moment i think that they probably are <e>", "<cs> my lords no amendment to the statutes of the victoria cross is required <e> <s> it could be awarded for actions in the south atlantic if a suitable recommendation were made <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend has said as i am sure will my right honourable friend <e> <s> i cannot comment on any particular recommendations which may or may not have been made <e>", "<cs> my lords it would not be appropriate for the government to dictate the colour of residential caravans <e> <s> local authorities have power to impose colour conditions when granting planning permission and site licences for the caravan sites <e> <s> they are best placed to consider what will suit the beauty of their own locality <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend has said <e> <s> in the british standards institution published a range of preferred exterior colours for static caravans <e> <s> these were the most acceptable colours within the landscape which also avoided problems of overheating <e> <s> my right honourable friends the secretary of state for the environment and the secretary of state for wales gave this range their support in august and indicated to the local authority associations that they would have regard to it when considering planning appeals <e>", "<cs> my lords that indeed is a point <e> <s> it may be for the convenience of the house if i say that there are colours laid down in these statistics varying from mud greys through beige greens browns and blues <e>", "<cs> my lords as i think my earlier replies will have brought out there are powers for the local authorities to do this <e> <s> the government believe it right to leave the matter with the local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> with all his knowledge of the countryside commission he is well competent to give us this advice <e> <s> if i may say something about the colour green i am actually wearing a green jackets tie which was of course designed for camouflage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for this excellent example of what can be done with a little thought and consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw my noble friends attention to the fact that these are static caravans <e> <s> i therefore hope that there will be no overtaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the local authorities have these regulations and it is up to them to enforce them <e> <s> if it comes to the government intervening i am not sure what our powers are at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords with that particular question i think we are moving a little down the wrong channel <e>", "<cs> my lords there has been public consultation about this rather different matter which has unified local authorities control over camp sites and sites for the touring type of caravan <e> <s> as far as caravans in the garden are concerned the position will depend on the powers of local authorities in the area concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend brings out the point that some things are not altogether happy for the inhabitants of caravans <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not our policy to make forecasts of this nature <e> <s> however there are encouraging signs that construction output is beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope that the various measures which the government have taken in the field of land planning taxation and low-cost home ownership are encouraging just this <e>", "<cs> my lords in spite of the noble lords charming question i do not think i want to be drawn into estimates for the future <e> <s> the government plan to spend billion in which is per cent <e> <s> up on what was spent last year <e> <s> they believe that we should invest where it will do most to stimulate even greater investment by the private sector as exemplified by our low-cost home ownership programme the derelict land scheme and the enterprise zones <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i will of course pursue what the noble lord has said with my honourable friend the minister for housing to make sure that he takes note of it <e>", "<cs> my lords although a final decision on the location of the inspectorate for hazardous waste has still to be taken we expect to be able to establish it by the end of the year <e> <s> in the period since the report was published interested organisations have submitted views on it to the department of the environment and a series of very valuable meetings has been held with the major groups the local authority associations water authority representatives industry and the disposal contractors the institute of waste management and environmentalists <e> <s> the governments commitment remains to seek the best means of implementing most of the recommendations and while a wide measure of co-operation has been expressed at those meetings by all parties there is still much work to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords unlike some of my noble friends i was in great sympathy with the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in the house last november the government feel that waste disposal authorities should progress further into the preparation of waste disposal plans before bringing in section which i think is what the noble baroness is referring to <e> <s> the government still believe that this is the best course <e> <s> a considerable number of other authorities are now nearing the completion of their plans and the government feel that a good momentum is now being maintained in this area <e> <s> the government are still firmly of the view that implementation of section must await further progress on these plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement which is now being made by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport in another place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows with permission mr speaker i would like to make a statement about the further threatened strike on british rail and government measures to help rail users <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill and the noble baroness lady seear for their remarks which are much appreciated <e> <s> perhaps i may take first the specific point raised by the noble baroness <e> <s> as i understand it this is the normal practice <e> <s> it is what happened in the previous strikes and it will happen again this time <e> <s> i think that people are now accustomed to it but i will bring her remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his opening remarks <e> <s> as far as government departments are concerned it is left to individual departments but i think as my noble friend said on monday certainly in our department they are doing extremely well at staggering them <e>", "<cs> my lords my attention has been drawn to several instances of harm being done to wild animals and plants which will receive protection or improved protection when part is brought fully into operation <e> <s> her majestys government deplore such acts <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is well aware of the situation and is hopeful that difficulties in the preparation of the related regulations will shortly be overcome so that the commencement orders can be made <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of and the noble lord has been kind enough to draw our attention to the facts about the rare birds of prey <e> <s> i agree that the preliminary figures are alarming <e> <s> such robberies are of course already illegal under the protection of birds act <e> <s> when the registration and inspection provisions of the wildlife and countryside act come into force very careful and detailed checks will be made on the origins of immature birds to see whether they are captive bred or taken from the wild <e> <s> as far as the laying of commencement orders is concerned of course i cannot give any complete promise but as i said in my earlier answer we hope to have these done very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate my noble friends concern and i am sure that the house will join with me in deploring any action of irresponsible people to use the act as a convenient early warning as regards those creatures and plants they should now concentrate on collecting before it is too late <e> <s> the unauthorised uprooting of wild flowers is already illegal and i understand that the police have been informed in a case which has been given some publicity <e> <s> many wild creatures are also protected by current legislation <e> <s> however i know that my noble friend is particularly interested in bats and i am greatly encouraged that many responsible people are already coming forward to the nature conservancy council for advice on the new act particularly on the protection of bats <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the noble lords concern and whereas i do not think that perhaps my pressure may be of much use i shall certainly bring his pressure to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords this has indeed been considered and if we continue to have trouble with the two particular sections that are causing trouble at present then we shall do what the noble baroness has suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords i gather that the question of the badgers is at the moment under consideration <e> <s> so far as promising to do it before we actually rise for the recess is concerned i cannot do so but i hope very much to have it done anyway before we come back again <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is very happily reinforcing my point which is that there is no real change in what we are expecting and that the fear which has been expressed that you could be asked to produce a licence under this system is not a real one <e> <s> there is no real change <e> <s> you can still deny having your licence and then take it to the police station at another time to show that you have it <e> <s> perhaps i may develop my argument a little more because there is quite a lot of it <e>", "<cs> may i put the committee straight on that point immediately because it is an important issue <e> <s> it will cover both points and endorsements <e> <s> that is why we are getting in otherwise we could not hope to get in such a number <e> <s> once a police officer has decided for instance about speeding that he wants to see the licence if it results in too many points he will have to take it back up the tree because he will be unable to deal with it then and there by means of a fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> basically if one has a clean licence then one has nothing to worry about <e> <s> if a police officer looks at the licence he can act on the spot <e> <s> if ones licence has too many points which will take one over the limit then obviously the police officer cannot adjudicate <e> <s> if one does not have ones licence on one or does not want to show it then one can go through the procedure as per normal one can still ask to go to court <e> <s> this is an additional process to the law and it does not in any way stop anybody from taking the matter to the court to have an argument about whether he is guilty or not guilty <e>", "<cs> it seems a long time ago that the noble lord lord mishcon and i crossed swords right at the beginning about the surrendering of the licence <e> <s> although he did not think that he was speaking on my side i rather thought that he was <e>", "<cs> oh good <e> <s> i am glad to hear it <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right of course <e> <s> under the present law the driver has five days to produce a licence <e> <s> let me try once again to explain about the fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may try to answer the noble lord lord mishcon because i think that he was more or less right the whole way up his family tree except about the endorsement <e> <s> if you agree with a policeman on the street he will give you a fixed penalty ticket <e> <s> you send up your licence with that fixed penalty ticket and you will get the same endorsement as you would if you were found guilty <e>", "<cs> it is no different from what happens under the present law <e> <s> under the present law the motorist has to produce a licence in five days <e>", "<cs> i think that that would be a terrifying complication which i should not like to enter into at this stage <e>", "<cs> the point system included in these fixed penalties is only obligatory endorsements <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that all discretionary endorsements must go to a court <e>", "<cs> i think we are still all right but we are doing it in different terms <e> <s> it is only what my <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be helpful if i speak at this stage and then get shot down from all sides <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords amendment is that endorsable offences which were dealt with by the fixed penalty procedure would attract a fixed fine but no penalty points <e> <s> if the same offences were reported for prosecution and dealt with by the courts they would attract a fine to be decided by the courts and the number of penalty points appropriate to the offence <e> <s> the governments proposal is that endorsable offences should attract penalty points whether they are dealt with by the fixed penalty procedure or by the courts and i should say straight away that we regard the noble lords proposal as being not merely a modification of our proposals but as putting forward something which is fundamentally different <e>", "<cs> looking at schedule the offences for fixed penalties are listed <e> <s> the noble lord will see that all the offences there are obligatory there are no discretionary endorsements under the fixed penalty <e>", "<cs> i join the noble lord lord underhill in his general welcome of the proposition which underlies these amendments that illegal parking seriously disrupts the bus industry and that the bus operators could operate more economically and effectively in conditions free of obstruction caused by illegal parking <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to report that the restoration of the ceiling of this chamber is progressing well and should be completed as planned by october <e> <s> the main contract for the supply and fixing of new joinery and structural carpentry was let in january at a price of <e> <s> the contract for the restoration of the painted ceiling panels was let in march for <e> <s> this work should be completed by august <e> <s> the fixing of the panels and carved wood should then take about a further year and the restored ceiling should be revealed to view in october <e> <s> the overall cost of the restoration should remain well within the original estimate of million thanks to competitive tendering <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her congratulations which i shall of course pass on <e> <s> it is always a great feeling for me when sitting on the front bench to think that she might be crawling about the timbers above my head <e> <s> i can confirm that timber similar to that used in the original ceiling will be employed and that scots pine from the estate of the noble earl lord cawdor will be used for the carpentry and yellow pine from canada for the joinery <e> <s> i am not quite sure of the antecedents of the pines otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords if i am to be diplomatic i should say that they were conceived before and grew up after <e>", "<cs> yes my lords a survey of the ceiling in the peers lobby has been completed and the report has been evaluated by the department <e> <s> the condition of the ceiling is poor and subject to the agreement of the administrative committee a protective scaffold and platform will be erected during the summer recess <e> <s> in view of this discovery it is also being considered prudent to survey the other decorative ceilings in the house of lords during the summer recess <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly bring that particular point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether it will be possible at this stage to make any lowering in order to help the acoustics <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made by my right honourable friend the minister for local government in the other place <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the comments of both noble baronesses <e> <s> where we slightly differ from them is that we feel that this is <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble baroness will just allow me to reply to the noble lord <e> <s> we are not hostile to local authorities in this <e> <s> what we are trying to do is to ensure that local authorities carry out their duties effectively <e> <s> however we do not believe that water authorities which are major industrial undertakings are part of the local authorities job <e> <s> it is a closer relationship with the government to the regional water authorities that enables us to take this step <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the kind way in which he put his questions <e> <s> first i should like to say that the government are well aware of the work which my noble friend has done in this field particularly as chairman of the nwc <e> <s> i would like to say that we look forward to absolutely no lowering of standards and shall try to maintain the same standards which he maintained <e> <s> my noble friend asked several questions and most of them are paraphrased by the words do we really think it is better <e> <s> i must answer all his questions by saying yes the government do think it is better otherwise they would not be doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords there are several reasons why we have decided to restructure the water authorities <e> <s> i mentioned a number of them in the statement <e> <s> perhaps i may return to the basic ones which are the inappropriateness of having these huge boards which was drawn out by the monopolies and mergers commission <e> <s> there is also a need for tighter links between the ministers and the water authorities themselves which we believe can be good <e> <s> there is a need to have executive members up front on the boards <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always very nervous of any questions coming from wales because i know they look after these matters very carefully <e> <s> i said in my original statement and it is all i have on this at the moment that the welsh water authority has already been reconstituted along these lines <e> <s> so far as further debate on this subject is concerned that is a matter for the usual channels <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first question we are not doing this exercise in any way to save money by cutting staff or anything like that although there will probably be one or two savings in this field <e> <s> we are really doing it in the name of efficiency <e> <s> so far as the boundaries are concerned the boundaries of water authorities will stay the same <e> <s> there is no change in the actual boundaries at the moment <e> <s> but i take the point my noble friend made <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously again i must say to the noble baroness that that should be discussed through the usual channels and with her extra influence it is more likely to come about <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> with regard to the question about staff there are various parts and functions of the central council and some of those will be taken on by the regional water authorities <e> <s> until discussion with the regional water authorities has taken place it is impossible to answer her question in depth <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for coming to my assistance at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as my noble friends earlier comments are concerned of course we equally have to be careful that we do not announce things <e>", "<cs> my lords with that added sting in the tail of course i will take my noble friends point to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to the noble baroness knowledge but of course we have got the monopolies and mergers commissions report on which we are basing this particular action <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by associating myself with other noble lords who have spoken this evening in expressing gratitude to the noble lord lord jenkins for asking his unstarred question and for the opportunitity it has provided us to discuss a topic about which he very clearly feels deeply <e> <s> the noble lord lord jenkins referred to some violins and i think i have heard ten violins so far playing a very similar tune and i shall endeavour in my remarks not to be too far out of tune <e> <s> the noble lord also referred to with the rest of us <e> <s> i am only sorry that because this particular thing is <e>", "<cs> my lords the new road proposal which affects the naseby area is the m a link road which will be an all-purpose trunk road and not a motorway <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport is looking at possible routes both north of naseby where the battlefield is and to the south <e> <s> he is anxious to avoid encroaching on the main area of the battlefield and i can assure your lordships that his proposal which he hopes to publish later this year will take full account of the claims of the battlefield the effect on the countryside the interests of local residents and the cost of the proposal as well as all other relevant factors <e> <s> a public inquiry will almost certainly be needed before a final decision is taken and <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend says although of course i cannot commit myself <e> <s> if it did go north i am sure the house would like to know that the area where it might pass would be the roundheads baggage train <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> this is a major link which is being proposed known i think as a green circle and it will be an important addition to the midlands <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords that is true <e> <s> but as a result of going ahead with that plan the review was in further studies revealed the poor ground conditions along the route and this factor forced us to bring the route nearer naseby village <e> <s> it is for this reason which is a good one that we feel the residents ought to be consulted again despite the extra costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that i should like to take up the time of the house with a soil survey but i should be happy to respond in a written answer <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of my noble friend i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> in discussing this amendment i would like to make it clear that it is our intention <e>", "<cs> if i may first reply to the specific point raised by the noble lord lord underhill section provides for the motoring speed limits and section creates the offence <e> <s> therefore it should actually be included and i am sure my noble friend would have said that in his reply <e>", "<cs> my advice is that it never has been in an act <e>", "<cs> i think we are trespassing almost on black rods territory namely how do we get out of the houses of parliament safely <e> <s> if i may come to the remarks of the noble lord lord underhill we feel there is little doubt that there may be circumstances where leaving a vehicle in a dangerous position proves such a hazard that the police officer will report the offence for prosecution <e> <s> i am equally certain that there will be circumstances in which it will be entirely appropriate for the matter to be dealt with by fixed penalty <e> <s> this is the extra thing we are now offering <e> <s> that is the flexibility which the government are trying to provide by giving the police this third option <e> <s> i do not think it is possible in every case to say that this <e>", "<cs> this amendment differs from the other amendment in a slightly surprising way in that this is a non-endorsable offence <e> <s> we are proposing that it should be covered by the extended fixed penalty system because non-endorsable offences have been traditionally regarded as less serious <e>", "<cs> i do not have the specific statistics for which my noble friend has asked and in point of fact i rather doubt that they exist <e> <s> if they do exist i will certainly let the house know what the figures are <e> <s> perhaps i could just put the figure of into context <e> <s> we are talking in round terms of offences a year of which we are trying to get some on to the fixed penalty system <e> <s> in that context the figure of is not all that large <e>", "<cs> these are all points slightly outside the scope of schedule but i will take note of them <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord underhill is entirely correct and he will be aware that the government are entirely at one with him in what his amendment seeks to achieve <e> <s> as he has mentioned it he will by now have seen our amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> all i can say in answer to his question is that we prefer our brief wording in that it is slightly more modern and stylish <e> <s> they both endeavour to do exactly the same thing <e>", "<cs> we believe it is unnecessary <e> <s> if i am wrong i will come back to it <e>", "<cs> it refers of course to the motorist <e>", "<cs> of course the noble lord will take his licence with him will he not <e> <s> i am sure that the noble baroness lady macleod will have no problems <e> <s> i know that my noble and learned friend will disperse the mist when he speaks next wednesday <e> <s> my noble friend lord lucas made an interesting point which i will of course look into <e> <s> naturally fairness is intended but scottish law is different and to that extent one has to make some arrangements <e>", "<cs> i shall not enter into that particular exchange between the noble lords <e> <s> however i should like to make my point <e> <s> i am not altogether sure that i wanted taxable companies to get a discount for parking penalties anyway but maybe that is just my own opinion <e> <s> the idea of offering a discount on the amount of the fixed penalty payable if it is paid promptly is not a new one <e> <s> it was first floated i understand by the joint working group on the enforcement of traffic regulations in london <e> <s> then the inter-departmental working party on road traffic law considered the idea in some detail and recommended that there should be enabling legislation to allow for an experiment with a discount scheme <e> <s> it is however to be noted my lords that the working party recognised that it could be over-elaborate to combine yet another tier on the fixed penalty structure with the procedures for enforcement that are now in this bill and that it would be difficult to find a suitable location for an experiment <e>", "<cs> of course i shall look into how recent the last report is and see whether it is time to look at this again <e> <s> i think that this is very much a matter of approach <e> <s> it is a matter of whether you want to give a discount for a penalty when you go to a court which i should have thought would have been a very original and not a very nice step to take or whether you want to encourage people to pay the fine because they have to pay more if they do not pay it <e> <s> if they have done something wrong i am not very keen to give them a discount <e>", "<cs> first i should apologise to the noble lord lord mishcon that i did not respond to him when he spoke earlier <e> <s> i shall answer him when i give the other answer on the specific point which i did understand <e> <s> i have rather an intriguing picture of those awful words persistent offender which my noble friend lord lucas tells me i must not use <e> <s> one really has to look at the figures quoted by the noble lord lord underhill to find out where he ought to live and which police forces he should dodge <e>", "<cs> i think that this is a very broad subject that we have been discussing and one in which i very much share the interest of the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> the question of uniform practice throughout the country obviously interests the committee very much but i wonder whether the fixed penalty clause which we are now considering is an appropriate juncture for consideration of this matter <e> <s> perhaps it should be considered in a wider context <e> <s> i should like to turn to one or two of the specific points which have arisen during the debate <e> <s> i should like to reiterate something that i said earlier which i think will please the noble lord lord mishcon <e> <s> i said that following a promise made in another place we have now established that the secretary of state for the home department and the secretary of state for scotland would be willing to offer general guidance to the police with the objective of uniform practices in mind <e> <s> if it is possible to produce something further along those lines at report stage we shall do so <e>", "<cs> i shall try to explain a little further <e> <s> the words unless the contrary is proved would give documents much greater weight than is intended to the point of their being conclusive evidence of the facts stated in them unless proved to be false <e> <s> the intention with which i am sure the noble lord lord mishcon would agree is that they should be no more than evidence that the court may take into consideration while giving them what weight it sees fit to give them <e> <s> the term sufficient evidence has a special scottish

<e> <s> copies of both these regulations were laid before the house on th and th june respectively <e> <s> the house may recall spending some time last year considering what was then the town and country planning minerals bill <e> <s> this was designed to encourage higher environmental standards at active and disused mineral working sites <e> <s> that bill formed the first part of the governments implementation of the recommendations of the report of the stevens committee on the control of mineral working <e> <s> the committee had been appointed in to study problems faced by the minerals industry and by the planning authorities in trying to work within a planning system which had been designed mainly to control urban development <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already spoken to

stockholm <e> <s> we were represented there by scientists and officials at meetings of experts which took place in the previous week <e> <s> i do not want to say more about that because my honourable friend is shortly going to make a statement on this matter in response to a question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think my noble friends comments underline how difficult it is to find out what causes acid rain <e> <s> the effects are not yet clearly established <e> <s> as i understand it it is the forests themselves which are being rained upon by acid rain the results of which are not yet fully documented <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that perhaps the noble baroness goes a little far to say that this is the principal cause of what is going on in scandinavia <e> <s> our activities comprise a very small percentage of what is going on there <e> <s> perhaps i can say that although the convention has not yet come into force action has proceeded on an interim basis <e> <s> a europe-wide monitoring programme is under way to determine the extent of acid rainfall in europe and a group of experts from signatory countries including the united kingdom is reviewing the scientific evidence on the effects of air pollution including acid rain on the environment and the cost damage and control <e> <s> the convention itself is likely to come into force later this year once of the signatories have ratified <e>", "<cs> my lords in point of fact one of the sadnesses of the stockholm conference was that the eastern european countries were not represented <e> <s> of course we

noble friends calm reaction <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that this might be a convenient moment for the house again to resolve itself into a committee on the transport bill <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord lucas of chilworth for explaining his amendment with such clarity <e> <s> his proposal is that instead of three penalty points being given for a speeding offence whether it is dealt with by fixed penalty or in court two points should be given if it is dealt with by fixed penalty and two or three points if it is a court case <e> <s> as such the proposal is a much less radical departure from our own proposals than was the noble lords amendment to clause <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether my noble friend has really studied the penalty points system which your lordships

argument put forward by the noble lord <e> <s> i would be appreciative if we could look at this again to see whether we can move towards him in some way before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i would imagine as constables <e>", "<cs> i very much appreciate my noble friends point and of course i will make sure that the secretary of state has it well in mind <e>", "<cs> i think we are getting unduly complicated in this <e> <s> my understanding of the grouping is that it was suggested by the department with a telephone number to ring if anybody wanted anything <e> <s> it is a simple one <e>

<e>", "<cs> i will be perfectly happy when i speak to to speak to the others <e>", "<cs> we were not dragooned at all <e> <s> we entirely accepted this point <e> <s> the person i am slightly worried about is whether my noble friend lord lucas is happy with that set-up <e>", "<cs> it may help if i were to clarify some of our thinking on this matter particularly as my noble friend lord lucas asked a number of questions <e> <s> the idea as that the police areempowered to remove a vehicle before immobilising it <e> <s> this brings the more serious and anti-social parking offence within the scope of the clause and i note in particular that the metropolitan police attached great importance to this subsection <e> <s> they will find it particularly helpful at the times when the means for removing an obstructing or dangerously parked vehicle to the pound are not immediately available <e> <s> i should perhaps mention that we have power at the moment to move vehicles to the pound and therefore we can move vehicles <e>", "<cs> i am advised that if applies only to the national schemes <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene at this stage and say that no motorist displaying an orange badge issued under the national scheme would have his car immobilised whether or not it was parked in a position covered by the exemptions in the national scheme <e> <s> the national badge is available to eligible disabled people living in london <e> <s> as the noble baroness probably realises she somewhat took me by surprise on the issue that she raised and so i should like to look into it <e>", "<cs> there is only one point about which i should like to remind the noble lord lord harris of greenwich <e> <s> of course the tow-away <e>", "<cs> indeed i probably sat down rather too quickly i was going to say that i would take it back and have a look at it <e> <s> perhaps i could discuss it with my noble friend lord lucas and see whether we can meet somewhere along the line on it <e>", "<cs> i am not speaking to answer that particular question from my noble friend <e> <s> it is a little wide of the mark <e> <s> he queried my figure of parking meters in central london <e> <s> i gather that there are in westminster and in central london <e>", "<cs> it might be helpful if i paint my picture now <e> <s> i ought to say to the committee at this stage that the thoughts i am getting are interesting

committee on the way they are thinking <e> <s> i should like to say at the moment how we are thinking so that i can get the committees reactions <e>", "<cs> i think that the committees imagination is enormous <e> <s> may i show the committee how i think the system is going to be working at the moment <e> <s> there will probably be a small vehicle which will have a series of wheel clamps in it with a team of people <e> <s> they will go round and clamp something and put the ticket on the vehicle which will show which police station has to be contacted <e> <s> the car driver will then go to that police station and the keys will be there <e> <s> another team will go out and release the wheel clamp <e> <s> that will probably allay the fears of the noble baroness <e> <s> i have not checked this information for the noble lord lord underhill but my understanding is that the actual money will be paid at the police station by the car driver when he takes the ticket in there <e>", "<cs> i accept that there may be ingenious devices which are less safe <e> <s> however i should like to make one point <e> <s> i understand that the police have demonstrated a device of the type they are considering to the joint committee on the mobility of blind and partially sighted people who were concerned about the possibility that it might project beyond the car over the pavement <e> <s> i am sure that the committee will welcome the fact that these discussions have taken place and i believe they indicate the responsible approach which can be expected from the police in matters of public safety <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for his explanation because i must confess that i was not quite sure of the reason why this amendment had been tabled <e> <s> the clause as introduced is so drafted that the power of the police to use immobilisation devices shall not have effect in any area unless an order has been made under subsection <e> <s> my right honourable friend has indicated that for the first designated areas he has in mind an experiment in limited areas of the metropolitan police district and for a limited period <e> <s> whether any further designations follow would depend very much on the outcome of that experiment <e> <s> no decision has yet been taken on the areas to be used for the experiment and this is a matter which will be discussed between the department of transport the home office the police the glc and the boroughs concerned <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness <e> <s> i was about to suggest the same thing <e> <s> now i know exactly what the two noble lords want in this amendment i shall see whether we can progress towards something in that direction <e>", "<cs> i am grateful for the suggestions from both noble lords and from the noble baroness <e> <s> may i take up one or two points from the noble lord lord underhill and from the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> again i am grateful to both noble lords for explaining exactly what they had in mind <e> <s> in considering the amendment i think it would be helpful first to say that negligent action by the police which leads to damage either to an immobilised vehicle or to a third party would be a proper subject for civil action for damages against the police <e> <s> indeed i understand that when on occasion a vehicle has been damaged in the course of the exercise of vehicle removal powers the police have been prepared to settle reasonable claims outside the courts <e>", "<cs> perhaps it would be a good moment for me to say my piece <e> <s> i hope the committee will <e>", "<cs> it is obvious from the appearance of the noble lord lord underhill and my noble friend lord gisborough that cycling keeps one trim <e> <s> i am very grateful to the noble lord lord tanlaw for bringing forward the amendment and for drawing attention to the recently-opened cycle route near the albert gate <e> <s> the government fully recognise the dangers faced by vulnerable vehicles such as bicycles or mopeds and invalid carriages in mixed traffic <e> <s> there is a case for segregation when it can be achieved and highway authorities have powers to introduce segregated facilities for cyclists <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent these being shared by the other categories of vehicle mentioned in the amendment though that would usually be a matter for local decision <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend said in his speech this is an extremely complicated amendment <e> <s> i would say right away that there is meant to be nothing sneaky about it and i am surprised that it has generated <e>", "<cs> i take note of what the noble lord lord mishcon says <e> <s> i would equally like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for his kind remarks on the notes on clauses where the explanation of subsections and is not much clearer <e>", "<cs> i think that would be entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> it is always saddening to hear of tragic accidents and of course i am aware of the case to which the noble lord lord underhill has referred <e> <s> however i should like to confine my remarks to the amendment before the committee <e> <s> disturbing though any fatal road accident is the court has a duty to consider the individual circumstances of each case to reach a conclusion on that basis and to impose the penalties that it sees fit within the range available to it <e>", "<cs> the object of the limit on the duration of provisional motor-cycle licences together with the introduction of the two-part test is to ensure that learner riders take training and pass their tests <e> <s> i am sure no one will quarrel with this objective <e> <s> we recognise a certain amount of criticism of the means that we have taken to achieve it <e> <s> nevertheless a proposal was passed and we are now in the process of laying the necessary regulations to implement it <e> <s> i understand some will come out i think next week <e> <s> these regulations are necessary because as the committee will recall we did not specify in the act either an on or off period <e> <s> we said that we expected the on period to be two years and the off period to be one year <e> <s> we also said that we should prefer not to specify the periods in the act itself because circumstances could change <e> <s> the on period has to be short enough to encourage a rider to start thinking about the need to take training and pass his test at the outset of his riding career when he needs <e>", "<cs> indeed i shall undertake to do that <e>", "<cs> for some time the government have been aware of possible shortcomings in this primary legislation <e> <s> while section gives the secretary of state powers to prescribe helmets which will offer protection to motor-cyclists in the event of accident it does not extend this power to control accessories which may be fitted to helmets <e> <s> the government have been concerned that visors which are either excessively tinted or scratched impair vision particularly at night or during inclement weather <e> <s> they have been a contributory factor in accidents <e>", "<cs> my lords the most recent estimate made by the railways board of the total cost of modernising and electrifying the london to bedford railway line is million at mid- prices <e> <s> almost per cent <e> <s> of this figure is for work on re-signalling as well as track and route improvements which will also benefit diesel hauled inter-city and freight traffic <e>", "<cs> no my lords i have no further information on the dispute about which we had a statement very recently <e> <s> in a letter to the unions on th june the board suggested progress on several productivity issues including this one and proposed a three-month experiment with driver-only operations between london and st albans and dual manning open stations between st albans and bedford <e> <s> i understand that the nur have not accepted this suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords the nur have put up counter proposals <e> <s> i am not quite sure what are the three proposals to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> however there were six productivity proposals last year and discussions throughout the year have been continuing on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords that is what i thought the noble lord was referring to <e> <s> discussions started last year and the noble lord lord mccarthy has also commented on this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords her majestys government are satisfied that foreign governments generally have a responsible and co-operative attitude with regard to proposals for the buildings they occupy and i therefore see no need to carry out such a review <e>", "<cs> my lords embassies and consulates are subject to the planning laws of this country and although their diplomatic status can lead to the occasional problem i do not accept that the position is anywhere as facetious as my noble friends last suggestion implied <e> <s> the present position at the <e>",

end of the year <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed there is the other review in progress and i am sure they will include this kind of issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure whether they can give a breakdown of figures but it may be of interest to the house to know that the total out-turn budget for the year in question was million so that the proportion paid by the caa was not all that large <e> <s> some two years ago the treasury looked into this issue and as i understand it both parties were happy with the result <e>", "<cs> my lords when there was a little difficulty two years ago the department of transport and the civil aviation authority were expressing disquiet about charges <e> <s> the treasury examined the method of calculating this element of the charge and they concluded that it was reasonable and indeed that it was difficult to visualise a fairer approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be read a second time <e> <s> before i deal with the content of the bill may i draw attention to a correction which has had to be made in the explanatory and financial memorandum <e> <s> when the bill was considered in another place it was amended to enable reclamation schemes carried out by the english industrial estates corporation to be eligible for derelict land grant at the same rates as already enjoyed by local authorities <e> <s> the resulting change in the memorandum required by this amendment was not <e> <s> i regret to say carried through properly <e> <s> as your lordships have no doubt noticed a corrigendum slip has now been provided the text of the bill itself is perfectly in order <e> <s> the bill i bring before you today is modest in size and chiefly a consolidation measure but it does contain important new provisions which we hope will be of great advantage to the new drive on derelict land reclamation in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness lady birk and to my noble friends for the welcome and helpful approach to this particular bill <e> <s> the noble baroness mentioned as an example wales and perhaps i might say at the beginning of my remarks that wales has led the rest of the united kingdom in the field of land reclamation <e> <s> the derelict land unit in the welsh office was set up in following the tragedy of the aberfan disaster and in its years of existence it reclaimed some acres of land and made a significant start on the major areas of industrial and mining dereliction <e>", "<cs> my lords if it falls within the criteria or very nearly so of economic uplift yes it would be <e> <s> arrangements have been made for most of the areas which are due to lose assisted status in to be designated as dclas by the secretary of state for industry under

"<cs> my lords before i turn to the specific points i should like to explain both the broad policy context of this special development order and the particular series of events which have led to the

blocks which our generation is passing on as part of its contribution to the historical heritage displayed along the capitals river <e> <s> it is our intention to make amends during the s and s <e>",

<e> <s> i think this was lord hamptons point <e> <s> they must go back to lambeth council for a new permission for all or part of the site incorporating modifications <e>", "<cs> my lords the recommendation of the recent rayner report was that admission charges should be introduced at the museum of childhood in bethnal green with a view to covering the museums recurrent costs and if that were to prove impossible that consideration should be given to closing down the museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am indeed aware of all the three points that the noble lord makes and i am grateful to him for stressing them today <e>", "<cs> my lords i undertake to make sure that my right honourable friend does indeed take local considerations into account <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of my noble friends point <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recognise the all-party support against the proposal in this house as i did during the debate on the theatre museum <e> <s> i shall of course bring all these remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> my own fascination has been to study what is actually in the museum and i entirely agree with him <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i might refer the noble lord lord strabolgi to the governments position on charges <e> <s> the government do not intend to impose charges for general admission to the main collections nor to change the well-established practice of charging for entry to some outstations <e> <s> but it would be open to new trustees to make proposals on these

the suggestion he put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i understand my noble friends concern that the private sector which in this case includes the nationalised industries should receive the maximum aid possible to help them to go in for the reclamation of derelict land which they themselves own without having to involve local authorities <e> <s> the government want to encourage this new opportunity not only for its own sake but also for the sake of the local authority programme <e> <s> in so far as the non-local authority sector can take on land reclamation directly to that extent the task will not fall upon local authorities <e> <s> they will thus be able to devote grant-aided expenditure on other schemes <e> <s> we have set out specifically to encourage the private sector by introducing these grants <e>", "<cs> i am pleased to confirm what i have already said that in the light of experience over the next months the government are prepared to look at the matter again <e> <s> i am sad that my noble friend should be so pessimistic about our chances <e> <s> i feel i shall be here

noble lord stresses the difficulty of governing by opinion polls <e>", "<cs> my lords we do indeed share the abhorrence of these weapons <e> <s> we do not believe that it would do any good if we were to disarm unilaterally <e> <s> russia would certainly not follow suit <e> <s> i believe that the majority of people agree that we must keep our defences strong otherwise we shall put ourselves as well as our nato partners at serious risk <e> <s> the only way to achieve disarmament is through a realistic process and negotiated arms control arrangements as were explained earlier by my noble friend lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing out one of the points that i had in my brief <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe it is the noble lord lord richardson who is next to speak <e>", "<cs> my lords average strengths of trained united kingdom service personnel of the regular forces over the last three years have been <e> <s> pay has moved in accordance with the recommendations of the armed forces pay review body <e> <s> since coming into office the government have accepted these recommendations in full thus honouring their commitment to maintain comparability as the basis for increases in armed forces pay and ensuring that servicemen and women receive a fair payment for the work they do <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friends comment <e>", "<cs> my lords almost without all proportion <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an area where there have been a number of reviews and inquiries <e> <s> for instance in the working party on lead in petrol reported on the costs and feasibility of making reductions in lead emissions from cars in the department of health and social security working party chaired by professor lawther completed a review of the sources and effects on health of lead in the environment and currently the food additives and contaminants committee which will report shortly have in hand a review of metals including lead in canned foods her majestys alkali and clean air inspectorate are reviewing their requirements for the best practicable means of controlling emissions from leadworks and the royal commission on environmental pollution are looking at aspects of lead in the environment as part of their current study <e>", "<cs> my lords last year we announced the reduction in the maximum permitted level of lead in uk petrol from to grammes per litre <e> <s> this is coming into force by the end of <e> <s> this <e>", "<cs> my lords although the department of the environment has a ministerial responsibility for lead the department of transport has control over the level of lead in petrol motor vehicle technical standards and the technical aspects of reducing lead in petrol <e> <s> all this is going ahead on a broad basis <e>", "<cs> my lords our first priority is for the water undertakings to press on with their programmes by identifying sources of water which can dissolve lead from plumbing and where practicable to treat it chemically so that plumbing solvency is much reduced <e> <s> on this last day of our present sitting i am sure that all noble lords will go home refreshed by our own water supply <e>", "<cs> my lords i can recall the noble lords question on th march when he asked me something similar <e> <s> my reply then was that i am sure the noble lord is quite able to translate it himself <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept the noble lords premise <e> <s> expenditure on the navy this financial year is planned to be around billion more in real terms than in the last year of the previous administration <e> <s> on present plans it will continue to be higher throughout the s <e> <s> we are pressing ahead with many new programmes including the construction of new surface ships and submarines and new weapons systems such as the spearfish and stingray torpedoes the sea eagle anti-ship missile and improvements to the sea wolf ship defence missile system <e>", "<cs> my lords regarding the first question of course we appreciate that there are a lot of lessons to be learned and indeed as the noble lord is aware a detailed analysis is being carried out <e> <s> so far as the fleet of the future is concerned along with the nato allies our aim is to have the best possible fleet within our available resources designed for the threat <e> <s> i hope that some of the things that i mentioned in my opening remarks will underline that point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his intervention <e> <s> our debate only six days ago very much went over these lines <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure of the figures that the noble lord started with <e> <s> so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no specific date on that matter but i doubt whether it will be ready during the recess <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord pursues a theme which i think we discussed only last friday across the chamber together <e> <s> all i can say is that the government do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords all necessary repairs and overhauls of royal fleet auxiliary vessels returning from the south atlantic are being carried out in the royal dockyards at rosyth devonport and gibraltar <e> <s> rosyth and devonport have already undertaken work on seven vessels and gibraltar two vessels <e>", "<cs> my lords adequate capacity currently exists for the necessary repairs and refits of royal fleet auxiliaries to be undertaken in the royal dockyards and it is the governments normal practice to take full account of the capacity available within the dockyards before turning to the commercial sector <e> <s> on the specific point of the repairs needed to be made to royal navy ships i am sure it would be better to wait for the white paper on the falklands before commenting on this <e> <s> i believe my noble friend is aware that some vessels of a trade nature have been repaired in other shipyards <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not like to agree with the noble lord about the future of the gibraltar shipyard <e> <s> as the house will be aware the gibraltar yard is to be closed in and i am sure the house would want the gibraltar dockyard to be fully employed until that date <e> <s> regarding the other point which the noble lord made to date british shipbuilders have been awarded contracts for six vessels at a cost of over million and the private sector yards have vessels at a cost of approximately million <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very interested in the noble lords question because of course it looks at the other side of the coin to that put forward by my noble friend lord orr-ewing who has pointed out that we are taking work away from the private sector in order to give it to the royal dockyards <e> <s> i am saying that the royal dockyards have the capacity to take the work even with rosyth and devonport and without i am afraid using chatham <e> <s> as far as portsmouth is concerned again i think we should wait for the falklands white paper to see whether there are any new decisions on this subject <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully sympathise with what my noble friend says but as i said to the noble lord lord bruce of donington there are two sides to the coin <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware we are cutting down on the naval dockyards which not everybody agrees with <e> <s> i am sure my noble friend is equally aware that there is adequate capacity currently existing to undertake the necessary repairs and refits of royal fleet auxiliaries to be undertaken by the royal dockyards <e>", "<cs> my lords again i fully appreciate what the noble lord says but may i say that if we wait for the falklands white paper which we expect towards the end of this month we can then more easily appreciate the lessons <e>", "<cs> my lords as both noble lords have said the house will be aware that this issue was debated in committee when i attempted to persuade noble lords that this amendment would cause difficulties <e> <s> in view of the support that my noble friend lord lucas got in committee i undertook to go back <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord lord mishcon and it is clear from what he says that our intentions are the same <e> <s> we both want simple forms in plain language that are easy to understand <e> <s> we differ only in how that might be best achieved <e> <s> in fact we differ to such a small degree that he can actually turn one of my arguments to his own advantage <e>", "<cs> my lords the new clause would widen even further than the bill already provides for the circumstances in which an alleged offender may be able to take advantage of the fixed penalty procedure <e> <s> to put the other side of the picture i would say that i think it is important for us to remember that a person who is alleged to have committed an offence is entitled to a court hearing to determine whether or not he is guilty of that offence <e> <s> that is his right <e> <s> he does not really have a right to a fixed penalty notice <e> <s> the fixed penalty system proposed in the bill is an extra a choice available to the alleged offender at the discretion of the police <e> <s> every further complexity of <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the comments of the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> in fact i tried to suggest to my noble and learned friend the lord advocate that he might reply to this amendment but he told me it was for england and wales to get on with it <e> <s> i get the impression from this amendment that the noble lord lord underhill is attempting to turn our chief officers of police into procurators fiscal <e> <s> with all due respect to both callings i am not sure that this can or should be done <e> <s> as the house will be aware schedule to which the amendment refers lists the offences for which a fixed penalty may be issued only in scotland and then only by a procurator fiscal <e> <s> as i understand it this list was arrived at by considering for which offences a fixed penalty might appropriately be made available but which nevertheless occurred under such varied circumstances that it was thought necessary for a procurator fiscals judgment to take the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual i was fascinated by lord underhills expos which at one stage i thought was sounding like the football results <e> <s> i hesitate to say what i am about to say because the noble lord lord underhill has the book in front of him and i do not have it in front of me <e> <s> by the time i sit down he may have checked my facts and proved me wrong <e> <s> however i am informed that in the less important offences the variations are much larger this is normally because of administrative convenience whereas for the more serious offence the more is the need for the police to see consistency of practice <e> <s> i am sure that the house will agree with that as a general principle <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will allow me to respond to the noble lord lord davies of leek and to speak for a second time <e> <s> i have already explained that indeed we want uniformity and not only that the association of police officers have been approached and have agreed the same thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i may intervene to say i am informed that it is a misprint <e> <s> so it will be all right in the end <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may speak now while the quotation of the noble lord lord underhill is fresh in your lordships minds <e> <s> like so many quotations he started with on the one hand but did not go on to say what i had said on the other hand <e> <s> what i said on the other hand was that <e>", "<cs> my lords this issue of course links with what i have just said on the general issue of the functions of traffic wardens order <e> <s> a power to exercise functions from a moving car does not amount to a power to stop other vehicles which may be the thought at the back of some members minds <e> <s> the house may not be aware that at present however the order itself already prohibits wardens from carrying out their functions from a moving vehicle <e> <s> what this amendment is doing therefore is preventing ministers in the future from seeking to alter this position by the affirmative resolution procedure <e> <s> the government have no intention of amending the order to achieve this at the moment and i would hope that the house would leave the issue as it is <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble lord may feel able to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friends for their comments <e> <s> in going some way <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord airedale in saying that i equally was rather surprised by the traffic warden being put in here as the other person <e> <s> i believe i said at committee stage that what was envisaged was vehicle removal officers aiding the police in this particular case <e> <s> they of course are the people who go around in the towing vehicles at the moment <e> <s> when i say envisaged it is not sure that they will be able to do it or available for it which is why the government want to leave this as broad as possible <e>", "<cs> i would happily agree <e>", "<cs> i said i should also look at that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls for that intervention and to the noble lord lord underhill for proposing the amendment because in some respects the thought behind it is attractive <e> <s> there are however a number of difficulties and i am not such an optimist to think that all the records which lord underhill thinks are available are in fact available <e> <s> the amendment relates to the record of the vehicle rather than to the record of the vehicle owner or driver and as the noble lord said it does not take account of the possibility of changes of ownership which would be on another computer <e> <s> it would mean that a driver who bought a used car in respect of which a previous owner had accumulated a number of fixed penalties could run an increased risk of immobilisation <e> <s> there is incidentally no way we know of finding out the fixed penalty record of a car when it is offered for sale <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand them the noble lords amendments would require the ministerial approval of immobilisation devices to be set out in regulations and would require the secretary of state to consult interested organisations as he thought fit before issuing approvals <e> <s> that goes a good deal further than the procedures for approval of other perhaps very much more complicated police equipment <e> <s> for instance the approval procedure as set out in government amendments nos <e> <s> p n and p would allow the same approval procedures as for evidential breath testing equipment and radar guns <e> <s> the approval order would be a formal document issued on the authority of the secretary of state <e> <s> it would not be subject to parliamentary proceedings <e> <s> the secretary of state would be free to consult interested organisations before giving approval as i am sure he will <e> <s> the government see no case to adopt at this stage a more formal procedure for the less elaborate immobilisation devices <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i wish to make a personal statement <e> <s> i am doing so at the earliest possible opportunity <e> <s> on tuesday th october in answer to a supplementary question from the noble lord lord hankey i inadvertently misled the house by saying that the white paper on the lessons learnt from the falklands conflict would be published towards the end of this month <e> <s> i should have said as indeed my right honourable friend the secretary of state has already announced that it is the governments intention to publish the white paper towards the end of this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to a certain extent i can set lord underhills mind at rest <e> <s> i said in my remarks that it does not apply when the police can establish that the meter has been fed since the initial payment <e> <s> therefore i do not think that we are doing anything basically different <e> <s> having i hope satisfied him on that point i then have to be honest and say that i cannot see that we shall catch any more than we have caught before which is a pity <e> <s> i imagine that the reason is the difficulty of proof <e> <s> at the same <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill anticipated the difficulty of amendment no <e> <s> v is not one of conflict with the governments intention <e> <s> it follows from what i said about current thinking on the initial experimental area that we are quite happy with the idea that the initial designation should extend only to part of westminster and part of kensington and chelsea <e> <s> however i am afraid that we cannot accept the insertion of references to these boroughs in the bill because it is likely to render the whole bill hybrid <e> <s> the amendment would affect the interests of two boroughs in a way distinct from the effect it would have on all other local authorities in a similar category <e> <s> this would threaten to make the bill hybrid although a formal decision would be for the house authorities <e> <s> a hybrid bill is subject to different procedures as the house know involving the service of notice under standing orders relating to other business <e> <s> it is for this reason that we have felt that we cannot accept this as part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i was about to say that i agree entirely i entirely take the point of the noble lord lord airedale <e> <s> however one can perhaps argue as my noble friend lord renton would do if he were in his place that extra words are not necessary it is slightly difficult for the draftsman and everybody else to accept <e> <s> may i say this if the noble lord will withdraw amendment no <e> <s> x i will see whether we cannot put these words back at the next stage in an amendment of our own <e> <s> there is not much time to withdraw them otherwise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for all the various questions which have been put on this amendment <e> <s> i was rather hoping that it would slip through with one or two congratulatory remarks but perhaps it has something to do with the hour <e> <s> i should like to start with one point which was not raised <e> <s> the proposed amendment applies solely to great britain that is <e> <s> england wales and scotland <e> <s> but i understand that similar provisions may follow in northern ireland in due course <e> <s> the police and local authorities can institute proceedings in england and wales and similarly by the procurator fiscal in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment which my noble friend is proposing would restore many of the problems we are trying to resolve through clause <e> <s> clause seeks to amend section and of the road traffic regulations act by removing the distinction currently made between unclassified roads and trunk or classified roads in attaching restricted road status which attracts a mph speed limit to a road where a system of street lighting is installed unless and until a direction otherwise is made <e> <s> despite its complex appearance it will actually simplify the law on speed limits <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree with the spirit of this new clause because clearly we do not want motorists to be blinded by bright lights at the moment the government do not feel that a general enactment of such is warranted <e> <s> two local authorities south yorkshire and west midlands county councils already have powers similar to those proposed by this clause in their rationalisation acts and i understand that lancashire is seeking them in their present bill <e> <s> however we have not discovered sufficiently widespread demand for such powers to warrant their inclusion in a general highways law <e>", "<cs> my lords i will try to satisfy the noble lord that the new clause is unnecessary <e> <s> in subsection i believe that the requirements he proposes are already met <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend has reminded us of the arguments put forward by the representatives of the motor cycling fraternity and the trade about the limitation of provisional motor-cycle riding entitlement to two years followed by an interval of one year during which the provisional licence cannot be used for this purpose <e> <s> my noble friend wishes to provide the secretary of state with power to exercise a discretion in favour of those learners who for some good reason are not able to pass a test within two years <e> <s> but i hope to persuade your lordships that he has the power already <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord was very modest and did not propose what he would like to see <e> <s> would he like to see a skip or something else <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the noble lord in his general thesis and he is quite right in saying that the term builders skip is already employed in section of the highways act which of course this clause would amend <e> <s> therefore we feel that in this case we should not depart from it <e> <s> equally i must add that we have no evidence to suggest that its application to skips other than those used literally by builders has ever been questioned <e> <s> but we shall of course bear what the noble lord has said in mind and if an opportunity arises to change it or the need becomes very apparent we shall of course do so <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord underhill for his comments <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that this amendment has come so late in our proceedings as i am sure it is one which the whole house would like to have taken part in <e> <s> i can sympathise with the noble lords reasons for moving his amendment but i am sorry to have tell him that i do not think we can accept his proposal <e> <s> it is always difficult when providing a new service for people in need to settle the line dividing those who are to be eligible and those who are not to <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of the matter is that clamps can be put on their cars but with diplomatic immunity they would not have to pay the fines <e> <s> whether or not the people who will be doing this work will be advised to put on the clamps in such cases i do not at the moment know <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather thought that i spoke to these amendments when we spoke to amendments nos <e> <s> v w and x <e> <s> did we not then speak to them <e>", "<cs> in point of fact i think that i did take in this question <e> <s> i replied to it when dealing with an earlier amendment <e> <s> i said that i did not think that the amendment was necessary in the sense that some form of consultation would be inevitable <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will very kindly read what i said at the earlier stages <e> <s> he will recall that i referred to the remark of my noble friend lord lucas about having a report which would be fully available <e> <s> i said that the amendment would require the secretary of state to consult such representative organisations as he sees fit before making an order under subsection of the new clause continuing in force an experimental order <e> <s> i added that i have no doubt that consultation will be a necessary part of the assessment of the results of an experiment and that the views of all those affected by the experiment will be relevant <e> <s> indeed i would expect views to be volunteered from all sides without any need for a formal invitation <e> <s> i added that therefore i did not believe that a formal requirement to consult would be necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have put forward a comprehensive and improved package of measures to reduce the environmental damage caused by lorries and to make our road freight industry as well as the firms who depend on it more efficient <e> <s> these proposals cover road construction grants to encourage the transfer of freight from road to rail or waterway lorry re-routeing and control lorry action areas to alleviate the effects of heavy traffic new noise and safety requirements changes in operator licensing limits on lorry dimensions and a new taxation system <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport hopes shortly to announce detailed proposals on lorry weights and axle arrangements and to bring forward the necessary regulations <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are indeed aware of the considerations my noble friend has put to the house this afternoon <e> <s> the government are still determined to press on with the package <e> <s> we believe that at the moment there is more general acceptance by the public of this package of which increased weights are a logical part <e> <s> my noble friend asked me to comment on the expression very shortly <e> <s> i find it a little dangerous in this house to comment on dates but i still think it will take place very shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his comments <e> <s> of course he is totally correct the research is going on all the time <e> <s> as far as bridge damage is concerned our objectives are to take remedial action to repair damage caused by existing traffic <e> <s> as he says we are continuing to experiment with road weights <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm what the noble viscount has said but it is an interesting comment and i will indeed check up on it <e> <s> we have <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord underhill has put both sides of the coin to such an extent that there is little that i have to say <e> <s> i should say first of all that this amendment adds nothing to the powers contained in clause <e> <s> subsection would already allow the secretary of state to make an order to provide for most of the offences in schedule to become fixed penalty offences in england and wales <e> <s> i say most because he could not of course make offences under the roads scotland act apply in england and wales <e> <s> therefore i have to say that the amendment is defective in this second issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i should have said at the report stage what i said earlier on at this stage <e> <s> this is a basic point <e> <s> this amendment adds nothing to the powers contained in clause <e> <s> this would already allow the secretary of state to make an order to provide for most of the offences in schedule to become fixed penalty offences in england and wales <e> <s> so this amendment adds nothing to clause and that is really the long and the short of it <e> <s> there is already the power of the secretary of state to do what the noble lord wants <e> <s> if the noble lord has not these specific offences down in his amendment then all we do at the moment is get rid of the order-making power <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a good many discussions on this issue since the bill began its stages in this house <e> <s> i found the noble lord lord underhill very persuasive and i have long sought in my own way to persuade the noble lord that our intentions in essence matched his own <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that his latest proposal will cause us no difficulty and the government are content to accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill said this is a small tidying-up point to clause <e> <s> the amendments would require the ministerial approval of immobilisation devices to be expressed in regulations subject to parliamentary approval as the noble lord said <e> <s> the procedure for approval as the bill stands without these amendments is that before any type of device can be used it must be assessed and approved by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> that approval will be given in an order printed by her majestys stationery office and made available to the public <e> <s> the procedure is the same as the one used for breath testing equipment for many years <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that the police are looking at a number of different devices some manufactured in the united kingdom and others manufactured abroad <e> <s> no final decisions have been taken but i am sure that the police will bear in mind that on several occasions this house has looked towards the british equivalent <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we went through these issues in an earlier debate <e> <s> as this is now third reading i think that we should stay on the narrow issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully appreciate the concern expressed by my noble friend that clause will mean that any trunk or classified road other than a motorway will become restricted automatically when street lighting is installed <e> <s> however this will not in practice be the position in every case and indeed the number of roads where this might occur is likely to be quite small <e> <s> first so far as trunk roads are concerned these are the responsibility of the secretary of state and i can repeat the assurance that i have already given to your lordships that he will comply with his own criteria for setting speed limits to ensure that appropriate limits are in operation when lighting is <e>", "<cs> my lords as i indicated to the noble lord the government would in any case have expected to consult on the outcome of the experimental use of wheel clamps before presenting to parliament any draft order continuing the experiment in force <e> <s> we are happy to accept the amendment which will make such consultation a statutory requirement <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will be most grateful to my noble friend lord cranbrook for introducing this subject today in such a lucid form thereby offering to the house an opportunity to debate the report by the european communities select committee on action by the european community to control noise in the environment <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a wide ranging debate on a document that will exercise a strong influence over the way in which the provisions of the wildlife and countryside act for the protection of habitats are implemented <e> <s> i am grateful for the various kind remarks by noble lords on my introduction <e> <s> i believe i am right in concluding that so far as concerns the formal question of the approval of the draft code of guidance while some noble lords might have preferred to see something shorter or easier to understand and i have already touched on the reasons for its complexity i gather there is general agreement that the document should be approved <e> <s> i noticed that the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley did suggest that we have been lumberedwith it which i thought was perhaps less than generous <e> <s> i also noted that lord middletons organisationation has already produced a simpler guide which may be of use to us all later <e>", "<cs> yes my lords my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment and for trade have issued their decision today and have granted the british airports authority outline planning permission for a second passenger terminal at gatwick airport <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords the noble baroness is totally correct the fact that it happened today and not tomorrow is entirely fortuitous <e>", "<cs> my lords in this happy atmosphere i am afraid to have to tell my noble friend that i do not have those figures at my fingertips <e>", "<cs> my lords this inquiry is an entirely separate matter <e>", "<cs> my lords these factors have been taken into account and no doubt in the other planning inquiry they will be taken into account again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to introduce a bill to establish boards of trustees of the victoria and albert museum the science museum the armouries and the royal botanic gardens to transfer property to <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not in a position to say <e> <s> degrees of war disability can only be assessed by the department of health and social security after a serviceman has been medically discharged from the armed forces <e> <s> no service personnel have yet been medically discharged from the armed forces because of injuries sustained in the falkland islands conflict and decisions on such discharges can only be made in the light of clinical developments in individual cases over a period of time <e> <s> i believe it could be wrong to try and predict how many might eventually have to be discharged <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that all the considerations he has suggested will indeed be taken into account <e> <s> if a man has to be medically discharged from the armed forces he is given considerable advice and help in smoothing the transition to civilian life and this would include expert advice on the various opportunities for training for civilian employment through the service resettlement centres or mod sponsored courses at polytechnics and colleges of further education <e>", "<cs> my lords the ministry of defence guarantees a minimum level of pension for all servicemen invalided from the armed forces with a serious disablement that is per cent <e> <s> or more which is directly attributable to their service <e> <s> a basic lump sum is also paid <e> <s> these awards are related to rank and degree of disability but are paid irrespective of age or length of service <e> <s> they are in addition supplemented through the payment of war disablement pensions by the dhss <e> <s> in all cases pensions and lump sums are paid tax free <e>", "<cs> my lords yes indeed wherever it is possible such a thing will happen and if our advice is that they should go outside we shall again advise accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords we are at the moment of course talking about the people who have been badly wounded <e> <s> it will as i said in my original answer take a little while before the various states of recovery will be known <e> <s> therefore it would not be possible to produce a statement at any one time but i can assure the noble lord as i assured my noble friend lord campbell of croy that every single consideration is being given towards looking after these people <e> <s> perhaps what the noble lord lord bruce has in mind is the south atlantic fund on which i think it might be advisable in the not too distant future to let parliament know what is happening <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i shall certainly bear my noble friends point in mind and look into it for him <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for transport has commissioned messrs brian colquhoun and partners consulting engineers to consider british rails short woodside to selsdon route in south london which is to close next year <e> <s> their terms of reference are to investigate and cost the options for

secretary of state for transport has actually commissioned this of course has not got anything to do with the other names the noble viscount mentioned <e> <s> we shall of course bear in mind what the noble viscount has said <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for raising the second point in particular <e> <s> i would indeed endorse exactly what he said this is purely a study for using those routes which are already to be closed and there is no question of the other suggestion the noble lord made <e> <s> i believe the british railways board does know what is going on but i do not have the actual facts in front of me <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to confirm what i said in reply to the noble lord lord underhill// this in no way changes any policies about closing lines

indeed my lords i was coming on to answer some of the noble earls points but of course the very subject of homelessness covers a great number of different people <e>", "<cs> my lords the protection zone of nautical miles around the falkland islands remains in force <e> <s> the argentine government were informed on st july that any argentine warship or military aircraft entering this zone may be deemed to be hostile <e> <s> the same applies to any argentine forces approaching other british dependencies in the south atlantic <e>", "<cs> my lords it is indeed the intention of her majestys government to keep the protection zone of nautical miles until there is a change of attitude on the part of the argentine <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i sympathise as does the whole house with the noble lord lord shinwell and i will draw his remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> the noble lord will of course be aware that our representative at the united nations has indeed been speaking up and saying that what the argentines proposed was unacceptable <e>", "<cs> my lords as i am sure the noble lord is aware we have no relationships with the argentine government at the moment and there is no prospect of an early restoration of diplomatic relations <e>", "<cs> yes my lords containing costs getting value for money modernising working practices and adjusting to what the customer really needs are all high priorities <e> <s> the governments transport bill currently in another place aims to encourage this <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport support grant we believe remains at a reasonable level <e> <s> there are we believe a number of things that london transport could do to improve its efficiency <e> <s> there is i believe an acknowledged scope for curbing restrictive practices tailoring services to demand the rationalisation of the bus network and more one-man operations and the introduction of automatic fares collection <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge what the noble lord has said and i would agree that the reports found much to commend and appeciated the level of efficiency and service which the operators have managed to achieve <e> <s> i believe however that there is scope under those reports for increased efficiency and the provision of a better service <e> <s> i look forward when the transport bill comes to your lordships house to debating this with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a question we have heard before in this house and as before i would say that this is under consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords while i appreciate the theme behind the noble lords question i cannot lend any advice to his adjectives such as huge because the fares fair policy happened for such a very short period of time and the lessons learned must therefore be as it were under some cloud <e> <s> however the lessons learned are there and we are waiting to find out whether the ratepayers agree with them <e>", "<cs> my lords on saturday i watched three no <e> <s> s in close convoy passing me <e> <s> i do not feel in point of fact that this is what ought to exercise this noble house but it should really be a subject for london transport to look at <e>", "<cs> my lords no doubt the noble and learned lord is good at housey-housey and will know whether is better than <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not got the figures handy to answer my noble friends question but i will happily write to him with the information <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge my noble friends great interest in this subject and i know that when we in this house have debated the state of london traffic my noble friend has contributed excellently <e>", "<cs> my lords it is our intention to implement these provisions as the public expenditure situation permits <e> <s> in the meantime the government continue to give financial and moral support to the keep britain tidy group who campaign against litter on many fronts in collaboration with local authorities voluntary groups industry and commerce <e>", "<cs> my lords the costs of drawing up plans are unlikely to be great but implementing them would depend upon the cumulative decisions of local authorities across the country <e> <s> i gather that the last estimate some years ago was for the plans and probably something like million for the implementation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i have no information on that particular point <e>", "<cs> my lords no decision on this matter is required in the immediate future <e> <s> the reading room in the british museum building will continue to be used for its present purpose until at least the end of this century <e>", "<cs> my lords it is likely to be several years before a financial decision need be made for the further stages which would eventually allow the reading room to be used for other purposes <e> <s> decisions on its future use will be made in time to come by the british museum trustees who have assured my right honourable friend the minister for the arts that they will have due regard to the traditions and associations of the reading room <e> <s> i will of course draw my noble friends further remarks to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for emphasising the fact that the reading room and the books must be in the same place <e> <s> as regards his second point i shall ensure that it is drawn to the attention of the trustees of the british museum <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for underlining what i was saying <e>", "<cs> my lords the great need is to rehouse the british library which at the moment is spread over buildings <e> <s> i was under the impression that the need for a new building to house in appropriate conditions the priceless collections of the british library was not in doubt and indeed had been accepted <e> <s> however the future of the round reading room must be considered in the light of that fact <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord who indeed has great experience in these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and am grateful to him for underlining my point <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my original reply a decision on the future of the reading room will not be made for a considerable time <e> <s> when the final phases of the british library are completed which will probably be at the end of this century then will be the time to see whether or not the reading rooms are adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords in the name of my noble friend lord bellwin i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i should like to begin by explaining briefly the background to this bill <e> <s> the first international convention dealing with rail transport dates from when the organisation which continues to administer the current conventions known from their administrative headquarters as the berne union conventions was set up <e> <s> the convention covered the international carriage of goods by rail within central europe and was followed in by a further convention covering the carriage of passengers and their luggage <e> <s> the united kingdom acceded to the conventions in and is currently one of member states now covering western and eastern europe except for the ussr north africa and the middle east <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for his helpful and constructive approach to the bill <e> <s> i shall try to answer all his questions in the hope that no further problems will arise in committee <e> <s> as i said earlier we have here a simple bill which will enable the united kingdom by ratifying the cotif convention to continue as a party to adhere to a set of extremely useful and practical rules governing international rail travel <e> <s> as a result proper safeguards will be provided for passengers and traders <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e> <s> i am grateful to those noble lords who have had to listen to me speaking on the transport bill <e> <s> i am sure that that is not what they had in mind when they decided to attend your lordships house this afternoon <e> <s> i am happy to have the privilege of introducing the national heritage bill to this house <e> <s> noble lords have an active interest in the preservation of our past and a particular interest in our architectural and archaeological inheritance <e> <s> most of us too share a wider interest in the display and ordering of our great national collections <e> <s> i look forward with great interest to hearing the contributions to the debate this afternoon in particular the maiden speech of my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd <e>", "<cs> my lords many noble lords have mentioned that this is in fact two bills in one <e> <s> may i say as the person who has to wind up that i feel that it is two bills in one if not four in one <e> <s> i should like to start by joining other noble lords in paying a tribute to my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd for his excellent maiden speech and for telling us of his success story <e> <s> i hope that the fact that he has made his splendid speech today will augur equally well for this bill and that all parts of it will have an equal success story <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i will make sure that the noble baronesss suggestion or indeed warning is borne in mind <e> <s> there was some discussion about the term of office of trustees <e> <s> the length of term of office varies among existing national trustee museums and galleries and the period of not more than five years in this bill broadly reflects the average in other institutions and allows greater flexibility than a longer fixed term <e> <s> there is of course provision for reappointment <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to these regulations si <e> <s> no <e> <s> perhaps i may thank the noble lord lord underhill for giving the house the opportunity to discuss them and also for his presentation which was very modest and very equal-handed at the beginning <e> <s> at the same time something which i confess i forgot to do last week may i congratulate the noble lord on his appointment as deputy leader and say how nice it is to have him in that capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend the minister of state for agriculture and my honourable friend the parliamentary under-secretary of state for the environment the member for sutton and cheam having received and considered advice from all interested parties concluded that the owner should be allowed to fell part of the wood <e> <s> as to the remainder the provisions of the wildlife and countryside act relating to sites of special scientific interest are now in force and if application is received to fell further areas the consulation arrangements authorised in the code of guidance for sssis will apply <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not heard that the owner had contradicted what had been said <e> <s> i am advised by the forestry commission that the majority of the remaining woodlands carries licensable size timber and therefore a licence would be necessary before it could be clear felled <e> <s> with regard to a section order it is for the nature conservancy council to decide whether to seek such an order and if it did the secretary of state would then give it proper consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that my noble friend speaks much sense but i do not especially wish to be drawn on that particular argument <e> <s> adequate procedures already exist to ensure that the forestry commission consults as appropriate the agriculture departments local planning authorities and other relevant statutory bodies before reaching a decision on an application for grant or for a felling licence <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not records as full as those of my noble friend but according to our records the area was clear felled in <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the first part of the noble lords supplementary question yes i think that he is right <e> <s> so far as the second part of the question is concerned my understanding is that it would probably require a licence <e>", "<cs> my lords it is only a last resort in cases of dispute <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we do and i think that i went into the point in some detail when answering my noble friend lord gisborough <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms of reference for the rayner review provide for these matters to be taken into account and for the nature conservancy councils staffing and organisation to be examined accordingly <e>", "<cs> my lords in the opinion of the government the words were otiose <e> <s> we believe that when one speaks of a councils statutory duties it is implicit that one is speaking of the full range of those duties <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that those points will be taken into account in the review bodys scrutiny of the organisation and staffing of the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble baronesss intervention <e> <s> i shall of course bring the point to the attention of my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords in the opinion of the government it will be impossible for the scrutineering officer to conduct his review which is a review of staffing organisations and systems without having regard to the extent to which the manpower resources of the council match their current obligations <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the second part of my noble friends supplementary question i hope there are not very many problems <e> <s> with regard to the first part perhaps i may read what the director-general of the nature conservancy council wrote in <e>", "<cs> my lords that is slightly wide of the question so i cannot confirm it <e>", "<cs> my lords the other night i went to the national theatre and listened to a subsidised production of guys and dolls <e> <s> in it there was a very nice salvation army brass band <e> <s> i do not know if others of your lordships are as cold as i am but i think it would warm us all up if we could have a rendition at <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we normally allow the minister to reply <e>", "<cs> my lords the inspectors report which took eight months contained many recommendations for consideration by the government <e> <s> in september new air traffic forecasts were made available which my right honourable friends considered to be material <e> <s> in a letter to all the parties in november they expressed a preliminary view that it would be right to grant outline permission for the second terminal <e> <s> however they invited the interested parties to make written representations on the new forecasts before a final decision was taken <e> <s> this procedure lasted until august <e> <s> my right honourable friends announced this final decision on th november last <e> <s> it will now be necessary for detailed plans to be approved by the local planning authority and other conditions of the permission to be met <e> <s> the directly assessable cost to the exchequer of the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords that may well have been a learned judges opinion but on the other hand there is another opinion which says that two and a quarter years is not considered to be unduly long for this process bearing in mind the requirement for further representations which arose <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure he would have great expertise on airport inquiries <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot confirm the answer to the noble baroness first question because i do not have the information at my fingertips <e> <s> as regards work on the second terminal provided the necessary planning and investment approvals are forthcoming the british airports authority hope to start preparatory work on the site during the spring of <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to do so <e> <s> i was not aware that the noble baroness needed that confirmation <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the inquiry at stansted is going ahead on the assumption that the second terminal will be built at gatwick <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords at the end of october we wrote to all local authorities in england offering to make additional expenditure allocations where these would enable additional work to be undertaken this financial year <e> <s> by inviting applications we hoped to secure better use of resources following a forecast of a substantial underspend on capital investment by english local authorities in the current year <e> <s> i am pleased to say that many authorities have seized the opportunity to identify and press ahead with projects and as a result we expect a considerable amount of extra capital investment to be achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends response <e> <s> that is the sort of drive we are trying to put in <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the policies now coming to fruition are doing exactly what the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i did indeed refer only to england in spite of the fact that my noble friend lady elliot of harwood asked the question <e> <s> the position in scotland is rather different <e> <s> the capital control system in scotland is not statutory and there is less of a problem about underspending <e> <s> a few additional allocations are however being made and extra spending upon improvement grants is being authorised <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing me back to the time of my birth <e> <s> the very policies which we are putting forward at the moment are offering greater freedom to local authorities <e> <s> i am glad to be able to say that of the recent extra allocation million has been given to such projects <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for underlining what the noble lord lord molloy said about the s and for giving me that interesting lesson <e> <s> i agree that the reduction of interest rates is of vital importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is to tackle the real problems relating to revenue expenditure <e> <s> it would just be pretending to say that some of the items do not count <e> <s> there is an overriding need to achieve real cuts in total levels of local authority revenue expenditure <e> <s> there is still scope for restraining wasteful recurrent expenditure thus leaving room for revenue consequences on capital projects <e>", "<cs> my lords we are aware of the problems to which the noble baroness has referred and we are working towards their end <e> <s> we hope as i said in an earlier reply that the greater freedom we have given to local authorities to use all resources including capital receipts will encourage local authorities to go ahead and use this added freedom <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that additional question <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this really is a u-turn <e> <s> it is as a result of the act which came into effect in the consequences of which we are now seeing <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an excellent question <e> <s> i shall try to find some examples for the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to write tomorrow to the noble lord with some examples <e>", "<cs> my lords our estimate is that by st may this year some jobs had been provided in the enterprise zones designated across the united kingdom by firms new to the zones <e>", "<cs> my lords the consultants report which was produced was called a year report and basically it looked at the areas of the zones prior to designation <e> <s> this report was published earlier this year and any lessons learnt from it will be taken into account <e> <s> i understand that the consultants will be submitting their year report to the department very soon and again any lessons learnt from that report will be taken into account <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> as we have discussed in this house for a long time nobody enjoys the unemployment which there is but we believe that what we are doing with enterprise zones is something of great benefit to these areas and to the people there <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord cledwyn of penrhos has indeed put his finger on one of the problems of this particular project <e> <s> we do not know the precise number of jobs arising from firms moving into an enterprise zone but we believe it is a reasonable assumption that these firms are generally committed to moving into a new location anyway <e> <s> in setting up new premises especially in an enterprise zone with its attendant benefits they have an opportunity to expand both their operations and their workforce <e> <s> even now these are fairly early days to get full facts and figures from these zones but we are monitoring the kind of question which the noble lord asked and there are some very good stories to tell <e>", "<cs> yes my lords most of them are owned by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord glenamara will be aware we have just announced that we are introducing additional zones which i believe is a fairly good response after the original zones were introduced some two years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may take the last point first i understand that as a result of the enterprise zone at clydebank some jobs were created <e> <s> again this is a beginning because factories are still being built and so there is more to come <e> <s> in replying to the noble lord lord ross of marnock i would like to make three points <e> <s> first less than months after the first zone was designated it is still too early to assess all the costs <e> <s> secondly much of the cost of initial development in the zone will support activity over a number of years <e> <s> thirdly the success of the enterprise zone initiative should be measured not only in terms of jobs provided in the zones but also in the spill-over benefit of increased demand <e> <s> at the moment we believe that the cost will be about million <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that a comment on steel when we are discussing the enterprise zones is a little wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble viscount will visit some enterprise zones <e> <s> i feel that he is totally awry in his comments <e> <s> there are no delusions and there are no dying industries these are new places which are being developed for new jobs for people in a creative atmosphere <e>", "<cs> my lords the cost to the exchequer to date of the public inquiries relating to the proposed development of stansted airport is approximately <e> <s> expenditure incurred by the british airports authority on this inquiry is of course a matter for the board <e> <s> with a substantial part of the hearings still to be completed it is too early to anticipate the decision date <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that intervention with which i believe we all agree basically <e> <s> it was in point of fact on th december in the term of office of this present government that the then secretary of state mr john nott invited the british airports authority to bring forward proposals <e> <s> since then there have been a number of other developments all of which have been taken into account by this inquiry including of course the heathrow stage which will be starting in january <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> there has been nothing rushed in this inquiry and it will be statutorily carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i seem to be giving everyone assurances on all kinds of matters <e> <s> this matter is being pursued very carefully and as the noble lord lord jenkins of putney is well aware the case of heathrow is to be looked at early in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords i will be happy to serve as a post office between my two noble friends although i understand that at the moment the boy scouts are doing that job and perhaps they would be better employed at it than i <e>", "<cs> my lords we hope to see the end of this particular inquiry in the not too distant future and i am sure my noble friend will be satisfied <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that a consortium led by manchester airport has put the case to the inquiry for diversion to regional airports as an alternative to stansted <e> <s> the secretaries of state for trade and the environment will reach a final decision in the light of the inspectors report <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for pointing out that the m is nearing completion <e> <s> we shall of course then hope that the people of essex are relieved by that motorway <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand that no amendments have been set down to this bill and that no noble lord has indicated a wish to move a manuscript amendment or to speak in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in response to the noble baroness i am grateful for the kind words at the end of her remarks <e> <s> as she knows we had doubts about the keeling schedule <e> <s> this pamphlet will be available and incidentally it is in the printed paper office at the moment <e> <s> it will be available for discussions throughout the bills parliamentary pasage and we are at the moment looking into a method of publication for afterwards <e>", "<cs> i hope my noble friend will permit me to say that i think he is now going on to another amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps this might be the moment for me to intervene just to explain the governments view and to start by sharing with the committee my gratitude to the noble viscount for tabling this amendment so that we have had such an interesting discussion <e> <s> obviously the government prefer the trustee system that is why we have put it in the bill <e> <s> first we recognise the need for a full interplay between the skills and experience of the trustees and the staff <e> <s> the balance of their respective contributions must vary according to the issues under consideration <e> <s> for this reason the bill makes full but flexible arrangements for committees comprising of trustees and staff <e> <s> these provisions are set out in paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just explain first that the selection of trustees is a vital element in the governments view of the running of a major institution and they must be the best available candidates possessing the right combination of skills and experience <e> <s> when drafting the bill the government reviewed the desirability of awarding rights of nomination in relation to the new boards <e> <s> given our overriding desire to make the best possible appointments we rejected this option <e> <s> in our view it is essential that trustees should be selected on grounds of their personal suitability and with regard to achieving an overall balance of knowledge and experience <e> <s> granting rights of nomination might undermine this priority <e> <s> in fact i am doubtful myself about the rights of nomination <e>", "<cs> if i may first take amendment no <e> <s> moved by the noble lord lord strabolgi we have some sympathy with this amendment <e> <s> i appreciate that the initial period of office of the board will provide ample opportunities for members to get to know each other well <e> <s> equally they will indoubtedly be well placed to assess which of them would make the most appropriate next chairman <e>", "<cs> i have at the top of my brief the words listen to the house <e> <s> i have listened and this is something which is evenly balanced <e> <s> if i may i should like to consider it again <e>", "<cs> the government have noted the desire of the house raised both at committee stage and during the debate on second reading concerning the need to ensure that trustees with relevant experience are appointed to the new board <e> <s> in spite of the three noble lords sitting in the same row opposite who have all underlined the vast difficulties which arise giving three quite correct but different reasons the government accept my noble friends amendment in principle <e> <s> however we should like to offer our own form of words in substitution at the next stage <e> <s> i shall look forward on that occasion to hearing from the noble lords lord hutchinson of lullington <e> <s> lord <e>", "<cs> i recognise that there has been a customary link between the royal college of art and the museum with the presence of a college member on the museums advisory council <e> <s> the advisory council will be laid down when the new board of trustees is established <e> <s> my right honourable friend the prime minister will naturally bear in mind the link between the college and the museum among other factors when appointing the new trustees <e> <s> however the new board will have wider functions and responsibilities than did the old advisory council <e> <s> this means that it may be inappropriate to carry over automatically into the board the membership pattern of the advisory council <e>", "<cs> the amendment falls into two parts <e> <s> as the noble lord lord donaldson of kingsbridge has said the first part we consider is good but the second part we should like to redraft and bring back <e>", "<cs> the bill as presently framed does not include breaks during periods of service <e> <s> in some cases of course the trustees may themselves not wish to be reappointed <e> <s> equally there is nothing in the bill to preclude an individual from volunteering to serve for less than a term if for example for personal reasons he or she cannot commit their services for the full term <e> <s> in considering both new appointments and reappointments the government will take into account all relevant factors including the length of time for the appointment and the desirability where appropriate of extending an individuals length of service where it has proved valuable to the board or of allowing an interval to elapse prior to reappointment <e>", "<cs> i have little to add to what i said earlier <e> <s> i am very much at the committees disposal <e> <s> the government do not wish to rule out the possibility of appointing particular trustees for three terms <e> <s> in fact the word flexibility comes in again although in view of the possible time span involved i am inclined to agree that such a case would be exceptional <e> <s> i am between the noble lord lord strabolgi and my noble friend lord eccles on this issue <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said the other institutions vary so one could not bring it into line for all of them <e> <s> i understand that the average for the other museums is seven years <e> <s> on that basis our own period of five years for one term would be right <e> <s> may i discuss this again and come back at a later stage <e> <s> i think i agree with my noble friend lord eccles that a little flexibility here would be a good thing <e> <s> however we shall look at it <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern behind the amendment and the government do wish to ensure that trustees do not regard their offices as tenable in name only <e> <s> in particular we believe that it is a small but important matter of principle that trustees should not be absent without the boards consent but we do not believe that it is desirable to qualify this in the manner suggested by the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> length of absence would be a more justifiable criterion than the number of meetings missed <e>", "<cs> the noble lords amendment would have the effect of preventing individuals serving as trustees of other unspecified institutions from being appointed to the board of the v and a this would temporarily deny the museum access to useful sources of experience that may be valuable particularly in the period following the establishment of the v and a <e>", "<cs> if i could answer my noble friend lord eccles on one brief point yes it is our intention that there should be a contract of employment <e> <s> that of course would answer also my noble friend lord craigton <e> <s> the terms of a contract of employment would enable you to get rid of him after one or two years or whatever the term may be <e>", "<cs> the government agree that it would be undesirable for the post of director to represent an appointment for life <e> <s> equally it would not be advisable to go to the other extreme and signify a term of years <e> <s> the powers to reappoint would provide some flexibility but the government feel that the terms of a contract of employment are matters for negotiation and agreement between the trustees and the individual concerned <e> <s> the trustees will wish to get <e>", "<cs> yes broadly it is <e> <s> exactly that <e> <s> but one does not want to talk about personalities <e> <s> this is a once-and-for-all case we are looking at at the moment <e> <s> this is the only time that the v and a has been taken out of the departmental sphere <e> <s> it will not happen again <e> <s> it is a once-and-for-all issue <e>", "<cs> thinking of this particular time at the moment we have a clause for the staff to be offered a contract of no worse conditions <e> <s> that is a once-and-for-all piece of legislation in this bill <e>", "<cs> as has come out during the debate there is a delicate balance to be struck between the role of the director and the board in the matter of formulating policy <e> <s> clearly the board has the overall responsibility for developing policies to carry out the functions laid on them by the bill <e> <s> the board will naturally rely greatly on the director and senior staff for advice and help on this matter but the ultimate responsibility must rest with the board since it is upon them that the functions are laid <e> <s> the director and his staff will be responsible to the board for the general exercise of the boards functions and no doubt there will be fruitful dialogue between the director staff and the board so that the development of devising policy is informed by the practicalities of carrying out the functions and <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is properly concerned about the terms and conditions including pay of all employees of the trustee boards <e> <s> in particular as the noble baroness said she is anxious to ensure that future as well as existing staff will be employed on terms not less favourable than those currently operating in these institutions <e> <s> i hope i can assure the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble baroness will allow me to respond to her remarks in closing the last amendment <e> <s> my understanding is that consultations have been taking place throughout and i shall draw her remarks to the attention of those concerned <e>", "<cs> if i may return briefly to the amendment before the noble baroness has a way of putting a lot into her closing remarks <e> <s> i was aware of the legislation that she mentioned but apart from the health and safety at work act there is also the employment protection act and trade union legislation since then which we consider has made a little difference <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> in order to fulfil the requirements laid upon them by this amendment the boards and the other comparable bodies covered by the bill would have to negotiate arbitration arrangements separately with each of the trade unions representing staff in the institutions who would be in receipt of an offer of employment <e> <s> the amendments pre-suppose that each trade union involved will want identical arrangements <e> <s> if there are not to be at least five separate sets of arbitration arrangements the boards and their counterparts will also need to co-ordinate their own negotiating points <e> <s> not only is the procedure already laid down for both sides these tribunals have now developed experience in handling civil service references and can therefore refer back to their own case law <e> <s> it is also the case that the individual involved in a case referred to an industrial tribunal may have his trade union representative with him at hearings <e> <s> it is our view that the combination of these factors represents a better safeguard for the member of staff than reliance on local arrangements which could be untested <e> <s> it is also the case that the boards will be under a duty to offer employment on terms not less favourable to the civil servant than his existing terms <e> <s> as a result it is likely that fewer disputes will arise <e> <s> for the boards to have to spend effort in negotiating an unnecessary arbitration agreement is thus probably doubly wasteful <e>", "<cs> my understanding and i believe i said this in my original answer is that there are grievance procedures at the moment and it is a very well tried case <e>", "<cs> it is clearly important that decisions should be taken by the board only when a representative number of the trustees is present <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble lords wish to set a minimum size which will constitute the quorum for the boards of the trustee institutions <e> <s> but the amendment has wider implications than that <e> <s> by deleting lines and of page it not only redetermines the size of the quorum it also removes the general power to enable the boards to regulate all other aspects of their procedure <e> <s> i am sure that that is not my noble friends intention <e> <s> the board is enabled by paragraph to set its own quorum and the government believe that this is a matter that should be left for its administrative determination <e>", "<cs> i shall happily consider the matter again <e>", "<cs> we believe that there is nothing in the bill which prevents the boards laying down these duties in respect of the chairmen of committees <e> <s> indeed such responsibilities are common form and the government would expect that the boards will wish to follow them <e> <s> we submit that the amendment therefore is unnecessary <e> <s> the boards power to impose those principles contained in the noble lords amendment are contained in paragraph of schedule and we would not wish to see any of the boards wishes prejudged in this respect there are likely for example to be other procedures which the boards will wish to define in connection with committee meetings and it makes sense for all these related matters to be considered as a whole rather than piecemeal <e>", "<cs> i think i heard the noble lord lord donaldson say that he does not like the sherry <e> <s> during the second reading debate my noble friend lord eccles suggested that remuneration was essential to attract the right people <e> <s> i agree that it is essential to get the right people and any board whether it be of unpaid trustees or salaried executives fails if it lacks <e>", "<cs> i can give no assurance that i can put in that actual word at report stage <e> <s> if the noble viscount wishes to press his amendment then he must <e>", "<cs> the tricky point about putting down such an amendment is that i am informed that if we use objects in this sense and then say that they include books then of course at any other time we use the word objects in the bill it will not include books <e> <s> that in one of the trials and tribulations <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend lord montagu for explaining this amendment as i must confess that we were in some doubt <e> <s> the bill charges the boards of the museums with the promotion of the publics enjoyment and knowledge in their respective fields <e> <s> they are therefore expected not only to satisfy the publics interest in their activities but to expand their knowledge at the same time <e> <s> for instance they are required to publish reports of their activities and the provisions are contained in paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> i appreciate my noble friends concern to ensure that the scope of the boards remit is not drawn in such a narrow way as to preclude its duty to promote the publics enjoyment of the crafts <e> <s> as my noble friend will know the term art is construed in its broadest sense to include the practical application of any science industrial pursuit or craft <e> <s> this is a very wide definition and <e>", "<cs> the wording of the bill as published is intended to put beyond doubt that the trustees of the victoria and albert and science museums may charge for admission to the collections should they so decide <e> <s> it does not require them to charge <e> <s> it is not and i should like to stress this point an indication that the government intend to impose a charging policy on these or any other national museums or galleries <e> <s> indeed we consider that decisions on charging are primarily matters for the new trustees and i should like to take this opportunity of reassuring the committee that we have no intention of imposing a decision upon them <e>", "<cs> once again i am grateful to my noble friend for his explanation of what he has in mind <e> <s> at present the two museums administer schemes to assist local museums and art galleries with the purchase of objects for their collections <e> <s> these schemes are financed from allocations approved by parliament and included in the museums annual votes <e> <s> as my noble friend reminded us the government are at present considering how to go along with these schemes and in particular what sort of reference is to be made about them in this bill <e> <s> we expect to submit our amendment at a later stage and perhaps i may ask my noble friend to take this amendment together with the last one so that we may consider them together to see what we should put into the bill <e>", "<cs> i sympathise with the concern of my noble friend to ensure that moneys accruing to the museums in the event of the boards decision to change for admission should be used for their benefit and should not be clawed back by the treasury <e>", "<cs> first i should like to answer the noble lord lord simon of glaisdale <e> <s> if i understood his query aright he was concerned about the difference between clause and clause <e> <s> so far as i understand one refers to disposals and the other to loans <e> <s> therefore they are different subjects <e> <s> but i should like to read what he has said and make sure that i am correct <e>", "<cs> may i speak to amendment first <e> <s> the government appreciate the anxieties underlying these amendments and the desire to ensure that objects are not disposed of without due regard to the intentions or wishes of the donors <e> <s> may i reassure the committee that where trusts or conditions are attached to objects the bill requires the trustees not to sell exchange or give away the object in a manner contrary to these trusts or conditions <e> <s> that provision in respect of the victoria and albert museum to which this amendment relates is found in clause <e> <s> similar provisions have been included in those parts of the bill relating to the science museum the armouries and the royal botanic gardens <e>", "<cs> i take the noble and learned lords point and i should like to look into the matter for him <e> <s> as for the amendment i have been interested in what has been said on both sides and perhaps we may read those remarks and see where we can go from there <e>", "<cs> i should appreciated an opportunity to read what has been said to see if we can move anywhere towards it <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend lord eccles i would say that disposal may be by sale exchange or gift provided that the object in question is not held subject to an impeding trust or condition and either is a duplicate or is deemed by the board to be unsuitable for retention and capable of disposal without detriment to the interests of students or other members of the public <e> <s> that would appear to me to cover my noble friends example of the assagai without any problems at all <e> <s> it is certainly a duplicate there are more than one and it can be exchanged <e>", "<cs> how can they be unique if there are duplicates <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale asked me a question i shall look into it and see what i can find out <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord lord jenkins has underlined the difficulty which we are in on this particular issue <e> <s> it is a question of balance between the two sides between wishing not to have relics in a museum which you do not want and making sure that you are applying the conditions and making a museum acceptable to such things as a national heritage memorial fund <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi mentioned the rayner report <e> <s> i do not have it in front of me <e> <s> i did not bring it with me today because i know that the noble lord regards it as a red rag to a bull <e> <s> but i will certainly look at his point <e> <s> of course when talking to the noble lord lord jenkins on his amendment about books we did then say that they would be totally covered as part of the trustees heritage when they take over <e>", "<cs> my lords the transport and road research laboratory and the motor industry research association have conducted several research projects into the problems of braking stability of heavy vehicles and the various remedies <e> <s> there is no complete solution to the problem but the principal devices aimed at reducing the onset of jack-knifing are the load sensing valve and the wheel anti-lock device <e> <s> construction and use regulations now require one or <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord managed to convey an awful lot of questions in that supplementary <e> <s> i ought to start by saying first that jack-knifing has been decreasing since the s when load sensing standards started <e> <s> articulated vehicles have increased in number but against that the actual number of accidents caused by articulated vehicles has gone down so that is satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no evidence to support what my noble friend has said but should he have any i shall be happy to consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures on which i was working are injury accidents but as the noble lord will be aware the problem here is to get the correct figures because again the police in different <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards legislation my noble friend is quite correct we cannot legislate backwards on this question <e> <s> but i am happy to say that over the last few years a large number of vehicles have been fitted with these devices resulting in the figures that i gave earlier on the reduction of accidents involving articulated lorries <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i did mean exactly the opposite <e> <s> i am grateful to my noble friend for clarifying that point <e>", "<cs> my lords of course as the noble lord said we are all very much concerned about the losses on the roads <e> <s> however my honourable friend mrs lynda chalker announced only last week that she intends to take another look at the whole subject when a new concensus will be taken <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to go back to the advice given by the noble lord lord davies of leek on that occasion <e> <s> i have no new information to offer the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i assure my noble friend that the government are prepared to accept the underlying principle and will offer our own amendment in substitution at the next stage <e>", "<cs> i think the noble lord the deputy chairman of committees put amendment no <e> <s> and i believe my noble friend is speaking to <e>", "<cs> the government do of course accept that enjoyment should be clearly reflected in the words used and we do accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> i would say to the noble baroness that in no way was this omission deliberate in the sense she mentioned <e> <s> it was partly a point of grammatical style <e> <s> what we shall have is publics enjoyment of the development of science and technology and i should prefer to have another look at where to put the word enjoyment rather than enjoyment of development though if the committee would like the word enjoyment in at that point i shall be happy to accept that <e> <s> may i leave it to my noble friend either to accept publics enjoyment of the development or let me try to put it in at another place between now and report stage <e>", "<cs> i was only pausing for a moment to see whether there were any further suggestions for amendments to the terminology <e> <s> so far as the government are concerned we share my noble friends feelings and are happy to accept the principle of the amendment <e> <s> however it is not clear that all the areas listed in the amendment are relevant to the responsibilities of the armouries trustees <e> <s> i am thinking in particular of commerce and industry <e> <s> we should like to consider this carefully with a view to bringing forward an amendment at a later stage <e> <s> we would of course take into account what was discussed on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> if your lordships have any other suggestions regarding deletions or additions i shall be happy to hear them <e>", "<cs> i should just like to put the governments point of view and to say why we have done this and then i should like to listen to the views of the committee <e> <s> let me say right at the outset that it is not our intention in any way to demote the armouries or to say that they are of lesser importance than anything else <e> <s> i repeat that is not the intention <e>", "<cs> we have not so far had a division and as this is a non-controversial matter i think we ought to see which way the committee wants to vote <e>", "<cs> may i intervene <e> <s> i should be perfectly happy to have the arguments on amendment no <e> <s> if it is the will of the committee <e>", "<cs> of course i appreciate the reasoning behind these amendments which the noble baroness has explained <e> <s> they are designed to give the armouries the same vote status as is proposed for the v and a and the science museum <e> <s> the provision of a different rgime for the armouries and a grant in aid paid by the secretary of state rather than supply granted directly by parliament i hope your lordships will not in any way think of as belittling the status of the armouries <e> <s> that is far from our intention <e> <s> the inclusion of the armouries in this bill is indication enough of the governments view of their status <e>", "<cs> i say at once to the noble earl lord perth that these are not intended as blows <e> <s> as i have been at pains to say throughout our debates on these amendments the government fully appreciate the armouries for the excellent collections they are it is purely a question of administration so far as we are concerned <e> <s> the noble baroness was right to say that it is our intention to keep the armouries where they are there is absolutely no question about that <e>", "<cs> the difficulty is that the tower of london remains a royal palace in which the armouries are so there must be an arrangement with the tower for the occupation as it were of the <e>", "<cs> my noble friend is quite right because it would be going around in circles if there were to be a power for the armouries to charge for admission within the tower <e> <s> if we leave the financial arrangements as they are at the moment the grant in aid will come from the department of the environment which will of course be collecting the money outside the tower <e> <s> so if one were to take a separate kitty for the armouries within the tower that would be taken into account in regard to any grant in aid <e> <s> so as my noble friend was anticipating it would be going around in circles if there were such a power <e>", "<cs> i fully appreciate my noble friends point <e> <s> i shall look into it and see exactly what should be done <e>", "<cs> having left my uniforms and various other items to rgimental museums i hope that they will be looked after in the way that noble lords say <e> <s> equally i should like to add my tribute to all the work they do in the various rgimental headquarters <e> <s> to deal with amendment no <e> <s> which has been moved by the noble viscount lord ridley the term armed forces includes and i emphasise this the reserve forces <e> <s> there is therefore no need to make separate mention of them <e> <s> should we do so we would have to think of mentioning all the other forces such as the auxiliaries and the womens side of the services <e> <s> by inference incidentally if one mentioned one force within the armed forces one would have to mention as my noble friend will appreciate others <e> <s> may i therefore reiterate that armed forces does indeed include the reserve forces <e>", "<cs> i appreciate that in tabling these amendments my noble friend has at heart the best interests of the royal air force museum and the other museums which he mentioned <e> <s> may i stress first that unlike the science museum which the noble lord cited the royal air force museum for which this bill seeks to provide already have their own boards <e> <s> the royal air force museum already has a properly constituted board of trustees <e> <s> similarly the battle of britain and the bomber command museums have their own boards of trustees <e> <s> only the aerospace museum at cosford does not currently have its own board but is run by the board of trustees of the royal air force museum under a management agreement between the secretary of state for defence and the trustees <e> <s> although linked to the royal air force museum by this agreement the aerospace museum is therefore separate <e> <s> thus there are distinct differences in the identities status and constitution of the four museums which it is proposed should be governed by a new board of trustees <e>", "<cs> as i said before there is an essential difference between the armed forces museums which are likely to be affected by this bill and the other museums to which it applies in that the armed forces museums are already governed by properly constituted boards of trustees <e> <s> it is necessary to consider to what extent the bill should impose conditions on the way in which the trustees carry out their functions <e> <s> schedule as it stands is intended to set out the safeguards which quite rightly should be provided for the staff of museums who are currently ministry of defence civil servants and who may in due course become employees of their respective boards of trustees <e> <s> it is intended thereby to ensure that their position particularly with regard to their pension arrangements is not worsened by such a transfer <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble viscount lord simon has finally underlined the difficulties of choosing a new name for this body <e> <s> it is not an easy thing to decide and it always will give rise to a good deal of debate <e>", "<cs> the government find this a most interesting amendment and one with which they have a good deal of sympathy <e> <s> however as it stands i do not think it should be accepted but should form a very useful input for further thinking between now and the report stage <e> <s> there has been a lot of criticism of the bill as introduced on the grounds that schedule is difficult to understand and that there is no clear statement of the basic policy purposes for the commission <e> <s> of course i fully understand that <e>", "<cs> this is an intricate subject <e> <s> i am sorry that my noble friend lord cockfield is no longer a minister at the treasury otherwise i might have had some nice whispered comments from him <e> <s> if i may answer the noble baroness lady birk the aim of setting up the commission is intended to be progress <e> <s> i assure the noble baroness that my right honourable friend the secretary of state would not have taken on such an idea had it not been with the aim of benefiting generations to come <e> <s> in no way is it intended to be a stranglehold <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has very much got my own thinking in mind <e> <s> i was feeling very much embarrassed that we have not got further <e> <s> it is absolutely my intention to convey his message to my right honourable friend the secretary of state and say it is fundamental to the progress of the bill that we should have that information <e>", "<cs> i did not pick up the point which was made by the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran <e> <s> we have of course thought about it very deeply <e> <s> it is the difficulty of coming to a decision which is slightly different which is exercising the mind of the government <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether i may intervene here because i would like to hear the comments of other noble lords once i have said what i have to say <e> <s> the government were not surprised to receive an amendment relating to the size of the commission <e> <s> it is difficult to achieve a balance between the conflicting demands and after some consideration the government have decided that an upper limit of members is a little too restrictive and propose to bring forward an amendment to increase the number <e>", "<cs> these two amendments are designed to widen the scope of expertise and knowledge to which the secretary of state will need to have regard in selecting persons for appointment as members of the commission <e> <s> i think i should emphasise that the list must not be read as closing the door on expertise that is not listed <e> <s> while i can see the attraction of making the amendments proposed i would like to make one or two points about them <e> <s> the existing list of items seeks to include only those kinds of knowledge or experience which taken as a whole are relevant to the matters with which the commission will be concerned <e>", "<cs> as i expressed our view on the museum side we are very much against that <e> <s> that is what we want to steer clear of <e> <s> of course i am very happy with history because that would qualify me <e> <s> i hope i can say that with my tutor the noble lord lord dacre sitting behind me <e>", "<cs> of course i well understand the desire to involve local authorities in the work of the commission and to establish good relations between them from the start <e> <s> local authorities will continue to have a vital role to play in the presentation of the heritage a role which we all value <e>", "<cs> may i come in here <e> <s> perhaps i might state the intention at the moment because i think this will make a little difference to our considerations <e> <s> what is written at the moment is up to five years <e> <s> the up to provision was made with it in mind that all the terms need not be the same <e> <s> what we are looking at in this amendment is a period of four to six years rather than up to five years <e> <s> in point of fact we are restricting the lower limit and adding one year to the top limit <e>", "<cs> yes he can <e>", "<cs> nonsense <e>", "<cs> i am most disappointed in the noble baroness lady birk <e> <s> i had hoped that she would speak to amendment no <e> <s> alone because i am happy to say that i accept it <e> <s> but if we may now move forward to amendment no <e> <s> i shall go into more detail <e>", "<cs> if i may respond to that point very quickly it is going to be an unfunded scheme and the costs if there are any as it were will be taken out of grant in aid and will be taken account of <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly undertake to bring that point to the attention of the parliamentary draftsman <e>", "<cs> on the question that my noble friend first raised i was following what he said and agreeing completely but i am afraid i rather missed the actual point of the question <e> <s> the basic concept here is that it is not a worsening proposition and he is quite right to say that we should look to the future as well as where one wants to offer the commission a little more freedom <e> <s> i understand that so far as the natural environment research council and the nature conservancy council are concerned these are going very successfully at the moment and my understanding is that they take about three people to look after them <e>", "<cs> yes i should certainly like to see what the noble lord has in mind <e> <s> perhaps i may just say again that the government intend to recommend to the commission that it should adopt a pension scheme analogous to but separate from the civil service scheme <e> <s> by adopting an analogous scheme the commission would get a ready-made pension scheme incorporating all the important features of a civil service scheme <e> <s> i should like to read carefully what he has said and perhaps he will be good enough to do the same then we shall see what situation we can reach <e>", "<cs> i very much take the point about the listing and will ensure that the word of the noble baroness and my noble friend are taken into account <e> <s> if i may be more specific about the amendment i am grateful to the noble baroness for explaining it as i was not very clear at the beginning as to its intention <e> <s> i am <e>", "<cs> i do not think it has to be in the bill because the civil servants can do it anyway <e> <s> this is something which is done with public bodies anyway so it does not have to be in the bill <e>", "<cs> indeed <e> <s> i can do so <e> <s> this is part of the secretary of states general powers <e> <s> if i may repeat what i said it happens already and very successfully between government departments and other public sector bodies and it is our intention that it should happen with the commission <e>", "<cs> i can understand my noble friends concern to avoid reducing the amount of money which would be available for the commission to spend directly on the heritage but it would be wrong <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i was interested by the comments of the last two noble lords because they were very much similar to the start of my own remarks <e> <s> this amendment seeks to remove from the commission its powers to decide how best to arrange its affairs in respect of obtaining the best and most appropriate range of expert advice <e> <s> i question the right to make <e>", "<cs> i think i did answer the noble lord lord kennet he nodded at me when lord simon was speaking <e> <s> we agree that this particular amendment is going too far <e> <s> how far on the others we shall come to as we go along <e>", "<cs> this amendment would enable the commission to pay the members of any advisory committees it sets up whatever expense allowances it wished <e> <s> there are many matters which we think it right to leave to the commission to decide as it thinks fit but this and the level of remuneration generally <e> <s> i am afraid are not among them <e> <s> the commission must get the secretary of states approval given with treasury consent which the noble and learned lord lord simon dislikes so much to rates of pay it proposes for its staff and the remuneration it proposes for its own members <e>", "<cs> i have no such fears as the noble baroness raises so perhaps i could tell her what i feel about this anyway and she can come back <e> <s> the whole question of remuneration and honoraria has been very thoroughly aired in relation to the trustee museums in the bill and i promised then to consider what might be done in the light of the views expressed <e> <s> the concept of reimbursement for loss of earnings in the case of <e>", "<cs> a common theme running through many of our debates is the need for the commission to have a certain degree of financial freedom <e> <s> the government have a good deal of sympathy with this view but only to the extent that it is compatible with the necessary proper degree of central supervision <e> <s> where like the commission a body is substantially funded by government it is essential that there should be systems in place to enable a proper account of the expenditure of that public money to be given <e> <s> one of the most important checks on expenditure is that provided by the auditors <e> <s> in these circumstances it is standard practice that the government should appoint auditors for a body which is not subject to full audit by the comptroller and auditor general <e> <s> it provides a very proper degree of central supervision where taxpayers money is concerned <e> <s> i can see no reason in this case to depart from this practice and i hope that my noble friend will be satisfied with that explanation <e>", "<cs> all i can do is reiterate what i have already said namely that this is the normal practice for bodies of this type <e>", "<cs> i take to heart the points made by the noble baroness and my noble friend <e> <s> the government have a good deal of sympathy with the aim of these amendments and would have no quarrel in principle with the concept that the commissions functions should in part be exercised for the purpose of conservation through investigation and recording or for the purpose of conservation of archaeological sites <e> <s> however as the noble baroness will have noticed there are a large number of amendments down in respect of clause including a complete new version of the clause <e> <s> i will of course deal with each amendment as it arises but it is clear from both the quantity and quality of the amendments that we shall have to study them carefully to see how we might improve our drafting <e> <s> it will i hope be agreeable to the noble baroness to withdraw the amendment at the moment knowing that we shall take her remarks completely to heart <e> <s> i should also like to say to my noble friend lord dacre that we will take into account amendment no <e> <s> k <e> <s> which in fact he did not move <e>", "<cs> i share the view of its importance and i am delighted that my noble friend described to me designed landscapes because i was not absolutely sure of the definition of what he calls his shorthand <e> <s> we have some slight reservations about widening the commissions remit but <e> <s> with the support that the noble lord obviously has for this we shall look into it very carefully and see how it can be included <e>", "<cs> i am grateful again to my noble friend for his explanation <e> <s> i believe that it is already covered but i shall of course check on it and again take it into consideration if it is not listed for our further consideration <e>", "<cs> this is an important aspect of the commissions role and we have already been speaking around it <e> <s> it is right that it should receive attention <e> <s> this amendment is generally in tune with the governments thinking <e> <s> i think particularly that the commissions role should be clarified in respect of the provision of facilities <e> <s> indeed we shall keep this very much in mind in any redrafting <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble baroness said amendments but is she speaking only to r <e>", "<cs> i was rather nervous that she might have been taking one or two others <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that this seeks to make the list of subjects in the subsection consistent with that in subsection as amended and of course we would agree to that <e>", "<cs> nevertheless i feel i should put on record in regard to this amendment that it is clear that an important function of the commission will be to manage and present the monuments in its direct care <e> <s> the amendment goes considerably further than that it would impose on the commission a duty to manage and present to the public many aspects of the national heritage in england for which it has no formal responsibility and over which it will have no control <e> <s> the amendment does not limit the commissions task to monuments buildings or areas under its ownership guardianship or management <e> <s> it extends to all aspects of the heritage regardless of ownership status or importance <e> <s> having said that i will go carefully into what my noble friend said but i thought i should utter those cautionary words <e>", "<cs> i take my noble friends point and perhaps i might explain the position a little <e> <s> he is right to say that subsection provides a facility to charge for education and instruction given to the public <e> <s> but under the provisions of schedule the commission will have the power to charge for admission to monuments paragraph and to charge for any facilities or services provided for the public at any monument paragraph <e> <s> there is some advantage in having the power to charge explicitly linked to certain powers or duties <e> <s> in the case of the educational and instructional facilities which they may provide for the public i think it right that they should be able to charge if they wish <e> <s> hence the charging provision in subsection <e> <s> but to make this power all-embracing is more difficult to take <e> <s> it might also create difficulties as it duplicates the specific powers set out in schedule <e> <s> this may seem a rather complicated reply and probably we should look at the matter again <e>", "<cs> before responding to my noble friend i should like to say a few words to the noble lord lord kennet in regard to the previous amendment <e> <s> i take the noble lords point but i should like to look at the matter more closely since the noble lord lord montagu has stimulated a new train of thought that i should like to follow up <e>", "<cs> the main thrust of this amendment is one that the government entirely accept <e> <s> we intend to bring forward at a later stage an appropriate government amendment to empower the commission to undertake and sponsor research <e> <s> the noble baroness referred to the other amendment <e> <s> i should say in an anticipatory warning to my noble friend that we think that that one goes a little too far but we are happy to give an undertaking to put down an amendment in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords no applications for grants have been approved <e> <s> only one formal application for grant has so far been received but this was later withdrawn <e> <s> the department is ready to discuss any worthwhile proposals where grant is necessary to <e>", "<cs> my lords we think that the grant rules are the minimum necessary to safeguard public funds <e> <s> the noble countess will be delighted to hear that the revised memorandum was published on th december and many copies have already been sent out <e> <s> i did not realise that the noble countess had not seen one <e> <s> i shall make sure that she gets one <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord as always produces statistics about which i can only say i am sure they are correct <e> <s> indeed we are trying to get heavy vehicle freight on to the canals <e> <s> as he knows we published this last memorandum on th december and we shall have to wait a few weeks to see whether that is going well <e> <s> i believe that the noble lord is also aware that we have spent quite a lot of money on the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation improvement scheme and are very much waiting to see how well that goes when it opens in the spring of next year before considering more capitalisation on this sort of score <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to inland waterways transport policy under section to which the noble lady referred methods of assessment and financing are different to suit the different characteristics of each mode but all come within the governments policy that freight services should be supplied on a fully commercial basis and that the need for fair competition between modes is met <e> <s> that is the line along which the government are moving <e>", "<cs> i take the point raised by the noble baroness my lords but experience of section in relation to rail applications has shown that applicants need time to understand the grant and to prepare applications which have a chance of success <e> <s> there have on the other hand been occasions when we could not come to terms on the grant and the other side have gone ahead and done the operation without grant <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the effects on the ports and dockers livelihood are concerned there is absolutely no reason why there should be an adverse effect <e> <s> the intention is to administer the scheme to assist freight handlers to get traffic off the roads where it can be shown that there are benefits to communities which would otherwise be adversely affected by the use of a road route <e> <s> it is not to shift it a short distance to by-pass docks <e> <s> we should require there to be a substantial movement on inland waterways and evidence of environmental benefit and that is when we should consider offering grants <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment would if accepted wreck this part of the bill <e> <s> i assure the committee that we recognise the strength of opinion which lies behind the amendment and which has made the noble lord lord rennet bring it forward <e> <s> i hope however that in the light of our discussions so far on the commission and the assurances i have been able to give the noble lord will feel able not to press his amendment <e> <s> we have sought as much as possible to assist the committees discussions through the provision of explanatory material <e> <s> we intend to give the most careful consideration to the points raised by noble lords and to accommodate them where we feel this would help the running or the work of the commission <e>", "<cs> before we go any further may i reply to the point on consolidation <e> <s> i understand that <e>", "<cs> if i may respond very briefly to the noble lord lord kennet so far as publication of the guide is concerned it is our intention to follow the will of your lordships <e> <s> if it is at all practicable we will do exactly what the committee wishes <e> <s> there is no question of hiding anything and we will do this in the <e>", "<cs> we are pre-empting amendment no <e> <s> a trifle <e> <s> we have already discussed this a little when debating clause and i believe that this is what we are going to do on amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> may i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> a which has a bearing on this question <e> <s> the amendment moved by the noble baroness would require the commission to set up a charitable fund to receive voluntary contributions and profits arising from commercial operations and also to receive endowments <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> a would include the commission in the list of bodies in the charities act which so far as they are charities are exempt charities that is they are exempt from many of the controls exercised by the charity commission <e>", "<cs> the government have every sympathy with the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> it has always been our intention that the commission should be able to make use of voluntary services and indeed would be better placed to tap the private goodwill which clearly exists <e> <s> however as with all the helpful points on clause i should like if i may to consider the matter further with a view to bringing it forward at a later stage in the revised version of this clause <e>", "<cs> if the effect of this amendment would be to remove any restrictions on the commissions power to borrow then the government obviously do not see such a wide power as very appropriate <e> <s> the commission will be funded largely out of its grant-in-aid and is unlikely to be in a position to service any long-term loan debt <e> <s> in any case such borrowing would count against the overall resources made available to the commission by way of public expenditure <e> <s> therefore the grant would be reduced accordingly and no net benefit achieved <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may just explain our thinking here <e> <s> we are of course financing the commission by grant-in-aid <e> <s> the commission may want to buy a house or rent a house the capital sum may be or it may be a small rental <e> <s> obviously the commission does not have that kind of money but we do not want to stop it having it <e>", "<cs> that is our intention <e>", "<cs> may i first respond to my noble friend lord beloff about the invitation which the british academy gave to the secretary of state that they would offer to see him <e> <s> i understand that my secretary of state responded yesterday to this matter <e> <s> had he done so earlier obviously we might not have had the amendments <e> <s> one of the major benefits of setting up the commission is the amalgamation of the currently separate advisory and executive functions <e> <s> both these functions must in the governments view be exercised by the commission <e> <s> setting up an advisory council would serve to continue a separation between the advisory and executive roles and we believe would create an unnecessary further layer of mandatory bureaucracy <e> <s> i think that the latter point was made somewhat forcibly by the noble lord lord hutchinson earlier in our discussions in respect of the british library system <e>", "<cs> some of what i have said already particularly in respect of amendments to the previous clause also applies here <e> <s> the government have much sympathy with my noble friend and wish to see some simple and comprehensible statement of the commissions functions in the main clauses to illuminate the difficult text of schedule and we have already discussed that <e> <s> however there are problems from a drafting point of view in framing a provision which duplicates what is already provided for elsewhere in the bill and the question of what to say in the body of the bill needs careful thought <e>", "<cs> as the noble earl lord perth said taken together these amendments would mean that the members of the historic buildings council for scotland like the chairman could in future be paid rather than just receive their expenses <e> <s> the paragraph in schedule which provides among other things that the members shall receive only their expenses is needed for technical reasons to re-enact provisions which now apply <e> <s> we are not making any changes <e> <s> the historic buildings council for scotland and the historic buildings council for wales are being left in precisely the same position as they now are <e> <s> it is perhaps worth noting that the position is the same as that which now applies to the equivalent english body the historic buildings council for england <e>", "<cs> as the noble baronesses have said these amendments attempt to widen the definition of historic buildings for which the commission may themselves make grants and towards whose acquisition by the national trust they may also grant aid <e> <s> at present they may exercise these powers only in relation to buildings of outstanding architectural or historic interest <e> <s> this is a policy which was set in the historic buildings and ancient monuments act which deals with the secretary of states powers and we have deliberately followed them here for the commission <e> <s> substituting the world special would widen considerably the scope for making grants and as the noble baroness has said that is the intention although they have both been at pains to say it would be in exceptional cases <e>", "<cs> they are already graded <e>", "<cs> i am indeed sympathetic to what my noble friend is saying although i must be careful of how i choose my words or he will be twisting my arm again <e> <s> we had an interesting discussion about designed landscapes when my noble friend lord montagu was kind enough to define them for me <e> <s> with the added words we have i must say that i am in a muddle as to whether a garden or a park is a designed landscape or what the definition is <e> <s> i also was rather sorry that my noble friend did not go on to refer to arboricultural and silvicultural because i was interested to know what exactly the commission were going to let themselves in for if they took on this apect <e> <s> there is a clear danger here of spreading the commissions functions wider than their resources can support <e> <s> the committee should consider this when thinking of giving these added responsibilities to them <e>", "<cs> i am afraid my noble friend is slightly ahead of me because i do not have my copy of <e>", "<cs> may i quickly come back <e> <s> i apologise to the committee for not having at my fingertips what i said last time <e> <s> this amendment goes further than the question of research <e> <s> it seeks to empower the commission to make grants to any public authority which has care of monuments or historic buildings <e> <s> the grant-making powers that it suggests are far too widely drawn to the extent that every public authority would be eligible for grant and indeed that grant could as the amendment is drafted cover any expenditure of the public authority not just that on monuments or historic buildings <e> <s> the commission will have wide powers to make grants in relation to this main purpose <e> <s> it is for this reason that we preferred the earlier amendment to the latter one <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness says this amendment seeks to widen a rather narrow category of objects which may be acquired by the commission to improve the historical completeness and presentation of buildings in their ownership or under their control or management <e> <s> the government agree that historically appropriate objects are highly relevant to the overall conservation of the building and we are happy to accept the amendment in principle <e> <s> however i should prefer not to commit myself to this precise form of words because it may be necessary to make some small word changes to improve the construction of a subsection <e> <s> therefore i would ask the noble baroness if she would withdraw the amendment on the basis that we will incorporate this principle in an amendment put forward at a later stage <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond and that may help the noble baroness she can read it on another occasion <e> <s> this amendment seeks to widen the categories of buildings for which the commission would be empowered to acquire objects from their own buildings or those of the national trust to any buildings owned by a wide variety of bodies including local authorities and the national museums and galleries <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness said this amendment is addressed to a fundamental aspect of the relationship between the commission and central government <e> <s> it seeks to give the commission complete freedom to acquire historic buildings and their contents as they see fit without reference to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the noble baronesss second point and i will have a look at it <e> <s> as she rightly appreciated i was talking entirely about the financial implications in paying the purchase price of a house <e>", "<cs> as i understand it this amendment is designed to give the commission a specific power to rescue historic houses repair or improve them or do whatever is necessary and then sell them again <e> <s> however with one small difference these activities are already provided for under subsections and of the new clause to which this amendment would be an addition <e>", "<cs> i accept entirely the purpose of this amendment <e> <s> at the moment the clause which this amendment seeks to amend will only allow the commission to grant-aid compulsory acquisitions by local authorities of historic buildings in need of repair <e> <s> the secretary of states present powers enable him also to grant-aid local authority acquisitions made under section of the town and country planning act <e> <s> this allows local authorities to acquire any building of special historic or architectural interest <e> <s> following the general policy of transferring to the commission existing grant-making powers the government intend to put down an amendment to make the commissions powers the same <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that the noble baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment <e>", "<cs> the powers conferred by this amendment which the noble baroness explained to us are wide ones which would enable the commission to play a leading role in organising partnership schemes with a wide range of bodies or persons for the conservation of historic buildings and areas <e>", "<cs> of course i can give that undertaking to the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran and i will bear in mind what he has said <e> <s> the noble lord may have been in the chamber when it was said that my right honourable friend the secretary of state has offered to iron out with the british academy the various points it wishes to raise <e> <s> in response to the noble baroness lady birk i thought she was really making a case for including this matter in clause <e> <s> can we look at that point too <e>", "<cs> the government fully intend that the commission should fulfil the role which this amendment would give it <e> <s> the government will need the expert advice of the commission on capital transfer tax matters and specifically on whether buildings land or objects fall within the scope of the exemptions given by the finance act to property of historic interest we made this quite clear in <e>", "<cs> we have taken the opportunity to reconsider this question and the noble baroness will be pleased to hear that we can agree with her view <e>", "<cs> the amendment which my noble friend described would require the commission and the scottish and welsh historic buildings councils to prepare lists of gardens on an advisory basis <e> <s> such a procedure would potentially form a distraction to the new commission in its early years from what the government see and i believe the committee see as its major tasks <e> <s> in particular the government would not want to see anything slow up the programme of the accelerated listing re-survey which is now getting well into its stride <e>", "<cs> speaking personally i am very much in favour of what has been said because i am a great admirer of gardens too <e> <s> i will take this back to see whether i can obtain agreement to what the committee so obviously wants to do <e> <s> however i must once again emphasise that the work we are considering now falls outside the basic remit in respect of ancient monuments and buildings <e> <s> but having said that and knowing the feelings of the committee particularly on design landscape as well as on gardens i shall certainly have another look at this matter <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> the government are aware and i hope that they have been seen to be increasingly conscious that many heritage interests express concern about the quality of conservation work carried out on the government estate <e> <s> apart from the obvious point that resources are always limited a good deal of this concern we believe is misplaced <e> <s> so far as they are able the psa and other government departments seek to take care of their historic property and much good work is done <e> <s> i was rather hoping that perhaps the final curtain might be unveiled from our own frontage on our way in today so that we could see the superb work which they have done on that particular front <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kennet is entirely right the two amendments are both designed to remove the requirement for the commission to seek the secretary of states consent when entering into an agreement with the appropriate church authorities to acquire and preserve a redundant church or land previously annexed or belonging to it <e>", "<cs> with tremendous efficiency i have a little note here but i cannot read it so i shall write to my noble friend <e>", "<cs> yes i shall certainly look at it but as i think i have made clear there is capital involved <e> <s> that is the theme throughout the bill where the consent of the secretary of state is included <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord rennet said this amendment seeks to define the term the setting of a listed building in relation to the requirements on local authorities to publicise applications for planning permission which they consider would affect the setting of a listed building <e> <s> the amendment restricts the new definition to grade i listed buildings but as a totally new departure extends the publicity requirements to all scheduled ancient monuments <e> <s> i am not sure that that is what the noble lord intended <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly be prepared to look at anything that the noble lord puts up again and consult in the meantime <e>", "<cs> was the noble lord speaking at the same time to amendment no <e> <s> j <e>", "<cs> amendment no <e> <s> h would place a burden on local authorities by requiring them to send to the commission copies of plans and documents relating to planning applications affecting conservation areas which have to be publicised and then to allow the commission a period of days in which to consider them <e> <s> the commission would furthermore be able to extend this period at its own direction up to three months <e>", "<cs> i rest on what i said originally namely that we do not like the idea that the commission itself would under amendment no <e> <s> j require local authorities to allow them a period of days in which to consider an application with the period then being able to be extended at the commissions own direction up to three months <e> <s> i think that would be a difficult one <e> <s> we think the balance in the bill is the honest answer that the commission should be kept informed of such applications and that is why in the bill we have provided for notices to be sent to them <e> <s> as the noble lord himself said he would be going a step further and on the whole the government would seek not to do that <e>", "<cs> paragraph of schedule requires that where a local planning authority under section of the town and country planning act has to advertise a planning application which in its opinion would affect the character or appearance of a conservation area or the setting of a listed building it shall send a copy of the advertisement to the commission <e> <s> that will then enable the commission if it so desires to make representations but it does not interfere with the duty of the authority to determine the application in the light of the representations received from the commission or from other bodies <e> <s> in other words the commission is enabled to make its views known without any interference with the planning authorities duty to determine the application within eight weeks or such longer period as may be agreed with the applicant <e>", "<cs> i thought that in her remarks the noble baroness covered much that was covered earlier by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> i said that i would see what i could do for the noble lord and so of course i can keep the noble baroness informed <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord the government have proposed the approach that is set out and as can be seen from the remarks of my noble friend lord sandford there is quite a lot of backing for it <e>", "<cs> i take the points made by the noble baroness and i shall certainly look into the matter <e> <s> in this particular case i do not think that it has <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the secretary of state needs to reserve the power because there are some third parties involved in this case <e> <s> the secretary of state needs to keep his current powers because he is responsible for deciding scheduled monument consent applications <e> <s> in those circumstances it would be wrong to transfer these powers <e> <s> i always hesitate to involve myself in quango arguments but we hope that we are setting up one in the place of two <e> <s> that does not altogether not follow our policy <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness is laying stress in the wrong place <e> <s> under the second of the two new paragraphs the commission may acquire by agreement such easements or other rights as appear to it to be necessary for managing maintaining or gaining access to any monument under its ownership or guardianship <e> <s> these may be existing or new easements <e> <s> the amendment does not give the commission power to acquire easements or other rights compulsorily <e> <s> this is a right which remains the prerogative of the secretary of state although as with any proposed acquisition by him he is required by the amendment to consult his experts in the commission <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord kennet will be aware the whole problem with schedule is the amending of present legislation and not the forming of new legislation <e> <s> that is a problem and it is a very difficult one to get over <e> <s> i was rather hoping that when the noble lord heard about the vicinity of ancient monuments and knowing his predilection for beverley he might have come back and said that he liked the idea of vicinity in this particular case <e> <s> however i take the noble lords point and hope that what i have said has clarified the matter <e> <s> had i realised that there was not a note on the clause i should have read out the full amendment earlier <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble baroness is seeing things which do not exist <e> <s> this amendment enables limited owners of land to grant certain rights <e>", "<cs> yes shall i go through it <e> <s> paragraph of schedule amends section of the act which deals with public access to monuments in public control <e> <s> sub-paragraph provides that regulations made by the secretary of state or a local authority to regulate public access to any or all of the monuments under their ownership or guardianship or in the secretary of states case to monuments under his control or management for any other reason may only be made under subsection rather than under the section generally <e> <s> the intention is to define more closely in this section which regulation-making power applies to which group of monuments since the powers relating to the secretary of states own monuments are different from those <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for her introduction and i too shall also address my remarks to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> these two amendments seek to make the commission guardian of all monuments currently in either the secretary of states ownership or his guardianship <e> <s> we have taken a different approach <e> <s> for the commission to be constituted guardian of monuments in the secretary of states ownership would mean that he had lost any real control over that monument <e> <s> it would not be right that the secretary of state should do so in respect of crown land <e> <s> there are alternative methods of ensuring that the commission is made responsible for managing these monuments such as that we are describing in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the government will be bringing forward a suitable amendment at a later stage to cover owned monuments <e>", "<cs> i think this is coming up in another amendment so perhaps we can leave it until we reach that amendment <e>", "<cs> when the secretary of state or the commission or a local authority want to transfer the guardianship of a property between themselves it is of course right that the people most concerned should have to give their consent <e> <s> that is what is already provided the people immediately affected by the operation of the guardianship deed would have to consent <e>", "<cs> this applies to the guardianship monuments and as i tried to explain earlier these are the ones which the secretary of state does not feel he can let further out of his control and ownership <e> <s> for that reason he offers to the commission the right of virtually running them but not owning them <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is indeed making her point <e> <s> the effect of this amendment would be to enable the commission unlike a local authority to dispose of land containing an ancient monument without having to consult the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> i can understand my noble friends desire to ensure that the commission can undertake or pay for archaeological investigations in buildings as well as on land <e> <s> i fully take the point he made on behalf of the society of antiquaries <e> <s> i am happy to say that this is already provided for because the paragraph of schedule which this amends itself amends section of the ancient monuments and archaeological areas act <e> <s> the definition of land which can be found in section of that act specifically includes <e>", "<cs> would my noble friend like monument as well <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is very much that i can add to what i said earlier today on this subject <e> <s> i totally appreciate what the noble lord and the noble baroness have said because i also have to cope with schedule <e> <s> i can fully understand the problems <e> <s> these things rather tend to land on ones desk too late for one to do very much about them <e> <s> i have in the backward direction been trying to do as much as i can to get it right and i shall continue to do so <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness says this amendment would require the secretary of state to pay to the commission the sums agreed by parliament whether or not in the event they needed them <e> <s> this would to some extent go against the established procedures <e>", "<cs> this group of amendments addresses the question of exactly how the commissions grant regime will operate <e> <s> we are all agreed on the extreme importance of this issue but i think i must say at the outset that the government consider that in general it is an area in which it is difficult to legislate <e> <s> the commissions financial needs will not be set in concrete and to legislate on the detailed financial arrangements is to risk introducing an unwelcome element of rigidity which could bedevil the commission at a later stage <e>", "<cs> i am wondering whether the noble baroness lady birk intends to speak separately to amendment no <e> <s> f dealing with capital sums or whether she would like me to deal with that now <e>", "<cs> very well because i have some remarks to make about e and f <e> <s> in the meantime perhaps i might comment now on the use of the phrase substantially greater <e> <s> i feel that having as it were given quite a lot with one hand it would be fair to give just a little with the other and i think it would be difficult not to include that proviso <e> <s> i am grateful for the remarks of the noble lord lord beaumont and i hope that when people have been able to read my remarks that will make a good focus for us should there be any more points to raise on the issue on report <e>", "<cs> i fear that on this particular point i am not going to be as reasonable as perhaps the noble baroness may wish <e> <s> in the governmentss view the commissions role is largely an executive management role using the experience and expertise that it gains from that to advise others on the preservation and proper and sensitive presentation of the heritage <e> <s> i have explained to the noble baroness how the actual grant-in-aid will work during the year and from that she will have realised that there will be little possibility of investing it although of course the commission would be able to put it on deposit <e>", "<cs> a central focus for the heritage and an important voice for conservation are other complementary roles of the commission but so far as i can see none of the things that i have said nor i believe those which the noble baroness has just been suggesting predicate any need for a capital fund <e> <s> a fund surely is for major purchases of heritage property and as i have already said in this field there is the highly regarded national heritage memorial fund <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness is aware we are having a look at the taxes and i will take this into account at the same time <e>", "<cs> perhaps this amendment will give me an opportunity to put the governments side of this matter on record <e> <s> we have considered carefully in the course of discussions about the new commission whether functions in respect of royal parks and royal palaces should be included in the commissions remit <e> <s> however the government have concluded not to do so <e> <s> all buildings with the status of a royal palace are in a very real sense royal <e> <s> people regard such places as hampton court palace and the tower of london as closely connected with our national history and with the monarchy it is indeed the royal linkage with these places which makes them such attractions <e>", "<cs> i imagine it would yes <e>", "<cs> if we can just take the two different places hampton court and the tower they are in themselves two different cases because as we said when we discussed the tower of london the financing is rather difficult <e> <s> the doe as it were has a main door and therefore the armouries would be funded from a grant-in-aid which would obviously have an effect on the main door <e> <s> the armouries would not have their own collection <e> <s> we did touch on that with regard to the armouries earlier <e>", "<cs> with the leave of the committee i shall direct my remarks to both this amendment and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the position of the royal commission on historical monuments for england in relation to the new commission is a particularly difficult issue <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk has said that the broad arguments for and against the inclusion of the royal commission have been set out in both the original consultation document and in <e>", "<cs> i must have done very well <e> <s> i was told to be neutral <e>", "<cs> i have not said my noble friend should withdraw it <e> <s> i have just said that the government have not made up their minds <e>", "<cs> i should like to open by saying to the noble lord lord strabolgi that the government are not trying to do anything sinister in either this amendment or the next two amendments to which i know he is going to speak <e> <s> the object of the provision in the bill is to simplify the procedures for adding to the list of national collections in which the secretary of state may vest works of art left to the nation without any specific provision being made <e> <s> at present the secretary of state is required to seek parliaments approval by means of an affirmative resolution of each house <e> <s> the proposal would remove the requirement for the affirmative resolution and the noble lords amendment would have the effect of retaining that requirement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is concerned that lifting the requirements for the affirmative resolution procedure in relation to the proportion of works of art that may be on loan from the national gallery and the tate gallery collections at any one time in official residences and public buildings may lead to an undesirable increase in the number of such loans <e> <s> i hope if i can to reassure him in two ways <e> <s> first since the passage of the act no requests have been received from the two galleries to exceed the existing <e>", "<cs> may i say one thing to the noble lord lord beaumount <e> <s> i ought to get this correct <e> <s> it is proposed to retain the secretary of states power to vary these proportions by means of an order <e> <s> so the secretary of state would do it by means of an order <e>", "<cs> we have already talked about amendments in respect of a trading subsidiary and charitable trust and in this amendment the noble baroness is suggesting that we should give the commission exempt charity status in so far as it is a charity <e> <s> this would mean that the commission in so far as it operated or was able to operate as a charity was not subject to charity commission supervision <e> <s> it would thus be on all fours with the other trustee bodies in the bill <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the concern of the noble baroness on this issue and i confess that it is concerning me too <e> <s> the amendment raises some difficult questions in terms of the nature of the commissions position in regard to taxation issues which as the noble baroness knows we are taking under our wing <e> <s> some such matters are easier than others for example the question of relief from capital transfer tax <e>", "<cs> i think that i really ought to have rested my case on that excellent expose by the noble lord lord kennet <e> <s> these amendments might enjoy a measure of support to avoid any confusion arising between the title of this bill and the national heritage act <e> <s> the creation of a series of legislation under a generic heading is a common device and the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i shall give a threefold reply to the noble viscount <e> <s> first it has not so far been found necessary to offer any incentives or special terms to explore frontier areas <e> <s> the government would not however rule out the possibility of such incentives where this was considered necessary <e> <s> secondly under the current tax rgime fairly generous relief is available <e> <s> successful exploration and drilling <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i am aware that the industry is not satisfied with the general level of taxation of north sea oil <e> <s> extensive consultations have been under way with the united kingdom offshore operators association in recent months <e> <s> i would however draw the noble lords attention to the petrol revenue tax on exploration expenditure which on my reading of it <e> <s> seems to me to be quite generous <e> <s> i know that i can now no longer hide under the words i shall take it back to my right honourable friend but i will of course take his remarks to heart <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his kind remarks <e> <s> i am also grateful to him for the lesson which he taught me in his secondary question <e> <s> i was indeed aware of some aspects of the rockall trough but i am grateful for the further information <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely clear about the noble baronesss point but i shall certainly read it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it should be open to a wide field of people to do this which we in this country are doing and which other countries do <e>

whole <e> <s> i wish therefore to add my gratitude to my noble friend lord mottistone for giving the house the opportunity of discussing this vital subject <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i too should like to take amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> as the house will recall we discussed the substance of these amendments in committee <e> <s> i can only repeat what i said

nomination by outside bodies <e> <s> this is a point which we discussed in depth during the committee and i believe that that in the end was the committees view too <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may with leave speak again though it is report stage there are three ladies on the british museum board one on the imperial war museum one on the national gallery two on the national portrait gallery one on the tate gallery one on the wallace collection one on the british library and two on the museum of london <e> <s> the only one which has a zero against it on my list is the national maritime museum

"<cs> my lords i think it was the noble lord lord donaldson if not it was certainly one of his colleagues on the back-bench there who in committee told me that i was carrying out a task that was impossible and that i could not please everybody <e> <s> i am therefore delighted with the view now taken by my noble friend lord renton <e>", "<cs> my lords the bill gives the board power to appoint its director subject to the approval of the prime minister <e> <s> the government believe this to be a modest but essential safeguard of the public interest and one which is found in the arrangements

the noble lord lord jenkins may be concerned to ensure that the board of the v and a is not impeded in its choice of candidate by any political considerations presented by the government of the day

enabling me to place on record the governments thinking about the term of appointment for each subsequent director <e> <s> it is indeed our intention that the board should be able if it so chooses to offer future directors appointments for a fixed term <e> <s> precise details concerning the length of the appointment will be matters for consideration in consultation with the board and the terms and conditions of service will be subject to government approval under paragraph of schedule <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment deals with what we hope will be the hypothetical question of what should happen if someone refuses an offer of a job by the trustees <e> <s> of course we very much hope that there will be no such refusals <e> <s> i have already explained at committee stage that the intention is that the staff of the trustee institutions should be treated for all practical purposes as if they were civil servants <e> <s> it is therefore difficult to envisage that many people will have reasonable grounds for wishing to refuse an offer <e> <s> we would not wish to incorporate into the bill a clause which might deal with a non-problem <e> <s> if the government were to accept the amendment this might lead to problems <e> <s> the introduction of new trustee bodies might prompt some people to look round to see whether a better job was available <e> <s> if they found one they would as now need to resign <e> <s> they might therefore have to refuse the trustees offer but there would of course be no case for compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords if the house will permit me to speak twice i will of course undertake to have a look at what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did indeed co-sponsor a similar amendment at committee stage <e> <s> he was concerned at that point to ensure that machinery existed for settling disputes before an employee had been dismissed <e> <s> i did undertake to look at the matter again in the light of the debate and i wrote to the noble baroness lady birk about it <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will respond to the noble baroness <e> <s> i see that my noble friend lord renton is sitting on the woolsack at the moment and i hesitate to say that anything can be put on the face of the bill in this way <e> <s> i cannot honestly say to the noble baroness that i think <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendments which i am proposing relate to four different parts of the bill which is the reason for so many numbers <e> <s> these amendments do two things <e> <s> first they honour our commitment to my noble friend lord montagu to consider stipulating the mininum size of the quorum for each board of trustees <e> <s> we remain of the view that the determination of the quorum above a minimum should be a matter for the boards and future variations should not necessitate amending legislation <e> <s> however we accept the main merits of setting a minimum quorum in each case to ensure proper representation at meetings <e> <s> accordingly we propose that a minimum of four be set as the quorum in the case of the three larger institutions and a minimum of three in the case of the armouries <e> <s> the later amendments which need a lot of paper provide revised financial arrangements for the victoria and albert and science museums <e> <s> i have previously explained to the house that the government intend that the two museums should be financed by means of separate votes <e>", "<cs> my lords the government listened with great care to the contributions to this debate on a similar amendment moved at committee stage <e> <s> since then we have looked at the matter again in detail not just in relation to the amendment proposed but as to the principle involved and also as to the options offered in discussion such as honoraria rather than remuneration and the possibility that only the chairman should be remunerated <e> <s> the most important objection to my noble friends amendment is that the proposal to remunerate trustees would offend the well-tried law of equity which does not permit of a trustee being allowed anything by way of remuneration <e> <s> the alternatives we discussed will not withstand close scrutiny <e> <s> for example to offer an honorarium would preclude trustees and committee members claiming loss of earnings and to remunerate chairmen only which i notice has not been suggested today we believe would be inequitable particularly as <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord lord jenkins is seeking to do to lay the responsibility for determining any allowances for trustees at the door of the minister for the arts instead of that of the secretary of state <e> <s> my right honourable friend the minister although very much alive and kicking lacks the legal capacity for the purposes intended by the noble lord <e> <s> the functions exercised by him are functions of the secretary of state <e> <s> in practice since he exercises the functions of the secretary of state in this field the minister for the arts will be responsible for determining the level of allowances subject to the treasurys approval <e> <s> the effect of the noble lords amendments in this particular aspect will be covered <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house because this is the report stage and not a debating stage i point out to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney that it is enshrined in legislation that the secretary of state shall cover all secretaries of state and in this particular case as the minister for the arts has no as it were legal standing in legislation it is the secretary of state who must apply in this legislation <e> <s> it may be unsatisfactory to the noble lord it may be unsatisfactory for us all but it concerns a different part of the legislation which we cannot change tonight in this particular bill <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord beaumont of whitley anticipated the government are sympathetic to the objectives behind these amendments <e> <s> the matter was raised in committee and i am grateful to the noble lord and other noble lords for tabling these amendments again <e> <s> we are pleased to accept the principle underlying them but we should like to consider the precise drafting and whether some slight further amendment is necessary <e> <s> it might be for the convenience of the noble lord lord beaumont to press his amendment and if we find further slight amendments necessary we ourselves will move them <e>", "<cs> my lords with the permission of the house i too will speak to amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> i appreciate the concern lying behind the amendments moved by the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i appreciate the wishes of the noble lord lord montagu and the noble lord lord strabolgi to ensure that objects which the v and a no longer require for their own collection and which meet the strict criteria for disposal under clause should go to institutions which will look after them in the publics best interest <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill to preclude the board of the v and a from doing that or indeed any of the other boards established by the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may briefly add to what i said to my noble friend lord montagu of beaulieu as regards his amendment about the provincial museums i am happy to confirm that it is our aim to continue our liaison and aid provincial museums <e> <s> my noble friend will recall that the bill is drafted so as to keep the <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the desire of the noble lord lord strabolgi to ensure that transfers may take place between the board of the v and a and the trustees of the ulster museum <e> <s> i wish to reassure the house and particularly the noble lord lord donaldson and my noble friend lord eccles whose hear hear i heard that the amendment is unnecessary because the ulster museum was added to the institutions listed in schedule to the national gallery and tate gallery act by means of an order in <e> <s> the effect of that order is to read the schedule as if the ulster museum is included in it <e> <s> that being so it is unnecessary to make additional reference to it by adding it to the <e>", "<cs> fifteen all <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise the attempt of the noble lord lord strabolgi to put on an even footing all the transfer provisions contained in existing museums legislation and i have to tell the house that he was entirely right in the examples he gave <e> <s> but unfortunately his amendment would widen the scope of the bill considerably and for that reason alone it is difficult for the government to consider it <e> <s> it would we believe be necessary to amend or repeal the related provisions in the existing legislation to which he referred and that would be an exercise of complexity and might even require a separate piece of legislation <e>", "<cs> my lords an amendment of the kind presented by the noble lord lord jenkins would be an invitation to any country or interest group to seek the return of any cultural object of which it can claim to be the country of origin <e> <s> i had the opportunity to explain to the house on th february last that in the governments view there is no case for amendments to legislation intended to facilitate the dispersal of our great national collections <e> <s> it is not a question of return or restitution but of whether one takes a narrow or broad view of a world cultural inheritance <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness and my noble friend lord montagu have said these amendments provide either that the prime minister shall appoint the chairman or that the prime minister shall appoint the first chairman but only appoint subsequent chairmen after consultation with the trustees <e> <s> at committee we discussed the question of prime ministerial involvement in appointments and on a division the committee showed themselves in favour of leaving appointments at the armouries in the hands of the secretary of state for the environment <e> <s> under both these amendments the secretary of state will appoint the majority of the trustees <e> <s> i can see no good reason why he should not appoint the chairman <e> <s> the government continue to believe that the arrangements adopted in the bill are the best <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> this is report <e>", "<cs> no my noble friend cannot answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for giving me this opportunity and for introducing his amendment in such a mild manner <e> <s> very seldom has such a short amendment been about to get such a large response <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i will respond to a couple of points <e> <s> first i should like to thank the noble lords who welcomed my statement <e> <s> the noble baroness lady birk concentrated her remarks mainly on vat <e> <s> i would like to underline again that the fund is exempt from income and corporation tax on income arising out of activities relating to its main purposes from capital gains tax from development land tax from national insurance surcharge and from stamp duties on sales or transfers to the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be permitted to respond a third time your lordships will see the danger of letting matters go on <e> <s> in reply to my noble friend lord strathcona and mount royal the advice i have is firm and it is that tax amendments are appropriate to a finance bill and this is rather more a problem of getting it ready in time <e> <s> if this device proves to be in any way faulty i will see what we can do about bringing these forward more quickly <e> <s> to the noble earl lord perth yes that is what i said <e> <s> to the noble lord lord hayter who asked whether the bill should stand as it is now we have only just completed our negotiations with both the treasury and the inland revenue on this question and i am sure we shall be looking at the bill to see what now needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran can produce no expertise on this subject <e> <s> the government have from the start recognised that archaeology should be one of the subjects on this list of areas of knowledge and expertise and it is fundamental to many of the commissions functions <e> <s> however i do not believe that we ought to go on from there and break it down into its component parts <e> <s> in general as lord renton said appending lists of specified types would tend to narrow the definition rather than widen it <e> <s> although i cannot pretend to be a great expert it seems to me that there is a great danger that we may exclude things that we want to include for instance if i may give an example industrial archaeology <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware from discussions here in committee and elsewhere of the desire of my noble friend to involve local authorities in the work of the commission to establish good relations between them from the start and as a symbol of this to include local government in this list of qualities <e> <s> local authorities will of course continue to have an important and valuable role to play in the presentation of the heritage <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in committee the government see a distinction between the situation of the trustee museums and of the commission <e> <s> for the trustee museums there is the close link with existing trustee museums which makes it appropriate that their staff continue in the civil service scheme <e> <s> however the commission as an executive agency will need freedom to operate in what it sees as a most efficient way <e> <s> in particular the commission will need flexibility in its staffing arrangements <e> <s> staying within the principal civil service pension scheme we do not think provides that flexibility <e>", "<cs> my lords to pick up my noble friends last words to work in the way it wants to we do not at the moment know how it would want to work <e> <s> this is the basic position we feel here <e> <s> the question of whether the commission should be statutorily required to set up advisory committes rather than given discretion to do so was discussed extensively in committee <e> <s> this amendment seeks to provide a compromise in that it would require the commission to set up at least two committees but would leave discretion on how many more it might set up <e>", "<cs> my lords as the commission have discretion whether to set up advisory committees the power to set up a committee with a particular membership is rather unnecessary and would in any case <e> <s> have no effect as they would be able to decide not to set up such a committee <e> <s> but even if the establishment of such a committee were intended to he mandatory i do not think as i said when replying to the previous amendment <e> <s> that we are on the right course <e> <s> a committee with the membership proposed would be more or less reconstituting the nominated members of the ancient monuments board for england and i believe that the only body with any standing which would be omitted would be the royal commission on historical monuments <e> <s> that shows the dangers of trying to establish sub-committees of this nature <e>", "<cs> my lords while i recognise that there are well-established organisations and as the noble baroness says we are trying to establish others which operate on the basis of delegating functions to committees we do not believe the concept is always appropriate <e> <s> we think it would be inappropriate here <e> <s> there are two vital requirements for the commission without which it will not be a success it must have strong and sound management and it must have access to the right range of expert advice <e> <s> in the governments view those two essential requirements are met by the bill as it stands strong management and access to specialist advice <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment is designed to encourage and so far as is practicable ensure the recruitment and training of skilled conser <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps this will be an opportunity for me to respond to amendment no <e> <s> a <e> <s> this amendment as the noble lord lord kennet put it raises a point about the purpose of a commission <e> <s> by formally giving a primary role to the commissions duty to secure preservation and conservation and perhaps i can come back to the words later the amendment runs the risk of relegating to secondary importance the promotion of the publics understanding and enjoyment of this part of the heritage <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kennet said this is a matter of judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment seeks to underline the need for the commission to build up good relations with other bodies which have interests in their field of responsibility <e> <s> the commission will not be able to carry out their duty of preservation without consulting and co-operating with others and the power to enter into agreements is much better left in the unfettered form shown in the governments own amendment <e> <s> my noble friend lord sandford wishes to put this as it were in the functions that is subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think it is the governments view that it would be right to make the recording function one of the main duties <e> <s> paragraph <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i believe the house will agree that the two words are synonymous and that obviously we should stick to one throughout the bill <e> <s> we will look at the matter and come back to it again <e>", "<cs> my lords the point is that in her earlier remarks the noble baroness said that the word preservation was used in some parts of the bill and the word conservation in others <e> <s> this had me slightly surprised and my answer is that they are synonymous and that therefore it is unnecessary to use both terms throughout the bill one should be there but not both <e>", "<cs> my lords i was looking around the house to sense what your lordships actually felt about this matter because i am very open-minded <e> <s> i will say to the noble baroness lady white that i looked up these words in the dictionary and she will be delighted to hear that for the word conservation the dictionary said that it meant to keep from decay <e> <s> that is the sort of trouble we are in <e> <s> i will indeed look at it again <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as my noble friend is concerned i have of course the same proviso about this amendment as i mentioned before that i would not wish nor would the government wish to see it in clause <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i can explain the governments thinking here <e> <s> as far as the archaeological areas are concerned the noble baroness has drawn the attention of the house to subsection which contains a definition of an ancient monument which covers as the house will see a vast number of things including an archaeological area <e> <s> obviously we would prefer to leave it where it is so that when one reads clause <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment brings forward a concept which we aired in committee that the commission should be more widely concerned in providing for the presentation of monuments to the public and for the provision of educational facilities rather than education <e> <s> may i say to my noble friend that i think the amendment in one way goes too far and in another way not far enough and i am not sure he was not critical about my own amendment for the same reason <e>", "<cs> my lords before anyone else takes away the points that i have listed in front of me my noble friend lord sandford mentioned half of my reasons when he moved his amendment and my noble friend lord geoffrey-lloyd has just made the other point that i have in front of me i should like to make a few comments <e> <s> their powers to provide information to advise any person and to do such things as they think necessary or expedient for the purpose of exercising their functions are more than sufficient to enable them to promote or undertake publicity <e> <s> as to drawing the commissions attention to this part of the work as my noble friend lord sandford says their duty to promote the publics enjoyment and knowledge seems to be very clear <e> <s> with that understanding i hope that i have helped my noble friend and that he will feel the point has been adequately covered <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as my noble friends comment about the finance bill is concerned i will look into the point but as i understand it some of the tax amendments that we are putting forward or are considering would only be practical in a finance bill <e> <s> however i quite take my noble friends point there may be other matters which we could co-opt into the bill and i shall indeed look into it <e>", "<cs> my lords to some extent indeed we covered this ground when i spoke to the amendments of the noble baroness lady birk amendments no <e> <s> a b and particularly amendment no <e> <s> c <e> <s> as we have heard this amendment seeks to empower the commission to establish committees to discharge functions of the commission <e> <s> it generally covers the same ground as we discussed in relation to amendment no <e> <s> c although with precautionary provisions <e> <s> as i said then in the governments view we have set up the committees so that they look after first strong management by the board and then access to specialist advice through committees <e> <s> we believe that the committees should have an advisory role and should stop short of actually delegating functions <e> <s> we said at that stage that it was entirely up to the commission how they set up their committees and we believe that they would wish to have advisory ones and should not be bound by having to have statutory ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have understood my noble friend correctly <e> <s> this amendment seeks to enable the commission to employ other bodies to provide for the presentation of their monuments including publicity and educational facilities <e> <s> if so i can assure my noble friend that the power to do this is fully covered by the commissions powers to enter into contracts and other agreements <e> <s> nothing further is required <e> <s> in fact this amendment would go further than this in that it would empower the commission to pay for the presentation and promotion of the monuments outside their control and this the government think would be going too far <e> <s> once again as with other amendments of my noble friend to amendment no <e> <s> may i look at all the details of what he said and again come back to him if i find that we have not covered the points he has made <e>", "<cs> what has that to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not intended to reply as i do not have much to add but my noble friend has stung me to answer <e> <s> first i should like to say that in my opening remarks i said that the advisory role of the commission would be totally there in order to support the royal palaces <e> <s> but my noble friend then mentioned winston churchill and suggested what winston churchill would have thought about this <e> <s> i think that winston churchill would have been horrified at the idea of the royal palaces being put into a commission <e> <s> i may be quite wrong but winston churchill had a great sense of history and history is in being royal and as such i think that they should be treated separately <e> <s> i cannot say whether the historic buildings council and the ancient monuments board thought that when this new commission was set up they would have control of the royal palaces and i have to leave it to the house to decide <e> <s> but i should be very surprised if that were one of their ambitions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for the kind things they have said <e> <s> with regard to the comments made by the noble lord lord kennet about the form of publication i do not have the exact words before me but so far as i know there is no change on the statement i made at committee stage <e> <s> however i will make sure that we give a full statement at third reading which will spell it out quite clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord has explained this amendment is designed to ensure that access conditions for disabled people are imposed by the commission when making historic building grants for general public access with conditions attached to them <e> <s> i think there is a very real problem in seeking to do this <e> <s> although public access to historic buildings is something which should be looked for and encouraged by the commission the scope for special provision for disabled or any other persons is very limited <e> <s> preservation of the past does not allow the historic fabric to be altered to provide special facilities <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may clarify the point <e> <s> the amendment moved is amendment no <e> <s> which is my amendment <e> <s> the noble duke will have to wait until his amendment is called <e>", "<cs> my lords very briefly perhaps i may just run through again what i think this amendment includes because it seemed to me that we had covered virtually everything <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> using the words <e>", "<cs> my lords when we discussed this idea at committee stage i said that with one difference the activities provided for by this amendment acquiring repairing improving and reselling historic houses were already provided for under section a of the act <e> <s> that difference was the need to get the secretary of states consent to acquisition <e> <s> as we have heard from my noble friend amendment no <e> <s> takes this on board and makes acquisition for the revolving fund subject to such consent <e>", "<cs> my lords since we discussed a very similar amendment to this one at the committee stage i have had the opportunity to reconsider the question of whether or not the commission should have specific powers to organise partnership schemes with a wide range of bodies or persons for the conservation of historic buildings and areas <e> <s> i have to say that despite the arguments advanced then and now i do not believe that these powers are really necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords we had a good discussion in committee on the principle which underlies this amendment and it is clear from the redrafting as the noble baroness says that some of the points made in that discussion have indeed been taken <e> <s> i have to say however that the government remain of the opinion that a power of this sort could be counter-productive <e> <s> as i said before we believe it would be far better for the commission to proceed by advice and persuasion being seen to be reasonable and responsible while still pressing the conservation case <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord says this amendment attempts to set out in detail part of the advisory role of the commission <e> <s> this role is a vital one and i can assure the house that the commission will have all the necessary powers to undertake it successfully <e> <s> i hope i can persuade the noble lord lord kennet that the amendment is in large part unnecessary <e> <s> the new clause which we have already discussed gives the commission the widest possible advisory powers <e> <s> under it they may give advice to any person in relation to historic buildings and ancient monuments situated in england whether or not they have been consulted <e> <s> they also have a specific power to advise the secretary of state on any of his functions under the act and the act <e> <s> so clearly they have the power to offer advice on applications for listed building consent and scheduled monument consent among a wide range of other matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that it is intended that an amendment will be made to existing regulations to ensure that the commission are informed of all listed building consent applications <e>", "<cs> my lords the first amendment moved by the noble baroness amendment no <e> <s> seeks to widen the category of planning applications which have to be publicised to include those which would affect the setting of a scheduled monument as well as those which would affect the setting of a listed building <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> does the noble lord think that this will make any difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i have got slightly out of phase because i thought that the noble baroness lady david spoke to <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that since we discussed these matters in committee some redrafting <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would change the basis of the present system for determining listed building consent applications <e> <s> as the noble baroness said currently these are the province of local authorities with a right of appeal to the secretary of state who may also call in important cases for his <e>", "<cs> my lords i have sympathy with my noble friends reasons for moving this amendment <e> <s> the amendment would enable the commission as well as local authorities to serve building preservation notices <e> <s> as has been explained these are notices which prevent private owners of buildings from undertaking any works without consent for six months or until the secretary of state has decided whether to list the building in question <e> <s> the government consider that it would be inappropriate for an appointed body such as the commission to exercise powers which impose restrictions on the right of private property owners <e> <s> such functions are only properly exercised by elected representatives <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble baroness describes this amendment attempts to provide for any member of the committee to be remunerated who is involved in advising the commission on the exercise of its powers <e> <s> the house will be aware that we are not in favour of remunerating members of the commissions advisory committee and i do not believe there is any <e>", "<cs> my lords with the agreement of the noble baroness i will direct my remarks backwards to amendment as well as to no <e> <s> <e> <s> i must confess that when i read them these amendments made me pause for a considerable time because the noble baroness has been castigating me somewhat for not trusting the commission <e> <s> but as i understand these two amendments they would indicate first that the commission is not to be trusted to undertake any works to buildings or monuments in its ownership without the consent of the secretary of state and secondly that comments or criticisms from local authorities and a wide range of amenity bodies made to the secretary of state are required if the commission is to operate effectively and that the commission cannot be trusted to listen to any comments without a statutory provision <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may i should like to speak first to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> these three amendments seek to extend the powers to control public access under section of the ancient monuments and archaeological areas act to monuments under the commissions management <e> <s> the noble baroness will be pleased to hear that we have no quarrel with the principle of the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been the governments intention that the commission should take over the day-to-day management of the monuments in the care of the secretary of state <e> <s> we stated it in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid i am still in the position of having no firm government view to give to the house regarding the future position of the royal commission on historical monuments <e> <s> as my noble friend lord montagu would say i am still throwing the hot potato up in the air and i am trying not to catch it <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house as i understand it it would continue in its present form <e> <s> of course i appreciate the concern of the noble baroness lady birk and i actually had runners standing by right up to oclock this evening in case i could get a decision but at the moment i do not have it <e> <s> and until i do there is very little more i can add <e>", "<cs> my lords the power of the commission in new clause to do such things as it considers necessary or expedient covers the question of voluntary contributions and also the receipt of donations <e> <s> voluntary contributions which will not count against the grant-in-aid are likely to be aimed at specific projects rather than given for general purposes and to the extent that the commission receives other income that too will be expected to be used rather than saved <e> <s> the establishment and use of a capital fund we are not encouraging in this case <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i can give my noble friend that assurance <e> <s> the powers of the secretary of state to pay grant are of course covered in clause <e> <s> the government have made it clear in <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend gave me three options <e> <s> of course i could accept any of them but unfortunately they have to be accepted by my colleagues as well so i must be careful <e> <s> i think that the best i can say to my noble friend is that i shall of course undertake to make a statement on this subject on third reading with an amendment if appropriate <e> <s> my noble friend mentioned his own amendments <e> <s> personally i believe that they would both be a little short of the issue if we did so wish to include the royal commission they would fall a little short of what we would want <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened to the arguments put forward in committee by the noble lord lord strabolgi and in view of their inability at this time to make extensive revisions to schedule to the national gallery and tate gallery act the government recognise and accept the desirability of preserving the procedure of the act <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord lord strabolgi will understand that while the government accept his amendments in principle i should prefer to allow the draftsman the opportunity to make any consequential revisions particularly to schedule <e> <s> for this particular amendment that may seem rather hard work but it is really because of amendment no <e> <s> to which i am to make the same kind of response that i feel that i should like the draftsman to have another look at the matter so as to move our own government amendment at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for his introduction to this amendment <e> <s> the government are in sympathy with the objective of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> however we cannot accept his amendment outright <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed lord strabolgis amendment on face value is very reasonable and it is difficult to see as he says why the provisions in the british museum act do not <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have said to the house on a number of occasions both now and at committee stage that there have been wide discussions with the staff and with the unions <e> <s> recently there have been some press reports <e> <s> the government have inquired into these and i should like to reassure the house that the claims of staff support for the petition appear to be unsubstantiated <e> <s> the directors have held meetings with their staff and have been unable to trace the source of the petition <e> <s> the staff have assured the directors of their support given the undertaking that the bill is based in broadly its present form including staff safeguards <e> <s> i can see no point in a secret ballot <e> <s> the government cannot accept the amendment as it stands which would also effectively subjugate the wishes of parliament <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will not wish to press it <e>", "<cs> i do not think i can go quite that far <e> <s> as the noble lord lord jenkins is well aware we had some discussion on earlier amendments about the no-worsening situation whereby civil servants at the museums can have a no-worsening clause built into their contracts which as far as i know they themselves welcome too <e>", "<cs> moved amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the reason why local authorities do this is unnecessary because of course the government are elected with a responsibility for maintaining national security <e> <s> so far as civil defence is concerned the government indeed appreciate the work done in civil defence and give all encouragement to the excellent work that it does for the civil population in any emergency <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed the government are aware of and share the disgust at nuclear weapons but as the noble lord is equally aware we do not take the path of unilateral disarmament but rather that of multilateral disarmament <e> <s> so far as the last part of the noble lords question is concerned i would refer him to the responses yesterday of my noble friend lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords an up-to-date list of those who have informed the government is kept at the ministry of defence <e> <s> its circulation i am not aware of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to be able to tell the noble lord that the sea seems to cover more of the earths surface than does the land and fortunately these objects have a habit of falling into the sea <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute to the civil defence in the noble lords area and to wish it all good fortune <e>", "<cs> my lords the actual number which have informed the government is i believe <e> <s> i know that there is press speculation on the total varying between and who have portrayed this to the press <e> <s> the noble lord exaggerated when he suggested that the figure represented four-fifths of the population <e> <s> normally local authorities are elected by less than half of the population of their areas and these particular edicts represent the views of only a percentage of those who have voted <e> <s> the noble lord might like to look at some recent opinion polls which show that the unilateralist cause has slightly subsided <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords my noble friend has a very good point there <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a free country and if that is the county councils wish it should do so <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my opening remarks the government are elected with a responsibility for maintaining national security and it is upon them that responsibility rests <e>", "<cs> my lords central government have for a long time had responsibility for defence <e> <s> that has applied not only to the present government but to previous governments and i should like to remind the house that a previous government supported an independent deterrent as do we <e>", "<cs> my lords i tried to bring out that point in an earlier reply <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware we all indeed can <e> <s> we respect it but will the enemy <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that as a result of <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> during the period from to however it was very disappointing <e> <s> in the total of that period it was less than per cent <e> <s> however as my noble friend rightly says it has improved remarkably in to the figure of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords we all of course welcome the noble lord lord ezra here although on this side of the house and no doubt immediately opposite we are disappointed that he is going to be seated to the side of us <e> <s> however we welcome him just the same <e> <s> so far as a successor is concerned i am sure that the house will not wish me to comment on newspaper reports which appeared over the weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed we should like to do exactly that and i think i should say in answer <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what my noble friend has said and in the same breath i should like also to associate the name of the noble lord lord gormley with the <e>", "<cs> my lords to date neither british forces nor so far as we are aware those of other north atlantic treaty member forces have exercised with the united states rapid deployment force <e> <s> however we would not wish to exclude the possibility of such exercises taking place in the future <e> <s> neither britain nor so far as we know other nato member nations are proposing to participate in discussions of the kind described in the question <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed at the moment studies of the impact of the rdf on nato planning are themselves taking place so there are no decisions at that level being made at the moment <e> <s> of course i shall bear in mind what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree entirely that the rdf is a case for the united states of america indeed it is their force i believe we can offer some encouragement to those countries although we shall not lead them astray by saying that we can produce a force of this sort of magnitude <e>", "<cs> my lords an exhibition of british defence equipment on hoard the commercial ferry viking venturer will visit qatar bahrain saudi arabia kuwait abu dhabi dubai jordan and egypt between th february and th march <e> <s> some british defence manufacturers are taking part in the exhibition which is designed to display a wide range of military equipment to a number of friendly countries in the middle east <e>", "<cs> yes my lords indeed it is the intention to collect the costs for this on board operation from the companies concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not putting any such interpretation on the question of the noble lord lord molloy whose supplementary i thought was perfectly within the bounds <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given a list of the countries to which this sales group is going <e> <s> as a <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall avoid the noble lords question by saying that neither was in the list that i gave at the beginning <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot do more for the noble lord than to amplify my previous answer that we consider that the sale of defence equipment and i underline the word defence to friendly countries brings important benefits to this country <e> <s> but every proposal and i mean every proposal is carefully considered in whitehall on its individual merits <e>", "<cs> my lords they fail to give a licence for the export of those goods and i can give examples of where this has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we are going slightly wide of the mark on this question <e> <s> personally i believe that what we are doing is an exceptionally good exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends intervention <e> <s> i should like to underline again the word defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the ministries as well as the commercial attaches concerned will very much bear in mind what the noble lord has said and see how successful this particular venture is <e>", "<cs> my lords i can see a lot of question marks about the noble lords question <e> <s> to start with who are they <e> <s> but even more difficult as we have discovered fairly often in latter years the noble lord shakes his head if we do not do it somebody else does it anyway so an ordinance of self-denial is not altogether profitable <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat a statement which is being made in another place by my honourable friend and colleague the parliamentary under-secretary of state for energy <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lords lord bruce and lord tanlaw for their response to the statement and i will first take up some of the points raised by lord bruce <e> <s> the charter as i understand it is for this use only and it is not intended to carry on chartering this particular boat <e> <s> i know that there is no question of cegb funding this ship because as i just remarked they will use it only for this one operation which is the laying of this cable <e>", "<cs> my lords i bow to no one <e> <s> not even to the noble lord lord molloy in my wish that everybody would buy british but quite honestly there are cases where it cannot pay <e> <s> in the first part of his question the noble lord asked about inspection of the vessel <e> <s> i am sure that the cegb would not think of using the vessel unless it was up to its full requirements <e> <s> i am equally certain that the firm international transport management of middlesbrough would not accept the vessel for it to be chartered unless it met all the specifications which as the noble lord lord bruce said are very detailed <e>", "<cs> my lords with regard to the fitting out of the vessel i imagine that it will come fully fitted out in order to be chartered by the cegb that is to say international transport management will surely have the duty of doing that <e> <s> so far as the contract for the channel electricity cable project is concerned i am informed that this is expected to be the only part of it that will go overseas <e> <s> with regard to the final point made by the noble lord lord bruce we shall be perfectly happy to answer any questions on this subject <e> <s> we have nothing to hide <e>", "<cs> my lords the government take the view that the overall duty is best stated in the form shown in the bill without direct primacy being given to either leg of the duty <e> <s> the duty of preservation deliberately comes first in clause and the governments policy that preservation will be the first priority of the commission has been clearly and often stated <e> <s> the second part of the duty to promote enjoyment and advance knowledge includes promoting and advancing the knowledge of preservation <e> <s> in answer to the noble baroness i understand that this latter point has not been found by some to be very clear and we are looking to see if some improvement can be made but the sense of the provision is as i have just stated it <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may repeat the words which i used at the time <e> <s> i understand that this latter point has not been found by some to be very clear and we are looking to see if some improvement can be made but the sense of the provision is as i have just stated it <e> <s> we are looking to see if we can make some improvement to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lord sandford for his remarks and of course i shall bear in mind what he has said and draw it to the attention of the minister before the bill is taken to another place <e>", "<cs> my lords the government do not believe that the phrase educational facilities and services covers anything more than education and indeed we believe it may cover even less <e> <s> however i can see no reason why we should not use that formulation if the house so wishes and in that spirit i am happy to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend has said we did of course discuss this question on report <e> <s> afterwards the government looked very carefully at what my noble friend lord sandford had said to see if all the things he wanted to encourage and see happening were in fact covered by clause <e> <s> we concluded that the formulation we had educational facilities and services instruction and information covered just about everything <e> <s> perhaps there seems to be a feeling that because the drafting is dull what it covers will be dull as well but i have no doubt the commission will adopt the more imaginative and skilful approach to presentation which is in essence what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment would give the commission the function of making and maintaining records <e> <s> there is little doubt that such record-making will form an ancillary part of its executive functions so purely on its merits the amendment has something to commend it <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble baroness has said <e> <s> i have been following her remarks and i understand that everything she said is covered <e> <s> however of course we shall look at it again to see whether there is anything more comprehensive we can do <e> <s> we believe this is a far-reaching clause that covers everything mentioned this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i again say that i think everything my noble friend has said will be covered and if by any chance that is not so i shall of course let him know <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble baroness will not think it unkind of me if i describe this as a more restrained version of amendments <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment moved by my noble friend seeks to require the secretary of state the commission and the royal commission on historical monuments to consult together about the future of the national monuments record <e> <s> if i may like my noble friend i shall say a few words about the substance of the amendment in a moment but i am conscious that at the report stage i undertook to make a statement about the future of the royal commission as a whole on which the government had at that stage not taken a view <e> <s> with your lordships leave this amendment gives me the opportunity to make that statement <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the noble baroness lady birk has been slightly sidetracked off the amendment <e> <s> however if she would like me to undertake once again that which i have done on previous occasions and assure her that the government do wish to set up the new commission with every single advantage and will certainly make sure that they have adequate funds to have computers and the like then i reassure her on that though i think that is probably slightly wide of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords as we have heard these amendments seek to add to the items whose acquisition by the national trust can be grant-aided <e> <s> the government recognise the force of the case made that the acquisition of a building inevitably includes the land associated with it and it is right that grant should cover this too <e> <s> we shall seek to bring forward an amendment in another place which clarifies the commissions powers in this way <e> <s> my noble friends amendments go on however to extend the functions of the commission to include grant aiding the acquisition of gardens and other land by the national trust <e> <s> the government have at various stages of this bill sought to indicate that with the best will in the world the resources of a new commission will of course be limited <e> <s> the government believe that these resources should not be spread too thinly <e> <s> the acquisition of land by the national trust can at present be grant aided in appropriate circumstances by the countryside <e>", "<cs> my lords very early on i think my noble friend lord strathcona will correct me if i am wrong and i think it was actually at the committee stage i said that what exercised me in this particular question was the gap <e> <s> i said that i should like to go back and make absolutely certain that there was no gap <e> <s> my noble friend lord skelmersdale said at the report stage that there is not a gap between the two <e> <s> i can assure the house at the moment that there is no gap <e> <s> indeed as the noble lord lord winstanley has underlined there is a little bit of overlap <e> <s> i find myself in a cleft stick because my noble friend lord strathcona does not want any overlap because if there is any overlap nobody will know where to go to <e> <s> i can assure the house that we have looked at this particular case with extreme care because i fully sympathise with my noble kinsman that this is an important part of the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lord skelmersdale and i are assured that there is no gap between these gardens <e> <s> everything can be covered <e> <s> in fact there is a small overlap <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another revision of an amendment which we discussed on report <e> <s> i recognise that an attempt has been made to limit the extra burden it would place on local authorities by referring to buildings which are scheduled monuments thus excluding certain types of monument such as field monuments which i think we would all agree are less likely to be affected by local development <e> <s> however i am not sure that this really does get us any further <e>", "<cs> my lords this is another subject which we have discussed at earlier stages and about which there is clearly some disagreement <e> <s> this version has been drafted to lessen the inevitable increase in the burden of work for local authorities <e> <s> under previous versions they would have had themselves to send to the commission copies of all the plans and documents relating to planning applications which have to be publicised under this amendment they will have less paper to deal with since they are only required to send a direction to the applicant <e>", "<cs> my lords applications for listed building consent are at present determined by local <e>", "<cs> he is against it <e>", "<cs> my lords i do indeed recognise what the noble baroness described as the new approach in this amendment <e> <s> it seeks to enable the commission to make grants for works in an area as though the area had been designated a conservation area <e> <s> they would also be able to make town scheme grants where no town scheme was in operation <e> <s> what this amendment means is that where an elected local authority having considered the question had decided not to declare a conservation area or not to set up a town scheme the commission would be able effectively to overrule that decision and where they wanted to they could behave as though an area had been designated or a town scheme had been set up <e> <s> surely this would be totally wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the question raised by the amendment is i believe a constitutional one <e> <s> the statutory system of scheduled monument consents set up under the ancient monuments and archaeological areas act is designed to protect and thereby preserve scheduled monuments <e> <s> in order to achieve this the system places restrictions on the normal property rights of owners so that they are unable to undertake works affecting a scheduled monument without consent and that consent can be and often is made subject to specific conditions <e> <s> in these circumstances it is the governments view that the determination of scheduled monument consent applications should be the responsibility of a body answerable to the electorate and thus should stay with the secretary of state <e> <s> this is what the bill provides for but with a requirement on the secretary of state to consult the commission before determining any application <e> <s> i recognise that this amendment attempts to deal with this by allowing the applicant to opt for the secretary of state rather than the commission to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord did indeed draw attention to this point at report stage <e> <s> the government accepted in principle that the armouries the british museum natural history and the british library board should be added to the institutions listed in schedule to the national gallery and tate gallery act <e> <s> since report the government have made some inquiries and are still considering the extent of the consequential effects of this amendment and the next one and their position in relation to the scope of the bill <e> <s> i wrote to the noble lord at the end of last week to keep him informed and the position at the moment is that this is going to the house authorities to see whether it is within the scope of the bill <e> <s> i should like the noble lord to give us a little more time before i come back to his point about a statutory order and of course we shall bear that in mind as well <e>", "<cs> my lords in this case the case of the british museum act before reaching a decision the government wished to check whether there had been a specific reason at the time the act was passed which precluded the addition of the national gallery and tate gallery to the institutions to which the british museum could transfer objects <e> <s> we also expressed reservations about whether the scope of the bill might be extended in the manner envisaged by the noble lord lord strabolgi in his amendment <e> <s> since report we have completed our historical researches and it would appear as he correctly surmised that the omission of the national and tate galleries from section of the act was nothing more than an oversight an oversight furthermore that was very soon recognised <e> <s> as to why we have not tabled anything at this stage my answer is the same as that to the noble lords previous amendment that we are discussing this with the house authorities and we shall indeed wish to table our own amendment if everything is satisfactory in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords we have spent three days in committee and a further two days on report discussing this bill and i am very conscious that gathering around us now are others who wish to get on with the mental health amendment scotland bill <e> <s> this afternoon we discussed further amendments <e> <s> all these discussions have been very helpful and constructive and the government are grateful for the interest and trouble taken by so many noble lords in contributing to these deliberations <e>", "<cs> i do not think i would follow my noble friend fully down that path my lords <e> <s> we are having a number of talks with a number of companies on field development plans <e> <s> i would agree with him that there will be a change in the pattern of what goes on in the north sea and that is brought out to an extent in the report particularly as it were moving from the construction world to the maintenance world <e> <s> as for tax incentives we are now entering the season when there are calls for tax deductions and as my noble friend is well aware that question is being considered by my right honourable and learned friend <e>", "<cs> yes my lords and we should pay tribute to what the offshore supply office is doing in connection with that aspect <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lords point and it has been extensively discussed <e> <s> i shall indeed bear his remarks in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the double which cambridge has done of gilbert and sullivan and agatha christie <e> <s> so far as the playwrights are concerned of course the arts council does indeed support new playwrights when it can <e>", "<cs> my lords i echo the gratitude of the noble lord lord strabolgi that the royal opera house company is going to manchester <e> <s> of course a large part of the sums paid out are in fact for touring <e>", "<cs> my lords i support virtually everything that my noble friend says until he comes to the question of taxation which is a matter for my right honourable friend in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords as this question was originally put down by my noble friend lady elliot of harwood i have the figure handy in it was <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not agree with the noble lord <e> <s> the arts council takes a great deal of trouble to make sure that its money is spent across the board and when supporting even the large national companies in london we must bear in mind that the national theatre company itself has a widely drawn audience from all walks of life and helps a great deal to make the one nation policy to which we all look forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the figure for scotland which i gave to my noble friend was for the year <e> <s> the figure for the same year for wales was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks <e> <s> i should perhaps draw your lordships attention to the quite considerable number of subsidised plays which are brought up from the provincial theatres to london <e> <s> i have in mind the nuffield southampton theatre which had a play called nuts which was transferred to the whitehall theatre <e>", "<cs> yes my lords it is disappointing <e> <s> improvement in productivity this year over the same period last year was per cent <e> <s> which i think is also disappointingly low <e> <s> this was partly caused by industrial disputes and we believe it is essential that the industry resumes its past progress <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to agree with the noble lord lord davies of leek about the youthfulness now of the coalminers and about his final sentiments <e> <s> i would say to him that in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must leave the detailed planning to the national coal board <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is aware the government are investing a considerable amount in the coal board and will continue to do so <e> <s> we have confidence too in the planning of both the present chairman mr siddall and of his predecessor the noble lord lord ezra <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the two supplementary questions from the noble lord lord gormley <e> <s> firstly on the commitment in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord strabolgi will have to wait for an announcement by my right honourable friend in another place which i gather will be made quite shortly <e> <s> i am sure he will find that the person chosen will have plenty of years to run and will be a great expert in the profession <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it my honourable friend in another place in the department of the environment made a statement about this last friday which will now leave the future planning to the leicestershire county council <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what hat the noble lord is wearing <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that we have for incidents generally reported since started in with and have gradually declined since until they reached a figure of in <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble viscount as so often is ahead of me with his comparisons but i can confirm the former part of his question <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord davies of leek asks whether it can be denied <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying a little from the subject matter <e> <s> if the noble lord would like to talk about wave power i shall happily answer him <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend that that is indeed one of the factors why french electricity prices are more reasonable than our own <e> <s> i should add that the government consider that safety is of paramount importance and the nuclear industry has an excellent safety record <e> <s> the united kingdom now has a quarter of a century of safe nuclear power and in over reactors has accumulated years of experience in operating commercial nuclear power stations <e>", "<cs> no my lords it is not <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot agree with the noble lords hypothesis <e>", "<cs> my lords once again i think that we are straying a little from the subject matter and i have not tried to extrapolate the edfs finances over the past year <e>", "<cs> my lords it has indeed been a stimulating debate with many interesting points being raised and i shall try to answer some of them <e> <s> the noble lord lord lovell-davies said that when he was in my seat he did not last very long in the ministry <e> <s> may i say that in this respect i am the third one already in the present government so i too am a little nervous about how long i shall last there <e> <s> however i am happy to say that my two predecessors have gone both onwards and upwards <e> <s> i was also pleased that the noble lord was able to make his remarks more or less on a non-party basis and indeed with the exception of one or two observations the noble lord lord bishopston was similarly uncontroversial <e> <s> when going around the country i have found tremendous all-party support for energy conservation <e> <s> it is not a matter of party it is a matter which crosses all barriers <e> <s> like the noble lord lord tanlaw i too have been told how dull is the subject of energy conservation <e> <s> but i have been fascinated by it and have had quite the opposite reaction to it <e> <s> i try to pass on this feeling when i go around the country <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that if the noble lord reads back in <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall try to cope with some of the questions which have been asked <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi asked whether mr macgregor would be appointed again after three years <e> <s> i think that this is something we would have to wait for to see what sort of job he has done and where we are <e> <s> i am delighted that both the noble lord lord tanlaw and the noble lord lord strabolgi realised that it would be this side of the house which would be deciding this <e> <s> the noble lord lord strabolgi asked me about the million <e> <s> the payment for the british steel corporation is two-thirds of which is being retained until when it will be adjudged whether he has earned the full fee or not <e> <s> so far as the fee for the coal board is concerned it is an additional million million of which will be retained in trust until the end of his term <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make two points to the noble lord <e> <s> first it is not an act of provocation <e> <s> what we are looking for is the best man for the job <e> <s> secondly what we are looking for is a man for the job at the moment <e> <s> one of the points about the coal industry is that there is plenty of coal and one of the aspects that we appreciate about mr macgregor is that he is a marketing man as well as a metallurgist <e> <s> we believe that the combination of these two factors is very important at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has asked a number of questions <e> <s> i was expecting that mr macgregor would he acceptable to the sdp as i saw that he went to hillhead grammar school <e> <s> so far as the figure of is concerned for the bsc job my understanding is that that will not be paid until <e> <s> the noble lord asked about testing the market and talked about friends of the government <e> <s> the point here is that there has been quite a lot of rumour that mr macgregor might be appointed to this job <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i said earlier on in my remarks that marketing is one of the factors which made up our minds in regard to this decision <e> <s> so far as the loss of the coal board is concerned that is running at about million at the moment which as was said in the statement means that the payment of million is one days loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know the level of consultations <e> <s> we have of course had the recent ballot which the noble lord lord blyton mentioned <e> <s> so far as the board is concerned i gather that it approved <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be construed in that way <e> <s> as i said in an earlier reply both united kingdom management and the national coal board have a lot of extremely good people <e> <s> it is a question of having people available who have <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the support of my noble friend and agree with him throughout <e> <s> i believe that one of the reasons why we have to pay this sum to lazard frres is the very qualities of the man which puts him at such a high price <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may answer the last question first i am afraid that i do not know <e> <s> so far as refundability is concerned as in the case of the bsc two-thirds of the compensation is refundable on a <e>", "<cs> my lords two-thirds are kept in trust until the end of the term and if mr macgregor happens to resign becomes ill or fails to keep the appointment then on a <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord paints a scenario which i find hard to follow in my brief as it were <e> <s> so far as i know if mr macgregor continues to be chairman he will continue to get paid <e> <s> if he is no longer chairman then he will not be paid <e> <s> i am not sure from the scenario which the noble lord paints where he would be <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as the first part of the noble lords supplementary question is concerned the chairmanship of bsc will be decided by my right honourable friend the minister responsible for the industry and he will be making an announcement in due course <e> <s> so far as the noble lords latter point is concerned <e> <s> i do not know from where the noble lord gets his knowledge but according to my knowledge this is an appointment made by the cabinet with the full approval of all members <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe there is no such thing in the act <e> <s> however i hesitate to use the word vetted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite correct <e> <s> i do not know at the moment <e> <s> it is up to my right honourable friend to make the appointment of the new chairman of bsc <e>", "<cs> my lords as this is the first time that i have had the pleasure to talk to the noble lord lord ezra across the floor of the house may i say how much i welcome him here and how much we appreciate his term as chairman of the national coal board <e> <s> regarding his figures of course i would not argue with him <e> <s> as i understand it there were quite a lot of things agreed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a wide-ranging debate and i should like to thank all noble lords for their contributions <e> <s> in particular i should like to thank my noble friend lord taylor of hadfield for his excellent maiden speech <e> <s> it is an incredible achievement to have put his name to such a well-known national and international firm in such a short period as years <e> <s> i also appreciate very much his wise remarks about the electricity supply industry and judging by other noble lords contributions today they will all welcome his points about chp in particular <e> <s> we look forward to hearing his contributions a lot in the future <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their response <e> <s> i hope i may be able to persuade the noble lord lord hunt that his qualified welcome can in fact become a generous one <e> <s> the noble lord lord bishopston asked about the msc <e> <s> yes they were indeed consulted <e> <s> perhaps i might explain about the money <e> <s> the ministry of defence in common with civil employers participating in the scheme will receive a subvention from within the cost of the yts programme as a whole of approximately million if the come in in a full year <e> <s> that is to cover the cost of training and the payment of per week allowance <e> <s> given the decision of the ministry of defence to reduce food and accommodation charges some costs will be borne by the mod possibly in the nature of million as i said earlier <e>", "<cs> my lords of course this is not basically a scheme to solve unemployment <e> <s> it is a scheme of training for youth today <e> <s> it is a voluntary scheme because as i explained in an earlier answer to the noble lord lord hunt there are a number of other opportunities open to these young people which are being offered at the moment <e> <s> therefore in no way are they forced to accept this scheme <e> <s> the noble lord asked who will do the training <e> <s> the point about the vacancies is that this is a capacity which the army believe they can absorb into their present training structure <e> <s> as regards food and accommodation i said in my opening remarks that the total sum per week is out of which the army will be deducting for food and accommodation <e> <s> the volunteers will also be fully equipped and clothed by the army <e> <s> so far as a future debate is concerned there will be an instrument before the house so there will be an opportunity if anybody prays against it for a debate <e>", "<cs> my lords details of the training itself have not yet been finished <e> <s> in answer to my noble friend i think it best to say that it would depend on the capacity of the training organisations in the chosen fields when the youngsters apply and on their own aptitudes <e> <s> in the raf it may include for instance mt driving typists administrative clerks painters and finishers <e> <s> in the royal navy it is hoped to train some youngsters as communicators dental assistants or even medical assistants and in the army there is scope for training in light engineering <e> <s> so that anybody will be able to opt for training <e> <s> but of course the vacancies will be very limited in each area <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will not be surprised if i say that i disagree with many of the opinions which he has expressed <e> <s> the noble lord asked about the schemes turned down by the prime minister <e> <s> i have no knowledge of these but i read out the names of some of the other organisations which are considering a scheme <e> <s> these were listed by my honourable friend the minister of state for the treasury mr hayhoe in a written answer in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord will realise that he is going outside the scope of this statement but so far as the ministry of defence is concerned i can say that once the decision had been made they bent over backwards to make it a practical and sensible scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i rather hoped i had answered the noble lords question about pressure <e> <s> there will be no pressure and no enforcement at all <e> <s> and there will be no gratuity <e>", "<cs> there was a great deal of i believe artificial worry generated in another place about the prospect of privately-owned nuclear power stations <e> <s> these fears are unfounded as i hope your lordships will realise once i have outlined the system of licensing and the protection which exists in the united kingdom to ensure safe nuclear power <e> <s> the most important point to bear in mind is that it is not the ownership of plant which governs its safety but the comprehensive regulatory system which this country enjoys <e> <s> this has several stages which apply to all prospective operators of nuclear power stations whether in the public or private sector <e>", "<cs> this clause is primarily concerned with bringing the wording of section of the electricity scotland act into line with the terminology used in this bill <e> <s> as my noble friend noted the one significant change is to increase from kw to mw the level above which a private hydro-electric station in scotland requires the consent of the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> it also ceases to be a criterion for the purposes of consent whether the output of the station is for sale to others <e> <s> hydro-electric stations are of special significance to energy policy in scotland and particularly in the nshab area <e> <s> their development is politically sensitive and could have significant environmental implications <e> <s> moreover control over developments is required to ensure that a new scheme does not abstract water which is used to power another scheme <e>", "<cs> i think that to write to all scottish lords would be very burdensome but i will certainly write to the noble lord lord ross <e>", "<cs> if i understood the noble lord correctly this is the main purpose of the bill <e> <s> this now makes arrangements for private generators to sell to the boards <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord strabolgi supported by the noble lord lord ezra seeks further <e>", "<cs> my noble friend spelled out many ideas for the future which i am not at all sure i go along with <e> <s> the difference between the government and my noble friend relates particularly to the transmission and distribution system <e> <s> at the moment under the energy bill local authorities are able just as is a private generator now to sell their surplus supply as laid down in the bill to an electricity board <e> <s> the question is whether to go one step further and make available to local authorities something which is now available to the private generator <e> <s> i am not convinced by this argument <e> <s> if however my noble friend would like me to take it back and have another look at it i shall be willing to do so <e> <s> however i make no commitment that i shall be able to give ground <e>", "<cs> clause is an explanatory clause <e> <s> it makes clear that where any electricity board supplies electricity to a private generator under an agreement resulting from this bill its price is to be in accordance with tariffs fixed by the board in the same way as prices to consumers generally <e> <s> tariffs for elecricity supplied to any consumer are subject to the electricity act and the electricity scotland act <e> <s> these acts establish the way in which tariffs for electricity are to be framed and published and make provision for a system of consultation with consumer representatives <e> <s> they also allow for a special agreement to be made where tariffs are not appropriate to the case in question <e> <s> this will apply only where there are genuinely special circumstances <e>", "<cs> clause requires area electricity boards and scottish boards to fix tariffs for the purchase of privately generated electricity <e> <s> this will ensure that private generators will know in advance the price that they are likely to receive for their electricity <e> <s> incidentally in response to the noble lord lord tanlaw there is nothing to stop contracts from being agreed between private generators and boards for periods beyond one year the bill places no restriction on that <e>", "<cs> we are not trying to encourage or discourage we are trying to get the method right on how the local authorities should supply their electricity to the boards <e> <s> that is really the point and the argument we had earlier was about generation <e>", "<cs> i must admit to the noble lord that i did not at once see why he had tabled this particular amendment to this clause as the clause deals more with technical and safety matters <e> <s> however i should like to point out to the noble lord lord strabolgi that the presentation of supply tariffs is already dealt with in existing legislation <e> <s> under section of the electricity act supply tariffs and these will include supply tariffs for private generators must be framed so as to show the methods and principles by which the charges are to be made as well as the prices to be charged and must be published <e>", "<cs> in speaking to this amendment which proposes the insertion of the word promote the noble lord has taken us on a grand tour of the energy industry <e> <s> i think that the first sentence of my reply expresses my real feeling <e> <s> as drafted the clause gives electricity boards a clear duty to promote chp schemes <e> <s> existing statutes are designed principally around the production of electricity <e> <s> their duties in respect of associated heat are limited <e> <s> this clause removes doubt as to the attitude that the boards are to adopt in connection with schemes for the use of heat from ordinary power stations <e> <s> to their credit they have developed some of these projects on the grounds of energy efficiency and commercial sense <e>", "<cs> i knew i had been talking too much but i had not expected my remarks to be quoted back at me to that extent today <e> <s> i understand there is to be a debate on energy tomorrow <e> <s> this second amendment of the noble lord lord tanlaw i found rather intriguing <e> <s> i was wondering what he would have to say <e> <s> it would in fact require a scottish board if considering a chp scheme to apply the social criteria that applies to other expenditure <e> <s> however i presume that the noble lord meant what he has been speaking to and it is that to which i shall reply <e>", "<cs> i think that i can set my noble friends mind at rest <e> <s> the electricity consumers council already exists <e> <s> these clauses simply put it on a statutory basis and therefore put it on the same basis as other consumer councils <e> <s> we discovered when looking at the bill that the electricity consumers council was the only one that was not statutory <e> <s> all the area boards in point of fact have statutory consumer councils and it is only this body that is left out <e> <s> so that was our reason for doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> we can use it <e> <s> we are encouraging them to do it <e> <s> it is only the question of whether they can use the transmission or not <e> <s> we are encouraging them to use waste to burn waste to make electricity <e> <s> it is all in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords it is in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not objecting to it at all <e> <s> the noble lord lord shinwell is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords this is report stage <e> <s> if i may be able to reply to the noble lord with the leave of the house this point is in the bill and i think we debated it at committee stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the purpose of clause is to require meters used by a person other than an electricity board to measure the electricity he supplies to another person to be of an approved pattern <e> <s> this means a design approved by the appropriate united kingdom or european community metrological authority <e> <s> approval in the united kingdom is given by the department of energys chief electricity meter examiner on behalf of the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord ezra really wants every inch of this one <e> <s> he rightly said that i had said that this should read exactly as he wants it <e> <s> i will try to explain once more why we believe the present wording not only includes what he wishes but goes i think further <e> <s> i explained at committee that the wording of clause was deliberately chosen in order to give the boards a clear and specific duty to adopt and support schemes for chp and the use of heat generally <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should be happy to answer the noble baroness by saying that if there was any question of a price not being agreed i think the matter would go to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for him to adjudicate <e>", "<cs> my lords before replying to the noble lord lord ezra may i say a word to the noble baroness lady phillips in answer to her question on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i said to her that the secretary of state would be able to do something but may i say that in point of fact he could direct the board if it was not doing its statutory duty and that is how it would be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether with the leave of the house i might reply just very briefly to the noble lord lord tanlaw as i have not been able to speak to him before today <e> <s> first the criteria which he has mentioned are very good and i will certainly draw to the attention of the boards what he has said today but i do not think that they <e>", "<cs> my lords it has been the stated policy of successive governments to ensure that no one who is known to be a member or sympathiser of the communist party or of a fascist organisation shall be employed on work which is vital to the security of the state <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that not only can i give that assurance for the next five days but i shall be happy to give it for the next term as well <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding at present is that that will fall as some of the other legislation is falling at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i slightly lost the question asked by my noble friend on that supplementary <e> <s> however i shall read what he has said in <e>", "<cs> my lords with the advanced system of education perhaps they will soon be the same

<e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the minister for the arts has recently made some amendments to the scheme in particular to improve the position of childrens authors and those changes will also simplify the schemes administration <e> <s> i do not believe it would be appropriate to make major amendments to the scheme before we have seen it in operation for a year <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i appreciate what my noble friend is saying <e> <s> i would ask him to wait and see what the first distributions will be and on that we can judge whether or not we shall have to increase the amount <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we must wait until the first year of the scheme is completed before we can make our judgments <e> <s> i very much hope that what my noble friend is saying will not in fact be proved accurate <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed that is so <e> <s> again until we have seen the first years operation we cannot honestly say whether it will be a good distribution or whether we shall have to put more into the fund <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend will be aware in point of fact the total amount available is million <e> <s> so if he wishes to divide the into that he can do so <e> <s> but we still have to take the number of books and editions into account <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i beg to move that this house doth

"<cs> my lords i much enjoyed the noble lords maiden speech from the box and he will not be surprised if i say that i did not quite agree with everything he said <e> <s> the noble lord made a point specifically on the term royalties and the fact that this was the right of a country <e> <s> i would like to suggest that royalty is not a tax but is part of the consideration for the grant of a licence <e> <s> the liability to pay royalty arises under the clauses called model clauses set out in such specific sets of regulations made under the act and incorporated in licences granted under that act <e> <s> the current regulations are of course the petroleum production regulations which include the model clauses <e> <s> i would suggest to the noble lord that nowadays the term royalty as i tried to explain earlier is much more absorbed into the general taxes than being a term which might make people feel that they were losing something <e>", "<cs> my lords the investment was made on borrowed money and it was on borrowed money that we had to pay interest <e>", "<cs> no my lords i will not for the moment <e> <s> the noble lord was not present during the opening speeches and i think

the last months electricity prices have remained constant which means that as there was a rate of inflation during that time the price of electricity has gone down in real terms <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am afraid that is not the point <e> <s> what i said earlier was that the prices of the fuels are a matter for the two industries to settle for themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords i imagine the

reliability <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is wide of the question and i do not know the answer <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lords first question i was talking about tests which have been taking place in the united states <e> <s> of the major tests seven out of eight were good and i think that is a high proportion as tests go <e> <s> as regards stringent safety precautions taken over every aspect of design handling storage and movement of nuclear weapons these make the possibility of accidental release of fissile material into the environment very remote

latter part of that question in my answer to the noble lord lord molloy <e> <s> as regards the dramatised version on television this weekend that serves to underline the need to ensure that such an occurrence never happens <e> <s> this means that it is even more important to maintain the deterrent effect a view that i think is widely shared in this house and makes the government and the nato

defences and in some measure to deter the threat <e> <s> that i believe we all welcome <e>", "<cs> i note that the amendment proposed by the noble lords would mean that the bill provided for royalty exemption only up to broadly the same level of production as that for which the oil allowance is given for prt <e> <s> indeed i can see why it might be argued that if fields with production below this level are the ones to be helped by the prt oil allowance it is only logical to apply the same limit in the case of royalty exemption <e> <s> however the matter is not so simple as that <e>", "<cs> i think that we talked about the united kingdom offshore operators association quite extensively at second reading <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord explained the effect of the amendment is simple <e> <s> it would exclude from royalty relief the two fields approved between st april and st april <e> <s> all members of the ukooa would have been aware from the summer of of the review we were undertaking in close consultation with that association <e> <s> it was appropriate therefore to include the two fields which were approved after the review had begun alwyn north in october and clyde in december

committee that no secret assurances were given to the participants in those two fields that they would receive special treatment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord bishopston ranged widely on this particular point which is only about two oilfields <e> <s> if i may take him up on his wide exercise <e> <s> i believe that the incentives which this royalty bill will produce will give the chancellor more revenue than the old system <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble baroness did not appreciate my reply to her question <e> <s> i did try to answer what was down on the order paper <e>

"<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord has seen this very substantial pamphlet and will know that its authors have appreciated most of the problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord is making a rather strong political point which i do not think affects this at all <e> <s> as a morning after the night before i discard it <e>", "<cs> yes my lords as my original reply bears out this is the case <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to say that i believe that offshore employment is likely to continue rising up to the mid-s as new fields come on stream <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not hear the broadcast to which the noble lord refers but i could well understand its taking place <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware we recently made a fiscal adjustment to encourage such exploration and we are also encouraging the development of united kingdom controlled technology to ensure the optimum development of our own market resources in this area <e>", "<cs> my lords i fully understand the points made by the noble lord and i hope that he will be encouraged by my earlier remarks when i said that i hoped that it would be increasing until at least the mid-s <e> <s> we are also of course encouraging the industry to expand abroad and to try to get overseas markets at the same time <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the house is taking pleasure in the fact that this does produce more employment <e> <s> i quite take the point that my noble friend makes and i am sure that the oil companies concerned will not be employing more people than they have to <e>", "<cs> my lords i like the

feel sure that if the president and our prime minister have come to this agreement then that is good enough for us <e>", "<cs> may i just remind the committee to start with of the purpose of clause to which this amendment relates and try and make clear to the committee the effect that this amendment would have <e> <s> clause is essentially a technical provision as the noble baroness has hinted <e>

prescribe interim maxima for rates and precepts in the most difficult cases <e> <s> as i have said interim maxima are a stop-gap to ensure that no authority is left unable to raise a rate because of delay in setting a rate limit for it <e> <s> they would be prescribed only if time was running short and the beginning of the rating year was approaching <e> <s> that is why we have provided in the bill as presently drafted that interim maxima should be set if it proves necessary by st march in the case of a rate and th february in the case of a precept <e>", "<cs> i believe the noble baronesss

jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as i said earlier we have indeed considered this <e> <s> i shall bring it again to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> but the circumstances are very different as i tried to explain in my supplementary answer from those in the steel industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not trying to draw the opposition in the way that my noble friend has done but as i have said the situation is different <e>", "<cs> my lords i really do not know where the noble lord has been over recent years <e> <s> so far as i can understand it the miners are very appreciative of the redundancy terms which are extremely generous <e> <s> any idea that the situation is comparable to what the noble lord suggests i reject <e>", "<cs> my lords i am all for the public being aware of what is going on <e> <s> so far as i know nothing has been hidden in this context <e> <s> the government consider that the present financing is adequate <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first supplementary to the end of some per cent <e> <s> of the contracts by value had been let to united kingdom firms and organisations <e> <s> so far as his second supplementary is concerned i should be only too happy to have a debate on this subject if neccesary before the summer recess <e> <s> i shall rely on the normal channels <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it was extremely satisfactory that the culham development came to this country in the first place and it is one from which culham itself has benefited <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lords first question the total estimated cost to is about million at current rates and the direct united kingdom financial contribution to jet is approximately per cent <e> <s> in addition to our share which is currently per cent <e> <s> of the european commissions per cent <e> <s> support of jet <e> <s> other research is going on <e> <s> i believe we have a debate next week on the other alternatives when we can perhaps pursue the subject <e>", "<cs> i am not sure that my arguments are all that strong but i hope anyway that i can put the noble lords mind at rest which is what i shall seek to do <e> <s> in including this provision in the bill the government were conscious of the widespread concern felt by business about the lack of opportunity to influence high levels of rates even though non-domestic ratepayers account for nearly per cent <e> <s> of local authorities rate income <e> <s> we looked at the possibility of reintroducing the business vote but that <e>", "<cs> i notice that the noble lord says nationalised industries <e> <s> i know that he has an amendment later about electricity boards <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord underhill carefully explained this amendment relates to the code of practice and regulations that we propose to issue on the new duty to consult representatives of <e>", "<cs> that was a very moving speech from my noble friend lord pennock <e> <s> i only wish that instead of days at easter we could occasionally have years <e> <s> i share the desire of my noble friend lord pennock and of the noble lord lord graham of edmonton to ensure that this clause operates effectively <e> <s> that is certainly the wish of the government and we thought hard about it <e> <s> perhaps i could just tell your lordships something behind our thoughts <e> <s> we concluded that the structure set out in clause was the most effective means of achieving our aim <e> <s> first it imposes a general duty on local authorities to consult second it requires them to have regard to guidance issued by the secretary of state as to who should be consulted and how that consultation shall be effective third it confers powers on the secretary of state to prescribe in regulations information to be supplied to consultees <e> <s> we decided on this three-tier structure precisely because we believe that the provisions must be flexible enough to take account of local circumstances and to enable local authorities and businessmen to build on existing best practice <e>", "<cs> i think i must rely on what it says that it would have force because it leaves them open to a challenge in the courts <e>", "<cs> if i try to clarify the position i shall probably get people more mixed up than i did before <e> <s> to start with i gather that the co-op is included anyway <e> <s> clause is concerned with a duty to consult industrial and commercial ratepayers and i said that the purpose of the clause is to give industrial and commercial ratepayers an opportunity to influence the level of those rates <e> <s> i also mentioned that we might define more fully industrial or commercial such as universities or hospitals <e> <s> that is what led my noble friend to have a doubt <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear was asking about the word must <e> <s> the duty is to consult so that is a must <e> <s> what they do after the consultation will be up to the local authorities but the duty rests on them to consult <e> <s> that is where the duty lies and that is where they would lay themselves open to a challenge in court <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to give an undertaking <e> <s> it is our hope to get it by then but the fulfilment of my hopes is usually a little delayed <e> <s> however we shall certainly see what we can do <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has taken us into some detailed technicalities of rating practice <e> <s> i hope that i need not deal with every consequence of the proposed amendment but as my noble friend suggests we shall study it and write to him on any further points we have <e>", "<cs> i think that the whole committee such as exists at the moment will be very grateful to the noble lord lord graham of edmonton for his exposition of this amendment <e> <s> when i reached my office in the department of energy this morning i read in the newspapers that this amendment was down <e> <s> little did i realise that this evening i should actually be responding to it <e> <s> such is the way of life <e> <s> but i hope the noble lord will appreciate that i have a double edge to my response in that i do act for electricity as well <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene briefly between the noble baronesses <e> <s> i will talk to all the amendments and come back to that of the noble lord lord banks more specifically <e> <s> to start with we have of course every sympathy with the spirit of the amendments <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals says this is not a party political matter <e> <s> let me say in support of a matter which was raised by the noble baroness lady masham that it is our intention to try to get this right during the stages through which the bill will go in this house <e> <s> that will certainly be my ambition <e>", "<cs> i should like to be able to answer the noble baroness categorically <e> <s> i think that i was speaking for the department when this project was launched <e> <s> my memory is that at the moment this new taxi is on trial and a number are being tried out <e>", "<cs> this has been a most impressive short debate <e> <s> i want to say right at the beginning that what we have to discuss here is the right way to do it <e> <s> we all have the same aim there is no doubt about that <e> <s> we all want to press this yes i agree <e> <s> the question is which is the right way <e> <s> i agree with what my noble friend lady lane-fox said in a very forceful speech but what we are arguing about is how best to do what she wants to do <e> <s> i am not trying to hide behind assurances <e> <s> if you feel it is right to put it in the bill that we will do but let us just make quite sure that that is the right way to go ahead <e> <s> i say the right way to go ahead because the noble baroness lady masham talked about parking places in westminster <e> <s> of course this bill would do nothing about that <e> <s> so we want to be careful about the way we are going to go <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment so that i can put my reply on record <e> <s> again the government have much sympathy with many of the ideas that lie behind this amendment and it is vital that public transport services should not be denied to people whose disabil-ities are such that they cannot use ordinary public transport services <e> <s> but as i attempted to make clear in our earlier debate on similar subjects there are two different circumstances we are discussing <e> <s> the first concerns lrts own services <e> <s> it is absolutely right that lrt should be under an obligation to ensure that these services are as suitable as possible for disabled people <e> <s> this involves attention to small details of design and so on with disabled people in mind <e> <s> i believe that the department of transports record the assurances that i and the departments ministers have given and indeed those that are already in the bill will ensure that the needs of these people are met <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to have learnt that my noble friend lady lane-foxs batteries caused her trouble which is why she was a little delayed in reaching us <e> <s> may i as minister in charge of the electricity supply division offer her my sincere apologies and if she has any more troubles i shall try to charge them later <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord underhill for explaining his amendments so fully <e> <s> if i may i will try to respond by explaining precisely what is behind our thinking in respect of this particular clause <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be to relieve lrt of the duty to bring forward proposals for setting up operating subsidiaries for their bus and underground services <e> <s> lrt would simply be left with a discretion to do so <e> <s> the government made their intentions quite clear in this respect when they <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i do not want to prolong the debate at this hour but i think we are looking into the future <e> <s> he may be proved right or the government may be proved right but the government certainly do not intend to follow the course which the noble lord is trying to say we are to follow <e> <s> we do of course intend that lrt should be the authority and that it should give london a much better service than it has had in the past <e> <s> that is our aim but i appreciate the noble lords feeling <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord has indicated we have spent some time discussing the role of local authorities and here we are concerned with the consultation by the secretary of state with the local authorities <e> <s> like the noble lord i do not intend to speak at length <e> <s> my noble friend has already explained to your lordships when we think consultation is or is not appropriate and why <e> <s> the role of the secretary of state in clauses and stems from his relationship with the london regional transport board <e> <s> the lrt are answerable to the secretary of state not to the local authorities <e> <s> in any case the matters dealt with in these clauses are really of no relevance or concern to local authorities <e> <s> they are not concerned with identifying or seeking to meet needs <e> <s> they are domestic and organisational matters between the nationalised industries and their sponsoring ministers <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to noble lords for the manner in which they have expressed themselves to the amendment <e> <s> one of our principal concerns in putting this bill forward is to ensure that lrt and its subsidiaries provide the best possible services for passengers within the resources available to it <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i should like to deal first with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i entirely agree with the principle of this amendment which provides for lrt to include their own employees among the persons from whom they propose to invite tenders under clause <e> <s> before the noble lord lord carmichael gets too excited my difficulty in accepting the amendment however is to what extent it would be right to incorporate in the bill a requirement to do something which i believe has already become accepted practice <e> <s> it is now usual for employers if they are contemplating some form of contracting out to give their own employees an opportunity to bid for the job on equal terms <e> <s> this has the advantage of exposing them to outside competition and considering whether they can themselves carry out the same work more efficiently or at less cost <e>", "<cs> this seemingly innocent amendment would change the character of the clause considerably as the noble lord has indicated <e> <s> it would make it less flexible and much less useful <e> <s> the noble lord used the word woolly <e> <s> let me set out certain situations which might arise and how this amendment would affect them <e>", "<cs> i take the noble lords latter point and i shall certainly look into it <e> <s> as far as the former is concerned i think he will always be jogging happily if he is hoping for an amendment to be accepted here which has been rejected in another place <e>", "<cs> i appreciate what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i hope very much and i had to go through these amendments rather quickly that when they are read in the clear light of <e>", "<cs> my lords as i tried to explain in my original reply the situation is not as the noble lord describes <e> <s> the miners can either have redundancy terms or jobs in alternative pits <e> <s> i explained the matter to the noble lord lord diamond the other day when i pointed out the difference between the steel scheme and that of the national coal board <e> <s> first i made the point that so far the national coal board has been able to avoid compulsory redundancies <e> <s> secondly i said that any coal industry equivalent of bsc would have to operate many more locations and therefore would probably be less effective <e>", "<cs> my lords yesterday in the other place my right honourable friend pointed out that any manpower reductions would be obtained by miners voluntary decisions and pit closures and their timings is of course a matter for the coal board <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not have figures for that <e>", "<cs> my lords as my noble friend is aware at the moment the average is no greater than it has previously been <e> <s> in fact during the s it was vastly higher <e> <s> some pits were closed during the terms of office of the socialist party <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are not washing their hands of the whole affair <e> <s> the government have invested in the coal industry to a degree of which the noble lord is well aware <e> <s> in addition as was stated in the other place yesterday the government intend to continue to invest in the coal industry to the tune of some billion over the next three years <e> <s> we believe in the mining industry we want to ensure that it is profitable and that the miners themselves have a future which we believe they have <e>", "<cs> my lords i take issue with my noble friend on his last sentence <e> <s> this is not a dying industry <e> <s> this is an industry into which the <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my initial reply where mining areas already have general employment problems there are a wide range of benefits such as the special employment and training measures operated by the manpower services commission <e>", "<cs> my lords besides those things i mentioned in my original reply the european coal and steel community provides cheap loan finance for investment projects which promote the interests of the coal and steel industries and for reconversion projects providing new employment for redundant coal and steel workers <e> <s> over the last five years over million has been made available for investment finance under this scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed i have not got the statistics which my noble friend suggests or asks for <e> <s> i shall see whether they could be forthcoming <e> <s> i take note of his points <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> what i am equally trying to say <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble lord on that occasion and i have the <e>", "<cs> my lords if i say that the disparity between the price of coal coming from an economic pit and an uneconomic one is as against over perhaps the need for the closures will be evident <e> <s> i did not quite follow the rest of the noble lords question <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for repeating that because it enables me to say once again that all the miners who want to go on working have been found a job in other mines <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i have mentioned the various types of assistance which are available such as special development area status development area status and intermediate area status <e> <s> all these things are indeed being considered <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord has said and i shall certainly consider it <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene for one moment <e> <s> is not the noble lord aware that these miners in nottinghamshire want to work <e> <s> would the noble lord not wish them to work <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i avoided the term self-sufficiency <e> <s> what i said was that the reserves were there <e> <s> did i say self-sufficiency <e>", "<cs> i did in which case i will stand by what i said <e> <s> what i find exciting in this field i am sure that my noble friend lord campbell of croy will be with me on this is the new methods of extraction which are being found <e> <s> these alone i believe certainly a recent talk by one of the oil companies to which i listened led me to believe this suggest that the ideas we have for the future are pessimistic rather than optimistic <e> <s> but as the noble lord is well aware we are in the world of hypothesis and as the noble lord lord harris of high cross mentioned we are in the world of crystal gazing and it is very hard to come to any firm conclusions <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point <e> <s> to return to nuclear power it has firmly established itself as a supply option for this country and for over a quarter of a century has been providing <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that the lecc and the electricity council are at the moment in talks <e> <s> i do not think that it would be right for me to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand to be corrected by the noble baroness but i do not believe that the high court has actually said anything about this <e> <s> my understanding is that the case is up before it <e>", "<cs> my lords no i do not agree with the noble lord particularly as i had some say in drafting the response <e> <s> i should like to reaffirm that the government accept the financial principles which were laid down in the white paper <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware there are a number of different approaches to this matter <e> <s> i have before me in order to put it into simple laymans language as the noble baroness asked in her original question the definition of the long run marginal cost <e> <s> this is simply the cost of supply on a continuing basis including replacement capital cost and a satisfactory return on capital employed <e> <s> we would be quite ready to have any scrutiny <e>", "<cs> i will indeed my lords <e> <s> the noble baroness might like to know that i have been in close touch with the chairman of the electricity consumer council and intend to remain so on this topic <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend and in my reply to the noble baroness i mentioned the words including replacement capital cost <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not inherent in what i said <e>", "<cs> the committee are indeed lucky to have the noble lord lord pitt with his great knowledge to lead us into this amendment <e> <s> i am very grateful to him for explaining it so fully <e> <s> how fortunate we are that we do not have to finish before four oclock on this particular occasion <e>", "<cs> i hoped i had covered that point in that the boroughs will be taking on responsibility if the glc is abolished <e> <s> that is the reason why we have clauses to <e> <s> if there is any difficulty about these boroughs getting together to provide a scheme there is a statutory right for us to do so <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble earl for moving this amendment <e> <s> as he rightly said we have already talked on the general theme and i too will avoid that particular point <e> <s> the amendment seeks to make clear that public transport services for the disabled can be provided under the new powers in clause which concern the purchase of additional services from lrt by the local authorities <e> <s> my first inclination was to accept this amendment <e> <s> however i am advised that the amendment is technically unnecessary because the clause as it stands already covers implicitly special services for disabled people <e>", "<cs> as this is the first amendment in this particular clause perhaps i might speak for just a little longer than i might otherwise do <e> <s> these amendments seek to write into the bill obligations on my right honourable friend the secretary of state for trade and industry who will have primary responsibility for the passengers committee to undertake certain consultation over his appointments to the committee and to make a proportion of appointments in response to nominations from the local authorities <e>", "<cs> where we are probably apart here is in the fact that local authorities will presumably have their own transport committee of whatever form the boroughs decide to set up which will look after the local authorities workings with transport <e> <s> but what we are looking at here is the consumer group which need not necessarily have a duplication within local authorities <e> <s> i am not being dogmatic about this but that is my feeling <e> <s> i do not see why we must have local authorities in the consumer body because the local authorities will be one of the group at which the consumer body will look to make sure that it is looking after disabled people and so on <e> <s> i cannot see the point of making the consumer body full of local authorities <e> <s> i look after one of the consumer bodies <e> <s> certainly that is not the case with ours and may i say that the selection of people is exceptionally good <e>", "<cs> i find it very useful to get the noble lords feelings about this because i was worried about what the amendment meant and i now know <e> <s> but i honestly think that our own solution is better <e>", "<cs> may i just say for the information of the committee that the bill deals with this in paragraph of schedule <e> <s> it applies section of the chronically sick and disabled persons act to the passengers committee and has the effect that the secretary of state must consider appointing to the london regional passengers committee people with experience among disabled people and of their special needs such people being disabled themselves <e>", "<cs> i can well understand the points which the noble lord lord underhill has made <e> <s> the consumer council system is not intended to apply to private sector operators who provide services independently of lrt <e> <s> it is intended to apply to services provided by the nationalised industries many of which are monopolies or near-monopolies <e> <s> we believe that the extension of the role of a consumer council to small private sector businesses such as private sector bus operators would be an unwarranted increase in bureaucracy and public sector intervention <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is suggesting that lrt will use or employ this particular group <e> <s> in that case the passengers committee can go to lrt and say what are you doing <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may look into the more detailed arguments which the noble lord has produced and let him have a note upon the matter <e>", "<cs> the amendment which the noble lord has moved would put local authorities in greater london in a special position in relation to the london regional passengers committee not shared by other local authorities or by other bodies in relation to the transport users consultative committees elsewhere <e> <s> they would lay a specific duty on the committee to consider local authority representations and a duty to inform the local authorities of the outcome of their considerations <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may briefly intervene <e> <s> the noble lord will recall that i mentioned the provision in clause <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord carmichael has explained to us we are concerned in these amendments with the powers of the passengers committee <e> <s> the first two amendments would enable them to consider matters relating to fares and charges <e> <s> the third amendment no <e> <s> would enable them to investigate suitable topics of interest to public transport users in greater london and to make recommendations on such matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> we in the department of energy believe that tank jackets draught proofing loft insulation and cavity insulation are all good energy savers as is some double glazing particularly in dwellings where window frames have deteriorated to the point where there is no alternative but to replace them and in dwellings undergoing general rehabilitation <e> <s> but the effects of the new tax are limited <e> <s> new construction will continue to be zero-rated <e> <s> both repair and maintenance work and supplies for diy installations are already taxed at the standard rate <e>", "<cs> my lords i should be very sorry if that were the case <e> <s> on the other hand this is a tax which has been imposed in order to correct distortions <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first say that we are still encouraging people on all the various propositions that i suggested earlier <e> <s> these will still be encouraged as they are still energy-conservation-effective <e> <s> so far as the current tax position is concerned it discriminates in favour of manufacturer-installed double glazing and against both contractor and diy installation <e> <s> that is why this change is being made <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> i should just like to say that i cannot accept the word enormous <e> <s> the savings in this field are not as great as the ones that i mentioned earlier but i shall not go through the list again <e> <s> however there are savings from double glazing which as i said we recognise <e> <s> i do not think that the noble lords exaggerations will help the situation <e> <s> as i said earlier we are still encouraging energy efficiency and the methods which i have been talking about and the paybacks remain very good <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware there would be no change in the rateable value for double glazing <e>", "<cs> my lords it was in the budget <e>", "<cs> my lords i again think that the noble lord exaggerates somewhat in trying to make his points <e> <s> of course i understand what he is talking about but i said in earlier answers that the energy efficiency paybacks particularly on the subjects he mentioned of loft insulation and cavity wall insulation are still extremely good in spite of the imposition of vat <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to my noble friend but i do not much wish to be drawn into that field <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that the noble lord corrected himself on the date of the inquiry because it actually started two days after i reached the department and i shall not know what to do when the inquiry is over <e> <s> i should correct the noble lords figures <e> <s> the overall cost of the inquiry is just over million at the moment <e> <s> obviously now that the inquiry is running it would not be for the government to do anything but await the just verdict of that inquiry and we must do so <e> <s> therefore i cannot comment on the agrs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of my noble friends predilection for agrs and again i cannot comment on what she says at the moment <e> <s> the amount of money so far spent by the board is about million <e> <s> the bulk of that expenditure is on design and development work <e> <s> as my noble friend is aware an additional million was spent on the ordering of long-lead materials <e>", "<cs> my lords again i must go back to what i originally said <e> <s> this is one of the issues which the inquiry is considering and i do not think it would be right for me to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that the aspect raised by the noble earl is being considered by the inquiry <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference between the noble lord and myself is purely on what one means by the inquiry <e> <s> so far as the overall cost of the inquiry is concerned and not the cegbs other costs those are the figures i am giving <e> <s> the noble lord is quoting what the cegb itself is involved in <e>", "<cs> the purpose of these amendments <e> <s> which the noble lord has moved so eloquently is very similar to amendment no <e> <s> which we debated during our consideration of clause <e> <s> i do not want to detain the committee too long and i hope i shall not go over the same arguments again <e> <s> on that occasion the noble lord lord pitt drew attention to the current glc scheme which places no restriction on evening peak travel as well as providing half price off-peak travel on british rail services within london <e> <s> nobody is denying the right of local authorities to provide additional facilities of this kind if that is what they wish to do <e> <s> but it is another thing entirely to require in statute that this sort of scheme should exist <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply briefly to the noble lord lord tordoff who spoke i think about less favourable schemes although i missed his actual remark when he was speaking <e> <s> i can perhaps answer that <e> <s> at the moment some things are still experimental <e> <s> we do not know even if the glc continued <e> <s> whether they would be kept or not <e> <s> the second point is that new ideas are continually being introduced <e> <s> we do not therefore know in this committee what will be less favourable when the bill is enacted <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said in his introduction the main purpose of this series of amendments is to compel and i stress the word compel all local authorities in london to arrange travel concessions not only with lrt but also with private operators and with british rail <e> <s> the amendment would also have an unfortunate side effect to which i will refer later <e>", "<cs> i will certainly look into that <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i disagree with one word of what my noble friend has said except that i now have to change my own notes <e> <s> we do not think it would he right to single out concessionary fares and give expenditure on concessionary fares a statutory exemption from the general penalties which local authorities may suffer in regard to their total expenditure <e> <s> the new clause would also have a disadvantage in that it would prevent local authorities which had their expenditure under control receiving grant on their concessionary fares expenditure <e>", "<cs> of course i agree with the noble lord lord underhill that the government fully share the concern of the committee about the position of the unemployed but i believe that there are difficulties in pursuing the course proposed in the amendment <e> <s> the existing categories of people eligible for travel <e>", "<cs> it may help the noble lord if i say that it is possible <e> <s> without special legislation to provide reduced fare travel for the unemployed on a self-financing basis <e>", "<cs> we are now debating clause which in fact is about the reserve scheme <e> <s> the noble lord lord somers might like to bear in mind that it is because of the doubts he expressed that the government have put in this reserve scheme it caters for just such an eventuality as he envisages <e> <s> the amendments moved by the noble lord lord pitt are designed to extend the concessionary travel scheme under clauses to of the bill to travel on british rail services <e>", "<cs> i find this a fascinating argument and one that is really a question of preference as much as anything else <e> <s> it might be a reasonable start if i were to say to the committee that there are of course good reasons for imposing limitations of this kind in the reserve scheme <e> <s> in fact <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state made it clear at report stage in another place that the reserve scheme was deliberately being restricted to off-peak travel and he explained why <e> <s> concessionary fares schemes have their origin in the fact that in the middle of the day buses and trains <e>", "<cs> i think i would like to ask the noble lord lord pitt only one thing <e> <s> perhaps he can tell me if i am wrong <e> <s> this is the point of the noble earl lord perth on the present scheme <e> <s> i understand that for the present scheme which we have incorporated these times are based on advice from london transport <e>", "<cs> in case i misled the committee on that point i agree exactly with what the noble earl lord perth said <e> <s> something that the noble lord lord pitt mentioned was whether we had consulted the glc about the scheme <e> <s> my understanding is that the scheme is actually based on the advice of london transport <e>", "<cs> this new clause appears to be based on an assumption that it is necessary statutorily to compel an independent operator to provide concessions if the local authority want them and are prepared to pay for them <e> <s> i believe i have understood the noble lord correctly <e> <s> but if the local authority are prepared to pay for them there seems to be no reason why such operators should not provide them <e> <s> it would involve them in no net additional cost and they would be most unlikely to court adverse publicity by refusing to help those for whom such concessions are intended <e>", "<cs> the committee will recall that one of the debates which we had on clause covered much the same ground as these amendments <e> <s> in essence what the amendments seek to do is to impose on all london authorities a duty to arrange uniform travel concessions not only on lrt services but also on those of british rail and independent operators within greater london <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that they continue <e> <s> if that is not the case i will let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords the limits already imposed by the government on the level of empty property rates which can be levied by rating authorities mean that after the three-month rate-free period such unused industrial premises would receive per cent <e> <s> rate relief and that any other non-domestic premises would receive per cent <e> <s> rate relief <e> <s> the amendment will help businesses which have to close down but which do not wish to strip out plant and machinery <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord a figure such as that for which he asks but if i can have one discovered i shall let him have it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment because it gives me the opportunity to explain to the house why the existing legislation concerning the provision of domestic rate relief is framed in the way it is <e> <s> section of the general rate act requires rating authorities to provide domestic rate relief of / pence in the pound on domestic hereditaments which include dwelling-houses as defined by schedule to the act which the noble lord mentioned <e> <s> schedule specifically states that where the whole or substantially the whole of the available accommodation is used for the letting of rooms singly for residential purposes then except in certain special circumstances the hereditament shall be deemed not to be used for the purposes of private dwelling or private dwellings <e> <s> effectively this means that domestic rate relief is not available for hotels guest houses or houses in multiple occupation <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> the share was standing at about per cent <e> <s> worth some billion in itself <e>", "<cs> my lords the terms used in the brown book at the moment are proven probable and possible reserves <e> <s> these are reserves in existing discoveries <e> <s> most can be economically brought up at present prices <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what my noble friend said in the first part of his supplementaryi would need notice of his second point under a separate question <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the figures i have been giving the house this afternoon remaining recoverable reserves so far discovered would last ten and a half years if present production rates are maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to be careful as this is the report stage but i think that now i shall in a way be speaking to my amendment no <e> <s> and explaining what it is about which i think will ease the discussion of the house when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i am grateful to noble lords for what they have said about the governments amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords this is report stage and i should not really be popping up and down <e> <s> however with the leave of the house i should like to make some points <e> <s> if it is the case that sir peter baldwin has said this all i can do is to ask his successor whether he agrees <e> <s> to be more serious i have tried to say that i thought this matter was covered <e> <s> if my noble friend lady lane-fox on reading my words feels that it is not i shall go back myself to make sure that it is <e> <s> if it is not i shall return with something at the next stage <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house i believe that i have now spoken to amendments nos <e> <s> a and <e> <s> the point that i tried to make in my opening remarks was that we actually cover in this amendment what the noble baroness wants in amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i was hoping that she would study what i have stated to see whether she agrees that this covers what she wants in which case she would be happy <e> <s> alternatively if i find that i have not covered everything that she stated in her remarks i shall have another word with her to see what we can produce by the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this is a slightly more particular amendment than the one we have just had <e> <s> as the noble lord lord ennals said at committee stage we discussed the general question to which this amendment relates that is whether it is right for lrt to be under a statutory duty to provide services for severely disabled people those who are not able to use the normal bus and underground services <e> <s> i might point out that this amendment would not actually require lrt to provide the services it would merely require them to submit to the secretary of state proposals for their provision <e> <s> however i have no doubt of the noble lords intention in tabling the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i just say that i hope that when the noble lord reads what i said about the previous amendment he will find it more reassuring than what he has just said <e>", "<cs> my lords may i try to answer some of the questions and set the noble lords minds at rest <e> <s> the effect of these amendments would be to relieve lrt of the duty to bring forward proposals for setting up operating subsidiaries for their bus and underground services <e> <s> lrt would simply be left with a discretion to do so <e> <s> the noble lord lord underhill has suggested that we should rely on lrts managerial judgment in this matter <e> <s> may i first confirm that we shall be anxious to back lrts managerial judgment wherever we can <e> <s> but i hope he will recognise that the government must be able to provide for what they regard as the best initial structure and then allow lrt to develop it <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great interest to the noble lord lord ennals when he introduced his amendment <e> <s> i can see that he is drawing on an impeccable precedent and i rather expected to have my leg pulled in that way <e> <s> perhaps he would not be altogether surprised if i said that i still cannot recommend it to the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for his further explanation and indeed for his little talk on how to sell our mistakes <e> <s> we debated this admittedly at rather a late hour the other day <e> <s> i am sorry if my answer on that occasion did not wholly satisfy the noble lord <e> <s> i am afraid that even with his further remarks i remain in some doubt <e> <s> let me try to explain why <e> <s> we fully accept that any lrt employees should be able to tender in response to invitations made by lrt but the fact is that there is nothing in the bill to prevent them from doing so <e> <s> indeed it has already become accepted practice for employees to be invited to tender in addition to outside companies <e> <s> it is we believe in lrts interest to act this way since it allows them to compare the cost of having a job done in-house against the cost of contracting out <e> <s> this seems a basic principle which does not need to be given statutory force <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciated a great deal of what the noble lord lord carmichael said and indeed i appreciated what the noble lord lord tordoff said <e> <s> i should like to try to allay their worries and say that we do indeed agree with fair competition and would not wish the kind of cowboy operations which the noble lord lord carmichael described to come into operation <e>", "<cs> my lords we did of course discuss an amendment on these lines at the committee stage as the noble lord lord underhill has said <e> <s> i think that the noble lord managed to read out the letter which i sent to him which i thought was extraordinarily dry in a manner which i found more interesting <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael said we discussed at committee stage the question whether the passengers committtee should be able to consider fares and charges and at that time i was trying to satisfy the noble lord when i said that the government intend to deal with this matter for the country as a whole when a suitable legislative opportunity permits <e> <s> the noble lord has tried to tempt me out of this by saying why can we not have a period with london if it is going to take a long time <e> <s> i wish i could tell him when it was going to start but i am afraid i cannot because that is one of the things that is not in my remit and anyway i have made a lot of promises about things starting which i have had to chase up and which never seem to happen <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to the remarks of my noble friend in moving her amendment and i know that the london transport passengers committee has written to my honourable friend the minister of state on the matter <e> <s> i am sure that my noble friend will be aware that the clause has been deliberately drafted in a way which requires the passengers committee to send copies of its minutes conclusions and recommendations to the operators that is lrt and british rail as appropriate <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord said i do not think there is much to this amendment but i was listening with some interest to his example and could not help thinking when he said that if what is on offer is turned down we should need a statutory power in order to enforce it why could they not go somewhere else in order to get it <e> <s> i do not see what keeps them on that particular track <e> <s> the house may like to bear in mind that when an operator applies for a road service licence whether for the first time or seeking a renewal it will be open to local authorities the passengers committee and individuals to make objections or other representations to the traffic commissioners under subsection <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord underhill made clear the purpose of this amendment is twofold <e> <s> in the first place it seeks to remove the discretion of local authorities in greater london to place any terms limitations or conditions on the issue of certain concessionary travel permits <e> <s> secondly it seeks to make it obligatory for local authorities to make arrangements with the post office for the issue of the permits <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to agree with my noble friend that there is satisfaction of which the government take a percentage on the <e>", "<cs> i very much hope my lords that the noble lord will agree that the government particularly the offshore office which i think does exceptionally well in this field are already doing so <e> <s> the united kingdom share of the market represents the value of the contracts and the main sub-contracts stemming from them and these are placed with companies which through employment manufacturing and subcontracting make a substantial contribution to our economy <e> <s> i should also like to agree with the noble lord that there is a lot of further work which we call do abroad on this and that this should become an export market as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much hope that what my noble friend says at the end of his supplementary question is not the case <e> <s> i believe that our north sea oil industry has a great reputation <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate what the noble lord says which in part is what i replied to the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> in fact both my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the minister of state in the department of energy have been abroad to china and india to promote our export trade in this field <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no figures to substantiate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> when i have been abroad i have been very impressed by the number of our own people working there in offshore industries <e>", "<cs> my lords i said at report stage that if any anxiety still remained after the assurance i gave i would be happy to look at the matter again <e> <s> i have now had discussions with my honourable friend the minister of state at the department of transport as indeed has my noble friend lady lane-fox <e> <s> we have thought seriously since then about how best we could ensure that we were not leaving disabled people with doubts and worries <e> <s> after due consideration we believe that our proposal is the right solution and i shall now try to persuade the house to agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for again introducing us to this topic i believe that it is the third time we have gone over it <e> <s> i appreciate that the noble lord has made an attempt to meet my earlier criticisms of the drafting but i still do not think that he has made a case for the substance of the principle of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord interrupted me in mid-flow of a marvellous sentence <e> <s> but to go hack to where we were before i should say that equally general conditions of service is so imprecise in itself <e> <s> how would you identify that <e> <s> what would that mean <e> <s> as i was saying it would be in lrts own interests that the persons submitting the tender could be relied upon to provide continuity of supply and a satisfactory level of service throughout the period of the tender <e> <s> we simply do not believe that lrt should be under a statutory duty to have regard to the conditions of employment or the level of wages of other employers <e> <s> lrt must surely be allowed to exercise its own commercial judgment in these matters subject to the constraints already written into clause to provide the impetus for contracting out <e> <s> in fact i do not think that it is very flattering to lrts future mangement to suggest that it would do otherwise than what i have said <e>", "<cs> my lords as i have emphasised throughout the debate on this subject it has been the policy of successive governments that local authorities should have discretion over the provision of concessionary fares schemes <e> <s> that is why clause basically re-enacts the existing law enabling local authorities in and around greater london to make their own voluntary arrangements with lrt british rail and other operators in their area as they wish <e> <s> in these circumstances we think it would be wrong to impose on local authorities a particular form of scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my two noble friends for their support <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord lord underhill that i have taken out my little sentence about flexibility as he obviously did not want me to read it again <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady phillips that it is not a question of money here and may i say to the noble lord <e> <s> lord pitt that it is not a question of changing the custom <e> <s> we are not against this idea at all but purely of making it a statutory imposition and imposing it on the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we would all welcome what the ncb are doing <e> <s> of course the government already have their training opportunities schemes <e> <s> also we should pay a compliment to the ncb who for many years have provided a counselling service for men who are considering taking redundancy <e> <s> we shall see that the present scheme is pursued as fast as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the governments policy is directed towards the basic objective of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for underlining the fact that at the moment all the redundancies have indeed been voluntary <e> <s> it might interest the house to know the statistics in relation to pit closures last year <e> <s> some per cent <e> <s> of those miners were found jobs elsewhere <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of that and the government together with the coal board work towards helping in the community area as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be drawn into the larger issues here <e> <s> one of the problems is the fact that at the moment the miners who want to go to work are being impeded from so doing <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord and his wisdom for that intervention <e> <s> so far as i know the sort of things that he has mentioned are still available and still happen and discussions do take place <e> <s> i will bear in mind what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asks a fairly hypothetical question <e> <s> if he wants to ask me a specific question i shall be happy to get the statistics for him <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think my noble friend is being completely fair <e> <s> i said to him in my reply that the task force is to report to an early meeting of the board after which we should be better able to answer the detailed points of my noble friends question <e> <s> certainly i will offer to do that <e>", "<cs> my lords what i have been trying to convey to the house this afternoon is that there is already a number of schemes in existence operated both by the government and the msc and new ideas are coming forward <e> <s> i hope this offers a positive future to the mining communities <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord produces an interesting sideline on which i do not wish to comment <e>", "<cs> my lords the ncb are encouraging new jobs in the mining areas and the manpower services commission and other agencies in order to support these efforts are trying to bring in new business and new employment <e> <s> this is most welcome <e> <s> i believe it is further evidence that the board are concerned to ensure that where men leave the industry they are given every possible assistance <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that there is as it were an intention to hide this it is a question of how it can best be done <e> <s> i would welcome further discussions between the national coal board and the british geological survey to clarify and if possible to resolve their different approaches to this matter <e> <s> i am not sure that this need require government intervention <e>", "<cs> my lords that is why in my original reply i was very careful to give details of those reserves which are actually accessible <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord in his wide-ranging survey underlined the difficulty of his planning approach which i would consider to be more interference <e> <s> the governments approach is to encourage the maximum economic exploitation of our energy resources not by central direction but by clearing the way for producers and consumers to reach the best possible understanding in the market <e> <s> our aim for coal is a future secured by a massive investment programme designed to produce coal at a price at which customers at home and abroad will increasingly buy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should not like to enter into that discussion at this moment <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware a research and development programme is continuing in both these fields <e>", "<cs> my lords the government believe that the coal industry can have a good future if it can bring its costs under control and become competitive in the market place <e> <s> they believe this not because of any assertions about quantity but because of what our best mines operating with known coal reserves are capable of doing today <e>", "<cs> my lords there was a report and as i said in my earlier reply the noble lord is quite right <e> <s> the government are not sure at the moment whether they should intervene in this <e> <s> however we are keeping it under review <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said in my initial response to the noble lord lord kennet there are a lot of factors which are taken into account <e> <s> price is one and of course suitability is yet another <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm to the noble lord that the capital cost of reducing so <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that sub-committee g is at the moment taking evidence on pollution <e> <s> my department submitted evidence to it in may <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty of joining a club which issues a starting date of is that all countries have different trends <e> <s> in our particular country our emissions have already fallen by per cent <e> <s> since which is not a record but it is something of which we are very proud <e> <s> however in answer to my noble friend we are saying yes to further substantial so <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that my noble friend is altogether going too far <e> <s> there is totally insufficient scientific evidence to establish a clear link between emissions and environmental damage and no guarantee whatever that the substantial expenditure required by the directive would be cost-effective <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e> <s> i could add of course hydrocarbons as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his remarks <e> <s> i look forward to the publication with enthusiasm <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that my answers have not shown excessive speed and i believe that the governments policies are right <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord reads the <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords one would welcome a ballot of the mineworkers so that they can make their own decision <e>", "<cs> no my lords certainly not and any reasonable person who has read what the coal hoard has put forward would entirely disagree with the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for bringing that point to the attention of the house <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords as i said in answer to an earlier question the mineworkers who are working did ballot whereas those who are not did not have a ballot <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble lord will find that i am reasonable but on the other hand unhelpful questions are rather apt to receive unhelpful answers <e> <s> what i should like noble lords opposite to do is to back to the best of their ability the nine-point plan which the coal board has put forward and to ask the mineworkers who are on strike not to intimidate those miners who wish to work <e> <s> i believe that if they were to do that we would see a speedy conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of the views expressed by the noble baronesss party with which of course i agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make one remark about the noble lords speech and that is that there are a lot of pits working and we are here talking about only a part of the industry <e> <s> one of the sadnesses is that the industry is split in half <e> <s> the other comment i should like to make in regard to his second point is that at the moment there is very little difference between the two sides the interpretation of the word beneficial is one of the differences and i hope very much that this can be resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i must again put to the noble lord the point that this dispute is now on a very small issue indeed and we very much hope that that will be settled <e> <s> but in the meantime her majestys government have made available a massive investment and have quite clearly laid it on the line that they want the most efficient and effective coal industry in europe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that the right honourable gentleman mr orme did indeed help in getting the national union of mineworkers to the table <e> <s> i am delighted to say as i said earlier that the national coal boards door is open at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords in the nine-point programme put forward by the national coal board the board stated that it would bring into full operation its new enterprise company which will provide mining communities with advisory services accommodation facilities managerial advice and if necessary launch aid to assist new small businesses and enterprises in those mining communities where a new diversity of jobs is required <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords support for this scheme <e> <s> as yet the government have not been approached on the matter of financial aid and i shall let the noble lord know <e>", "<cs> my lords indeed that could be the case and the government also have training opportunities schemes but this will be in addition to those <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord says and i will encourage the national coal board to keep this well under its own umbrella <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is aware there are other schemes <e> <s> as i mentioned earlier there is the governments training opportunities scheme run by the manpower services commission <e> <s> i cannot give him a specific answer to his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed bring that suggestion to the attention of the coal board <e>", "<cs> my lords following the advisory council on research and developments recommendation in the departments wave energy programme was reduced to its present level of about a year <e> <s> the programme is kept under review but there appears to be no justification at present for any increase <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> i do not think that in this particular case that is so <e> <s> the reason that we did not go forward with this technology is that at the moment we do not believe that it pays <e> <s> in a country like norway it may do so because there is an indented coastline with a small tidal range which facilitates the installation of small-scale demonstration schemes <e> <s> that would not apply to this country <e>", "<cs> no my lords not at the moment but the laboratory work is still being carried out particularly at coventry polytechnic queens university belfast as well as at edinburgh university <e>", "<cs> my lords we are continuing research to see whether there is any justification in a large-scale project for wave energy <e> <s> in the meantime we are concentrating for renewables on geothermal both tidal and hot dry rock as well as wind biofuels and passive solar <e>", "<cs> my lords the gist of my answers was that we have not written it off but are still keeping an eye on it <e> <s> in fact the energy technology support unit at harwell is preparing a report on the programme which will he published later in the year <e>", "<cs> my lords i will bring the noble earls question to the attention of the laboratory where the work is being carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i readily endorse what was said by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for energy <e> <s> i can also underline that there are generous removal allowances which are already paid by the national coal board to men who transfer to other pits following a closure or manpower reduction <e> <s> men who move so far that they have to move house receive full reimbursement of expenses associated with the move including such costs as introductory visits removal expenses and solicitors fees <e>", "<cs> my lords as my right honourable friend the chancellor of the exchequer said in his statement in the other place earlier today the dispute has probably added net some million to million to public expenditure so far this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i note the suggestion of the noble lord but i should like to remind him that the labour government not only accepted the principle that uneconomic pits should close but embodied it in legislation by providing in the coal industry act for social grants to be paid to assist in the closure of pits of uneconomic capacity <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have a copy of this mornings <e>", "<cs> my lordsin my original reply i said that pit closures were only undertaken after most careful consideration and i referred to the cause of a substantial part of the loss <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not associate myself with the figures produced by the noble lord <e> <s> i should like to say to him that this government have invested more in the coal industry than his <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to answer that question that is for the usual channels <e> <s> but i believe that the message we can take to the country is end harassment end intimidation and let the miners make their own choice <e>", "<cs> my lords i remind the house there are many miners working at this time as well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to see the ballot which has been called for <e> <s> i do not see why one should not be held <e>", "<cs> my lords the average price of coal in our country is at the moment around per tonne as against the best we can get out at which compares with other imported coal which comes to thames-side slightly cheaper than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to pay tribute to the coal mining industry just as the noble lord has done <e> <s> i hope very much that it gets together and holds a ballot and works at full force <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble baroness for her supplementary question and i must say that since she put this question down on the order paper i have made myself aware of the matter and have come to much the same conclusion as the noble baroness <e> <s> may i remind her that the premise which the wildlife and countryside act now enacts provides that marine nature reserves can be created only by the consent of all concerned <e> <s> that is the situation we are in at the moment trying to make sure that all concerned do consent <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the noble lords contribution and how nice it is to hear him in such good voice again <e>", "<cs> i should say that fishing and recreation continue in national parks in heritage coast areas of outstanding natural beauty and on sites of special scientific interest <e> <s> we very much hope that the <e> <s> same will be possible in the marine nature reserves <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted that as a result of our undertaking it forthcame and now we have to deliver <e>", "<cs> my lords only if the secretary of state is satisfied that the ncc has sounded out all bodies with a legitimate interest in the area can he then proceed himself <e> <s> if i may give some words of encouragement to the noble baroness an all-party conservation committee of both houses of parliament has written to the prime minister on this subject and the prime minister has asked my right honourable friends the secretaries of state for the environment for scotland and for wales to consider the matter when they meet to discuss the conservation and development programme for the united kingdom <e> <s> i am under the impression that the mnrs will be on that agenda <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most interested in the noble lords constructive suggestion <e> <s> i am confident that the majority of noble lords present would join me in deploring the fact that the num leadership has sought by violent means to sustain this strike without having called a national ballot <e> <s> i have no doubt that if such a ballot was held the majority would vote to accept this offer <e> <s> however i fear that in a ballot brought about by legislation the vote would not focus on the future of the coal industry <e> <s> the leaders of the num would inevitably seek to present such legislation as anti-miner and anti-trade union <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his remarks about my transfer to the department of the environment <e> <s> i must confess that i take it as a mixed blessing <e> <s> so far as his question about ballots is concerned i do not particularly want to be drawn into the legislative argument <e> <s> i know however that the whole house agrees that it is a great pity that a national ballot was not held in this case <e> <s> of the nacods strike due next week i would prefer not to do anything that would in any way infringe upon that at the moment but to say that i very much hope that it will not come off <e> <s> i say that for the same reason that was supported by the noble lord in his final argument <e> <s> what has been offered by acas an independent review body really does answer all their queries <e> <s> i am grateful to the labour party for using its influence with the num and nacods to make sure that they consider carefully that it is in the interests of the coal industry and the nation that they accept this reasonable compromise produced by acas <e>", "<cs> my lords yes yes and yes <e>", "<cs> my lords the national coal board of which mr macgregor is chairman is doing a very good job in order to try to get a productive coal industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what my noble friend says <e> <s> i agree with a great deal of it <e> <s> however i do not think that i should be drawn into this particular question <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e> <s> at respective question times i have laid great stress on the fact that this government look forward to the future of a good mining industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is well aware that is really a matter for the usual channels for which i am certainly not responsible <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe myself that the government have ensured that adequate funds are available for massive investments but we do not want to intervene to write a blank cheque for the taxpayer for the production of coal which is no longer of benefit to the industry and which is holding back the boards ability to develop the future of the industry <e> <s> as the noble lord is aware this present action is very fluid and i do not think i should comment any further <e>", "<cs> my lords i think the answer must be that the difference has always been very small <e> <s> it remains very small and in spite of the acas proposals for an independent review body

have said that this will be an opportunity for people to elect two bodies on the same day <e> <s> i asked the same question as my noble friend when i was given the briefing on this subject and of course this is a point which we can raise when we debate the abolition bill in the new year <e>", "<cs> my lords the idea is that this will be part of the abolition bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for the noble lords support and i am sorry that the right reverend prelate has not spoken also <e>", "<cs> my lords i welcome the debate initiated this evening by my noble friend lord nugent of guildford <e> <s> oil and gas on shore is a most topical subject and my recent spell away from environment at the department of energy has certainly given me an added insight into the subjects <e>

specifically about the governments intentions as to the draft circular produced by the department of the environment and the welsh office <e> <s> i can of course assure him that they are wholly honourable <e> <s> i can also respond in the knowledge that this is the most straightforward question to answer of the many asked this evening <e>", "<cs> my lords i will indeed pursue this subject generally with my noble friend <e> <s> later on in my notes i have something about technology <e>", "<cs> no my lords i would not agree with what the noble baroness says <e> <s> we are now going back over the ground covered in april <e> <s> at that stage a per cent <e> <s> increase in domestic prices was the subject of a challenge by the london electricity consultative council and the consultative council exercised its rights under statute formally to appeal <e> <s> this rise of per cent <e> <s> was agreed by the electricity council and duly came into force <e>", "<cs> my lords the electricity council proposed the per cent <e> <s> increase across the board which took place in the spring <e> <s> mr alex henney was not reappointed <e> <s> a new chairman has been appointed a mr bourne and we

baroness has said but i personally was very stimulated by mr henneys words and what he produced for the government and would welcome his reappointment if he wished to serve on the national council <e> <s> as far as the london council is concerned at the end of his three years he was not reappointed <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very difficult when the noble baroness produces a whole lot of sentences to know to which particular sentence one is replying <e> <s> as far as i am concerned the consultative council is at the moment in consultation with the ministry and i am sure that this will be to the benefit of all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that the noble baroness will have to wait for <e>", "<cs> my lords all i can say to the noble baroness is that as far as i am concerned when i was there she is totally wrong <e> <s> i initiated talks with the consumer councils with the chairman mr hatch and i understand that my successor is continuing these discussions <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> i have quite a lot to say on abolition and if i may i shall use that in my winding-up remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords this has indeed been a wide-ranging debate <e> <s> i do hope that the noble baroness lady nicol was in her seat when the noble lord lord lindsay of birker took us to maryland because that at least got us away from london for one speech <e>", "<cs> my lords that is of course the choice of the chairman himself <e> <s> in answer to the noble lord lord harris of greenwich i have to say that i agreed very much with the situation which he painted for us <e> <s> i was sad that he was against so many of our policies <e> <s> i noted that proportional representation was one of the answers he gave <e> <s> while i concede that it might have some benefit i cannot believe that it would be the cure-all in all these cases <e> <s> the noble lord produced the case of the newspapers in north london and i believe that this would be an ideal subject for the inquiry into abuses <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is too touchy my lords <e> <s> my remarks were not meant in the way she took them <e> <s> i meant that it was a sort of campaign which had been fostered by the glc <e> <s> in no way would i accuse the noble baroness of reading any of that sort of literature <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is ahead of me <e> <s> i think this underlines the fact that it will be better if we wait for the bill on this particular subject rather than have me try to answer specific questions now <e>", "<cs> my lords instead of being subject to the policies of the glc it will obviously be subject to the policies of the arts council which is funded by her majestys government <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time i saw the bill it consisted of just over clauses and was very much a bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> indeed the report he mentioned is being carefully studied as is the national economic development councils report <e> <s> in particular we are looking forward to the discussions with nedo at the february meeting <e> <s> but the fact remains that since the construction industry has been increasing its turnover <e>", "<cs> my lords i have not in point of fact seen the article to which the noble lord refers <e> <s> i shall look at it immediately after question time <e> <s> however i believe that the help which the industry is receiving through the governments economic policies is formidable and the lowering of interest rates will help the construction industry in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is too early to tell at the moment <e> <s> decisions have not yet been fully taken on for instance the split between capital expenditure and current expenditure from which an estimate of total spending on construction can be determined <e> <s> i hope that when the white paper is published in january i can be more specific in what i say to the noble baroness <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comment <e>", "<cs> my lords as i said to the noble baroness we shall be publishing the white paper in january or thereabouts <e> <s> i have indeed taken note of the cbi and tuc policy reports and these will be studied along with the nedo report <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to be drawn into discussing specific figures with the noble lord on this question <e> <s> but during and also i think in the current year we have seen a fairly steady rate of employment in the construction industry <e> <s> i understand that the self-employed element has gone up slightly while the other has stayed almost the same <e> <s> as for the future we hope very much that the upturn in the construction industry will be related to increased employment as i am sure the whole house will wish <e>", "<cs> my lords i again hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> i hope that he will take some comfort from the construction industrys turnover in the last two years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their welcome of this particular statement <e> <s> to answer some of the questions raised by the noble lord lord graham of edmonton and taking first the european aspect let me say that with exceptions the cars that we buy in the united kingdom come from an industry which is organised on a european basis and we need to do everything we can to enable this industry to prosper <e> <s> that means proceeding on a european basis if at all possible <e> <s> but the european commission proposal in another directive that all new cars should run on

available in the united kingdom for those drivers who are keen to use it and whose cars can run on it will be most welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the point about a white paper i shall of course bring it to the attention of my right honourable friend <e> <s> on the point about a paper i understand that it was a fairly short paper which was put before the european community <e> <s> i shall ensure that either a copy of it is placed in the library or that my noble friend is sent a copy of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble baronesses for their personal welcome to me if not to the statement <e> <s> may i say to the noble baroness lady birk that all authorities budgeting this year to spend three-quarters per cent or more below gre are getting targets for next year which will allow spending to increase in line with inflation by per cent <e> <s> even the lowest spenders targets this year implied real-term cuts of about per cent <e> <s> that comparison shows clearly how it has been possible to discharge to the letter the undertaking given to the house last january <e> <s> on top of that we have given a modest extra improvement to targets to those authorities spending at or very close to target as well as below gre <e> <s> these are allowed up to a per cent <e> <s> increase in spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his welcome of this statement <e> <s> of course the government will take their own responsibilities for any increases necessary in the spring <e> <s> may i say at the beginning that i hope it will not be necessary for per cent <e> <s> to be the level of increase but we shall certainly take our share of responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult for me to answer the specific questions which the noble baroness has asked without the figures we all need to have in front of us <e> <s> so far as the future increased expenditure is concerned the figure i mentioned i believe the noble baroness mentioned it as well of million we believe to be a step in the right direction <e> <s> it should not lead to cuts in expenditure on the social and other resources of the counties <e> <s> until we have seen the figures in more detail i cannot answer the noble baroness more clearly <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that it applies to all civil defence expenditure on capital and current account <e>", "<cs> my lords i was aware of some of the statistics that the noble baroness has given me <e> <s> she will no doubt have seen the exchange on rd december <e> <s> of course this is a new scheme <e> <s>

department was reliant upon information provided by keepers which was not always as accurate as we would have liked <e> <s> however i have looked into this carefully and i do believe that as the data basis improves our knowledge we shall become more efficient in this particular sphere <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand my noble friends question <e> <s> obviously i am not yet in a position to comment on this bill as it has not been published <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend that the chances would obviously be better for the clause which he has in mind if the bill did not contain other controversial matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot accept my noble friends criticism of hikers in this way but of course i understand the point he is making <e> <s> i believe the royal society for the protection of birds does a great deal of work in this particular sphere <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as the fines are concerned the maximum fine is for an offence under section <e> <s> for other

"<cs> my lords i must confess that i was wondering how the noble baroness was going to get that over <e> <s> in answer to her first question the rate support grant will continue to equalise the rate

the running of hampstead heath <e> <s> i personally should very much like to see that done by the boroughs <e>", "<cs> my lords to start with we shall of course be debating this subject when it comes to the house in the spring <e> <s> secondly there is a residuary body which will be set up to iron out such problems <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy to tell the noble lord that the historic buildings and monuments commission which is taking on kenwood house is intending to keep the concerts going <e> <s> it wishes to maintain the present standards and even try to improve them <e>", "<cs> my lords that sounds delightfully simple in this house but i can assure the noble lord that if he went to barnet he would have a very rough reception <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord lord hatch was referring to the lakeside concerts and certainly my reply was directed to them <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble baronesss point and i hope that she will also accept mine when i say that hampstead heath could well be run by the local authority and its borough which in this case is camden <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords it is quite difficult to get a response from camden <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that when we have an opportunity to debate this matter perhaps at committee stage parliament will be able to do just that <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for the fact that i do not have the answer to the question on hainault forest <e> <s> i remember that the noble lord raised that matter last time <e> <s> whereas i have walked over hampstead heath and paced the acreage i am afraid that i have not yet done so in hainault forest <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is another question which can wait until next tuesday <e>", "<cs> my lords we have a record of achievement in this area of which we are proud but we shall do more <e> <s> the progressive implementation of part ii of the control of pollution act our commitment to introduce unleaded petrol by and the significant increases we have announced in funding for the nature conservancy council and the countryside commission are among the many examples of our approach in different sectors of the environment and we

conservancy council and to the countryside commission in the recent announcements as a good step forward <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i have not read my honourable colleagues statement but it sounds very wise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am only too well aware of the debate on this subject going on in the country <e> <s> i assure the noble lord that we listen very carefully to all the comments <e>", "<cs> no my lords i cannot really agree with the noble lord <e> <s> i find it amazing that an industry which has seen its output grow by per cent <e> <s> this year should be described as being in decline <e> <s> in regard to unemployment i am pleased to say that the latest figures for the employees in employment show a per cent increase <e>", "<cs> no my lords we are not <e> <s> these are figures which i have been given and which have been drawn out from other reports <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware that the front bench opposite wants stimulation in this field <e> <s> but as the noble lord is equally aware we believe there is benefit from a low rate of inflation and the scope for tax cuts <e> <s> this we believe will really benefit the construction industry <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall indeed convey those comments to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased to say that our figures for new orders show an increase in the industry of per cent <e> <s> so far this year compared with the same period last year <e> <s> that on the whole is supported by the private sector <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall now repeat a statement being made in another place by my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment on local authority capital expenditure <e> <s> the statement reads as follows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested in the responses to the statement from the two noble baronesses <e> <s> first may i say that as regards the effect on the construction industry i believe it will be much less than is claimed in some quarters <e> <s> the recovery seen in the construction industry is being led by the private sector <e> <s> output in the first three-quarters of this year in constant prices is around billion up on the same period a year ago an increase of nearly per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i am fully supportive of the right-to-buy and believe that it was one of the best actions taken by the conservative party <e> <s> i am delighted that we have done it <e> <s> the fact that we now have such a lot of cash flowing in fact some billion is partly the reason for this statement <e> <s> i remind the noble lord that this money is still available to the councils hut they can spend only per cent <e> <s> next year whereas they can spend per cent <e> <s> this year <e> <s> however they still have that money to use as they think fit <e>", "<cs> my lords the money is there and the local authorities can use it to repay debt <e> <s> they can invest it or they could for example use it against an overdraft <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have the central government figure in front of me being of course responsible only for the other <e>", "<cs> my lords it was <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps briefly i may return to the order and say that both houses of parliament agreed that it was right to put on the statute book what is now part ii of the local government interim provisions act <e> <s> that is of course a provision to suspend elections <e> <s> the principle is <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend says that he hopes very often <e> <s> when i look at the majority of in the other place for clause i stand part i am quite jealous <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not really agree with my noble friend <e> <s> requiring the water authorities to achieve a rate of return on their asset is a sound business practice and it ensures that resources are used to the best advantage with which principle the noble lord lord bruce of donington as an accountant would no doubt agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i read the exchange last week which the noble baroness had with my noble friend lord skelmersdale and i am glad that she took the same reading of it as i did <e> <s> the point is that the consumer committees can have this information and indeed they should have it and i very much hope they do have this information <e>", "<cs> my lords somebody else has to pay <e> <s> the higher returns will allow the water authorities to undertake more investment in water services and sewerage and next year the higher investment is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for the supplementary question <e> <s> i think that the government are right in considering that the water authoritys present average rate of return of per cent <e> <s> is too low and the higher targets will allow water authorities to increase their investment and reduce their borrowing <e>", "<cs> my lords the water authorities are obliged to consult their consumer consultative committees well in advance before deciding upon proposals <e> <s> i am advised that we have had active correspondence with the consultative committees and that representations from them look to be encouraging and appear to be indicating that the system is working as it should <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is ahead of me on the editorial in the <e>", "<cs> my lords i have already said to the house that the rate of return of per cent <e> <s> is too low and we believe that per cent <e> <s> would be about right <e> <s> i do not think that that really quantifies with that particular article <e>", "<cs> my lords water service charges are a relatively small part of bills and are taken into account when supplementary benefit is calculated <e> <s> some million householders get help in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords i will not argue with the noble baronesss figure but my figure should have been per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble lord that the government are not holding any of the local authorities money <e> <s> the cash from the sale of assets remains in their hands <e> <s> what my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment is proposing is that the use of such receipts for additional capital expenditure by the authorities should be spread over a longer period of time than hitherto in order to help keep total local authority capital expenditure within the levels allowed for in the governments public expenditure plans <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure about a copper-bottomed guarantee but i can assure the noble lord that local authorities will be able to use this money <e> <s> they can put the money on deposit repay debt or offset borrowing as they have done in the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords we are indeed reducing the rate from per cent <e> <s> this year to per cent <e> <s> next year <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding is that they treat it as capital but this is a case where the particular sum of money which the noble lord opposite just mentioned is out of all proportion to what it was expected to be <e> <s> i am delighted that sales have successfully reached billion but obviously this is a sum of money which it is impossible to allow to be floating about <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not go along with everything that has been said lately about this matter <e> <s> myself i believe that opportunities exist and that the housing starts which were begun this year have been an encouraging sign that the private sector is leading the house-building industry <e>", "<cs> my lords it is very much up to local authorities it is up to them to do what they like maybe they will repay debt <e>", "<cs> my lords the government are looking at the neddy report and will be responding <e> <s> myself i believe that the world banks -nation comparative study showed a strong correlation between low tax and rapid economic and employment growth <e> <s> i believe that the research which has shown that tax cuts have a better effect on job creation and price inflation than the alternative to cuts <e>", "<cs> is right <e>", "<cs> my lords if they are more successful then there would be more than billion <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may reply to the noble baroness and the noble lord <e> <s> i am grateful to them for their reception of the statement and for the even-handed way in which they are looking at this problem <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness that it is important that the public know that the public are brought along and that the public are informed about government thinking on this subject <e> <s> i believe also that it is very necessary that a clear understanding of the problems attached to this particular nuclear waste are understood by people so that they do not get into a panic about it when such clear directives are being laid down <e>", "<cs> my lords sea dumping does of course remain an option but its resumption will depend on the results of relevant international reviews which are currently proceeding and the best practical environmental options study recommended by holliday <e> <s> we have all discovered over the past few years that however one proceeds with this matter the government must bring the public along with them <e> <s> i believe that sea dumping in particular is a case in point <e> <s> before we can proceed further we must not only look at these reports but also try to educate the people involved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am told that the figure includes some imported waste but i do not know the proportion i shall let the noble baroness know what it is <e> <s> my understanding is that the term involved is not as long as the noble baroness suggests <e> <s> again i shall let her know the answer to that question <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not cavil with one word of what the noble baroness says <e> <s> in fact i think i agree with every word <e>", "<cs> my lords as so often with new town measures we have had a stimulating debate <e> <s> i was moderately happy with some of the remarks that the noble lord lord graham made until he called the bill avaricious and grubby <e> <s> whatever else it is certainly neither of those <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of eskan mentioned improvident haste and asked for an assurance that there is no prospect of a sudden turning-off of the tap <e> <s> i assure him that there is no improvident haste nor will there be any sudden turning-off of a tap <e> <s> the noble lord almost led me astray on the definition of old towns and new towns and those that we shall come to next <e> <s> i sympathise with the noble lord <e> <s> i do not think that i shall follow him along that line <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord graham is totally aware that that is the very reason why the decision is being reconsidered <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord graham for welcoming this order <e> <s> i too have seen the metro have been very impressed by it and indeed have been shown how it works <e> <s> i assure him and add to the pledges of my honourable friend the minister of transport mrs chalker by saying that we are looking forward to a successful and expanding metro system <e> <s> in no way do we expect that the abolition next year will have anything but a beneficial effect on the railway <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble baronesses for their support and particularly to the noble baroness lady birk for saying that the inquiry was both an important and timely contribution <e> <s> to answer some of their specific questions the noble baroness lady birk asked about paragraph <e>", "<cs> i think that the answer is to that is that it certainly may rather than will <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his welcome and also for his support in agreeing that the inquiry is necessary <e> <s> i agree with him that unfortunately a small number of abuses in a small number of places have led to this rather sizeable inquiry <e> <s> so far as local government finance is concerned i can confirm that the studies on this are progressing <e> <s> in fact i attended a seminar on it only last weekend <e>", "<cs> my lords when i replied to the noble baroness i very carefully read out the actual wording here so that i should not get it wrong <e> <s> i hope that she will read <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly would not preclude the possibility that the inquiry might wish to consider the role of the ombudsman in the checking of abuses but i think we should leave that actually to the committee to decide <e>", "<cs> my lords it specifically says in the statement that the structure will be outside the terms of reference <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords and particularly to the noble lord lord diamond and i hope to help him in my responses to the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i hope that at the end of my remarks he will conclude as i have concluded that there is no need to pursue this matter any further <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i understand it haringey still does not know the assumptions <e> <s> what haringey has managed to do is to work out the figures <e> <s> mr gale telephoned in december and produced a very good projection of million <e> <s> he actually said at that time that the figure might be between million and million <e> <s> on being told that that was about right he went even further and produced his figures <e> <s> however he still does not have the assumptions behind the secretary of states workings <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i touched on that <e> <s> i said earlier that it was we who proposed and we are waiting for the counter-proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with what the noble lord says about information but at one stage he used the word treat and with that i cannot agree we do not treat <e> <s> nothing improper has occurred <e> <s> some minority groups are rightly disturbed about the effects of a majority groups policies <e> <s> where the minority group provides information the secretary of state has a legal duty to take account of that information and that is what has happened <e>", "<cs> my lords on these occasions i think it is normal practice not to have political meetings within ones department <e> <s> i think it was absolutely right to have the meeting at conservative central office <e>", "<cs> my lords no i could not possibly give that categorical cry that the noble lord has asked for <e> <s> nor of course can i actually say that they will be permitted to be reduced from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> but that is what the government have proposed <e> <s> the noble lord will forgive me but i cannot possibly go further than that or rather i could go a little further and say that i am certainly sure at the moment that there are no thoughts whatever of reducing it below per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may come back to what noble lords have said about vat i think that one noble lord referred to vat on alterations and extensions <e> <s> i can perhaps say at the outset that the budget did not in any way affect a liability of the construction industry and its clients to pay vat on repairs and maintenance <e> <s> such work was subject to vat at the standard rate before last years budget and nothing has changed therefore <e>", "<cs> my lords i have a note to come back to the noble lord lord dean of beswick on the subject of insulation to which he also referred <e> <s> in my old life at the department of energy we had to negotiate quite a lot with the department of the

year <e> <s> at the moment we do not even know what the interest rate will be at the beginning of the next financial year <e>", "<cs> indeed my lords of course the very fact that local authorities are rate-capped means that they may have more problems with their loans but those problems are of their own making <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> this amendment would add to the considerations to which the commission has to have regard the need to achieve certain levels of population and employment <e> <s> as the noble

develop land or make any gifts of land <e> <s> for that reason alone i would hesitate to recommend that your lordships countenance this amendment <e> <s> however i do not want to rest merely on that <e>", "<cs> to answer the noble lord lord graham the disposal targets of each new town are settled in the light of all factors listed by the noble lord <e> <s> the demands of the treasury are settled in the light of what is possible <e> <s> we discuss with the towns what is possible and the targets take account of that <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the noble lord an undertaking on this matter but in all honesty i cannot <e> <s> however on my reading of the matter in this particular aspect the treasury certainly comes second if i may put it that way <e> <s> there is no question that the new towns do not have their own particular ability to deal as they wish without having to look over their shoulders at the treasury <e>", "<cs> these two amendments were also put down and considered in the other place <e> <s> the first would make any orders transferring the commissions residual property obligations and the like when the commission itself is to be wound up subject to affirmative resolution of both houses of parliament <e> <s> the second amendment to which the noble lord lord graham addressed most of his time would mean that instead of being able to transfer such residual property to accountable public authorities that is statutory corporations the majority of whose members are appointed by ministers the property would have to go to local authorities <e>", "<cs> the point i was trying to make in my remarks was that the local authorities would have had the opportunity to take what they liked and do what they wished <e> <s> what we are talking about now is the residual element which they have not wanted and probably therefore do not want <e>", "<cs> i am surprised at the amount of doubt on this clause that the two noble lords have expressed the noble lord lord graham of edmonton at considerably more length than the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran as i had thought that the provision was wanted and was what everybody needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all members of the house for their generous welcome of this bill <e> <s> i assure the speakers tonight that i have no intention of keeping anybody in the dark or indeed of covering anything in fertiliser <e> <s> i look forward to the discussion of a number of issues at committee stage <e> <s> if tonight i find that i have not covered any particular factual points i shall write <e> <s> the noble viscount lord craigavon in his short speech asked whether we would look at the retrospective point <e> <s> we are considering the amendment and we shall be doing exactly that <e> <s> at the moment it is in course of discussion with my colleagues to see what we can do about it <e> <s> i am sympathetic to the noble viscounts point <e>", "<cs> my lords when i say in the fray of course i know we are all in such harmony that i look forward to a very charming committee stage <e> <s> i think that what i can suggest to the committee is that it is necessary here to keep a balance all the time <e> <s> it is one of those occasions where we have to try to make sure that all the interests are looked after <e> <s> i shall read <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i would indeed agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord speaks words of wisdom and perhaps rather appropriately in the very week when we have a situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords <e> <s> on the agreements i think that over the past year we have had enough talk from mr scargill to last us for a very long time <e> <s> with regard to the amnesty no one can in any way condone the acts of serious violence intimidation or vandalism <e> <s> however men may have been dismissed for offences of a very much less serious nature for example unruly but not violent or intimidatory behaviour or trivial theft <e> <s> in such cases it will be up to the ncb to show what moderation it wishes by either reinstating or re-engaging such men <e> <s> the conciliation machinery is there and therefore can be used <e>", "<cs> my lords i join with the noble lord lord shinwell in describing it as an intolerable situation an intolerable strike an intolerable dispute and i also join with him in praising the police <e> <s> i think his mathematics have gone a trifle awry <e> <s> when he said years ago i think perhaps it was a mistake for years ago <e> <s> however that is as may be <e> <s> there has been no victory <e> <s> the prime minister herself said yesterday and i quote now off the top of my head words to the effect that it is all over and nobody has won <e>", "<cs> no i have not my lords the noble and learned lord is quite correct <e> <s> what i am trying to say is that those people who have been charged with offences will have the opportunity to <e>", "<cs> will have the ability to go to conciliation <e>", "<cs> my lords i can say that without hesitation <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as concerns the number of colliery faces lost i understand it to be in the region of <e> <s> as far as concerns the number of jobs that will be lost there has been no evaluation there <e> <s> i also think it is a little too early to give the other figure for which my noble friend asked <e>", "<cs> i should like to welcome the noble baroness lady birk to this stage of the bill and at the same time to commiserate with the noble lord lord graham <e> <s> i am sure that he would have wished to be here and i send him all good messages <e> <s> with respect to the noble baroness section has an important function which should be retained <e> <s> when permission is given by a development order this creates certain expectations on which people rely <e> <s> they incure expenditure on professional fees they enter into contracts to undertake development permitted by the order <e> <s> it would be quite wrong to retain the powers to withdraw the permission whether by amendment of the order or by directions under article without the entitlement to compensation for those who have not actually begun the work but have incurred expenditure in reliance on the permission <e>", "<cs> as i imagine that the noble baroness may wish to keep her powder dry for the next amendment perhaps i may speak now <e> <s> as my noble <e>", "<cs> i happily undertake to look into this for my noble friend <e>", "<cs> as the noble baroness says we have already dealt with a lot of this <e> <s> this amendment raises some fundamental issues which require considerable thought and it is perhaps unfortunate that we are being asked to decide them without any opportunity for widespread consultation or public debate <e> <s> i know and indeed we have heard that the farming community in particular is deeply concerned that the amendments if adopted would encourage the widespread use of article directions to control agricultural development in sensitive areas so circumventing the need for compensation to be paid under the provisions of the wildlife and countryside act <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has ably argued the case for treating agricultural development differently from other development for the purposes of the time limit which the bill introduces on the compensation entitlement in section of the town and country planning act <e>", "<cs> i should be happy to give the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran that undertaking <e> <s> perhaps i could ask him to consult with his own lobby <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mottistone took my words somewhat out of context <e> <s> i was giving examples of the dangers of generalising when i mentioned mineral workings <e> <s> however the provision of a five-year period for applications to be made after a development order amendment without loss of compensation rights would simply be an invitation to unscrupulous landowners to work up and submit applications which do not relate to genuine development proposals but are primarily intended to obtain compensation <e> <s> the basis of this bill is that compensation should be paid only when the landowner had begun to incur expenditure on the basis of the development order permission before it was taken away and in nearly all circumstances it seems reasonable to expect such a landowner to be able to put in his planning application within months <e>", "<cs> of course i shall do that <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord sandford has explained the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where the secretary of state upholds on appeal a refusal of planning permission which gives rise to an entitlement to compensation he should meet that cost <e> <s> i do not see why this particular burden should fall on the secretary of state <e> <s> it is a general rule that compensation for planning decisions is payable by the local planning authority <e> <s> the fact that compensation may be payable is clearly a matter which local planning authorities take into account when considering a planning application and i appreciate the argument that local planning authorities are reluctant to use powers where a compensation liability may arise even though as was the case with the hazardous development order it is highly desirable for them to have those powers <e> <s> that of course is a main reason for the proposal in the bill to restrict the compensation liability under this section <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend and i shall be quiet <e>", "<cs> if i may i will finish on the landscape development orders <e> <s> as regards my noble friends amendment when considering the legislation that we should put before parliament to deal with the peaktop properties decisions we gave thought to the proposition that section should be repealed <e> <s> we acknowledge it can be argued that the rights given by this section are not longer appropriate but we consider that rights to compensation should not be taken away lightly and that section still plays a part in the value at which land changes hands <e> <s> moreover apart from the matter of penthouse development we are not aware that the entitlement to compensation under section is being abused <e> <s> we therefore decided to make only a limited change in this bill designed to put right the known abuse <e>", "<cs> i thought that the noble lord lord hunt was about to get to his feet <e>", "<cs> i think that i have to resist this amendment <e> <s> the abuse of section relates to extensions to blocks of flats <e> <s> it does not relate to offices it does not relate to shops and it does not relate to restaurants or other commercial premises <e> <s> the only argument for extending the provisions of the bill in this way is surely that section compensation rights are obsolete and as i made clear in my second reading speech and indeed on an earlier amendment that is not what we believe <e> <s> we could simply have <e>", "<cs> i was intrigued at second reading when the noble lord referred to the school in the isle of wight <e> <s> it is possible to postulate circumstances where this bill would affect the noble lords school <e> <s> they would involve the refusal of planning permission to enlarge by up to per cent <e> <s> a building in existence on st july which contained two or more flats <e> <s> but i wonder whether this situation arises very often <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may respond to the previous amendment of the noble lord <e> <s> the onus will be on me to write to him <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness for putting her case so well and also to my noble friend lord sandford for supporting her <e> <s> extensions to listed buildings require a separate <e>", "<cs> my noble friend has slightly astonished me because i thought he had already spoken to this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> certainly i have no more to add so i hope that he will read my earlier reply <e>", "<cs> there is nothing more i can add to what i have already said in my response to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i will willingly read it out again but i hope that it is not necessary <e> <s> the provision of a five-year period across the board will be likely to undo much of the effect of this part of the bill because of the possibilities that it will provide for abuse <e> <s> i then asked my noble friend to look at it again <e>", "<cs> i recognise what my noble friend lord mottistone has said <e> <s> it is unusual to bring planning legislation into operation from the date of introduction although in fact such a provision is not uncommon in fiscal legislation <e> <s> the reason why we are proposing such a retrospective provision is perfectly simple <e> <s> we are shutting off a possibility of abuse which was being increasingly exploited <e> <s> if we had not made the provision retrospective i have no doubt that many more unacceptable planning applications would have been submitted during the passage of the bill so that its purpose would effectively have been frustrated <e> <s> that would he quite unacceptable <e> <s> i accept of course that there may have been some <e>", "<cs> my lords i can take issue with the noble lord about something which came up in the debate which he raised the other day that is quite simply that the growth in the construction industry over the past four years has been steady and increasing <e> <s> that does not i admit take us into <e> <s> the other point which was raised by the noble lord is in fact being voted on next week in the house of commons and i believe we should leave it like that <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be happy to do so but the matter is being voted on next week in an order <e> <s> meanwhile i have not actually made my response to the letter which i received from the federation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that i cannot comment on the accuracy of any such figures <e> <s> i suggest to the noble lord that he waits until the cegb annual accounts are out <e> <s> all that matters to her majestys government is the total effect of the strike on public sector cash flow <e> <s> the accounting losses of individual industries are only one input to that equation <e> <s> i understand that during the budget statement my right honourable friend is going to seek to provide an updated assessment on the cost of the strike and that of course will be the governments <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an interesting suggestion <e>", "<cs> my lords again it is too early for us to produce any overall picture <e> <s> i can only suggest that my noble friend waits with patience <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for bringing our attention to the coal conversion scheme <e> <s> this did not of course go very well over the past months <e> <s> we very much hope that it will now go a lot better <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a little wide of the question <e>", "<cs> my lords the section requires the ncb to aim to avoid persistent losses on revenue account <e> <s> the governments policy is aimed at restoring the coal industry to financial viability so that it can start to earn a satisfactory return on its assets <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe there is any conflict between section <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble lord says seems to make admirable sense and i look forward to looking at it tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord said and again i will look at it tomorrow <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lords supplementary question correctly i cannot agree with him that there is a million <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord taylor for his reception of this statement <e> <s> i am rather astonished by the reactions of the noble lord lord stoddart <e> <s> i am particularly astonished that there should be any question of stalin or anybody being chained up <e> <s> i thought that what we were doing was easing the chains <e> <s> i find it extraordinary that he should have such a reaction about something which saves the public an unnecessary expense which is why we have moved swiftly to save them from a corporation which is no longer required <e>", "<cs> my lords my understanding of my noble friends question was to ask me why we were doing this and the answer i thought is basically in the different operation of the market <e> <s> there is now so much oil being dealt with at spot prices that the question no longer arises <e> <s> do i hear my noble friend say that that is not true <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his clarification <e> <s> concerning his question on consultation no we did not <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot honestly say that i have the answer to that question today <e> <s> i hope that i can find it for the noble lord and write to him <e> <s> the one figure i do know is that we shall receive back three-quarters of the cost of bnoc as a result of tax <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> the original statement says that we shall retain the participation agreements themselves so that we can activate them to have access to these oil supplies should the need arise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am astonished that the noble lord should speak in these terms on a measure which i find to be totally explicable <e> <s> no consultations have taken place because of the risk of speculation about the changes in the oil market <e> <s> the chairman of bnoc was asked to come in this morning and he was told of the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i am informed that his reactions were what any good civil servants reactions would be <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not get the noble lords supplementary question <e> <s> is the noble lord asking why my right honourable friend changed his mind over the space of three weeks <e>", "<cs> my lords the answer is that the situation has changed in the oil market structure <e> <s> bnoc can no longer make a contribution to stability the terms under which it acquires participation oil have developed a strong potential for destabilising the market <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his appreciation that i am doing my best <e> <s> i will certainly go through the normal channels to see what can be done <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it the select committee considers that bnoc should move to setting term prices for shorter periods and in more direct relationship with market values in preference to the alternative of strengthening bnocs ability to stabilise the short-term market by allowing it to invest in storage and intervene more actively in the forward market <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord and i will be able to discuss this again at some later date <e>", "<cs> my lords i would underline everything that the noble lord lord shinwell has said <e> <s> indeed we have got an enormous pride in what is going on in the north sea and that pride will in no way be abashed by this particular measure <e> <s> the noble lord might like to know that the north sea oil production which we are getting at the moment represents per cent <e> <s> of the oil production of the world <e> <s> therefore on the taxation situation as i mentioned to the noble lord lord taylor we can have another look at this shortly <e>", "<cs> my lords without having a look at <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not absolutely certain about that <e> <s> the financial provision for subsidence damage is i think a matter for the board <e> <s> an estimate for will be given in the boards annual report to be published in august this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware that it does but i shall let my noble friend know <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes his case by a bit of exaggeration but i agree with him that this can happen <e>", "<cs> my lords inasmuch as the national coal board is a centralised institution that is indeed the case <e> <s> i believe it is board policy at the moment to repair subsidence damage rather than pay cash compensation thus helping to maintain the nations housing stock avoiding dereliction and blight and assuring those living in mining areas that their environment is not to be sacrificed in the interests of the nations need for coal <e>", "<cs> my lords not without prior notice <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for clarifying what the noble lord asked earlier <e> <s> i was not aware of that but i shall find out about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not aware of that <e> <s> i am sure that the agreements would have been to the best advantage of everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords i can only thank the noble lord for his wisdom about those earlier days <e>"]
