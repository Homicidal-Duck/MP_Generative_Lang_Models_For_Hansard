["<cs> my lords i too wish to commence my remarks with congratulations to the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester for his maiden speech full of wisdom and perhaps rather a rare speech because just as town and gown are always supposed to be at variance bishops and deans are supposed <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not intervene in this debate when the subject was raised at the committee stage <e> <s> i want to speak for only one minute now and raise two points one of which has not been sufficiently emphasised <e> <s> i believe that farmers and landlords are going to be under greater pressure to maximise their assets than they have ever been since the act came into being <e> <s> we must realise that there will be very much greater pressure on farmers in the future to maximise their land to be able to carry more sheep and cattle <e> <s> that is a danger that we have not had emphasised enough in this debate <e> <s> owing to the political state of farming the matter is more urgent now than it was <e>", "<cs> my lords from my own experience may i add to that that i have succeeded in two prosecutions this year for dogs coming into a field and worrying sheep <e> <s> in both cases the owners of the dogs were prosecuted by the police <e> <s> in one case the dogs were put down and in the other case i am not sure what happened to the dogs but the owners were fined <e> <s> there is a law against sheep worrying <e>", "<cs> my lords if that was not a diocesan view i have with me a copy of what was in that circular or diocesan news may i ask whether it was ever controverted by the diocese or by any man senior to the man who wrote it <e> <s> or is it still standing for anybody who reads <e>", "<cs> my lords i am honoured at being the first person to be able to speak from these benches in congratulation of the two maiden speakers that we have heard tonight <e> <s> the noble lord lord dacre of glanton as yet probably better known as hugh trevor-roper to his enormous body of admirers outside and inside this house has shown how greatly we are to be advantaged by his having come among us here <e> <s> may he speak often and on that wide variety of subjects including history which he has at his command <e> <s> to the noble duke the duke of portland may i say better much much better late than never <e> <s> we welcome him also very much among us the bearer of his great title <e> <s> he brings with him a very great knowledge and experience of the new world of african affairs <e> <s> may he also often speak in this house <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble baroness my lords for telling me there is a cheaper model <e> <s> but it is not a handy little book that you can use it is a reference book which tells you all sorts of alternatives <e> <s> it is a very difficult book to understand at first sight <e> <s> of course it has not been in print for very long and i have not had very much time to study it but you really cannot get on unless you start reading how you are to use it <e> <s> you need to read page for instance the general notes which are called distinctions in the text <e> <s> it goes on <e>", "<cs> because my lords the assurance was that new forms of service for all the services holy communion matins evensong marriage and so on would be agreed upon by the synod and published in an alternative service book but that the old service book would remain to be used on occasions when it was wanted <e>", "<cs> i was for a short time chairman of the forestry commission although that was years ago and during that time i may have been under a gross misapprehension i was always told we were not a government department <e> <s> i was told that the commission did not go to a department either but went direct to its ministers <e> <s> when we asked why not for tidiness call the minister of agriculture the minister of agriculture fisheries forestry and food <e> <s> putting another f in his title we were told that would be quite inappropriate <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> as the amendment as it now stands is defective as has been said and as the noble lord lord dulverton is not here to move it because of the lateness of the hour and his having to catch a train i would simply like to back up everything that the noble lord lord sandford has said <e> <s> it is only quite recently that i read section of the forestry act and it is quite astonishing that that clause <e>", "<cs> i will delay the committee briefly in commenting in support of the amendment <e> <s> i was glad to hear the noble baroness lady jeger quote the long title of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should just like to add that i hope that the committee will take note of what the noble earl has said <e> <s> it is a pity to make these commissions too big <e> <s> it is also perhaps a pity to lay down what qualifications each person must have <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe will remember that when he and i were both commissioners together we had an absolutely first-class trade unionist on the commission who was neither a forester nor an agricultural worker <e> <s> i cannot remember whether gwyn davies was a steel worker or a coal worker but he certainly came from south wales and no one could have asked for a better representative of the trade union movement there <e> <s> i think that is better than laying down that you must have a statutory trade unionist a statutory woman a <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke briefly when this point was discussed in committee and having listened very carefully to this debate this evening i feel that we should be unwise to support the amendment of my noble friend lord sandford <e> <s> it has often been said that the pathway to hell is paved with good intentions <e> <s> i do not think that this is a particularly good bill <e> <s> i had hoped very much that it might be possible for ministers to come back to the house and slightly to ameliorate the severity of clause <e> <s> this is a very short bill and i think that it is too short <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perhaps appropriate that i should make a small contribution to this debate as one who lives on the english side of the bristol channel and indeed not far from the coast <e> <s> i am not a scientist i am not an engineer and i am not by any stretch of the imagination an economist so i shall speak on the assumption that the work which has been done by the committee and as set out in the report has established beyond reasonable doubt firstly that a barrage for generating a significant proportion of the electricity demand of england and wales is technically feasible secondly that what is described as the inner barrage that is one running from brean down just below weston-super-mare on the english side to lavernock point just below cardiff and above barry in wales is the most economically viable and could generate per cent <e> <s> of the present electricity demand for the whole of england and wales and thirdly that though the cost of this inner barrage scheme is estimated at million with running costs of some million per annum this can be shown to be economic in the sense that it would show a rate of return greater than the per cent <e> <s> currently required by the treasury for investment in the public sector <e>", "<cs> most noble lords who have spoken have asked to be excused from having an interest <e> <s> i do not have quite the same interests as the noble lord lord northbourne although i am a member of the cla and of the nfu i used to be a landlord and am now a tenant <e> <s> i have another and perhaps unique interest to declare <e> <s> i had the duty to introduce from the front bench of this house in some years ago the tiresome words open market about which we are now all arguing for precisely the same reasons that this bill is now before your lordships that the arbitration procedure laid down by the act was not working in the way laid down in the act although for entirely different reasons <e> <s> we were not then able to blame a labour governments introduction of too secure a tenancy the act <e> <s> but if i can remember back years we were frightened about the tenant occupiers rent being distorted if the arbitrator had to rely entirely on the prudent landlord and the willing tenant <e> <s> we were bothered whether that was quite sufficient <e>", "<cs> i do not propose to follow the point on the scottish law but may i ask the minister when he replies on this amendment to confirm that if it is passed or if it is withdrawn to be used as a basis of negotiation it will leave intact something in the act which is of extreme importance <e> <s> i read from the <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend very much <e> <s> but even if the point does not arise on this amendment i still think it is very important for it to be retained in any new legislation <e> <s> it will defuse a lot of the fears and problems which will arise if we go into a more legalistic situation <e> <s> it has been stressed this afternoon and the noble lord lord walston and my noble friend lord belstead mentioned it earlier that there have been few arbitrations up to now and few if any arbitration cases have been taken to the courts but they may occur in future <e>", "<cs> must we not keep in mind all the time the effect that this will have on the third party <e> <s> is this the comparable rent which the arbitrator will have to take into account on the next door farm <e>", "<cs> i am sure that the minister will respond constructively as he has done all the way <e>", "<cs> we have had support from all sides of the committee and i should have thought that it would be seen as an omission to leave out this amendment from this new piece of legislation on agricultural holdings when the whole question of nature conservation is so much in the public eye and when so many of the big landlords such as the duchy of cornwall with which i used to be associated but i am not now and i do not speak for them take this matter so very seriously <e> <s> it would strengthen those who are trying to make these voluntary agreements work both private and public corporations if there was some reference of this sort in the act <e> <s> i hope that this can be in this bill when it becomes an act and i hope that this clause will be supported <e>", "<cs> if this debate is to continue i think we should remind ourselves that we are trying to legislate we are not bound to legislate in any way to give effect to the so-called package and agreements that were before us and were brought in by the meetings of the cla the landowners and the tenants <e> <s> this would be very far outside the whole basis of what they agreed upon together and in that sense it would justify the term used by my noble friend lord stanley of alderley a wrecking amendment <e> <s> that is from their point of view although of course parliament is entitled to legislate how it likes <e> <s> but we are trying and we have so far succeeded i think to keep within the bounds of the agreement made by the two sides of the industry <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with every word that the noble lord opposite has said if i may say so <e> <s> i said though that we must bear in mind that we were trying if we could and i was one of those who would like to if i could to legislate within the consensus and not go against it <e> <s> this would go against that consensus and i am merely reminding noble lords of that <e>", "<cs> my lords may i briefly say that i have sat through all stages of this bill <e> <s> i also sat through all the stages of the bill because i moved it from the front bench here as the junior minister <e> <s> i totally agree with what has been said to us from the cross-benches that us oldies know perfectly well as i am sure the noble lord lord middleton knows perfectly well what a prudent and willing landlord and tenant relationship is <e> <s> it is a term that has always been used in the ministry and that we had to deal with <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to follow the noble lady lady saltoun and say that i am grateful to my noble friend lord sudeley for having brought this matter before your lordships again this evening although i might perhaps have wished that it could have been brought before us in some other form <e> <s> it has enabled us to state the views that have been stated so cogently by very many speakers tonight and we have had the very great honour and advantage of hearing from the most reverend primate a really generous and really important speech which has been most helpful and for which the whole church i think must be most grateful that that speech will be on record <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that that is what the noble lord said but i believe the right reverend prelate the bishop of chichester mentioned that was not what we had been using that we had been using <e> <s> i remember the surprise i felt when <e> <s> or years ago i was in the choir stalls of westminster abbey and saw there the prayer book <e> <s> to make the legalistic point as some parish <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> my lords the protector of the church but she is the defender of the faith on my coins anyway <e> <s> i want to suggest that there may be a precedent and a convention or custom which we might use here <e> <s> this very day and this is a coincidence that may have some significance we have heard two short debates <e> <s> they have not been unstarred questions which a minister must answer and they have not been bills <e> <s> these short debates might be the way in which we could deal with such matters from time to time without infringing any constitutional rules and without getting mixed up in trying to legislate about worship or doctrine in the church which has rightly and properly been by act of parliament delegated to the synod and signed sealed and delivered in the worship and doctrine measure <e>", "<cs> my lords when i arrived in the house this afternoon rather late because taxis can never be found in wet weather and found that i was listed to speak after the noble lord who has just sat down i was a little nervous because i felt i should perhaps have to follow him in more senses than one <e> <s> but i feel now that the big guns having fired the heavy salvoes i have no obligation to do that and your lordships would not want me to try <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may add a word on the unpopular conifer <e> <s> we must not exaggerate their unpopularity by saying that they are all foreign christmas trees <e> <s> the scots pine has its origin in this country <e> <s> a mature scots pine is one of the most beautiful trees that grows <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so personally convinced of the importance of forestry that i was somewhat astonished to see that so many noble lords from all sides of the house feel it necessary to draw attention to that importance <e> <s> the speeches we have heard so far show that something is wrong with forestry at the present time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps it is appropriate that i should speak after the noble lord who has just spoken as i was also a member of the ecclesiastical committee <e> <s> the only reason i speak is because i was a member of that committee for several years <e> <s> i am no lawyer of any kind <e> <s> i am not a theologian but i suppose i am the lordly equivalent of the man on the clapham omnibus <e> <s> i do not know what is the correct description of such a man <e> <s> perhaps i shall describe myself as the ordinary man in the motor car <e> <s> i am the ordinary citizen going about his business as it were <e>", "<cs> my lords i too declare an interest perhaps more than some people because i was born in and spent my early life in my fathers house which was a parsonage <e> <s> he was the younger son <e> <s> my grandfather died after the battle of the alma and my father never saw him and therefore neither did i i lived in the parsonage and was told that one day i would succeed to a small agricultural estate in somerset and that that is what i should think about <e> <s> that is all i have thought about ever since and i am still very confused <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most instructive and i hope a very useful rural afternoon <e> <s> it has been a long afternoon for some of us <e> <s> i was very interested to hear the start of this debate on forestry and the spirited defence of the forestry commission by my noble friend lord radnor <e> <s> he was immediately followed by a notable and bold attack on the forestry commission by the noble earl lord carlisle <e> <s> i think a balance has been held by hearing from one side and then the other all through the debate <e> <s> i am pleased that in my own view if i were asked to adjudicate i could say that the forestry commission won though with certain reservations because no one is perfect <e>"]
