["<cs> my lords before i speak on the subject of airports policy may i say how grateful i am for the kindness shown by all members in all parts of this house to a very new member <e> <s> i happened to be introduced on th june of this year exactly years to the day since a fellow tweedsider john buchan the first lord tweedsmuir was introduced to your lordships house <e> <s> i cannot help recalling that john buchan as a famous novelist wrote a book called <e>", "<cs> my lords may i as someone who was introduced to this house only a bare hours before the noble baroness lady hooper congratulate her on a most excellent maiden speech <e> <s> as someone who has great knowledge of the law and of european affairs i am sure that her knowledge will be most useful to your lordships house <e> <s> i hope that during her long and distinguished time in this house she will see the european community becoming a real common market <e>", "<cs> i have listened and if i have tunnel vision then i plead guilty to having tunnel vision but i am not convinced by those who do not support my noble friend lord renton and his amendment tonight <e> <s> i feel very strongly as the noble lord who has just spoken said that the crucial part of the whole business of repealing the shops act is that there should not be coercion to work on sunday <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not putting my name down to speak in this debate but i am moved to rise as i have had some experience in the subject having been chairman of a scottish housing association for some years <e> <s> i should like to echo what the noble lord lord carmichael said about the dedicated people of all political persuasions who have made the housing association movement in scotland <e> <s> i speak of an association in a rural area as opposed to the noble lord lord carmichael who knows glasgow so well <e> <s> i know what good work has been done <e> <s> therefore i go along with him on that particular matter <e>", "<cs> my lords at the outset i feel bound to take issue with the inference in the question asked by the noble lord lord hacking that the governments present policies and arrangements on takeovers are unfair or incoherent except perhaps to say as far as unfairness is concerned that the timing problem raised by the noble lord lord ezra just now and by the noble lord lord hacking deserves a lot of inquiry when the inquiry gets down to business <e>", "<cs> my lords i too hope that the house will reject the amendment in the name of my noble friend lord ferrier <e> <s> i start by saying that the most important word in the whole bill is relief <e> <s> the dictionary definition gives the meaning as anything that relaxes tension <e> <s> i have the doubtful privilege of driving in edinburgh almost every week unlike the noble lord lord carmichael who is able to take the train <e> <s> in the borders we do not have trains so i have to drive my car <e>", "<cs> my lords at this hour of the evening i shall try not to detain your lordships long <e> <s> first perhaps i also may applaud the way in which my noble friend lord gray of contin introduced the bill to us today <e> <s> for the last years british gas has been a nationalised industry <e> <s> i do not have the advantage of my noble friends lord boyd-carpenter and lady macleod of borve who were on the scene at the time of the nationalisation of that great industry <e> <s> but it seems to have become the accepted wisdom of those years that monopolies are so important and have so much potential power to harm customers that they must be controlled directly by government <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene in this part of the discussion because i have a great deal of sympathy with what the noble lord lord stoddart has said about detailed knowledge of the gas industry and of consumer affairs for this giant of a man as he has been described <e> <s> however i am somewhat worried that if we write these words into the bill we are going to decrease the number of possible candidates for this very important job <e> <s> in the whole of the discussion this afternoon and this evening we seem to be wishing to increase the number of examiners and to decrease the number of candidates <e> <s> the second would be a great shame <e>", "<cs> in reply to that it would obviously be very useful for the said gentleman to have knowledge of consumer affairs but i know and i think the noble lord will know many captains of industry the noble lord lord stoddart referred to people who have been at the sharp end of business who may not have knowledge of consumer affairs <e> <s> i should hate to have their names excluded from any possible list <e> <s> you will probably find after a very short time that somebody of that calibre would pick up the whole ethos of consumer affairs which is a very important part of the job <e>", "<cs> before we leave this clause i am rather surprised that from the benches opposite we have heard nothing but talk of monopoly <e> <s> i understood when i spoke in the second reading debate and listened to other speeches that the gas industry was by no means a monopoly <e> <s> with the price of oil dropping through the floor electricity is becoming a very real challenge to the gas industry <e> <s> i was most interested to note also the evidence in the other place to the select committee on energy from the chairman of the national gas consumers council <e> <s> when she was asked a question is competition always going to be more effective a friend to the consumer than regulation <e> <s> the answer from her and also from her council was clearly this <e>", "<cs> this is a most important clause and we must spend some time getting to the root of the problem which faces us which seems to be whether or not we change from the current system <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon has spoken of miss sheila blacks evidence to the committee in another place on this matter but i look most closely at the words of those who are actually doing the job at present <e> <s> whereas this business of change from the present to something that is different is bound to be a controversial subject i am bound to say that i am interested in what miss black said to that committee on this particular subject <e> <s> she said that the existing council felt from its experience of dealing with complaints that the existing statutory system of regional councils was over-rigid and over-structured and did not necessarily achieve the most effective representation of consumers or the most effective protection of their interests <e>", "<cs> i too think that on this particular amendment we ought to look very closely at what the noble baroness lady gardner of parkes is getting at <e> <s> i come again to the evidence given in the <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw to the attention of the committee just one point on this amendment and ask whether the noble lord the minister has any clearer guidance for us on this matter <e> <s> it concerns those who will continue in employment because as i understand it the whole thing will stop and then start again and people will be taken on <e> <s> i noticed that it was discussed at great length in another place <e> <s> the under-secretary of state there said that he hoped that those currently employed will have the best possible chance of trying for the new jobs available <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i take issue with what has just been said over the question of what is the purpose of this bill <e> <s> i have listened at great length to the noble lord lord bruce of donington who seems to take issue with the city on every possible occasion and to take isssue also with the views of the conservative party on every possible occasion <e> <s> but surely one of the great advantages of this bill is that there is wider share ownership in prospect <e> <s> it may not please members of the opposition and particularly those on the alliance benches but per cent <e> <s> of adults now own shares that is million people <e> <s> that is a great improvement on the numbers in when only million people in this country owned shares <e> <s> it may also interest the committee to know that <e>", "<cs> this is indeed an important point raised from the opposition benches and i do not cavil at the point that it is in the interests of all british industry to buy british as much as possible <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say about our commitment to the treaty of rome and to seeing whether or not a clause of this sort would be breaking that treaty <e>", "<cs> i too have a great interest in what happens north of the border and i have great sympathy with a great deal of what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said <e> <s> i have had a close look at the amendment and under paragraph <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady macleod of borve in her moving of this amendment <e> <s> it has been said many times in this chamber that we look very carefully at the needs of those who are disadvantaged the elderly and disabled come into that category <e> <s> i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say on subsection <e>", "<cs> one matter concerns me in this amendment <e> <s> i fully agree with the first part and i hope that the minister when he replies will deal with the provision <e>", "<cs> i must say i find this an extremely strange part of the proceedings <e> <s> i suppose one must couple this amendment with amendment no <e> <s> which presumably will be moved later by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon and is on the subject of research <e> <s> it seems to me that members on the benches opposite would like to see the oil companies of this country nationalised and thereby be able to write into a bill something that will demand that they carry out research <e> <s> it seems that the gas corporation when it is turned into a private company will be failing in its duty if it does not carry through a thorough research programme which it is doing at the moment and carry it through in such a way that it will realise that gas supplies from the north sea will one day run out and the company will want to continue in business as a public limited company <e> <s> surely therefore market forces will demand and the company will realise that if it is to stay in business like any other good company then research and development is necessary <e> <s> i do not see any reason why that should be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> i was not one who welcomed the reply that the noble lord the minister gave to the noble baroness lady macleod but i should like to reiterate my thanks to him for his thoughtful reply to that amendment <e> <s> i feel that clause is one of the most important clauses in the bill <e> <s> it relates to general duties put upon the secretary of state and the director in relation to the elderly the disadvantaged and the disabled <e> <s> before we reach the bills next stage we shall want to see what will be proposed in that clause <e> <s> it might answer some of the problems and worries of those who are pressing the amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that this question of the statutory requirement which as i understand it is being reduced from hours to hours is perhaps a point that should be brought out <e> <s> what is much more important and seems to have been written into this bill is something which was not written into the bill of <e> <s> it is contained in the very helpful notes to which the noble lord lord diamond has referred on previous occasions in explaining this bill and is that the obligation to deal with escapes has for the first time been extended to the customers side of the meter <e> <s> that is a most important provision <e>", "<cs> on this subject i wonder whether we are going a little further than perhaps we should in telling the future company how to go about its business <e> <s> after all so far as protection of the consumer and maintenance and so on is concerned everything reverts to the vital clause <e> <s> if i read it aright in particular subsection the protections given in regard to maintenance and the furtherance of a good system are surely inherent in that clause <e> <s> it would therefore be up to the secretary of state and the director in particular to ensure what the <e>", "<cs> there is always a right time and a wrong time to dispose of an asset to float a company or whatever <e> <s> i suppose that one could go on arguing this all evening <e> <s> after all it could be that if this bill had passed into an act at the beginning of this year the stock market would have been considered at the wrong level <e> <s> much to the surprise of many people in the first three months of this year there was the most enormous hype i think that word was used by the noble lord lord stoddart of swindon in the general price of the market <e> <s> i am all for listening to the minister to find out exactly what considerations are taken into account when a flotation of this size comes to the market but to tie the hands of the government and to say that under this amendment one has to wait until these conditions are fulfilled is going totally in the wrong direction <e>", "<cs> before we go any further could i have clarification of what the noble lord lord williams is seeking in paragraph <e>", "<cs> before the noble viscount decides what to do with his amendment perhaps i may ask him this question <e> <s> do i take it as it looks very clear from this amendment that he does not believe in privatisation or does he believe in privatisation <e> <s> it seems that the terms of this amendment leave a wide open door to anyone to object to the privatisation of british gas at any time <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not suppose that any noble lords opposite will be surprised that i oppose the amendment <e> <s> we have almost been here before <e> <s> i recall a great deal of discussion earlier <e> <s> it was not about the wording of this amendment but the noble lord lord stoddart said at the last stage of the bill that he had rolled such an amendment round in his mind <e> <s> i have also done that <e> <s> i see the suggestion coming up again <e> <s> i could not agree more with what the noble lord lord somers said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord considers whether or not he will withdraw his amendment i must say that it was quite interesting to hear from the benches which he occupies the noble baroness lady seear who said at an earlier stage of this bill that the position of the consumer under a monopoly has never been solved and nothing satisfactory has ever been devised <e> <s> my view is that surely we are now moving into the uncharted waters of privatisation of the gas industry but i should have thought that with the ofgas directorate in position and the clear guidelines that it is given we are moving into an area which with those safeguards we should do well to explore <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am very grateful to the noble baroness for moving this amendment <e> <s> listening to the noble lord lord williams reminded me of someone trying to do a latin unseen and i must say that i have some sympathy with the points that he has raised <e> <s> i look forward to hearing the detailed answers from my noble friend lord belstead <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend lord belstead rises i too should like to say how grateful i am to see this coming into the bill <e> <s> my noble friend lady gardner of parkes has mentioned scotland <e> <s> i think that this is just the very point where the over-rigidity perhaps of what has been going on with the regional consumer councils in the past is overcome by something that is more flexible <e> <s> i know that in some parts of england it is thought that scotland is not a very big country <e> <s> it is in fact an extremely big country so far as the mileage is concerned <e> <s> to have this kind of flexible approach is important and i know that my noble friend lord gray will realise this since he comes from inverness and i come from just over the border and there are miles between us because it is extremely difficult to get a scottish regional consumers council to work effectively <e> <s> this arrangement to my mind recognises the geography and recognises that volunteers are absolutely crucial to the success of any consumer body <e> <s> the flexibility that the amendment gives i think answers a lot of the questions that have been raised in the house over this matter <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that at this stage we have to consider the whole question of what is meant by the national interest <e> <s> it is my view <e>", "<cs> my lords i see the difficulties which the amendment brings <e> <s> i have some sympathy with the idea that british manufacturers should have a chance to supply goods to british gas and so on <e> <s> i feel and this is something for the government to think about that the better made in britain campaign should be given added force <e> <s> that is the way to bring manufacturers and customers together <e> <s> the movement has recently had several exhibitions where various trades and industries have been brought together so that one understands the problems of the other <e> <s> price delivery and general quality standards are discussed openly in those forums <e> <s> rather than their being a passive observer <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who took part in an earlier stage of the bill dealing with this question of the elderly and infirm may i say that i am very grateful to the minister for putting down this amendment which at least starts the ball rolling in the direction in which we intended it to roll <e> <s> it is very useful to find that clause will be added to in this way <e> <s> with regard to an amendment to which we are still to come and about which we are not meant to talk i detect a note of hope in what the minister says about the outcome of that amendment and i look forward to seeing what happens this evening when we come to that amendment and perhaps hearing more of it at third reading <e>", "<cs> i think that this is an important amendment that has to be debated yet again no doubt because it is the view of the labour opposition that it should be written into the bill i should like the minister when he replies to deal with this new idea about the x factor because it seems to me that to have a value to be determined each year after consultation with the supplier the gas consumers council and the trade unions in the industry is not the normal way that a business runs its affairs the newly privatised gas plc will surely fix its prices i thought from our debates which have gone on for many hours that the director of ofgas would examine that particular price and decide whether it was fair and reasonable it seems to me that perhaps it is a question not of beer and sandwiches round a table for hours and hours on end but if your lordships house is anything to go by bacon and eggs at in the morning <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house may i say that i am sure the noble lord lord bruce of donington will be delighted to know that the number of private people in this country who now own shares has risen by per cent <e> <s> there has been a very substantial increase over the last months <e>", "<cs> my lords i entirely endorse what my noble friend the minister has said <e> <s> would the noble lord lord gallacher not agree that we are dealing with the retail business <e> <s> as he must know if you are going out to sell things to the general public up and down the land you need points at which you can sell those things <e> <s> it seems to me if one studies the development of the retail trade in this country as in any of the large stores and so on that they must be responsive to customers up and down the land <e> <s> that <e> <s> i am sure will be the intention of the new company <e> <s> i know that many people do not like the terms the market or market forces and so on but surely if gas is to be successful in competition with other forms of energy it must have a network which is effective and widespread <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i must intervene on this particular amendment and very briefly at that <e> <s> the noble lord lord diamond talked about consumers rather than shareholders <e> <s> i think it might interest him to have a look at the press release that came out about the flotation <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords it seems strange that such a very important amendment produced by the opposition front bench should be coming before your lordships at this particular stage of the bill <e> <s> i do not quibble with that but i should like to refer to the start of the amendment to insert that <e>", "<cs> i look forward to hearing what the minister has to say in reply to this amendment <e> <s> i do not even know myself whether the wording of this amendment is the correct wording to deal with the situation that has been described by the noble lord lord williams but it is clear to the <e>", "<cs> my lords i looked very closely at this particular amendment and i readily accept that the scottish law commission has recommended the course that the noble lord lord morton suggests <e> <s> however i am somewhat baffled about the contents <e> <s> we are talking about crown debts <e> <s> in particular i am concerned about the regulations regarding vat <e>", "<cs> this is a crucial part of the bill and i realise that your lordships must consider every aspect of it before coming to a conclusion <e> <s> i read with great care what was said by the noble lord lord morton of shuna on second reading and i very much agreed with the words that he used about the debt counselling schemes going on in birmingham <e>", "<cs> i read what the noble lord lord morton of shuna said at second reading <e> <s> he said that when we had gone through the list of what was excluded <e>", "<cs> i think perhaps we should like to hear the definition of where the law stands as far as a fridge-freezer is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the fact that this is the biggest challenge of its kind in my lifetime <e> <s> the treaty certainly lays down the gauntlet both to our european neighbours and to ourselves to accept the challenge <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord very much for that intervention <e> <s> he has the advantage of me in that i was at school at the end of the war and did not appreciate that that incident had occurred <e> <s> my information has come from those who have been studying this matter and it was not raised with me that that hazard had taken place <e> <s> i shall be delighted to have a look at the matter and the reasons for the accident <e> <s> but in general terms over past years which we have been studying the number of accidents in those tunnels has been very very few but i stand corrected on that particular matter if the accident had taken place <e>", "<cs> my lords does the right reverend prelate realise that in germany two thirds of the freight is carried by rail and in this country a very small amount is carried <e> <s> does he not think that rail will take a lot of that extra traffic that he is worried about <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether he thinks that the law on each side of the border between england and scotland should be similar or different <e> <s> it seems to me that this is a crucial aspect of the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to thank my noble and learned friend the lord advocate particularly in the knowledge that he now knows exactly what a fridge/freezer is <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord cledwyn for giving us the chance of debating this most important subject today <e> <s> first i declare an interest as a director of textile manufacturing companies whose centre of gravity lies far to the north of watford gap <e> <s> i make no apology for addressing my remarks to that part of the manufacturing industry which i know for i have <e>", "<cs> my lords i start by saying that i do not cavil at the present electoral system <e> <s> i am sure that there are some noble lords on the alliance benches who would wish that i did <e> <s> i realise that the labour party in scotland has seats as opposed to the government who hold and the alliance who hold eight <e> <s> but it is a fair point that at the last election over people voted conservative in scotland as opposed to labours and the alliances <e> <s> i say this because at times i feel that i suppose quite rightly from their point of view the labour party arrogate to themselves at general elections the right to speak for the scots people in their entirety <e> <s> i feel that conservative voters represent a substantial number of scots as those figures imply <e>", "<cs> yes indeed my lords i am very glad that the noble lord has mentioned a fairer system as he puts it <e> <s> although we did not hear from the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside about that system perhaps we shall hear about it from the noble lord lord mackie a little later <e> <s> i look forward to that <e>", "<cs> my lords i stand corrected on the point about anyone who is going to get maximum rebate who is not a student <e> <s> but indeed if he is a student yes the average works <e> <s> i understand that if he is a student in aberdeen he is going to do reasonably well whereas if he is in glasgow under the present system he is going to do better <e> <s> there will be losers and gainers but many people of all parties and of none long for a more suitable system than the one we have at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i have found one <e> <s> there may be others but this official has gone into print on the subject which is more than can be said for many people <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord talked about perth would not a better solution from the labour party be the rating of agricultural land and buildings <e>", "<cs> i should like to intervene on this particular matter <e> <s> obviously local income tax has been carefully thought through by all parties and certainly by the conservative party <e> <s> as has been said the noble lord lord ellenborough expressed his own view <e>", "<cs> the same number of people will pay local income tax certainly but not as great as the accountable number that will pay the community charge <e>", "<cs> i should like to make two points <e> <s> first i have here a quotation from the <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister will be taking action on this issue during the passage of the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> if an amendment is not yet ready and the amendment before us tonight is not correct as far as the government are concerned i hope that this knotty problem concerning sports clubs in scotland will be dealt with in the same spirit <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the minister for saying that he will look at the matter again <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that this is a special case <e> <s> it may seem strange that from these benches i should support the spirit behind the amendment <e> <s> however we are in difficulties as regards battered wives who have no money and who run to a house of refuge <e> <s> i think that the government should look closely at this special case <e>", "<cs> i said that the time to tax businesses is with corporation tax once profits have been made <e> <s> that is the major tax that should be levied on businesses <e>", "<cs> i should like to thank the minister for his reply <e> <s> i think i anticipated what it might have been <e> <s> i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> with regard to the noble lord lord morton of shuna i say no more than wait for the views of the edinburgh electorate to decide whether he is right or whether my views on the subject are construed by more people in edinburgh to be nearer the truth <e> <s> with those few remarks i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to add something to what my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> there are two points in this amendment <e> <s> one is the delay which it is clear the scottish cbi and also the association of chambers of commerce in scotland are not seeking for the non-domestic rate and the other is the laudable desire that the assessors in scotland and the assessors south of the border get their act together pretty quickly so that we can have speedy moves towards a harmonised rating system <e>", "<cs> i am a little confused because in amendment no <e> <s> the noble lord seeks to have a personal community contribution charge and then in amendment no <e> <s> he is talking in terms of having a personal poll tax <e> <s> which one are we actually talking about <e> <s> which one does the noble lord prefer <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw the committees attention to one aspect of this discussion <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton mentioned per cent <e> <s> it is that per cent <e> <s> of grant that concerns me because the bill provides that a flat rate sum will be paid each year towards the students personal community charge liability <e> <s> that will be based on the average level of personal community charge in scotland <e>", "<cs> in looking at the two amendments i see absolutely no difficulty in amendment no <e> <s> as regards a legitimate business expense <e> <s> i shall be very interested to hear what the minister says <e> <s> as my noble friend lord campbell of alloway pointed out these are matters for the treasury <e>", "<cs> i should like to say something about this matter which the government need to look at very carefully <e> <s> if i may say so i am particularly attracted by the amendment of the noble <e>", "<cs> i find the argument of the noble lord a little strange <e> <s> we all agree that we are trying to move away from property tax so far as concerns rates <e> <s> if this is the case i cannot see what is wrong with the wording as it stands <e> <s> with second homes cottages and so on a standard charge of one or two units of community charge seems a much more realistic way of dealing with them <e> <s> if we are to go down the road of a property tax on second homes we might as well wrap up the whole thing and go back to rates <e>", "<cs> i see absolutely no logic in the view held by the noble lord lord morton about this way of going about things <e> <s> obviously many people on the opposite side of the committee wish to maintain rates <e> <s> if that is the case why do we have to pay more for putting in radiators double glazing and so on <e> <s> that is one of the disadvantages of a property tax and even some members of the alliance seem to agree <e> <s> i for one cannot go along with the idea of putting back property into the standard community charge <e>", "<cs> i am delighted to agree with the noble lord lord ross of marnock particularly on his birthday <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me at an earlier stage in our deliberations he talked about the poll being per skull <e> <s> i thought that the standard community charge was on people and not on property <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord burton asked whether the period could be extended from three to six months which i think has been lost sight of in the argument <e> <s> perhaps the minister would like to address his mind to this if not today at some future occasion <e>", "<cs> i should not like to delay the committee at this late hour but i very much agree with what the noble lord lord kirkhill says <e> <s> we are dealing with a large number of people i think the figure is million and there are a lot of people who will not understand some of the forms that come across their table <e> <s> i instance the new home office directive on the form you have to fill in for postal votes <e> <s> it is not exactly an improvement on the old one in my view <e> <s> it just shows what can happen when some departments get hold of an idea and they go on and on and produce the most incredible forms in the end <e>", "<cs> i too should like to make exactly the same comments as the noble earl lord perth <e> <s> i think that the words used by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside were no one wants to encourage profligacy <e> <s> those words are crucial in any reorganisation that we are undertaking <e> <s> there must be back-up powers because we know of some very profligate local authorities in scotland <e>", "<cs> as these references are obviously being directed at me by the noble lord lord ross i consider that a per cent <e> <s> increase in a year for the lothian regions charge is excessive when inflation is running at and per cent <e>", "<cs> i mentioned crofters on the second reading of this bill <e> <s> i feel i must say something at this stage <e> <s> i may say that i find great difficulty with this particular amendment coming from the borders as my noble friend lady carnegy has said <e> <s> i should find it very difficult to go up into the border glens and say to those who are not very well off you are not being treated as the crofters are going to be treated in the highlands in the crofting communities <e> <s> when we talk about shetland the noble lord lord grimond knows much more about the area than i do <e> <s> however my experience is that the shetland fund has come in extremely useful for those who are less advantaged in that area thanks to the discovery of north sea oil <e>", "<cs> my lords i think this has been debated before <e> <s> i should very much like the noble lord to read out the solution that the gentleman who wrote the paper for the tory reform group came to <e> <s> it seems to me to be a very complex answer <e> <s> would the noble lord like to go on and read that part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not quite sure what the noble lord lord taylor is getting at but harmonisation is a matter about which i am concerned <e> <s> it is so important and fundamental for the future <e> <s> i refer not necessarily to the implementation in scotland but to the implementation of the whole scene for the united kingdom <e> <s> i must come back to what my noble friend lord glenarthur said at col of the <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am no lawyer but i happen to believe that if case law is built up on either side of the border it will take more than just getting together to arrive at a common harmonised programme <e> <s> the noble lord lord morton of shuna is nodding his <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to follow what the noble lord lord morton has said <e> <s> i think it proves the difficulty of trying to be extremely fair to one group while disadvantaging another <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord lord mackie will understand what i say because i read today in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down with the leave of the house may <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the minister for this very considerable advance on this difficult question <e> <s> i also declare an interest in that i have a son going to aberdeen university next session <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information can the minister say whether or not the noble lord lord ross is right when he says that the figure has to be standard at for example for all cottages or big houses right across strathclyde or is there any discretion between a small house and a large house <e> <s> i have not studied the point and so i do not fully understand <e> <s> i thought there might be some discretion between one and two but does it have to be the same for each particular property <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been most interested in hearing what my noble friend has said <e> <s> let us cut out most of his speech and concentrate if i hear him right on the suggestion that in setting income support levels the government will take into account the impact on the most vulnerable groups <e> <s> i had a letter today as i expect many noble lords did from the social security consortium which said that the noble baronesss amendments did not contradict the position of paying the per cent <e> <s> but then there should be compensation for such payment through income support levels <e> <s> i think what we have heard from the government today through my noble friend must mean just that <e> <s> i should be very disappointed if the most disadvantaged people in the community as i said at second reading should be in any way put in a position where they have no money and are not able to pay <e> <s> so this may well be the let-out for us on a most important part of this legislation <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will forgive me <e>", "<cs> my lords i too find the increase in water charges an enormous one for farmers to face <e> <s> i am amazed that the increase should be as the noble lord lord grimond has said one of almost per cent <e> <s> if that is the case i hope that the government will look very carefully at the matter because it will have serious effects in orkney and perhaps in any other island with high water charges <e>", "<cs> my lords i too spoke about this particular amendment at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i was concerned about the figures which the noble lord lord grimond produced at that time <e> <s> i believe he said that there would be an increase of per cent <e> <s> for farmers in the islands in orkney <e> <s> i did not feel that my noble friend the minister actually gave us much in the way of figures to justify the stand of his officials on this matter <e> <s> i am a bit distressed to hear that they and the local authority in orkney are still at loggerheads <e> <s> if they are at loggerheads i feel that the people on the ground probably know the scene rather well and i should like to hear some justification for why it is unecessary that an amendment of this sort should be presented at this stage <e> <s> it is a matter which could affect the livelihoods of farmers in orkney <e> <s> i should like further assurances from the minister before we let this amendment go <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to say how grateful the house must be to the minister for the way he has conducted this very difficult legislation through the house <e> <s> his patience and competence are an example to all of us <e> <s> if i may say so as somebody who has not been in your lordships house for very long i too now know what the phrase vintage ross means <e> <s> we are indebted to the noble lord lord ross for pointing out in such an astringent way the difficulties of the bill <e> <s> when i go home having listened to him i begin to think am i right <e> <s> then i looked back to and saw with some relief that he was as critical of the bill for the sale of scottish council houses as he has been over this measure and my spirits then began to rise again <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble baroness for her very swift reply and the minister for his comments <e> <s> i believe that the bill will put something right which has gone wrong and i am sure those affected will be grateful to see the bill passed <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the debate which took place during the general election in scotland i think your lordships will agree that it would be absurd to suggest that the election in scotland was fought on the basis of the community charge alone or of any other single issue <e>", "<cs> my lords that question from the noble lord lord ross points i think to the fact that he recognises that the conservative party did have a problem in the general election north of the border <e> <s> however i should like to say to him with all humility that he and his welsh colleagues made it possible for his english colleagues and himself to sit in cabinet in and to the delight of his political friends in the united kingdom and to the frustration of english conservative members of parliament who were in the majority at that time in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with my noble friend <e> <s> we discussed this matter at great length there were full days of it in this house and there was unanimous agreement between the alliance and the government benches that what we were about was the abolition of a discredited property tax <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to the noble baroness lady seear that that was not my intention at all <e> <s> i said that both the alliance and the government benches were determined to get rid of a discredited property tax <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for his kind good wishes in the job that i am undertaking <e> <s> if he had listened to what i said earlier on he would know that we shall of course note what happens when the english and welsh bill comes before your lordships house and another place <e> <s> the government have made it clear that their commitment is to securing the introduction of this reform <e> <s> however as i have said and i think i ought to repeat it if refinements are to be made to the proposals we shall consider them in relation to the scottish act if and when that is necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has received the cosla representations <e> <s> at the political level local authorities in scotland oppose the concept of a community charge <e> <s> in many cases that is not new <e> <s> however the new system is the law of the land and it is quite wrong to suggest that local authorities in scotland will not comply with the law <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it is a matter for the local authorities themselves to come forward with their ideas at the appropriate time <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that when this bill was being debated in this house the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe was insistent that a local income tax was his choice and that of his party <e> <s> but i have to point out that it was discussed thoroughly during the passage of the bill <e> <s> the local income tax which he suggested would neither be sufficiently perceptible nor provide a sufficiently wide tax base to achieve the accountability which the community charge will produce <e> <s> community charge rebates will ensure help for those who need it <e> <s> i may say that i heard very little about rebates in the debate in scotland during the general election <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord john-mackie for his kind wishes <e> <s> this is not the first time that i have stood at the dispatch box but it is the first time i have answered a series of questions with so many notes and it is difficult to check up on all of them <e>", "<cs> my lords it is perfectly true that there is help for marketing <e> <s> i have not looked through the papers to see exactly what it is <e> <s> i am very keen on this issue <e> <s> we are moving quite well in this area <e> <s> from my discussions with the salmon fish farmers of the shetlands it appears that they have taken on board the fact they have a year before the norwegians come into the market again and perhaps give them more competition <e> <s> what is perhaps more important is that as the noble lord will have noticed over the past week the fish farmers in scotland have combined with others under the aegis of food from britain but with their own slant to go ahead with marketing in a big way <e>", "<cs> my lords i can do no more than pass on the comments of the noble earl to the crown estate commissioners <e> <s> in the case of salmon fish farming there is a mixture of small and large <e> <s> in shetland it is all small and there are very few sizeable companies <e> <s> it is useful however to have a balance between the big and the small <e> <s> one has only to go to fort william and see what is happening with the marine harvest development and the obvious <e>", "<cs> my lords we are discussing two matters here <e> <s> in the case of the seabed and salmon fish farming one deals with the crown estate commissioners <e> <s> on the land where the problem arises because one may need storage facilities one deals with the local authority <e> <s> the common denominator in the case of the highlands area is the highlands and islands development board <e> <s> that body assists with grants <e> <s> discussions have to take place <e> <s> there are two different situations here and that leads to the occasional problem <e> <s> i assure the house that it is not easy <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that this is a serious matter for the norwegian authorities <e> <s> there is no evidence that the parasite can be transmitted through salmon ova which is an important point in terms of our import controls <e> <s> secondly no imports of live salmonids from the republic of ireland are permitted <e> <s> as a matter of course we consult with other laboratories both in norway and in other countries which deal with these diseases <e> <s> i underline the importance the government attach to dealing with this kind of disease which has been devastating in norwegian waters <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> we keep in close touch with such organisations which have been very helpful <e> <s> i understand that they welcome the move the government have made this week in this direction <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the passing of the salmon act and of the fact that the salmon dealers licensing has not yet come into effect <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will be reassured that the days when this will take place are near <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble viscount any indication of the amounts of fish that come from norway save to say that we have strict regulations on imports <e> <s> our current import controls for live fish and eggs are effective however and in my view there would be no <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i am aware the answer to that question is no <e> <s> however there is a problem with regard to cold water ornamental fish and we are looking at the problem quite closely <e> <s> it is intended to review the existing licensing controls for these fish <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say how much i appreciate the wishes of the noble lords lord carmichael and lord mackie of benshie and also of my noble friend lord polwarth that this bill will eventually pass <e> <s> may i say on a personal note that i was sad not to he here yesterday <e> <s> i was in fact standing up all night for scottish fishermen in brussels as i was the night before and a reasonable deal was obtained for them <e> <s> their industry is doing rather well as a result and i hope this will continue into <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly look very carefully at what the noble viscount said <e> <s> but my understanding of the salmon act is that there is no power in that act for me to act differently with one river from another <e> <s> however i shall look very closely at what the noble viscount said and if my interpretation is different from his then of course i shall write to him <e> <s> what is available is that the annual close time can be varied on a district by district basis as he will no doubt be well aware <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord carmichael very much for the welcome that he has given the order placed before your lordships house this evening <e> <s> so far as concerns animals affected by the chernobyl disaster we are dealing with sheep in the main <e> <s> cattle do not enter into the question partly for the reason that he mentioned concerning their grazing habits <e> <s> it is important to realise that sheep have been the most affected animal as regards this particular disaster and it is a disaster through their cropping of the grass <e>", "<cs> my lords i am so sorry <e> <s> i know the problems of that road and she put her finger on the problem of the tayside region in that connection <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble viscount mentioned forestry commission applications in his area <e> <s> i think that those applications will be coming forward soon <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank both noble lords for replying to the statement <e> <s> their reaction was perhaps predictable <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael asked whether this situation would wreck strathclydes attempt to rationalise schools <e> <s> the answer to that question must be that there is no reason why it should <e> <s> it may need to rethink the details but in principle it is right that it should remove surplus capacity where it exists <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to say how pleased i am to see the noble lord lord ross back in this house <e> <s> whenever he contributes to a debate he always gives one food for thought <e> <s> the noble lords remarks are predictable <e> <s> he questions the whole business of capacity and how that is determined <e> <s> i think that i have that point <e> <s> it is for the education authorities to decide in the first instance <e> <s> the education authorities must have measures of school capacity in any case and provided that these are reasonable there should not be any grounds for dispute <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady carnegy of lour for her comments <e> <s> first i insist that although paisley grammar school has been highlighted in this debate this is not a special measure for one school <e> <s> paisley grammar school is only one example <e> <s> any school operating at or near capacity will receive the same treatment <e> <s> my noble friend lady carnegy mentioned the review group in strathclyde which is looking at this problem <e> <s> the eduction committee of strathclyde regional council still has to make its decision <e> <s> the order that we placed yesterday comes into effect immediately and it will have to take that into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord lord ross with his experience will understand that schools which have full rolls are in a very different position to those which are half empty or less <e> <s> that is a matter which the government quite rightly have to take into account in considering overall education policy <e> <s> certain categories of case have already come forward for the approval of the secretary of state <e> <s> the noble lord lord ross made that clear under the act namely where closure would involve long distance travel for pupils <e> <s> this is only an extension of our selective involvement <e>", "<cs> my lords in the presence of two ex-secretaries of state for scotland it would not be for me to enter into an argument on whether or not strathclyde is the right size <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for his further contribution <e> <s> i have to say that it is the duty of <e>", "<cs> my lords with permission i shall reply to the two points that have been raised <e> <s> first in relation to the remarks of my noble friend lord campbell of croy about phasing in we have a programme for that <e> <s> we have to consult quickly with the island authorities before we reach the period of tendering <e> <s> we hope that we shall learn the immediate responses quickly and that we shall be able to work within the framework of the phasing to obtain the right answers on each of the denominated subjects for tender <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may deal first of all with the point raised by the noble lord in relation to cosla <e> <s> so far as concerns capital expenditure consent of million compares with local authorities initial bids of million and will be ample to allow local authorities to make satisfactory preparations for the new system <e> <s> as regards current expenditure as i have already indicated million <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i can recall there are four questions there <e> <s> first are we going to change our mind and hold back the implementation next year <e> <s> the answer to that is no <e> <s> secondly i gave an assurance to the house on th june last year <e> <s> if there were changes in the english and welsh bill which made it necessary to have a look to see whether we should change our own i gave this assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords yes new money <e> <s> with regard to any extra that will be required noble lords will know that my right honourable friend has announced capital expenditure this week of million and it is of course up to local authorities to decide how to spend that money <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall the very strong views expressed by the noble and learned lord lord wilson of langside when the bill was passing through this house <e> <s> it comes as no surprise to me that he should ask a question of this kind <e> <s> however at that same time it was very clear from members on the benches on which he sits that the present rating system was a totally unacceptable way of carrying on <e> <s> that is why change was made <e>", "<cs> my lords we debated this at great length <e> <s> we talked a great deal about accountability when the bill was passing through this house <e> <s> that is what the new system is about <e> <s> the noble lord says that the same amount of money will be collected <e> <s> we shall have to wait and see whether that is the case <e> <s> however being the good <e>", "<cs> my lords i can confirm that it is the governments intention that the new planting at the rate of hectares per annum should remain <e> <s> in addition there are the farm woodlands scheme targets which we hope to attain <e> <s> as regards new investors i am sure that the noble lord with his great knowledge of investment will understand that we shall like mr asquith have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i have seen comments in the newspapers recently about that matter <e> <s> i believe that my noble friend is referring to scotland and wales where most of the conifer planting takes place <e> <s> perhaps i may assure my noble friend that the uplands of scotland and wales will be protected against environmentally damaging afforestation <e> <s> no planting scheme will be approved for grant aid which is out of sympathy with the environment <e> <s> there will be special provisions in the new plans of operation for positive environmental and conservation proposals <e> <s> the existing consultation arrangements provide adequate safeguards for areas of special environmental importance <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lady has made a very important point regarding downstream activities which are particularly important to the economies of scotland and wales <e> <s> as regards the new regime the removal of tax incentives and the move to grants the government will keep under review the activities that take place particularly over the next months <e> <s> as i have said to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe hectares is our target <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is referring to the maintenance situation <e> <s> planting grants under the woodlands scheme will be paid in three instalments per cent <e> <s> at the start of planting per cent <e> <s> five years after initial planting and per cent <e> <s> after years <e> <s> those grants are paid subject to satisfactory planting establishment and maintenance <e> <s> as regards management grants those were paid under earlier dedication schemes and continue to be paid under closed schemes <e> <s> however they do not feature in the later schemes because of the lack of any persuasive evidence that such payments stimulated better management and were cost effective <e> <s> we are not convinced that there is a case for introducing them <e> <s> however i hear what the noble lord says and i am well aware of what is being said in the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the planting of conifers i am well aware of the views strongly held on both sides of the argument <e> <s> my noble friend lord renton may not like me to repeat it but it is a question of balance <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble lord understands that the figure of hectares is a target <e> <s> i do not accept that the level has significantly fallen consistently below that <e> <s> we have seen an increase in the level although admittedly it has not reached the target level yet <e> <s> the noble lord has asked me about the logic behind the change it is a simplification of the situation <e> <s> we must look at the whole of the budget in the context of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that is a little wide of the original question <e> <s> i shall look very carefully at what the noble lord has asked me about the farm woodland scheme <e> <s> of course the bill has not yet gone through the house but i should like to look at his question relating to what can be charged against the farmers own business before giving a categorical assurance <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be delighted to meet my neighbours <e> <s> i meet them on many occasions <e> <s> it will not surprise the noble lord to know that trees are fairly well up the agenda in my discussions with them <e> <s> however i am not persuaded that what he has said is true <e> <s> in my discussions many people and indeed many members on opposite benches have asked for changes to take place <e> <s> that has now happened <e> <s> i wish the noble lord a very good easter <e> <s> as i have said to him i think like one of the liberal prime ministers from the past we shall have to wait and see <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i am responsible for answering that sort of question <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate today has covered a wide range of housing matters <e> <s> i should like to thank all noble lords who contributed to the debate <e> <s> i was interested that the noble lord lord stallard saw fit to join in this debate <e> <s> i welcome another scotsman even though he has moved south of the border to take part in our deliberations <e> <s> perhaps first i should put him out of his misery when he asked whether the housing corporation was consulted about scottish homes and whether it agreed <e> <s> the answers are yes and yes <e> <s> the noble lord may be aware that the housing corporations responsibilities in wales are also to be passed to a separate body to be called something that i cannot pronounce in welsh but it is housing in wales <e>", "<cs> my lords i do appreciate that and i have heard the noble earl speak of it before in relation to the local government bill dealing with the community charge <e> <s> i shall look carefully at what he has said but i can assure the house that the advice i have been given probably means that it will not be possible to accede to his wishes <e>", "<cs> my lords i take note of what the noble lord lord hughes said and i undertake to go as far as he has indicated in the progress of the committee stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> these amendments take us to the heart of this very important issue <e> <s> i say straight away to the noble viscount lord thurso <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> i can do no better in answering my noble friend than to read section to which i referred earlier and to which the noble lord lord hughes referred <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i am sure there is no dispute about the intention of these amendments the need for accountability in relation to landlords and others in receipt of public funds <e> <s> the question is whether the amendments are the best method of achieving that accountability <e> <s> it is on that point that we are in some disagreement <e>", "<cs> the government are committed wholeheartedly to the care in the community policy which enables many people to return to their own homes and communities rather than spend their lives confined to long-term residential care establishments <e> <s> this amendment is intended to to give scottish homes a major role in bringing about that desirable object <e>", "<cs> i am well aware of this <e> <s> i am also well aware of what has been written in the griffiths report <e> <s> i go back to the initial point that i made to the noble viscount lord thurso on this <e> <s> we are not arguing that scottish homes should not play a part in this <e> <s> i am arguing on the point that was put to me that it should play a central role in this <e> <s> this the government do not accept <e>", "<cs> the amendment seeks to subject scottish homes to a requirement to prepare an annual investment strategy <e> <s> at this stage i should say to my noble friend lord balfour that i do not want to get into a debate on the merits or demerits of architects or their plans <e> <s> there is no doubt that any body which undertakes capital spending let alone on the substantial scale under which scottish homes will operate must plan carefully <e> <s> both the housing corporation and the ssha do so now <e> <s> they do not do so in isolation <e> <s> in preparing their plans they are fully aware of the competing claims and interests of a variety of bodies including local authorities and housing associations <e>", "<cs> i should like to say just one word <e> <s> we are talking about the annual investment strategy i think it is in the terms of the amendment <e> <s> that is all we are talking about <e> <s> so far as dealing with planners and scottish homes and their overall plan are concerned that will go ahead they cannot operate otherwise <e> <s> so i hope i have not been as unhelpful as the noble lord lord carmichael seems to suggest <e>", "<cs> these amendments which were debated in some detail in another place seek to impose what i consider to be unnecessary restrictions on scottish homes in relation to its organisation at administrative and board level <e>", "<cs> i should like to reply to the noble lord on this aspect <e> <s> i think when he has been to the western isles as i have recently he will agree that because of the crofting commission and the work done by the local authorities very good work the housing stock in those areas is much better than it was only a few years ago <e> <s> the government take this point very seriously although we come back to the issue of regional administration and so on <e> <s> scottish homes will have to address that aspect early in its career <e>", "<cs> i thought that we had dealt with amendment no <e> <s> with amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> the two amendments have much in common <e> <s> i must make very clear that the direction will come from the scottish homes board itself <e> <s> i thought on the previous amendment we were talking about administrative devolution if i may use the word <e> <s> i entirely agree i know what the noble lord lord hughes is saying that it is no use setting up a committee to do nothing <e> <s> what we are looking at is administrative devolution <e> <s> that is one of the first tasks to which scottish homes will have to address itself <e>", "<cs> the government are fully sympathetic to the aims of the amendment <e> <s> however we take the view that it is unnecessary <e> <s> we recognise that through the revitalisation of the private rented sector and the introduction of the tenants choice provisions of part iii of the bill tenants will be faced with options which are unfamiliar to them <e> <s> some of them are likely to be hindered in taking the best advantage of those options in the absence of reliable and unbiased advice <e>", "<cs> of course i shall take very careful note of what has been said on this point <e> <s> i am concerned that by writing something in on the lines which the noble earl has suggested by inference we are ruling out other points and that that may be taken by some to indicate that we are thereby going against the spirit of what is required <e>", "<cs> i have listened very carefully to what the noble earl has said as to the purpose of his amendment <e> <s> i agree with him that it is necessary for scottish homes to complete title to the heritable property which is transferred to it from the scottish special housing association under clause of the bill if it wishes to continue the practice of the ssha of granting feu dispositions to tenants who wish to buy their houses <e> <s> this is because under scots law it is only a person who has a completed title to land who can grant a feu disposition of it <e>", "<cs> my lords i take due note of what my noble friend says on that matter <e> <s> the fundamental purpose of our reforms is the same <e> <s> we <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i agree entirely with what he said <e> <s> we have gone a long way in secondary education <e> <s> our study deals with the primary area <e> <s> we have brought forward a consultation document and we look forward to the responses <e>", "<cs> my lords a consultation document has been issued <e> <s> an analysis of the responses is taking place at the moment <e> <s> at the appropriate time my right honourable friend the secretary of state will come forward with proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for raising that point <e> <s> we are looking closely at what is proposed for england and wales <e> <s> if i may give an example the gallic and welsh languages is one area at which we are looking most closely in order to see what is happening in wales and what we should be doing in scotland in that connection <e> <s> as the noble lord lord carmichael said the situation is different north of the border <e> <s> our consultation document differs in many respects from what is proposed in england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to my noble friends first point yes we are always prepared to learn from those south of the border if the point is worth learning <e> <s> on the question of foreign languages yes indeed my right honourable friend is well aware of that difference <e> <s> we can offer two languages for the first two years of secondary education <e> <s> that is the difference between north and south of the border <e> <s> my right honourable friend is currently considering a further decision paper from the consultative committee on the curriculum <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that remark <e> <s> we will take that matter into account <e> <s> with regard to testing we are looking closely at the dates for testing in primary education in scotland <e> <s> the age is slightly different from what is proposed in england <e> <s> there is the -year-old test in england which we do not propose to have in scotland <e> <s> we already have the standard grade at <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house to now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may first say to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe that i am delighted that he approaches the bill in his customary spirit of co-operation <e> <s> i hope that when i have finished my rather long statement i apologise to the committee for its length he will see that the government have been doing a lot of thinking since the bill left another place <e>", "<cs> i shall have to find out the answer to that question and inform the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> i have listened to what my noble friend said <e> <s> i have looked carefully at his <e>", "<cs> i accept amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord has said <e> <s> the point of the amendment is important but i shall read what he said to see whether there are grounds for including the wording in the bill <e> <s> at this stage i can give no assurances <e>", "<cs> i thought that when my noble friend came to see me i had convinced him that he should not concern himself with this point <e> <s> however i am prepared to look at the matter again and come back to him <e>", "<cs> it may help the committee at this stage if i explain why the government did not include a prohibition on premiums in the bill <e> <s> as noble lords are aware premiums are prohibited for regulated tenancies under the rent scotland act <e> <s> that is necessary because the act controls the rent of such tenancies and were premiums permitted landlords might use them simply to make up the difference between the controlled and the market rent <e>", "<cs> i shall certainly look at what my noble friend has suggested and if it is sensible we shall do what he asks but not otherwise <e>", "<cs> during our second reading debate my noble friend raised the possibility of incorporating in the bill the revised schedule to the rent scotland act which results from the amendments we proposed to make to it <e> <s> i can but admire the effort he must have put in to produce the version we see in amendment no <e> <s> which deals with schedule <e> <s> however i am afraid that i must disappoint him his revised schedule would not have the effect that our amendments are designed to achieve <e>", "<cs> i had intended to mention that we were going to have a close look at what has been said about the copyright bill to see whether we could learn any lessons from it and then come back <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to look at this again and consider whether we can perhaps help the noble lord with the problem that has been raised <e> <s> i warn the committee that as a result of the request there may be three new schedules <e> <s> i shall look at what has happened in regard to the copyright bill and at what has been said today by the noble earl <e> <s> he has the advantage of being a lawyer and i do not <e> <s> i understand the position that he is trying to relate to the committee and how difficult it is to follow some of the legal arguments <e>", "<cs> whatever the intention behind the amendment it would largely defeat much of the object of the bill as my noble friends lady carnegy of lour and the noble lord lord goold have pointed out <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot recommend that we accept amendments nos <e> <s> or <e> <s> the wording proposed would allow transfers to take place to public sector landlords as the noble lord lord carmichael said <e> <s> that is directly in opposition to our policy <e> <s> as i acknowledged on second reading there has been much debate in another place and elsewhere on the point that transfers under the provisions of part iii of the bill should be allowed to local authorities or back to local authorities <e> <s> however i stressed then and i repeat now that transfers to local authorities would do nothing to add to the diversity of provision and nothing to ease the burden on local authorities <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may come back for a moment at a slightly slower speed so that the noble lord lord taylor can understand what i am talking about on this matter <e> <s> surely the whole point must be that as i have said the provisions of part iii do not involve compulsion <e> <s> but i think that when noble lords see figures such as i have quoted of local authority work in the housing area of per cent <e> <s> and not much less in some other <e>", "<cs> i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has said <e> <s> i am not surprised that he has moved this amendment <e> <s> however before the secretary of state can designate an area as a rural area and thus exempt houses from the tenants choice provision in part iii of the bill two processes have to be gone through <e> <s> first one-third of the total public sector housing stock in the area before the right to <e>", "<cs> first i do not have the figures <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord lord mackie will look at what i have said <e> <s> i shall look most carefully at what he has said to see whether some basis of <e>", "<cs> i certainly do not want to be drawn <e> <s> i talked earlier today at question time about the english educating the scottish <e> <s> however i have no doubt at all that any bill that is passed through your lordships house dealing with housing in scotland will be taken due note of by the government in relation to their responsibilities in the department of the environment <e>", "<cs> this amendment seeks to apply to receiving landlords under tenants choice the powers of the housing corporation in relation to registered housing associations which were designed for use <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concerns that have been expressed here the deep thoughts by many noble lords on all sides of the chamber on this matter <e> <s> i know that in another place this matter was debated <e> <s> there have been entirely misconceived scare stories of old-style private landlords in precarious financial circumstances offering a poor quality of service to tenants who have been coerced from the safety of the public sector <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may respond to him <e> <s> i very much hope that we shall not suspect scottish homes of abuse of its powers before it comes into existence <e> <s> surely the remedy for any landlord who feels aggrieved about the propriety of the basis of scottish homess decisions must be to leave the correctness of those decisions to judicial review <e> <s> am i not right <e>", "<cs> we have had a very useful exchange on this matter <e> <s> i see very clearly the point the noble lord lord morton and others are aiming at <e> <s> scottish homes would be subject to the general duty to act reasonably <e> <s> however i shall study what the noble lord and others have said on this issue <e> <s> i have no doubt that we shall return to it <e>", "<cs> i cannot recommend acceptance of amendments nos <e> <s> and which seek to give the lands tribunal presumably the lands tribunal for scotland an appeal function if a public sector landlord disputes the valuation reached in accordance with the provisions in the bill by the district valuer <e>", "<cs> where we are dealing with valuations the prices of property and the speed with which one is able to carry through the operation that is an important part of the whole i happen to think that we are dealing with experts in the field in which they operate <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl is right on that particular point but we are dealing with a slightly different point <e> <s> the amendment i understand concerns valuations of transfers from local authorities <e>", "<cs> as i understand the point of the noble earl he asked whether the tenant has a right to refuse the district valuers valuation <e> <s> the answer is that the tenant always has a right to accept or to reject <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i draw to the attention of the noble lord lord morton of shuna the exchanges that took place in the house over the right-to-buy legislation in scotland <e> <s> noble lords clearly approved of the right-to-buy legislation which does not allow appeal to the lands tribunal in scotland in matters of valuation <e>", "<cs> i gave an answer to my noble friend lord selkirk yesterday on the question of title and i said that we were looking very closely into the fact that a real title must be transferable <e> <s> i said that we shall come back at the next stage of the bill with the answer to that point <e>", "<cs> i have heard quite clearly what the noble lord lord carmichael has said <e> <s> clause of the bill provides that the right to acquire property under the tenants choice provisions can only be exercised by scottish homes or by a person approved by scottish homes <e> <s> we believe this approval mechanism is necessary to safeguard the interests of the tenant who may contemplate changing his landlord <e> <s> clause provides that property which has been transferred under the provisions of part iii that is where the tenant has exercised tenants choice and transferred to a new approved landlord can only be disposed of by the new landlord if that new landlord obtains scottish homess approval <e>", "<cs> i hoped that i had explained that scottish homes in the first instance has to approve the landlord <e> <s> at the first sale thereafter scottish homes is involved <e> <s> after that the tenant is definitely in the private sector and like anyone else has to stand in the private sector <e> <s> i hope that i made myself clear in my explanation <e> <s> what i am trying to say is that the system we wish to bring in under this clause means that there is control and a means whereby scottish homes has control of the approved landlords for a sufficient time <e>", "<cs> as usual i listened carefully to what the noble lord said in connection with the amendment <e> <s> i shall try to speak slowly so that he hears the assurance that i am about to give him <e> <s> the amendment seeks to place a requirement on scottish homes to take appropriate steps to ensure <e>", "<cs> it is difficult to give an assurance that administrative rules which will be drawn up by a body which is not yet in being can be brought before the house <e> <s> i understand the feelings about the matter <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael understands as well as i do that scottish homes is responsible to the secretary of state <e> <s> i have given an assurance in the name of the secretary of state that the administrative rules which he will have to approve will be brought forward <e> <s> the secretary of state will have to satisfy himself that the views of tenants occupying properties are taken fully into account <e> <s> at this stage i do not think that i can go any further than that in answer to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> let me assure the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove that there is nothing sinister about the use in scotland of a five-year rolling cost floor and in england an eight-year period <e> <s> in the housing scotland act clause the cut-off date for the present scottish outstanding debt test is st december <e> <s> in the housing act however section sets the relevant date for the cost floor in england at st march <e> <s> there is therefore already a difference of four years and nine months <e> <s> our proposals narrow this differential to three years <e>", "<cs> i shall try to reply to my noble friend lord selkirk by saying that the people who will really lose are the taxpayer and the government and not the housing associations themselves bearing in mind the financial arrangements under which they operate <e> <s> that should be sufficient assurance to my noble friend on that point relative to housing associations <e>", "<cs> i accept that remark <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may make one or two further points <e> <s> i should like to clarify the position for the noble earl lord selkirk concerning the right to buy <e> <s> i want to make that matter absolutely clear <e> <s> that right continues for existing housing association tenants as distinct from the charitable housing associations <e> <s> however it will not exist for new housing association tenants <e> <s> i wish to make that clear <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for putting the argument forward in his amendment <e> <s> as he rightly says the matter will also come up in subsequent amendments and we shall no doubt have further discussions <e> <s> however at this stage perhaps i may emphasise that clause is designed purely and simply to prevent abuse of the housing benefit system <e> <s> i am sure that the committee supports that aim <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for putting down the amendment <e> <s> i recognise that local authorities are concerned that they will lose subsidy when they pay benefit above the level of rent determined by the rent officer <e> <s> this could arise when a claimant who is dissatisfied with the amount of housing benefit he receives makes use of his existing right which will be unaltered to have the decision reviewed <e>", "<cs> i will now try to explain this very complicated part of the bill <e> <s> this amendment if accepted would be contrary to one of the central themes of the bill that rents payable under assured tenancies are to be freely negotiated between landlord and tenant <e> <s> this is recognised in clause which makes it clear that for assured tenancies the rent determined by the rent assessment committee need not be the rent finally charged <e> <s> the only exception to that general rule is in the case of short assured tenancies where tenants have additional rights of rent control reflecting their reduced security of tenure because of the time-limit on that type of tenancy <e>", "<cs> i understand the aim of my noble friends lady carnegy of lour and lord selkirk <e> <s> a student must know before making an arrangement with a landlord what his liability is <e> <s> first landlords will quickly realise that they can charge only market rents if they are to obtain tenants <e> <s> secondly they will be able to find out the general level of housing benefit in those circumstances <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further than that <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have taken part in the debate on this issue <e> <s> i should like to begin by underlining two points which i have made during the course of the bill <e> <s> in reply to the debate on second reading i said that in relation to publicity we shall consider what further publicity is necessary in due course <e> <s> as members will understand i was referring to publicity after the passing of the bill because the government can present the case only after the bill is passed <e> <s> i also said that a great deal of discussion has taken place in the press radio and television as those of us who live in scotland know only too well about the consequences and the very real points which are being considered as we consider this bill for the people of scotland <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for intervening at this particular stage in the bill in the way that he has <e> <s> i find it very interesting that he should suddenly take an interest in this particular point <e> <s> i shall not go any further than i have done regarding funds which will be available to scottish homes to deal with the major problem of explanation of this bill and the consequences of it <e> <s> it will be provided by the secretary of state at the appropriate moment in the appropriate way in the appropriate amount <e>", "<cs> i shall not give a yes or no answer to that i cannot <e> <s> i intend to be sure that everything is done through every voluntary agency in scotland and through scottish homes so that people understand the consequences of the bill when it is passed <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that we can have it both ways <e> <s> the noble lord wants publicity for the difficulties faced by tenants under this new bill and yet he is saying that the government are spending too much money through the department for enterprise <e> <s> i cannot understand it <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for suggesting that we take amendments nos <e> <s> and together <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> i was dealing with the first amendment which is quite important and the one at which i wish to have a close look <e> <s> perhaps i may now turn to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords that is a fairly wide question <e> <s> i agree with the noble viscount that it is each nations responsibility to protect the fishery within the -mile economic zone of that nation in this case ireland <e> <s> under international agreements an irish vessel could be pursued from within our waters if it is caught within our -mile economic zone <e> <s> however we have no record of that hot pursuit process having occurred so far <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the irish government commissioned a report published in november which dealt with their own salmon fishery problems and the illegal fishing of salmon and its possible impact on stocks and angling opportunities <e> <s> the report of the irish salmon review group issued last year referred to illegal fishing and made recommendations for additional central measures <e> <s> however none of those measures has yet been accepted by the irish government with the exception of the weekly close time which they intend to change <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry if i did not make myself clear <e> <s> the responsibility lies with the fishery protection service of the nation state concerned up to the -mile economic zone <e> <s> that of course includes its own mile in-shore limit <e> <s> as regards the size of the irish fishery protection service yes it is smaller than our own <e> <s> however there are good relationships between our own fishery protection service and the irish service <e>", "<cs> my lords no i cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of all three points raised by the noble lord <e> <s> however a seal cull is well wide of this particular question no doubt the noble lord can table a question for me to answer on the subject <e> <s> coming from north of the border i agree of course over the monofilament net situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for that information <e> <s> we are particularly concerned about the returning grilse to scottish waters <e> <s> in fact that is a matter which causes us some concern in the whole question of the amount of salmon being taken as has been indicated by the noble viscount lord thurso in his question <e>", "<cs> my lords i think i clearly indicated that there were ongoing discussions between the fishery protection services of both countries <e> <s> that is the area where we have to look as regards safeguarding stocks <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that as far as enforcement is concerned dialogue is taking place between my department and the department concerned in dublin <e> <s> i can say no more than that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of what the noble lord says about the effect that the over-fishing of salmon stocks can have not only on welsh rivers but on scottish and other rivers for that matter <e> <s> this is a matter that must be addressed on an international basis <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord will realise the difficulty in establishing the correct figures <e> <s> therefore i should not like to speculate on how much greater the actual catch is than the officially registered catch <e> <s> we are concerned about the effect that it is having on scottish rivers and we shall look carefully at what is happening not only in irish territorial waters but within its -mile economic zone <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe knows because he was present at the passing of the scottish act discussions had to take place as a first stage between the inland revenue valuation office and the scottish assessors association <e> <s> progress in those discussions has been significant <e> <s> perhaps i should draw your lordships attention to the simultaneous revaluations in which will be a major step not least because they will help to clarify the extent to which differences north and south of the border arise from different valuation practices <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that this is the time or the place to go into a scotland versus england and wales debate <e> <s> however i appreciate what my noble friend has said <e> <s> i have to say to him and to others that the one thing that has to happen before we can have a unified business rate which will be effective north and south of the border is for harmonisation to take place <e> <s> that could well lead to legislation but i am very happy to report that so far the discussions between the two bodies have gone extremely well <e>", "<cs> my lords while i thank the noble lord for that remark i am very well aware of the amount of work that has to be done <e> <s> perhaps i may elaborate on the steps already taken which will indicate the direction in which we are going <e> <s> first those bodies have looked at the handling and interpretation of rental evidence to ensure that it is in line north and south of the border <e> <s> secondly they have identified certain classes of subject where there have been differences of practice namely racecourses and petrol stations with a view to developing a more common approach <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for her question <e> <s> i think that that is a matter which ought to be addressed during the debate of the bill presently before your lordships house <e> <s> so far as concerns scotland as noble lords will know at the moment the basis of business rates which will have ceilings applied to them is regional <e>", "<cs> my lords i am advocating a sensible arrangement north and south of the border so that business both north and south of the border will be able to prosper <e> <s> the rates will be those which can be paid by business and not those that some people think that business should pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his question <e> <s> i hope that he will be in his place tomorrow when i shall have something to say to the house about the scottish economy <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for those interesting statistics <e> <s> looking at the published figures for job vacancies which we know about in the dundee area we can see that the number has risen considerably over the past year <e> <s> that is encouraging news <e> <s> in addition in the dundee area alone unemployment has fallen by per cent <e> <s> in the last year from per cent <e> <s> in april to per cent <e> <s> in april <e> <s> i am delighted at that move in the right direction <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not have those figures <e> <s> i know that the noble lord is <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the views of the noble lord on that matter <e> <s> i remember that he questioned that change of policy <e> <s> however such automatic grants inevitably go to some projects which would go ahead in the same location without support <e> <s> by concentrating on selective assistance money will be directed where it is needed <e> <s> regional enterprise grants are designed to meet the needs of small firms in development areas which may have difficulty in raising finance for growth <e> <s> i know that the scottish development agency supports that policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know which evangelical mission the noble lord means <e> <s> the prime minister has been on two missions to scotland recently <e> <s> the most important part of her visits was to try to bring confidence to the business community and confidence to the workforce as well as ensuring that there are no sales prevention officers in government industry or the trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for his comment <e> <s> i know that the prime ministers visit was well received <e>", "<cs> my lords manufacturing output in scotland in the three quarters of last year for which figures are available show an increase of per cent <e> <s> cbi business surveys for the first quarter of this year show a trend which is very positive <e> <s> some of our severest critics in the scottish press are well known to the noble lord and to me <e> <s> i was very heartened to see that one of them said in the press this week <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that that question is some way wide of the question i am answering <e> <s> however i would point out to the noble lord the opportunities provided not only by the opening of the channel tunnel but also by the construction work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always easy to choose a base date that would allow one to arrive at the figures one wants to arrive at <e> <s> i am a fair person and i would agree with the noble lord lord carmichael that in scotland was not a particularly good year because of matters concerning in particular oil related development <e> <s> the progress that is now occurring in scotland is beginning to show the turn around which we have fully expected <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that all the measures which have been brought forward by the government to help the long-term unemployed and others have helped in bringing down the figures <e> <s> however we are in the business of training and retraining and finding real jobs for real people which is more than happened in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend for mentioning the situation in dundee <e> <s> i like many others oh this side of the house at least do not applaud those who give standing ovations to people who lose jobs in dundee rather than gain them <e> <s> quite frankly it is time that we put that sad episode behind us <e> <s> i am very happy to be able to say that progress in getting real jobs into dundee is going as well there as anywhere else in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not have them to hand but i shall be happy to write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of all the points made by the noble lord <e> <s> he has expressed concern about the figures which are being reached <e> <s> although final figures have not yet been confirmed i believe that he along with me will be happy to hear that they have risen for the year to the end of march to hectares <e> <s> that is a considerable advance on the figures of for example which showed a total of hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the major processing plants and those which are already up and running that is the expression i should like to use shotton is the major user of pulp and that involves the use of conifers <e> <s> as regards the <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that we are moving slightly away from what is required for the downstream activities of the wood processing industries in the short term and looking ahead to what is available for the future <e> <s> the question of maintenance has been raised on a number of occasions <e> <s> many owners will benefit quite considerably from the reduction in the top rate of tax and the transitional arrangements available until will provide a breathing space to enable owners to adjust and also allow time for us to assess the impact of the changes and to consider whether anything more needs to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of the noble lords great interest in this subject <e> <s> i know that on st march i answered some of the questions which he has now asked <e> <s> however i repeat that it is the governments view that in achieving their targets they will watch this matter carefully there will be investors available to invest in new planting <e> <s> in answer to the noble lords point about the forestry commission and its planting as an example the figure for was hectares and there were steady figures for and the succeeding years of and <e>", "<cs> my lords i pay tribute to the work of the noble lord lord john-mackie in this regard <e> <s> we are now reaping the benefits of the investments of previous years that is quite obvious <e> <s> that is why in the figures i have given we are looking forward to an increase in production from those forests up to the year <e>", "<cs> my lords we are straying into the area of the ability to find out the members of the family in any particular clan if i may put it that way <e> <s> we are on to the question of the date of birth and the reason for it which was fully debated when the bill was before the house <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept that <e> <s> the whole question of the date as from st april and the reason why it is in the form for the purpose thereafter is to ensure that when people change their addresses the registration officer is able to determine at what date the residence started <e>", "<cs> my lords it is important because it is certain that the local authority will want to know what community charge to levy for any part of the year on a person who moves to and resides in a house in a particular area <e>", "<cs> my lords one always has to be cautious in replying to such a general question <e> <s> however all registration officers charged with compiling scotlands community charge registers are confident that they can provide their lists on time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord carmichael is right in saying that the cost of implementation of any new initiative is bound to be high <e> <s> of course the government will take account of the general costs <e> <s> however the whole operation is going smoothly and we look forward to hearing from local authorities on their progress as the months go by <e> <s> i repeat what i said to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe the authorities are confident that they can provide the lists on time and that must be in the interests of the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall certainly pass on those remarks to my noble friend lord caithness when he considers the position for england <e> <s> all i say to my noble friend is that in any new initiative there are always problems when getting down to composing the forms prescribed <e> <s> it does present difficulties <e> <s> however the registration officers who are the key men and women are optimistic that they will be able to deliver on time what they are required to do <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to go into the details of this whole matter which was very fully debated <e> <s> i am dealing with the scottish act <e> <s> as regards the scottish act there is grace given for the months when one does not have to pay as one moves from a residence <e> <s> that was debated very fully at the time <e>", "<cs> my lords i repeat what i said <e> <s> we shall take into account all the information we receive while we implement this new and very complicated business <e> <s> i am very confident that when we come to assess it the results will be very satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i am delighted to respond <e> <s> i do not know which newspapers the noble lord reads but i was delighted to read in the <e>", "<cs> my lords this depends upon the view of the registration officer as to what is the main residence of the person <e> <s> if it is a question of a second home the noble lord knows very well that certainly in the case of scotland there are regulations regarding the standard community charge <e>", "<cs> both amendments nos <e> <s> ca and cd address the impact of business rates in scotland <e> <s> i make it clear at the outset that the governments commitment to the reform of business rates remains firm <e> <s> we accept that business rates in scotland are too high and that particular sectors of scottish business can face quite disproportionate burdens compared with their competitors south of the border <e>", "<cs> i thank noble lords who have spoken to this amendment <e> <s> i feel as if i am back before the last election when the point was fully debated in this place as the committee knows <e> <s> i have heard nothing tonight that i did not hear then except that we have moved on a bit <e> <s> it has been our consistent intention since the green paper <e>", "<cs> i was going to refer to the points made by the noble lord when he proposed the amendment <e> <s> perhaps i may now deal with the cost of implementation which he raised <e> <s> the criticism that the government have wholly failed as he said to meet the requirement is unfair <e> <s> local authority bids in november totalled million for - and - and the government have allocated an extra million <e> <s> some bids may have exceeded original estimates but the government cannot be expected to increase provision in respect of every bid <e> <s> local authorities have been given a fair allocation covering their requirement for equipment plus a contribution to accommodation costs <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for introducing the amendment <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the arguments which he has put forward in support of the new clause <e> <s> however i cannot accept the thinking behind the proposal <e> <s> perhaps that will come as no surprise to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has raised an interesting point <e> <s> if he was a ratepayer in camden perhaps he would understand the difficulties under which the government have to implement the new system <e> <s> one of the good reasons why we were able to bring forward the provisions from st april in scotland was that the differentials are not nearly as great as those which are faced in the city of london and elsewhere in england <e>", "<cs> we have had an extensive debate which has covered the important issue of student nurses <e> <s> in addition the debate has ranged very much wider in so far as we have had figures bandied about <e> <s> i have to agree with my noble friend lady carnegy of lour about the whole question of the figures that are bandied about <e> <s> i do not want to trade figures with the noble lord <e> <s> lord morton <e> <s> the figures he has quoted appear to come into a category of scare stories put about by opponents of the system <e> <s> the governments calculations indicate that the average community charge which will be required to replace domestic rate income in the current year will he with figures of up to for the highest city <e>", "<cs> if members of the committee will allow me to complete what i have to say they may learn a little more and be enlightened on some points that i have not yet been able to make <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i can give him the figures which have appeared for edinburgh glasgow dundee aberdeen and newcastle <e> <s> they are and and are taken from the paper which i quoted earlier <e>", "<cs> the noble lord made four points <e> <s> first i shall look most closely at what he said on the issue of prisoners <e> <s> it is not intended that the exemption should cover fine defaulters whose stay in prison is normally a matter of a few days only and who may choose at any time to end their sentences by paying their fine <e> <s> however i shall consider carefully what the noble lord has said in that connection <e>", "<cs> that is a subject which we could debate at great length <e> <s> the most important point so far as i am concerned and i am sure so far as the noble lord is concerned is that revenue support grant arrangements will take the figures into account <e> <s> i shall look carefully at what has been said <e>", "<cs> i should like to look at what the noble lord has asked me <e> <s> i should have thought that the answer is yes but i should like to check on that point and write to him <e>", "<cs> any answer i give is always a justifiable answer <e>", "<cs> we well understand that major difficulties have appeared in trying to arrive at harmonisation <e> <s> the government for their part looked very carefully at the kind of amendment which would give the power required to assist in that harmonisation <e> <s> i shall not withdraw amendment no <e> <s> ca <e> <s> we have debated it <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the committee <e> <s> i thought that the number mentioned was zd <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> zb is brought forward following an approach from the scottish assessors association on behalf of the community registration officers <e> <s> it inserts into the registration of births deaths and marriages scotland act a new section which imposes on registrars of births deaths and marriages a duty to supply to community charges registration officers details of people whose deaths are registered in their district <e> <s> district registrars will be required to supply prescribed details of such persons to each community charges registration officer whose area includes at least part of the registrars district <e> <s> registration officers will therefore receive details of some deaths which have occurred in their areas but which are of persons resident elsewhere <e> <s> it will be for registration officers to convey the details of such deaths to the appropriate community charges registration officer under the standard arrangements by which registration officers may exchange information <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for explaining his amendments to my amendment <e> <s> first i should explain to the committee why we consider it necessary to impose on district registrars the duty to provide information about deaths but to have a power to make regulations transferring that duty to the registrar general <e> <s> it is clearly important that details of deaths are notified to registration officers as soon as possible after they occur so that the register can be kept up to date and so that early action can be taken to ensure that communications about community charge matters are not issued addressed to persons who have died <e>", "<cs> it seems as though the noble lord is correct <e> <s> i should like to check that point before i confirm that he is correct <e>", "<cs> i shall look again at that point and see what the position is <e> <s> backdating which is the point raised by the noble lord lord morton of shuna will be sorted out in due course <e> <s> however the ending of the liability would then be backdated <e>", "<cs> it is all very well for the noble lord lord morton of shuna to try to pick his legalistic way through what he believes to be unnecessary provisions <e> <s> as i made clear my right honourable friend the secretary of state can change the limits now by way of regulations <e> <s> therefore i believe that the concern expressed by the noble lord is quite unjustified <e>", "<cs> the amendment concerns a reference to incidental and consequential provisions <e> <s> the purpose of that is quite simply to enable us to trace through other parts of the act and certain consequential references in the land compensation scotland act to annual value and hereditament which are a consequence of the references which are the subject of the main amendment <e> <s> any other approach would involve a vast number of detailed amendments appearing in primary legislation <e> <s> i am confident that what we are doing in the amendment is entirely justified <e>", "<cs> we could carry on for a long time with this matter but i shall read carefully what has been said by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> i do not withdraw what i have said <e> <s> however if the government ought to consider any factor that the noble lord has raised we shall do so <e> <s> in the meantime i remain convinced that the committee should agree to amendment no <e> <s> zc <e>", "<cs> it is all very well to say that it is just administrative convenience but the noble lord will be well aware that administrative convenience can also save money <e> <s> the saving of money by a local authority in turn must save money for the ratepayer himself <e> <s> the expenditure goes down and therefore there is a saving to be made <e>", "<cs> we could go on and talk about consultation but we shall come to that later this evening <e> <s> i am looking forward to discussing consultation in regard to other matters <e> <s> bearing in mind that domestic rates will cease and therefore the case load will become smaller there are grounds to hope that delays will be reduced considerably <e> <s> i speak as someone who was involved in business in scotland <e> <s> i am perfectly certain that industry will welcome this procedure and therefore i cannot agree with the views expressed by the noble lord <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord the consultations which have taken place within government have brought us to the conclusion that this is the best way forward on a united kingdom basis <e> <s> from his many contributions to these valuable debates i should have thought that the noble lord believed in harmonisation north and south of the border <e> <s> i should have thought that it would be useful for the noble lord to realise that in some areas it is better to try to harmonise on these matters especially when many companies north and south of the border have branches on either side of it <e> <s> it is very much easier to have a system which is the same right across the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> as we said at the beginning of this discussion this grouping of amendments covers a very wide spectrum <e> <s> i shall do my best to deal with the three points which i think the noble lord lord morton of shuna brought to our notice <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may finish <e> <s> if the noble lord does not mind i should just like to complete this section because it is quite important <e> <s> since the amendment was tabled it has attracted a lot of comment both in this house and more particularly outside <e> <s> the points which the noble lord makes are very relevant <e> <s> i think i interpret the feelings of those to whom i have spoken <e> <s> on balance it would be preferable for prize draws or lotteries perhaps not to be available within the range of actions which local authorities may take to encourage people to enter into forms of payment arrangements <e> <s> this is not a matter on which the government feel strongly <e> <s> they acted on the advice of those who were in the local authority area <e> <s> we would not have included the point had it not been mentioned to us <e>", "<cs> i do not think that i said that <e> <s> however i shall look very carefully at what is printed in <e>", "<cs> perhaps it escaped the notice of the noble lord lord morton of shuna but if he turns to page of the bill he will see under clause b that <e>", "<cs> i shall need to look at that point but i think that the answer is no as far as concerns addresses <e> <s> i should like to check that and come back to the noble earl <e>", "<cs> i feel sure that the noble lord lord morton was in his place last tuesday when i answered a question that had a bearing on this subject <e> <s> we remain of the view that this provision will make things easier for the registration officers whose job is not an easy one as i am sure the noble lord understands <e> <s> during the discussion on tuesday my noble friend lord campbell of croy spoke of the macleans and mackenzies and mackays and of how difficult it would be to distinguish who was who in any particular family village or community <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted to come back on the english and welsh situation <e> <s> it has been acknowledged that information about dates of birth could be collected at the discretion of registration officers in certain circumstances where it would aid in the identification of individuals for example where several people of the same name had been arrested at the same address <e> <s> i imagine that this information will be of particular importance in wales because of the number of williamses and edwardses who happen to live in the various close communities <e>", "<cs> of course my noble friend is right <e> <s> no one could be more concerned about bringing forward so many amendments to the bill at this stage <e> <s> i shall give him two reasons which i gave on tuesday when we started on this particular course <e> <s> one reason welcomed on all sides of the committee i recall that the noble lord lord morton of shuna was particularly pleased is that the schedule puts together all the various exemptions so that we can see where we stand <e> <s> that was required and we felt it important to bring forward proposals at this stage particularly in view of the situation of my noble friend lord caithness at tile moment in relation to exemptions and what may yet be decided by the government <e>", "<cs> no i have no figures <e> <s> but i shall certainly endeavour to find out <e>", "<cs> furthermore we do not see how creating two separate united kingdom companies along the lines suggested for example in the arthur young report would increase competition <e> <s> that is an important point <e> <s> the companies would probably be operating in different market sectors and not competing head on <e> <s> indeed the arthur young report said that the proposed ravenscraig-shotton and dalzell or rsd group would occupy a niche market <e> <s> indeed it is the special coated steel market in that particular grouping <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl lord perth for bringing this amendment forward <e> <s> it has been a very wide-ranging debate we even got so far as a scottish parliament at one stage <e> <s> it may be appropriate if i started by reminding the committee of what my noble friend the secretary of state for trade and industry told the house on rd december last year <e> <s> he said then that my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster had been reviewing with the corporation the previous commitment given by the government that all five integrated plants would continue to operate until august <e> <s> in the light of that review the chairman of the corporation stated that subject to market conditions it expects that there will continue to be a commercial requirement for steelmaking and continuous casting at the corporations five integrated plants for at least the next seven years <e> <s> perhaps i may emphaise this to the noble lord lord morton of shuna seven years not five years <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord lord morton of shuna will permit me to say so i am coming to that point somewhat later <e> <s> i should also emphasise that the statement came from the corporation not the government <e> <s> it is a much stronger statement for that because it has not been contrived for political reasons it is based on a hard commercial assessment of the prospects for the steel market as the corporation think it will develop not how politicians would like it to develop <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will permit me i said assurances not guarantees <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl decides what he wants to do with the amendment perhaps i may say that he kindly wrote to my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland recently to inform him that he would be raising this matter in committee <e> <s> i should like to quote from the letter which he will be receiving and which has now been signed <e> <s> in respect of the powers that he asks should be given to the secretary of state the letter says <e>", "<cs> i can conceive of where a one-sentence letter might be sent but the noble lord lord hughes asks whether the letter will be available <e> <s> i am happy to agree that it should be placed in the library <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with the matter of the letter <e> <s> the noble earl will receive the letter today <e> <s> however as regards the content i wish to underpin the point i made regarding the serious implications which would lie behind the acceptance of the amendment by the government <e> <s> for that reason i cannot accept it <e> <s> so far as the statement of december is concerned and the terms which british steel coporation has published it is absolutely clear to me and i have no doubt to everyone else that the terms of that statement will when the prospectus comes to be drawn up for the issue of shares be made known to prospective shareholders <e>", "<cs> with pleasure my lords <e> <s> they are amendments nos <e> <s> cc cd and ce <e> <s> the noble lord will see in a moment why i wish to mention those amendments while speaking to amendment no <e> <s> a <e>", "<cs> my lords may i nevertheless proceed because i think the situation will be clarified as we go on <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall speak to amendments nos <e> <s> a and a <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may answer the points raised by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot at this stage but i shall look at the matter and write to the noble lord <e> <s> i should say in relation to this particular part of the group of amendments which is an important part that the matters of detail are under discussion between my right honourable friend the secretary of state and the convention of scottish <e>", "<cs> my lords in order to satisfy the noble lord perhaps i may say that the broad intention behind the amendment is clear enough <e> <s> it is to provide additional derating to cover certain church premises which are used for administrative purposes including for example those used for the training of the clergy <e> <s> as has been made clear the amendment was discussed <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall try to explain one or two points that the noble lord lord morton of shuna has raised <e> <s> on the question of community service volunteers while i accept what he says about the timetable for making detailed regulations in respect of the exemption in scotland it is extremely tight <e> <s> i should say however that the number of people affected by the exemption will be relatively small <e> <s> the absence of finalised regulations for the moment will not therefore interrupt the basic procedures whereby registration officers at present are making up the community charge registers in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not satisfy the noble lord lord morton of shuna as to whether he is a good draftsman or not <e> <s> however shall say as the noble lord will recall that a very similar amendment for england and wales was accepted last thursday <e> <s> in the light of that the government are considering their detailed position on the liability of student nurses for the personal community charge <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house perhaps too may go in reverse order again and start with the question about the information <e> <s> it is the governments intention to publicise these matters most fully <e> <s> i quite understand the noble lords point that it is no use accepting a good alteration to an act without publicising its effects <e> <s> i hope that i have made it perfectly clear to the noble lord lord morton of shuna that there will be a very clear exposition of this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna for raising this difficult area so far as concerns the act <e> <s> however it may be helpful for me to deal first with what i understand to be the technical purpose of the amendment which has been tabled <e>", "<cs> my lords the british steel corporation and its chairman issued a statement on rd december as i have stated <e> <s> i believe that the british steel corporation chairman and his board are people of honour and of their word <e> <s> i accept of course what the noble lord said about miserable performances <e> <s> he was talking about the political miserable performances of some political parties in scotland <e> <s> i am referring to the result of the conservative governments efforts to turn the british steel corporation round into a profitable company which these results truly demonstrate <e> <s> i warmly congratulate the corporations management and workforce on that excellent achievement <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord morton of shuna asked a question about the hot strip mill at the committee stage <e> <s> i repeat the assurance that the british steel corporation gave namely that until next year there will be a continuance of the hot strip mill at ravenscraig <e> <s> the noble lord knows that as well as i do <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understand it i believe that the noble lord lord hughes with leave of the house is asking what guarantees there are that the privatised company will fulfil the obligations which are implicit in the statement of rd december not a year ago <e> <s> when the prospectus for the new privatised company is produced and this is on record the statement which was made on rd december will be reflected in the prospectus <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to repeat what i said to the noble lord lord hughes <e> <s> i can assure the house that the terms of the corporations rd december statement with regard to its integrated plants will be reflected in the prospectus which will be issued at the time of privatisation <e> <s> the undertaking given by the corporation to consider on a commercial basis any wholly private-sector offer for steel-making facilities at ravenscraig as an alternative to closure is clearly on the record <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i need to take advice on that matter because there is a question as regards what is included in the prospectus <e> <s> however at this stage i am saying that the government will discuss the issue of the various undertakings being incorporated in the prospectus in suitable terms <e> <s> it is an offer to discuss as the noble earl lord perth wishes <e> <s> i have given that undertaking <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment was debated in some detail during committee consideration of the bill <e> <s> i am aware of the concern of the scottish council for single homeless and others that the development of community care policies in scotland should not be ignored by those bodies that are best able to promote those policies <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the remit of scottish homes is very wide <e> <s> in this particular case we are talking about the problems relating to community care <e> <s> as the successor to the housing corporation scottish homes will have a part to play <e> <s> where the government are at odds with the noble lord lord carmichael in respect of this amendment is that we do not believe that scottish homes should have a central role <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house we are in the process of setting up scottish homes <e> <s> after the bill becomes an act <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we have spoken earlier this afternoon about the powers of the secretary of state to intervene <e> <s> in this case i am perfectly certain that if he felt strongly that scottish homes was not carrying through one of the main objectives for instance that community care was falling by the wayside and something of a policy nature had to be undertaken the answer would undoubtedly be yes <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to reply to some of those remarks <e> <s> i had thought that in committee the importance had been recognized as indeed the noble lord lord carmichael recognized of the amendments that were put forward <e> <s> as the noble lord lord kirkhill will know as regards rented accommodation one has to seek a balance <e> <s> there is nothing to stop succession as was referred to such as two sisters or a brother or a sister living together being written into a tenancy agreement <e> <s> as my noble friend lord selkirk said at committee stage it is up to the government to publicise the new rules on tenancy <e> <s> that is indeed the governments priority <e> <s> there is nothing to stop a joint tenancy agreement being written an agreement between the landlord and the tenant which answers the point of the noble baroness lady fisher about a joint tenancy agreement with another member of the family <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can say that i am prepared to look at this <e> <s> i understand exactly what the noble lord <e> <s> lord morton of shuna <e> <s> is attempting to achieve <e> <s> i shall certainly look at it in that way and if there is any way of tightening it up i shall certainly see whether we can oblige <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house we are talking about the actual written document between landlord and tenant <e> <s> however i feel i should explain the matter as i know of my noble friends interest <e> <s> we have not required the landlord to give the tenant a written lease but a document setting out the terms of the tenancy <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may say to my noble friend that the document will include the terms of the tenancy including any matter relating to succession which i believe was the point he was making <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house this is a very important point whether those concerned are citizens advice bureaux scottish homes or whatever <e> <s> the government are well aware that tenants rights are a very important aspect and are not always understood <e> <s> they are sometimes deliberately misunderstood and particularly by some landlords as we have said as to what the assured tenancies will be <e> <s> i give the noble lord my assurance that the government are well aware of this matter and that it is necessary to explain once the bill has become an act what has happened so that everyone understands what are their rights <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is very important to be clear about the point at debate in relation to this amendment <e> <s> it is not about whether the government are taking away a right of veto by individual tenants over the transfer of their houses from one landlord to another <e> <s> i know that the briefing material supplied by shelter scotland gives this impression but there is not and has never been such a right of veto <e> <s> this is not point which is affected by the opinion of counsel to which i shall come in a minute <e> <s> it is a matter of fact that clause whether amended or unamended has no bearing at all on the powers of public housing authorities to transfer houses to other landlords <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the difficult situation in which some noble lords find themselves in relation to this clause <e> <s> of course i am prepared to read and see the case that has been made by the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> of course i shall do so and if i believe that the clause needs to be examined in any way we shall certainly do so <e>", "<cs> my lords before i answer may i ask the noble lord lord carmichael whether he was also speaking to the other amendments in the group <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i am sure that your lordships will not he surprised when i tell the house that i shall not accept the amendments <e> <s> however i shall probably speak for even longer than the noble lord lord carmichael <e>", "<cs> my lords by leave of the house of course i think i see what the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe is aiming at <e> <s> i had hoped that by the long statement i made he would understand that we are just as keen to deal with the situation to which he refers as he is <e> <s> but it is all in the method of doing it <e>", "<cs> my lords as i understood it the noble lord lord carmichael was speaking to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> i believe that we shall be taking amendments nos <e> <s> and separately <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened with interest to what the noble lord lord carmichael has said concerning the amendments <e> <s> the matter was fully considered in another place and in your lordships house in committee <e> <s> i continue however to be unable to recommend that any of these amendments be accepted <e>", "<cs> my lords i must make it clear that i now have the document from cosla in front of me <e> <s> it is in connection with clause page line <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make that point absolutely clear and put it on the record <e> <s> so far as concerns the question of choice i think that we have made it very clear <e> <s> indeed at committee stage i was able to give figures about <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened carefully to what the noble lord lord mackie of benshie has said <e> <s> indeed i am sure that with his permission i shall be able to send a copy of the letter that i wrote to him to my noble friend lady carnegy of lour <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been very interested in the contributions to the debate <e> <s> indeed i am happy to answer on this matter which is obviously of great concern to the people of scotland <e> <s> my reply is quite full because i think the subject has to be understood clearly by all concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords when i have finished my story i believe that the noble lord will understand one or two of the points which have not been clear until now <e> <s> given these changed circumstances further consideration of transfer of ssha houses to shetland islands council does not arise <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i was referring to the questionnaire which was sent out in the tenants survey <e> <s> the words were <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house under the present arrangements which the ssha operates which will be transferred straight across to scottish homes if a case is made to the secretary of state under clause this could be possible with the secretary of states agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may make something absolutely clear <e> <s> what has to happen first is that ssha has to produce a scheme which will be presented to the secretary of state <e> <s> the ssha chairman has made it clear to tenants that he did not recommend sale to the shetland island council but the option is open to ssha as it will be to scottish homes to present a case if it wishes having taken everything into consideration <e> <s> i have no doubt that scottish homes will do so in its review of the arrangements of management <e> <s> if that happens then of course there is a way forward which may be the course that ssha and its successor body scottish homes will wish to adopt <e> <s> obviously this is something they would have to study and take due consideration of tenants views <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to my noble friend lady carnegy for tabling this amendment which enables the concession agreed to england and wales to apply also to scotland <e> <s> i have no hesitation in accepting it <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord mcintosh has explained this amendment is designed to extend to scotland the scheme of additional payments to disabled people on low incomes which is embodied in the amendments tabled at report stage by the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale <e>", "<cs> my lords in speaking to this amendment i also speak to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> i begin by dealing with amendment no <e> <s> which corresponds to amendments which have been discussed at earlier stages in the passage of the bill through this house and another place <e> <s> subsection d is i believe necessary to make it clear that while the price on transfer should reflect the current state of the house to be acquired it should also assume that the new landlord will within a reasonable period carry out works reasonably necessary to put the house into the state of repair required by the landlords repairing obligations <e> <s> where a house has been properly maintained by the <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not rising i thought i was going to hear a longer speech <e> <s> this matter has been debated at length in another place and an identical amendment was discussed here in committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords and my noble friend lady carnegy of lour for their contributions to the debate <e> <s> i look forward to studying the points that they have made <e> <s> the general concept has been welcomed <e> <s> we are perhaps breaking new ground all we have to go on at this particular stage are the experiments in brent and bromley and it is very difficult to draw conclusions on such a narrow base <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it is my understanding that it is up to the local authority to bring forward a scheme of its choosing <e> <s> it gives it the power to decide exactly what to bring forward to the secretary of state <e> <s> it does not apply to the whole of the housing stock <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i apologise <e> <s> the answer is no not necessarily <e>", "<cs> my lords these amendments were debated in some detail as the noble lord lord morton of shuna knows during committee stage <e> <s> i have listened carefully to the points made by him then and today but i am still of the view that these amendments are both unnecessary and undesirable <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that snide remarks of that kind do not do much to further the cause of the bill in this chamber <e> <s> so far as i am concerned believe that those who have a proper problem to raise usually face it up fairly early when they know the circumstances <e> <s> however now that it has been raised by the noble lord lord morton of shuna i treat the matter extremely seriously <e> <s> it will receive my extremely careful consideration and extremely careful answers will be given to those affected <e>", "<cs> yes my lords we are dealing with the timescale for an appeal as well as the lodging of the offer <e> <s> i know that there are other statutory provisions which contain a six months time limit <e> <s> the choice of time limit must depend on the circumstances in which it will have to be applied <e> <s> but in returning to my general point no one has suggested as a matter of practicality in relation to the absorption of the housing corporation in scotland and the ssha into scottish homes that three months is in any way inadequate <e> <s> finally we must bear in mind that the three-month period is not absolute because it can be extended if an industrial tribunal is satisfied that it was not reasonably practical for complaint to be presented before the end of the period of three months <e> <s> i hope that that answer will satisfy the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e>", "<cs> my lords am always ready to listen to what my noble friend said <e> <s> i shall look at this and write to him <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to thank those noble lords who have helped me to achieve this result <e> <s> i should say to the noble lord lord hughes that i would be delighted to throw away my brief but i am not a lawyer <e> <s> we have to he very careful to get everything just right <e>", "<cs> this will do much for housing associations in scotland <e> <s> of that i am absolutely convinced <e>", "<cs> my lords i have to admit that i was surprised to see this amendment on the order paper <e> <s> in another place members on all sides argued strongly that this ground for possession that suitable alternative accommodation is available should be discretionary rather than mandatory <e> <s> the government responded to those arguments and as your lordships are aware the ground is now subject to the sheriffs discretion <e>", "<cs> my lords i said part iii <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord morton of shuna i must say that it is always possible for those who are drafting legislation to realise after amendments have been put down that they may not cover the whole subject <e> <s> i am concerned that this bill should leave the house in good order so that it can be passed and enacted <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord morton of shuna <e> <s> yes i am happy to give him the assurance on the latter point <e> <s> i have written a very long letter to him which i do not propose to read <e> <s> the letter bears out the point he makes that schedule and schedule are dealt with in the corresponding bills <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill be now read a second time <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for speaking and giving the matter before us the passing of the bill his blessing <e> <s> i am not surprised that he took the opportunity to raise the question of privatisation although it is not strictly concerned with this bill but it was very much a feature of the debates in another place on this matter <e> <s> as he knows very well the government firmly believe that the requirement to operate in the private sector will provide added incentives to and sustain pressure on the boards further to improve performance and minimise costs to the benefit of customers and shareholders <e>", "<cs> my lords the government like any other institution have to bear costs in mind <e> <s> it was costs that closed the invergordon smelter <e>", "<cs> i thank all those who have spoken about our proposals <e> <s> i should particularly like to thank the noble lord lord carmichael for as i understand it generally welcoming what we are dealing with <e> <s> i should emphasise that we are dealing with a much narrower point than i believe my noble friend lord selkirk addressed <e> <s> we are dealing with the narrow position dealt with by the scottish office and my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland in relation to the voluntary sale of local authority houses which have to come within his orbit <e> <s> we are dealing with that and that alone in this set of amendments <e>", "<cs> yes indeed we are dealing with the right to buy <e> <s> we shall come to the question of consultation later <e> <s> however the debate which has taken place has gone rather wide of the provision which we are dealing with here which is the right to buy in connection with local authority voluntary sales <e> <s> i shall address the points relating to consultation raised by my noble friend lady carnegy of lour when we come to that particular amendment <e> <s> if my noble friend will forgive me i would rather deal with it then <e> <s> however in relation to the publication of details i can assure her that that will be the case <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may deal with that point <e> <s> we have issued an information paper to local authorities on the subject of the voluntary proposals as the noble lord lord carmichael has said <e> <s> we shall of course issue information on tenants choice when the scottish bill comes into effect <e> <s> scottish homes has power to publicise tenants rights and will be invited by my right honourable friend so to do <e> <s> i think that that answers that particular point <e>", "<cs> i should like to study what my noble friend has said and come back to him in writing to ensure that i do not admit to something we are not going to do <e> <s> however i have said that the criteria ought to appear as a real burden on the title in accordance with good conveyancing practice <e> <s> i should like to check up on the point he makes about scottish homes and the criteria which will apply and write to him accordingly <e>", "<cs> we debated at great length how far the government and scottish homes would have powers over first second and subsequent sales <e> <s> after the property has transferred a first time scottish homes still has an interest <e> <s> after it transfers for a second time scottish homes still has an interest <e> <s> after that no <e>", "<cs> that is not a good enough offer <e>", "<cs> the amendment of the noble lord lord carmichael does not specify who he wishes to see consult with cosla on the cost of school boards <e> <s> i find it hard to believe that the noble lord means the government because he of all people must know that arrangements already exist by which cosla consults with the scottish office on the matter of local authority spending and revenue support grant <e> <s> the financing of school boards was certainly firmly on the agenda when these matters were discussed in coming to the current settlement <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> the figure of million to million is for training for a period of over three years <e>", "<cs> the government considered very closely the statutory position of school boards in relation to their education authorities and the bill makes careful provision in that respect <e> <s> clause already makes a very similar provision and we believe that it makes this amendment unnecessary <e> <s> under the terms of clause a board must act in accordance with its education authoritys statutory duties <e> <s> indeed clause goes further in requiring boards also to act in accordance with the authoritys obligations under the common law <e>", "<cs> when we asked for responses to our consultation paper on school management the great majority of responses and perhaps my interpretation was a little different from that of the noble lord lord carmichael showed the conviction that something had to be done to provide parents with a voice in the running of the school system <e> <s> we take this matter extremely seriously <e> <s> when we suggested in the consultation paper that smaller schools might be grouped together under a joint board there were protests from parents and teachers in small communities who wanted a board for every school <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what he wants to do with the amendment i should just like to answer one point concerning awareness <e> <s> we shall do everything possible once the bill becomes enacted to make parents aware of all the possibilities <e> <s> however that is a totally different point and one which we shall come to later when we deal with the timescale for balloting and so on <e> <s> however i feel that the principle of the issue lies with the governments case <e>", "<cs> i thank all noble lords who have had contributed to this amendment <e> <s> i know that the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove sets great store by it and it is a crucial part of the approach to the bill <e> <s> the idea that school boards should have a majority of parent members is fundamental to our approach <e> <s> it is written into the structure of the bill not only in the obvious sense that clause requires a parental majority but also in the provisions of clause which state that where insufficient parents stand for election there will be no board <e> <s> that is the measure of our commitment to this aspect of the proposals <e> <s> if there are not sufficient parents willing or able to stand for election and to form the parental majority no board will be established <e>", "<cs> in reply to that point i must say that education is one thing but teaching is another <e> <s> if i remember my latin <e>", "<cs> we have nothing against the generality of teachers and other professionals in education serving as parent board members <e> <s> that is why the bill places no general ban on them <e> <s> our only reservation is about the ability of someone who has a professional commitment to a particular school to overcome that close involvement sufficiently to represent the interests of the parents properly <e> <s> i admit that it is a balanced judgment and the decision to make the provision of the bill as it stands was not taken lightly <e>", "<cs> i hope to be able to provide the counterbalance in reply to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e>", "<cs> as i understand it my noble friend is referring to the position of religious bodies other than those connected with denominational schools <e> <s> those are roman catholic in the main <e>", "<cs> we have received representations on this point from the church of scotland which have been considered carefully <e> <s> there is no easy answer <e> <s> my noble friend will know this if he goes to the western isles or some parts of northern scotland where non-denominational schools and religious bodies are very disparate <e> <s> there will have to be heavy reliance on the guidance given to school boards in order to ensure an input from those involved with religion <e> <s> however that would have to be on a straight co-option basis rather than by designating a place for the purpose <e>", "<cs> i recognise the points that the noble lord and my noble friend lady carnegy made about the interests which various community groups will have in the work of boards <e>", "<cs> in thanking the noble lord lord carmichael for moving the amendment i should like to speak to it and to my own amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes they can <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael referred to the bills passage in another place in this connection <e> <s> there was much debate about rights of attendance for the education authority and for the local regional councillor <e> <s> there was particularly wide support for the principle that the local regional councillor should have a right of attendance at board meetings and a right to speak <e> <s> my honourable friend the minister for health and education listened very closely to the views expressed then and in response concluded that it was right and proper that both the education authority and the local regional councillor in whose area the school is situated should have the right to attend board meetings and to speak <e> <s> the result of his conclusions appear before you as clause subsections and <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord carmichael pointed out that boards will not be required to consider authority advice except where they have specifically requested it clause <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> it may be that a board will have business on which authority advice would be either unwelcome or irrelevant <e> <s> for example it would be wrong to force boards to have regard to advice about whom to choose as co-opted members or as office bearers <e> <s> on the other hand it would be proper for the authority to suggest what groups a board might consider seeking nominations from or to advise the board what considerations might be relevant in selecting a chairman <e>", "<cs> the basic duty of the head teacher to his employers is to implement the authoritys policies and procedures for the discharge of its statutory duties <e> <s> the bill does not lessen the accountability of the head teacher to the education authority in this respect <e> <s> in fact it goes further by clearly identifying the head teacher as the boards adviser rather than a board member <e> <s> if the head teacher was a voting member of the hoard he could become committed to board decisions which the authority would want to countermand or question <e> <s> this would be an impossible position <e> <s> therefore the head teacher has been given a more independent role in relation to his board in order to avoid the suggestion that he could become the servant of two masters which is a very real concern <e> <s> the bill does not seek to weaken the head teachers contractual relationship with the authority and maintains a proper degree of independence from the board for the head teacher <e>", "<cs> i welcome the noble baroness lady seear to this discussion <e> <s> i am pleased to hear what she has to say <e> <s> of course as we have said in this debate the role of the head teacher is one that requires much careful thought <e> <s> he has a statutory duty to his authority and quite rightly he has to advise his school board of the important aspects of that duty which he has to perform <e> <s> however in addition there are other operations which may or may not be delegated on which the school board can express an opinion <e> <s> in these matters we feel that it is right that the head teacher knowing the local circumstances should be able to advise his board because he is only an adviser and not a member of the board about what he thinks would be best for the school <e>", "<cs> i recognise the words of sections and of the local government scotland act in the amendment <e> <s> i can understand the feeling that if those provisions are right for a local authority they must be right for school boards <e> <s> in fact we feel that the amendment is unnecessary and in practice would go much further than noble lords opposite intend <e>", "<cs> i thought that i had answered the point with regard to this area of the bill <e> <s> as it stands the amendment does not seem to me to address the points which have already been addressed in other parts of the bill <e> <s> there are three categories of amendment <e> <s> one of them is where we feel the amendment to be unnecessary and we feel this amendment to be unnecessary <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful if i explain how we see clause working <e> <s> the clause gives boards power to regulate their proceedings subject to any overriding requirements of the bill <e> <s> they would have to comply with the requirements on keeping minutes for example <e> <s> to exercise that power effectively boards must be able to set and to vary their own standing orders <e> <s> that is what we intend should happen <e>", "<cs> as i understand it that is so <e> <s> it is important that the various boards draw up standing orders <e> <s> that is what we shall be asking them to do <e> <s> of course we shall also go further than that and give them some guidance as to how they should draw <e>", "<cs> i think a helping hand is a good expression <e> <s> it is certainly very different from direction by education authorities which we would wish to avoid <e>", "<cs> i have very little else to say other than that of course we have to allow the school boards to set their own standing orders <e> <s> what they should do and what i have no doubt they will do is to take the advice of education authorities up and down scotland and also take advice from other bodies as well as consider the guidance which we shall give them on setting up <e> <s> i hope that finally the standing orders that are produced across scotland will he similar as the noble lord lord carmichael has indicated <e> <s> however i have to point out to him that sometimes variety can be the spice of life <e>", "<cs> i think i can quickly reassure the committee about scrutiny of boards stewardship of funds <e> <s> first we envisage boards operating within the education authorities financial management systems <e> <s> it is not intended to require authorities to hand over cash or to open a separate bank account for funds allocated to each board <e> <s> the allocation of funds to boards and their expenditure would be conducted within the education authoritys accounting and financial management systems <e> <s> the authoritys audit arrangements would thus apply directly and the amendment is unnecessary on that score <e>", "<cs> before delegation it is of course signed by the education authority <e> <s> when one comes to delegation of powers that is when we can go further than the local authority <e> <s> as i indicated under clause there are powers for the education authority in any delegation order to consider what financial regulations should be put in place <e>", "<cs> i know that the noble lord was not satisfied with an earlier reply that i gave <e> <s> i am absolutely satisfied with the reply <e>", "<cs> i welcome the conciliatory tone with which the noble lord lord mackie of benshie addresses this section of the bill <e>", "<cs> i should like to consider the point that the noble lord lord kirkhill is making <e> <s> if he will allow me i shall consider the matter reflect on it and write to him <e>", "<cs> in answer to the point about future delegation i have explained that any agreement has to have the support of the local authority for the delegations proposed and in particular the financial concerns relating thereto <e> <s> it is in the power of the education authority to limit that financial discretion <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend i spelt out to him that the school board is an unincorporated statutory body <e>", "<cs> as i understand it yes <e>", "<cs> these amendments cover three separate areas <e> <s> first the amendment to clause affects the sums which authorities are required to make available to a head teacher for expenditure on books and materials so-called capitation <e> <s> the amendment refers to these sums being allocated to a school board which is not how the bill proposes it should be done <e> <s> secondly the amendment to clause covers the administrative and other expenses of a board <e> <s> thirdly the amendment to clause also covers the funds made available to carry out any delegated functions a board may have <e>", "<cs> i should have thought that the noble lord with his vast experience of local authority work and being involved in the local education authority in aberdeen would understand that local authorities take into account what is necessary <e> <s> we are talking here of capitation in particular for shall we say <e> <s> the supply of books and materials to any particular school <e> <s> when they set down what are the necessary funds for that i should have thought that a budget would be taken out for each and every school <e> <s> the government expect the local authority to do that and i am sure that it does <e> <s> we believe that to be what is reasonably required and necessary for a school to operate <e>", "<cs> we on this side of the committee comprehend the situation exactly <e> <s> the only area where there is reasonable ground for division of opinion is in talking about selective action <e> <s> i had thought that my explanation was clear in that respect <e> <s> while we deplore wreckless authorities which overspend they must meet the consequences of their actions <e>", "<cs> i accept that there are serious questions about the relationship between boards and head teachers in the disposition of money for books and materials in the school capitation expenditure <e> <s> but first let us look at what the bill provides <e> <s> it provides that for the first time education authorities will be required to make money available to head teachers for expenditure on books and materials <e> <s> furthermore the authorities will have to provide an amount which they think necessary for the purpose and be prepared to justify their judgments in those terms <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for asking me to repeat my reply concerning a genuine deadlock <e> <s> there will be nothing to prevent the education authority from funding directly the expenditure proposed by the head teacher <e> <s> money already allocated in the current year would be frozen that is the important point and would have to be set off against further expenditure in the following year <e> <s> moreover the point made by the noble lord confirms my view that perhaps the government were not entirely wrong in having parent representation as a majority <e>", "<cs> the amendment would require head teachers to provide an annual report on curriculum policy and pupil progress <e> <s> but the bill in clause already provides that head teachers will have to give boards information and reports in a number of areas including a statement of the policy applied in the school on curriculum and thereafter to advise the board of any change to that policy <e> <s> that part of the amendment which relates to curriculum policy is therefore unnecessary <e> <s> in any event nothing in the bill would stop the head teachers annual report including a statement on curriculum policy <e> <s> other than for a report on the level of attainment of the pupils in the school it will he for the board and the head teacher to agree what information the annual report should contain <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie will be surprised to know that i have no quarrel with the underlying intention behind the amendment which is to involve the school board in the content format and distribution of the information contained in school handbooks <e> <s> an element of co-responsibility in the school handbook will go a long way towards improving it <e> <s> advice from users and potential users about how to present the information required will be invaluable in improving the handbooks and especially in making the information in them more accessible for the users <e>", "<cs> we touched upon that point regarding change of policy during the discussion on the previous amendment if i recall my own words on the matter correctly <e> <s> if there is a change in policy then it is up to the head teacher to discuss the matter with the school board and it should be publicised <e> <s> one of the duties which we shall come to later is that it is imperative that the school board informs its constituency that is the parents of any major changes <e> <s> that aspect comes into that area <e>", "<cs> i know that there is some concern that boards could evade the responsibility to report to parents because the bill leaves it up to the board itself to decide how often it is necessary to make reports <e> <s> i understand that anxiety <e>", "<cs> the principle of delegation is that boards should be able to take on additional functions and responsibilities from education authorities when they feel able to do so <e> <s> the power to enter into contracts or agreements is vital to that <e> <s> the noble lords amendment runs contrary to the principle of delegation which is to devolve further responsibilities on to boards <e> <s> what is the point of giving a board an area of delegated responsibility while at the same time withholding a major part of the responsibility for carrying out this delegated function <e> <s> you cannot truly have a delegated function if every time there is the most trivial of agreements to be made this involves bringing in your authority <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie <e> <s> i think that he should come over here and help me with the bill <e>", "<cs> yes he is <e> <s> i am coming to the point <e> <s> for example anything done in a secondary school could be said to extend to the interests of its feeder primaries <e> <s> moreover this amendment would appear to prevent the kind of cooperative working between boards which the opposition quite properly regarded as a matter of some importance in the discussion in another place <e>", "<cs> the provision for school boards to have additional functions delegated to them from education authorities is a mainstay of <e>", "<cs> my lords of course i understand the point the noble lord lord carmichael makes <e> <s> this amendment seeks to impose on scottish homes by statute the requirement to have regard to the views of tenants liable as a result of disposal by the new agency to cease to be secure tenants <e> <s> to apply such a requirement by statute is unnecessary as it will be one of many which the secretary of state for scotland will apply to scottish homes as he currently does to the scottish special housing association <e>", "<cs> my lords the intention of this amendment is to require a local authority if it disposes of tenanted houses to the ssha or scottish homes to go through the same statutory consultation with tenants as this schedule requires if it proposes to dispose of any of its stock to another private sector body <e> <s> in practice i believe that most local authorities would expect to consult tenants about such disposals in exactly the same way as if the sale proposed was for example to a housing association or to a private sector landlord <e> <s> i am not unsympathetic to the noble lords purpose <e> <s> however i should like to draw his attention to clause on page of the bill <e> <s> at line reference is made to consultation being required with tenants who <e>", "<cs> my lords i have studied the amendments closely <e> <s> they amount to quite a large raft and i shall deal with them as best i can <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord decides what he will do with his amendments i should like to point out that the local authority must report to the secretary of state the views of the tenants <e> <s> i should have thought that if there were a number of tenants or a few gathered together who decided that they did not like the idea of change there is absolutely no reason why they should not first write to the local authority and if that body does not present their views as it is required to do to the secretary of state <e> <s> there is always redress <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble lord lord carmichael for what is clearly intended to be a helpful amendment to correct what he sees as an anomalous position <e> <s> but i have given thought to the question and do not believe that it would be right to accept his amendment <e> <s> we are correct to apply general conditions of disqualification for membership of school boards which could have a range of executive functions <e> <s> but similar provisions are not necessarily appropriate for sub-committees which are to have no substantive decision-making powers which will have more specific concerns and whose membership can be changed easily by the board if some deficiency is discovered <e> <s> the important thing will be for a board to select people who are best placed to advise and give views on the particular area being considered by the sub-committee <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about a disqualification as regards subcommittees of school boards <e> <s> i appreciate what my noble friend is saying about the general disqualification rules but as regards sub-committees which do not have a substantive part in the decision making of school boards but report to them we are anxious that they should not be subjected to the powers which the noble lord lord carmichael would seek to impose on that particular body <e>", "<cs> my lords this is an important amendment and i feel that the noble lord lord carmichael and i have been here before <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to study what the <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord lord carmichael said clause already provides for boards to make standing orders <e> <s> it has always been the governments intention that they should make them <e> <s> however the proposed amendment would go much further <e> <s> by using the word shall it would require all regulation of board proceedings to be by standing orders <e> <s> there would be no opportunity at all for flexibility in proceedings <e> <s> for example unless standing orders specifically provided for it the chairman would not even be able to vary the order of consideration of agenda items to suit the convenience of the board <e> <s> the result would be hopeless rigidity or standing orders of monumental complexity and length relative to the size and local nature of the board <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i may say that indeed that is the form of guidance that we shall be working on very closely <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened carefully to what the noble lord said <e> <s> i also looked at what was said on this matter in committee <e> <s> i have no objection to the principle of these amendments although there are some technical and stylistic problems <e> <s> for example i take it that the amendment to line was supposed to follow from the existing terms of the bill <e> <s> unfortunately the first amendment removes these words <e> <s> however if the noble lord will consider withdrawing these amendments i shall certainly consider this and come to an agreed form of words <e> <s> perhaps he will discuss the matter with me before the next stage of the bill <e> <s> with that assurance i hope that he will seek at this stage to withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that the amendment is intended to prevent a member of the board acting as a clerk <e> <s> it would not have that effect <e> <s> its effect would simply be to require any clerk to be paid <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise some of my own words and i thank the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> we ought to go over this point because it is very important <e>", "<cs> my lords under our amendments we require a board to report to parents <e> <s> i should have thought that such a report should have the basis of any substantive situations which ought to be drawn to the attention of parents <e> <s> i believe that following from that it would be the boards decision as to whether the importance of what it was reporting required a meeting <e> <s> it is important that the position should not arise where the minimum requirement is merely that as i understand has happened in some parts of england and wales <e>", "<cs> my lords during the committee stage there was indeed a long discussion <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the acting head teacher can do everything in relation to what he must do as an acting head teacher <e> <s> what he cannot do is become chairman of the committee which deals with such situations <e> <s> i hope i have made myself clear <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble and learned friend the lord advocate carefully explained in committee the procedure for delegation of functions <e> <s> i shall not repeat at length the provisions of the schedule however the framework of the delegation procedure must be clearly understood <e> <s> in response to anxieties that boards might seek to take on additional functions against the wishes of local parents provisions requiring a board to call for a ballot of all parents of pupils at the school before they proceed to appeal have been included in the bill <e> <s> both the authority and the board have an opportunity at this stage to put their case to the parents <e> <s> if the authority believes that wider considerations of the kind proposed in this amendment are material it may put them before the parents <e> <s> only if a majority of the parents voting in the ballot supports the principle of delegation is the board allowed to make an appeal to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house what i have said in my general remarks about this is that all other procedures having been gone through the matter reaching the desk of the secretary of state he has to listen to what the local authority has to say and also to what the school board is proposing <e> <s> that is why i spelt out the contracting situation <e> <s> i believe that we are quite a long way from that position but i understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> as i understand the position there is absolutely nothing to prevent an authority putting its position to the secretary of state before a decision is taken by him <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lords lord underhill <e> <s> lord tordoff and lord taylor of gryfe for their expressions of sympathy at this time <e> <s> like them i believe that the response from the emergency services was second to none <e> <s> the dumfries and galloway <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the right reverend prelate for those words <e> <s> it is a sad event especially at christmas time and the relatives and friends of those who have perished and those who are injured are much in our thoughts <e>", "<cs> my lords i must refrain from speculation on this matter and stick to the facts which were given to me from a report at am this morning <e> <s> five people attended dumfries royal infirmary with injuries arising from the disaster <e> <s> of those five two have been discharged <e> <s> two elderly people have suffered major burns and are described as being in a very serious condition <e> <s> the remaining person has suffered a scalp wound which is not believed to be serious <e> <s> that is an interim report it is factual <e> <s> no information on the surrounding villages or how they have been affected has yet come to me <e>", "<cs> my lords as regards the expressions to the american people and particularly those who are in the services i thank my noble friend lord boyd-carpenter for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for those remarks <e> <s> i could not agree with him more <e> <s> it hinders the task of the emergency services when this kind of event happens and i am sure that due note will be taken of the circumstances of the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first point out that the recent large reduction in quota applied particularly to haddock in the north sea and not other species <e> <s> as noble lords will know there are many other species which arc fished for <e> <s> i say to my noble friend that definitive scientific advice for was not available until november <e> <s> the reason is that the fishery is directed at very young fish and assessments of stock levels can therefore only be made late in the day <e>", "<cs> my lords in reply to the noble lord lord gallacher the question of fishery protection is very important <e> <s> as concerns my own responsibility for the scottish waters i am absolutely convinced that the measure of protection afforded is the correct one <e> <s> however i have to say to the noble lord that it is not an easy task to quantify and the matter is always kept under review <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a term used in connection with fish stocks by the scientists when they assess what the recruitment is in numbers of new fish born into the fisheries in any one year <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord makes a very serious point in relation to the fishing industry <e> <s> it is particularly important to many towns up and down the coast of the united kingdom <e> <s> i have to say however that the significance attached to conservation and conservation measures is all important <e> <s> if the industry or if governments do not pay any attention to conservation there will be no fish left to catch as happened with herring in the s <e>", "<cs> my lords <e> <s> i think i should clarify my remarks in relation to the pelagic as opposed to the white fish species <e> <s> the pelagic species are also under great pressure <e> <s> existing pelagic capacity is more than able to take the pelagic quotas which in the case of mackerel have gone down this year <e> <s> i should remind my noble friend that the total white fish opportunities that is cod whiting saithe and haddock in for the north sea and the west of scotland will be about per cent <e> <s> of the estimated catches of <e> <s> so the need for diversion of effort should be limited <e> <s> i do not deny that the problem regarding north sea haddock stocks is very serious but it should be borne in mind that the other species form a very large part of the income of fishermen <e>", "<cs> my lords the difficulty we have with mesh size is a very great one and a very complex one <e> <s> from st january as i have already said we increased the minimum mesh size to millimetres from a lower size <e> <s> the difficulty we have particularly in regard to the scottish fleet is that it is a mixed fishery <e> <s> that means that it is very difficult to move up without some considerable loss of one of the species particularly whiting in the fishermens catches <e> <s> if the catches consisted all of cod there would be no problem and we could move up quite dramatically <e> <s> however we are discussing this matter at the present time with other member states <e> <s> the matter is for the united kingdom of very great importance <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful for my noble friends observation <e> <s> i believe it was the most difficult negotiation we have undertaken since the common fisheries policy was instituted in for the united kingdom <e> <s> i am grateful that my noble friend has observed that the increase from per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the north sea haddock quota meant that we were able to invoke the hague preference and obtain a larger share than we would otherwise have achieved <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very happy to tell the noble lord that the answer is yes <e> <s> i believe that to be the case <e> <s> i hope that fish prices will attain a good level so that the fishermen who are facing reductions in quotas will be able to obtain better prices for their fish provided of course that those fish are not too small to be of any value <e> <s> fishermen will have to remember that the stocks are there but they have to be preserved <e> <s> i hope that fish prices will continue to stay at a good level <e>", "<cs> my lords i very much welcome the opportunity for this debate on scottish affairs and i congratulate the noble earl lord perth on his success in securing it <e>", "<cs> my lords i know very well that he said that it could and we in tend to try to make it so <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> our figures show the level at which community charges could be set if moderate spending policies are followed <e> <s> the fact <e>", "<cs> my lords that is not the case <e> <s> what we are doing in scotland as has happened previously is to remove the safety net arrangements by degrees <e> <s> the charge that strathclyde benefits as opposed to the highland grampian or rural areas is perfectly valid up to a point <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has made it clear that the safety net arrangement will be phased out over a period of up to five years <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord overlooks the fact that his own region of strathclyde has managed to come within per cent <e> <s> of my right honourable friends estimate of what expenditure should be <e> <s> there is no validity in the argument that the secretary of state should not put forward his views since this is a completely new way of dealing with local authorities and their expenditure <e> <s> i think it is fair that the secretary of state should estimate what the levels should be particularly taking into account as i said the per cent <e> <s> rate of inflation <e> <s> therefore i reject the noble lords argument and i believe it is only right that those who are to pay the community charge should have some basis on which to make their judgments <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what my noble friend is referring to on this difficult issue <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has been considering whether the present flexibility in the community charge arrangements is sufficient to meet the concerns that have been expressed quite widely <e> <s> we have decided that it is not appropriate for the full standard community charge to be levied in respect of empty rural cottages that are required for strategic agricultural purposes <e> <s> therefore today we shall be issuing a consultation paper setting out proposals for an alternative treatment for such properties <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall refer to the last part of the noble lords question <e> <s> the government took into account a level of per cent <e> <s> in the estimates relating to non-payment and also for those areas that will be discounted <e> <s> of the local authorities tayside has taken per cent <e> <s> and as the noble lord knows strathclyde has taken per cent <e> <s> as has lothian <e> <s> so there is a variation as to what the actual payment levels will be <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the answer to the first question is contained in my original answer <e> <s> there we took into account inflation unavoidable extra expenditure on school boards and community charge collection <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord knows registration has been taking place and contrary to what some members opposite thought per cent <e> <s> of people have registered <e> <s> therefore there is a basis on which to assess what the levels should be <e> <s> the actual calculations are based on the past years expenditure by those authorities <e> <s> due cognizance has been taken of inflation of per cent <e> <s> to which i have already referred <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> the answer is yes we shall he assessing very closely how expenditure is arrived at by each and every district and regional council <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland will take due notice <e> <s> it will be up to the local authorities concerned to publish certain information as a result of the passing of this act <e> <s> the code of practice to he adopted is in the course of formulation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall be very happy to look very closely at what the noble lord lord hughes has said and i shall write to him <e> <s> in the generality of the question i believe that it should be clearly pointed out that in drawing up these figures the scottish office has taken due account of all relevant considerations <e> <s> they are not plucked out of thin air <e> <s> it will be plain for all to see in scotland what can he achieved if there is careful expenditure by local authorities <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to that is yes <e>", "<cs> my lords with great pleasure <e> <s> the scottish figure of per cent <e> <s> compares with the average of the major seven oecd economies of per cent <e> <s> that is a satisfactory situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord for his question <e> <s> it is true that in the early s the shake-out of labour in manufacturing industry especially in scotland was very great <e> <s> there were fears that things would not recover <e> <s> however the latest figures show that over the year to june manufacturing output per head in scotland increased by per cent <e> <s> compared with the year to june <e> <s> over the same period the united kingdom increase was almost per cent <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned figures <e> <s> however i do not believe that the figures for the increase in unemployment of to million under his administration between and were welcome <e>", "<cs> my lords without going into statistics all that i should like to say to the noble lord is and i believe that he will agree with me if he looks at ravenscraigs record now where production is flat out in the strip mill and in the production of liquid steel that the governments record in relation to scottish industry is one which i am sure he in his heart of hearts would applaud <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i wish to put the disposals policy in perspective <e> <s> as the noble lord may know the size of the forest estate owned by the forestry commission is hectares which i venture to say is not a small estate <e> <s> the amount of plantable land disposed of since the beginning of the proposal for disposals in is hectares which is quite a small amount in relation to the estate <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord says <e> <s> the government take seriously the rationalisation of the estate always remembering that the forestry enterprise is a valuable part of the forestry commissions work <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the noble lord to mean that when disposals take place access will continue in the future <e> <s> i cannot give such an assurance <e> <s> however we encourage private woodland owners generally <e>", "<cs> my lords the money has gone into the consolidated fund <e> <s> the figure to the end of march is million and it is expected that another million will be added by the end of this month <e> <s> that is a total of million <e> <s> i would add however that in the same period the government have purchased hectares of land at a value of million <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as i am aware when disposals of forestry commission land take place it is the right of those who buy the land to contain access if that is the correct word <e> <s> we cannot do more than encourage woodland owners to allow access to people over that land <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble lord that assurance <e> <s> the review is well under way and as soon as it is concluded he will be made aware of the result <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this short but very important second reading debate <e> <s> i should like to come straightaway to some of the points which have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords in december my right honourable friend the secretary of state announced the withdrawal of our grant from the scottish office <e> <s> my right honourable friend then announced that he would consider the various representations <e> <s> the college governors set out to deal with the situation and after a period they reported back to us <e>", "<cs> my lords those matters were seriously taken into consideration by my right honourable friend <e> <s> we are also concerned with the number of people in education in scotland where there are entrants aged and over to full-time higher education <e> <s> i must point out to the noble lord that in scotland there is already a much higher rate of participation in higher education than <e>", "<cs> my lords i recollect that of late out of a total of approximately students there were three at newbattle abbey college from the highlands and islands area <e> <s> as regards the swap arrangements for scotland we believe that by setting up consortia in its four major cities and we now see evidence that in glasgow the initiative is beginning to succeed we are addressing the problem which we all wish to see resolved that is taking more people into higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords my right honourable friend wished to see evidence of specific commitment from education authorities and higher education institutions <e> <s> as i understand it the total sum to which two local authorities and one university committed themselves was per year which was put into the report submitted by the governors of the college to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> my lords we felt that the right way to proceed was to give the college governors a year in which to see whether there was support for the continuation of the college <e> <s> a sum of out of the scottish office budget although it may not be so in other budgets is a lot <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that that is something which the noble lord would have to ask the principal and governors of the college <e> <s> however i note what has been said in that from the government is a very substantial amount of money against which seems to me to be the amount promised by three institutions <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware that a meeting took place earlier this week but i have no knowledge of the results of that meeting <e> <s> however my right honourable friend the secretary of state looked very carefully at the question of the estate land and the constraints which may be placed on the trustees in that regard <e> <s> we recognise that newbattle abbey has contributed a great deal over many years to an education facility <e> <s> however we felt and still feel that it is not worth the cost when we now have very much better ways of helping into education those people who have not had the benefit of higher education <e>", "<cs> my lords i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> however i must point out that the figure i gave of entrants aged and over to full-time higher education in scotland is considerable <e> <s> if one gauges that against the figures of and for the last three successive years it puts the matter in perspective <e> <s> i am sorry but i must say that we feel that the money spent in that area could be more wisely spent for the better use of further education in scotland <e> <s> i must remind the noble lord whom i know has great experience having been at glasgow university that we are now years on from that time and i believe that what i have said about higher education in scotland is a credit to government in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords we have played a very considerable part in helping local authorities to prepare for the introduction of the community charge by providing additional capital allocations totalling million in and <e> <s> on the question of additional personnel perhaps i may refer the noble lord to a green paper produced in where his preferred choice which is local income tax if administered independently by local authorities would have cost roughly million per annum involving thousand people in the united kingdom <e>", "<cs> my lords we had long discussions during the course of the scottish bills progress through this house <e> <s> i am happy to acknowledge that the cost of administration is lower than expected for the first year <e>", "<cs> my lords it is for the noble baroness to examine her own preferred choice and to tell the house what she arrives at <e> <s> although inflation has been running at a relatively low rate since those figures could well have been going up rather than down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am certain that my noble friend who i am sure is adept at filling in forms of all descriptions will have completed his form correctly <e> <s> however it is such comments that we listen to <e> <s> we are monitoring the first year of the tax most closely <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for his remarks <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i should ask one of my noble friends to talk to the other <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned higher running costs and capital expenditure <e> <s> the convention of scottish local authorities is free to raise such matters in discussions with my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland <e> <s> i am sure the convention will be doing that as we commence implementing this tax <e> <s> the noble lord referred to rebates an aspect about which we are extremely concerned <e> <s> but we are pleased that the number of applications received so far is around per cent <e> <s> of the estimated million caseload we expect with many more still arriving <e> <s> we are conscious of the fact that most local authorities are like lothian advising people either to wait or make a payment of per cent <e> <s> of the first months instalment which can be subsequently adjusted <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not comment on what the noble lord said about the english act but i remind him that the figures in under the old system have come out at million <e> <s> under the new system the budget estimates are million a million increase <e> <s> i do not consider that excessive bearing in mind the discussions we had on the legislation for scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords it is too early to judge whether that is the case <e> <s> as regards rebate forms we are satisfied that about per cent <e> <s> of the estimated million people have filled in their forms <e> <s> we are also satisfied that the processing of those forms is going ahead as speedily as possible <e>", "<cs> my lords the figures that i gave the noble lord are accurate <e> <s> they are the february figures the most recent to be published <e> <s> the provisional outturn for was higher than we had expected and we are very pleased that the <e>", "<cs> my lords we covered this ground very considerably during the course of the bill through your lordships house <e> <s> the government wish to ensure that those who have and take services from local authorities understand and pay <e>", "<cs> my lords i have given the factual situation <e> <s> what i would rather do at this stage is to consider this matter and to write to the noble lord so that he will know very soon how this is to be proceeded with <e> <s> at this stage it is difficult to know what the answer is <e> <s> i should like to confirm the point on the golden share that he mentioned which i believe will give him much comfort <e>", "<cs> my lords it is fair to say to the noble lord lord williams that the importance that we attach to the regulator and his staff is such that they will understand the formula in carrying out their duties <e> <s> i should be surprised if the noble lord who is extremely intelligent has not yet understood but if not i am sure that he will do so by the time the bill has passed through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords for their interventions <e> <s> for one i thank my noble friend and for the other i was just about to mention the noble lord lord hatch in my reply <e>", "<cs> my lords no the noble lord cannot tell you at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords that is as may be <e> <s> as i understand it the regulations that will be applicable to the grid company wall mean that it is a stand-alone company <e> <s> therefore by regulation it will be able to take an independent view of how its operations should proceed <e> <s> the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said that the degree of regulation may mean that the government may sell the industry at too low a price <e> <s> i believe that was a matter raised by my noble friend lord weir <e>", "<cs> the wording of these amendments suggests that a deputy director general of electricity supply should be appointed under statute and be directly responsible to the secretary of state for the regulation of the industry in scotland <e> <s> that would effectively result in a separate regulator for scotland <e> <s> i believe that that is the point that the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove wishes to make <e>", "<cs> in answer to my noble friend i think it is up to him to decide whether or not this amendment is suitable for bringing forward on this bill <e> <s> so far as the question of whether it is acceptable in principle i think that when i have finished speaking he will understand that the answer from me is no <e>", "<cs> on first looking at this amendment put forward by my noble friend it seems both logical and helpful <e> <s> however it is one that we feel to be unnecessary and i shall try to demonstrate why <e>", "<cs> yes <e> <s> if there is a grievance raised by any group of people or person on this matter the decision would be made by the director general <e>", "<cs> this is an extremely important subject <e> <s> i am very pleased that my noble friend lord stanley of alderley has raised it <e> <s> i fully appreciate his own particular interest <e> <s> it seems incredible that there is clear unanimity on all sides of the chamber that downward pressure on prices is what we are all trying to achieve as a result of the passing of this bill <e> <s> when to per cent <e> <s> of the cost lies in generation that is understandable <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord kirkhill i have already looked northwards <e> <s> as he will know as a past chairman of the north of scotland hydro-electric board the problems are writ very much larger in that area than they are in the rest of the united kingdom <e> <s> of that there is no doubt <e> <s> with my responsibility for the highlands and islands i know it only too well <e> <s> the other point is that hydro-electricity generation is a major part of the electricity generation in that area <e> <s> fifty per cent <e> <s> of the power comes from that source <e>", "<cs> i have to say to my noble friend lord stanley that that is asking too much <e> <s> i have said that without commitment i shall look very carefully at the matter as i have asked him to do <e> <s> i am very happy that he should have discussions with us between now and the next stage of the bill <e> <s> what i cannot do is give him a commitment that the government will come forward with an amendment at report <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may be permitted to intervene in this interesting discussion <e> <s> the fact is that the north of scotland hydro-electric board area is the only area where common tariffs exist as of right on a geographical basis not the whole of scotland <e>", "<cs> i believe that we are in total agreement with the noble lord lord peston that consumers should be entitled to know the basis on which their electricity tariffs have been made <e> <s> like my noble friend lord renton however i believe that the amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> again under the provisions of clause when a public electricity supplier fixes a tariff he will be required to present it so as to show the methods by which and the principles on which the charges making up the tariff have been made as well as the prices to be paid <e> <s> these requirements will apply to any of the charges included in the tariff whether it be the unit rate a standing charge or any of the other types of charges covered by clause <e> <s> there is therefore no need to duplicate the requirements of subsection in each specific case given in subsection <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness tempts me to go down a road which seems to imply by her way of putting it that everything in the public <e>", "<cs> we have had an interesting debate with knowledgeable contributions from noble lords particularly from my noble friend lord campbell in relation to the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> in reply to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe i should like first to say that i should have thought that what this government have done over the past few years in relation to the disadvantaged areas in scotland is quite remarkable <e> <s> forty-three million pounds will go to the highlands and islands board this year for dealing with the problems which affect that area <e> <s> therefore i do not wish to hear too much about what is done <e> <s> of course in the case of british telecom we have recently announced a substantial programme for the highlands and islands <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what he wants to do with the amendment perhaps i may point to the close co-operation that has recently taken place <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has announced co-operation between british telecom and the highlands and islands development board in an imaginative scheme which will spend a great deal of money helping telecommunications in that area <e> <s> i am sure that if my noble friend understands that that is the governments view on such matters he will understand that if electricity becomes a problem in the future as he envisages it might we shall look at similar schemes <e>", "<cs> our proposals are designed to give consumers the same right to request the provision of a supply on reasonable terms <e> <s> as i understand the amendment the proposals amount to a requirement that all requests to supply domestic premises from the mains must be met regardless of the cost to the supplier <e> <s> that takes no account of the efficiency or otherwise of that approach <e> <s> it may be that the use of alternative means would be both cheaper and more efficient in terms of energy use <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord peston for enlarging a little on his amendment <e> <s> as i understand it his intention in proposing it is to ensure that the consumer is not overcharged as a result of an allowance for capitalised maintenance in the connection charges which has been calculated on an unfair basis <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble viscount for being so succinct in proposing the amendment <e> <s> i have looked quite closely at it and i am now a little clearer as regards its underlying intent <e>", "<cs> clause b was introduced in recognition of the fact that in a few instances the loss of a supply of electricity for a very short period of time could result in substantial economic loss without there being any accompanying physical loss <e> <s> the economic loss in such cases would well exceed the actual value of the supply lost <e>", "<cs> presumably that means according to the capital equipment that would be lost <e>", "<cs> that is as i understand it <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that physical loss means loss of equipment <e> <s> the economic loss in such cases could well exceed the actual value of the supply lost <e> <s> with the increased reliance on computers in a great many aspects of modern business this is of growing concern as i am sure the noble lord will know from his past experience <e> <s> as the noble lord has asked me what i mean by physical loss i shall elaborate on what i have said <e> <s> it is damage to property <e> <s> that is exactly what i said about capital equipment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for the explanation of his proposed amendment <e> <s> i was not quite certain what lay behind it before he spoke but now i am clearer <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with his amendment perhaps i can elaborate a little on the busby contracts <e> <s> the point made about the busby contract is covered by the licence condition no <e> <s> which would require <e>", "<cs> i find myself in a certain amount of difficulty because i believe that the amendment of the noble lord lord williams might help to clarify the position and i shall take it away <e> <s> however i must say to my noble friends that they have put doubts in my mind as to whether there is a subtle point which i have not recognised in the wording of this amendment <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord recognised the major contribution made to consumer rights by clause <e> <s> for the first time there will be a right for an independent determination of disputes over the terms and conditions to be applied to the provision of the supply of electricity <e> <s> i assume from his remarks that the intention of the amendment is to make any disputes arising from the provisions of the bill the subject of determination under clause rather than any dispute whatever <e>", "<cs> far be it from me to argue with a distinguished lawyer from north of the border <e> <s> i would rather read closely his mayyshall be wishes and so on <e> <s> if the draftsmen have arrived at a situation where they have got it wrong and the noble lord has got it right i shall be the first to congratulate him and to write to him on the subject <e> <s> i prefer to look very closely at what he has said and the way in which he put it in order to see whether there have been errors <e> <s> i am not admitting to them <e> <s> i shall look at the matter closely to see whether we have the correct tenses in the right places and that we are dealing with the subject correctly <e>", "<cs> i understand the very strong feelings expressed by the noble baroness lady seear and also the noble lord lord dean of beswick on this matter <e> <s> the main thrust of the amendments is that a supply should always be provided albeit on the basis of payment in advance to someone who owes money for supplies already received rather than their being disconnected <e> <s> if we look first at the second amendment this would allow the supplier to fit a prepayment meter immediately a debt in respect of electricity charges arose <e> <s> it would also provide that irrespective of the circumstances in which a debt arose the consumer could only be disconnected if it were not possible to fit a prepayment meter <e> <s> the first point to note about the amendment is that the consumers consent will not be required for a prepayment meter to be fitted the supplier could install one unilaterally <e> <s> we believe that amounts to a serious invasion of the consumers privacy and would impose a solution on him or her based simply on the argument that parliament knows his interests better than he does himself <e> <s> and yet this would be the only avenue available to the supplier to ensure that he received the money he is due as he would be unable to disconnect if a prepayment meter could be fitted unless the consumer agreed to be disconnected <e>", "<cs> i understand full well that the purpose of this amendment is to extend the period allowed to customers to pay their bills and the noble lord lord renton made his point about that <e> <s> in responding to the debate i draw the committees attention to the fact that the provisions of paragraph of schedule already represent a considerable improvement on the existing statutory provisions which were provided in the electricity act <e> <s> when nationalisation took place the electricity industry made no statutory requirements on boards as regards the period of notice that they must give before disconnectng any consumer <e> <s> as the noble baroness said the electricity consumer has had to rely on the common sense or good will of the boards in this matter up to now and he has had no statutory rights whatsoever <e>", "<cs> my lords i have never made any secret of the fact that there will almost certainly be a drop in planting while the industry adapts to the substantial though necessary changes which we introduced last year <e> <s> however i have also heard some fairly pessimistic figures but i shall not crystal-gaze as to what those figures might turn out to be <e> <s> we are mid-season at the moment and the commissions conservators are collecting information on what the figures are likely to be <e> <s> i do not share the extreme gloom of some pessimists <e>", "<cs> my lords a growing number of hardwoods have been planted over the <e>", "<cs> no my lords the figures i have given refer to last year and do not contain any of the new community forests <e> <s> we would expect to see planting starting next year <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very well aware of the discussions that we had when the budget changes took place <e> <s> the transitional arrangements which we brought into force as a result of the last budget were for a fairly long period <e> <s> it has to be remembered that many woodland owners will have benefited substantially from the reduction in the top rate of tax to per cent <e> <s> and can now look forward to tax-free sales of timber <e> <s> however we are keeping the matter under review particularly in regard to maintenance of forests <e>", "<cs> my lords the fact that we are now seeing a sizeable increase in felling year by year is very satisfactory <e> <s> i can give figures for of million cubic metres having been felled as a very clear indication of the increase <e> <s> that is good news as is also the downstream activity <e> <s> we need to be sure that we have a sustained programme of planting but we also ought to remember that the size of the forest estate as it stands in the united kingdom has risen dramatically over the past few years <e>", "<cs> my lords as a result of what my noble friend has said and from his experience i am well aware that we are constantly wrestling with applications and the problems related to them <e> <s> i shall do everything i can to speed up those applications because they have a real bearing on the tree-planting programme <e>", "<cs> my lords it has always been accepted on all sides of the house that the forestry industry is most important to the united kingdom <e> <s> the government in the form of the commission own hectares which is a sizeable amount <e> <s> however we must always bear in mind the balance within the united kingdom and consider how many trees should be grown <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is most pessimistic <e> <s> by the end of april the forestry commission had received applications for almost hectares of new planting <e> <s> of that over hectares was for new areas not included in any previous grant schemes <e> <s> that is an encouraging start <e> <s> i know that it does not always lead to new planting but it is an encouraging start <e> <s> it compares most favourably with what was done in and <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as i am aware there are no plans to alter the forest running along the bottom of the noble lords garden <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i recall that before the last budget various representations were made by members of opposition parties that changes should be made to the taxation regime <e> <s> the government introduced those and we believe that it is a much better system <e> <s> however of course such a change brings about problems for nurserymen <e> <s> i am well aware of that but believe that they can adjust to budget changes in the same way as any other industry <e> <s> i understand how difficult those changes are for the industry <e>", "<cs> my lords yes <e> <s> as we have already understood in previous amendments the law is different in england and scotland <e> <s> between the nature conservancy council and the powers that the river purification boards have we feel that the secretary of state has acted in the interests of the environment up to now <e> <s> we feel that that is the way to proceed in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i take seriously the comments of my noble friend lord renton <e> <s> i shall read what he said about the long schedules which have been presented to the house in respect of scotland <e> <s> i must consult with my colleagues on the front bench about the comments of my noble friend lord balfour <e> <s> i have a feeling that the answer will be no but i shall discuss the matter <e>", "<cs> i understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> i had intended to convey to him that we envisage that the national grid company would wish to do nothing other than co-operate in times of fuel shortage but for example the grid or part of the grid might need to be operated in a special way which goes beyond strictly normal technical criteria as specified in the grid code in the case of emergencies <e>", "<cs> no we are talking about a special situation where certain powers have to be taken <e>", "<cs> i believe that the wording in subsection of the new clause which we propose is not too broad <e> <s> however i shall take the opportunity having heard what the noble lord said to look very closely at this with legal advice and at that stage to decide whether it is too broad <e> <s> as i understand it it is not too broad for the circumstances which we see may occur <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps explain to the noble lord at the outset that any type of power station development exempted from the need for the secretary of states consent by regulations made under this subsection will still be subject to all the requirements of the planning acts <e> <s> the subsection which the amendment seeks to delete will merely give a flexibility which the government consider to be necessary <e> <s> developments will take place at an operational power station in connection with generation which it may be more appropriate to deal with under normal planning procedures instead of under this clause <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord of course i am prepared to look at the drafting <e> <s> the fact remains that subsection of the clause must stand <e> <s> however if the drafting can be tightened to give expression to the kind of example i have given i shall certainly examine it <e> <s> i cannot give any commitment on it <e>", "<cs> i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i wish to respond briefly to the obvious interests north of the border <e>", "<cs> certainly we shall take up the point and look at the definition of reckless under scottish law <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i join the chorus from this front bench and i must disappoint my noble friend again <e> <s> even at this late hour i shall take a little time to go through this particular provision to try to explain why it is there <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do about his amendment perhaps i may say that i bow to the superior knowledge of the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar in matters legal <e> <s> it would be churlish of me not to consider whether the wording which i have tried to describe in subsection a is correct or incorrect <e> <s> of course i give an assurance that i shall ask those who have drawn up this statute to look again at the wording but i have to say that it will be without any commitment <e> <s> those who are not involved with the law can be as flippant as they like about terminology but i have to say to the noble lord that in my view it will be difficult to change <e> <s> nevertheless i certainly take his suggestion on board to see if change can or should be made <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend sits down though i find it difficult to convince him <e>", "<cs> it is quite clear that legislation passed by the party of the noble lord lord williams has been a precedent in this case <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is that they probably were spotted in the other place <e> <s> that is why we have come forward with amendments which we feel are more correct so far as concerns this clause <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel for speaking to amendment no <e> <s> b and for dealing with schedule <e> <s> before we immerse ourselves in any detail perhaps i may clarify the situation relative to schedule <e>", "<cs> in agreeing to group together these various amendments i hope that the noble lord lord williams of elvel will bear with me as i go through what i think to be the points of <e>", "<cs> i shall be most happy to do so <e>", "<cs> the main purpose of this clause to to enable a successor company to be given an appropriate combination of distributable and non-distributable reserves <e> <s> many private sector companies have non-distributable reserves such as share premium accounts stemming from past share issues <e> <s> there may well be a need to direct successor companies to create non-distributable reserves to place them on the same footing as existing private sector companies <e>", "<cs> having checked the matter i can give the noble lord the assurance that this will be the practice in the future <e>", "<cs> i shall have to answer that question in the negative at this stage <e> <s> however noble lords may be reassured to know that the secretary of states accounts directive to the industry specifically requires a true and fair view of the profit and loss and the state of affairs and source and application of funds of the council boards and subsidiaries <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the explanation i have given is a true and fair picture of the points which the noble lord sought in moving the amendments <e> <s> he sought an assurance that all accounts would measure their accumulated profits by reference to icas <e> <s> no assurance is possible <e> <s> as i have said the secretary of states accounts directive requires the industrys accounts to meet various private sector accounting standards in so far as they are appropriate to nationalised industries <e> <s> there are differences <e> <s> if the noble lord finds it helpful i shall of course write to him about those differences <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord an assurance on such an important point without checking out very carefully the substance of my reply to his direct question <e> <s> however of course i shall look at the matter and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> it is indeed true that the companies bill would make substantial amendments to part vii of the companies act which deals with company accounts <e> <s> the noble lord is therefore quite right in his presumption that if and when the companies bill is enacted and part i of that bill comes into force companies will be required to prepare accounts for the purpose of the companies act <e>", "<cs> that must be the case <e> <s> however of course the bill has not yet become an act <e>", "<cs> subsection of clause provides that for the purposes of the statutory accounts of a successor company the vesting of an area boards undertaking in a supply company shall be taken to have occurred immediately after the end of the area boards last complete accounting year to end before the transfer date and to have been a vesting of the boards property rights and liabilities as they existed immediately before that time <e> <s> the amendment would substitute the word at for the words immediately before <e>", "<cs> this is an argument which i believe needs to be looked at <e> <s> it may be that <e>", "<cs> i fully understand the thrust of the noble lords amendment at this stage <e> <s> perhaps it will be helpful if i explain why we feel that he is perhaps not correct in his interpretation of what we intend <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for raising this matter of revaluation <e> <s> it is our intention that the vesting of the property rights and liabilities of the electricity council and the electricity boards in their successor companies will take place during the course of the current financial year of the boards <e>", "<cs> perhaps i had better just clear up this matter <e> <s> i understand what i said the meaning of what i said was that the assets must be properly valued <e>", "<cs> having explained to the noble lord what i thought to be the basis of the argument that the government put forward and having given the examples of what has taken place in previous privatisations i should have thought that it was enough to satisfy the situation <e> <s> the government have no intention of changing the basis on which they operate in this area <e>", "<cs> i return to the point that i made <e> <s> it is clearly important that the assets of the electricity industry should be properly valued for flotation purposes <e> <s> the government will ensure that that is done <e> <s> that noble lord lord williams speaks about no discontinuity of accounts <e>", "<cs> clause deals with this in a technical sense <e> <s> there are no gaps through which events can fall between st april this year and st january <e> <s> this clause does not require valuation and assets will be properly valued as i have indeed said <e>", "<cs> subsection enables the loans to be made to successor companies only when they are wholly owned by the crown <e> <s> subsection enables such loans to be made from the national loans fund <e> <s> it is government policy that loans from the nlf are not available to the private sector <e> <s> subsection enables the secretary of state to stipulate the time when a loan is to be repaid as well as the method of repayment and the interest payable until repayment <e> <s> therefore under the powers already available the terms of any loan will make it clear that the loan will be repaid before the company ceases to be wholly owned by the crown <e> <s> in the light of that explanation i hope that the noble lord will consider withdrawing his amendment <e>", "<cs> i believe that what i have said covers this point <e> <s> i am looking closely at clause but i rest my case on the fact that the governments policy that loans from the nlf are not available to the private sector covers this matter <e> <s> i should have thought that that explanation would be sufficient to set the noble lords mind at rest <e>", "<cs> i should make perfectly clear the fact that it is the governments firm policy that all nlf loans should be repaid or extinguished before flotation and the clause allows for that <e> <s> i thought that i had made that clear in my original reply to the amendment <e>", "<cs> time and again i have made perfectly clear that the secretary of state may direct that loans must be repaid by a certain date or in a certain way and may specify the rates of interest to be paid <e> <s> i believe that that is inherent in the clause <e>", "<cs> it is necessary for the treasury to guarantee not only the payment of principal and interest but also other financial obligations such as any management charges or premia arising from early repayment <e> <s> i hope that that is sufficient explanation <e>", "<cs> section of the miscellaneous financial provisions act extended a number of existing statutes including the electricity act to include other financial obligations <e> <s> when loans are covered by treasury guarantee they can be obtained at an advantageous rate <e> <s> removing this area of guarantee could make loans either more expensive or more difficult to obtain <e> <s> the whole point is that other financial <e>", "<cs> the two scottish boards currently have debt of around billion which arises from successive investments which they have made in new plant <e> <s> the first step in arriving at a capital structure appropriate to the new companies will involve the transfer of the scottish nuclear company into the ownership of the two scottish electricity companies which will each receive a relevant proportion of shares in scottish nuclear issued under clause <e>", "<cs> presumably the answer which the noble lord seeks refers to the scottish nuclear company which of course will be owned in the appropriate proportions by the two scottish companies per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> i believe that the loans under schedule are outside the scope of this clause <e> <s> therefore i do not believe that it is relevant to raise that particular matter relating to schedule in this case <e>", "<cs> the drafting of subsection of clause to which the amendment refers again corresponds to parallel clauses in the british steel act and the water bill <e> <s> it would be inappropriate to require that the terms of any debentures issued should correspond to any early repayment terms applying to the loans which they replaced <e> <s> the amendment before the committee does not appear to take issue with that contention and i fail to see why implied early repayment terms should not be disregarded for this purpose in just the same way as any express terms <e>", "<cs> my understanding is that implied in this case means that the terms of the loan are those which are agreed at the time <e> <s> however i should like to consider the term and write to the noble lord with a full explanation of why implied is used in this case <e>", "<cs> i understand that implied terms mean any terms which imply the possibility of early repayment <e> <s> i hope that that answers the noble lord <e>", "<cs> yes the situation is that the new nuclear company will be jointly owned in the ratio per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> in arranging the tax loss position which will be beneficial to the scottish companies as a whole that is indeed the case <e>", "<cs> this question is related to the fact that the north bord which will have tax losses itself will be able to benefit under these arrangements <e> <s> if we did not make a provision in this paragraph it would not be able so to do <e>", "<cs> this matter was raised in another place <e> <s> it is not our view that it is a proper course of action to allow local authorities unrestricted powers to sell electricity <e> <s> in future as a result of the introduction of these new provisions local authorities in scotland will be able to engage in the production of electricity through chp schemes <e> <s> we have no wish however to encourage them to engage in the production of electricity for sale for its own sake <e> <s> in our view that would bring about an unnecessary extension of local authority powers which could only result in greater demands being placed on the ordinary citizen to finance such activities <e> <s> we see little merit in this amendment which would grant to local authorities in scotland wide-ranging powers to expand their activities in a complex and highly technological industry in which they have had little expertise at least since <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for speaking to the first three amendments <e>", "<cs> so there is <e> <s> i apologise <e> <s> i acknowledge that as experience after privatisation with former subsidiaries of the national bus company suggests there may well be pressures which could result in some subsequent resales after privatisation <e> <s> i do not think that it is realistic to try to legislate against these <e> <s> for one thing the amendment would do no more than delay re-sales and would not ultimately prevent them from taking place <e> <s> furthermore any such limitation would be a restriction on the competitive freedom of a company after privatisation which did not apply to companies with which it was competing <e> <s> such a restriction might for example make it more difficult for the company to raise new capital to expand its operations it might therefore be counterproductive in terms of the objective which underlies the amendment <e> <s> i would also remind tie committee that safeguards against the development of monopolies already exist in competition law which applies just as much to the bus industry as it does to other industries <e>", "<cs> i must return the compliment and say to the noble lord that he is most persuasive <e> <s> i am glad that he recognises the work that we have done in prestwick although i doubt whether that is recognised by all quarters of this chamber <e> <s> two main points emerge from the discussion and i must say that i am grateful to those noble lords who have taken part <e> <s> first there is the question of what can be summed up in the phrase asset stripping of property <e> <s> secondly there is the general point made by the noble lord lord underhill as to whether we have learnt any lessons from the nbc privatisation <e> <s> as regards the latter i believe that the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord said this amendment seeks to require the group to make any financial assistance offered to management-employee buy-out teams available to up to three buy-out attempts in any one company <e>", "<cs> i fear that the noble lord lord carmichael and i have been here before <e> <s> there are shades of the housing act in the amendment and i think we debated the point at the time of that bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i take my noble friends point on this matter <e> <s> the secretary of the royal forestry society has said that prospects for forestry seem to be better <e> <s> it is a question of attracting different types of investor <e> <s> with the <e>", "<cs> my lords i recall that it was not only on these benches that the changes in the budget last year were welcomed <e> <s> one of the experts who has nursery trees in his business mr christie of fochabers has said <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is an expert on these matters <e> <s> he will recall that i said that with such a big change we expected that there would be a dip in planting in the year ahead and perhaps in the years ahead <e> <s> however we feel that it was in the long-term interests of the industry to move to the new position <e> <s> these matters are kept under review by myself and my colleagues <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble lord is an expert on matters concerning wales <e> <s> i undertand his point but i should make it clear that the long-term future of the timber industry in this country is assured <e> <s> at the turn of the century the forestry commission which is a major part of the forestry industry though somewhat reduced in size will be supplying substantially more timber to the industry than it does at present <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord wishes to have details of the position in wales i shall be perfectly happy to write to him <e> <s> but overall the industry is in good heart <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend may be aware that the broadleaf policy is being reviewed at present <e> <s> the government will come forward with their acknowledgment of the consultation which has recently taken place <e> <s> as regards the question of broadleaves as such i must say that i do not share my noble friends pessimism in fact only last month i attended the opening of a new nursery in scotland where per cent <e> <s> to per cent <e> <s> of the good business being carried on was in broadleaves <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble viscount knows we have targets for forestry planting in this country which he will be aware cover both the woodland grant scheme and the forestry grant scheme <e> <s> in both cases those targets are constantly watched <e> <s> in addition i do not think that it is insignificant that investors in the industry to quote caledonian paper which has a factory in irvine that will be opened tomorrow do not believe that the future of forestry in this country is under threat <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i believe that there is a sound future for forestry <e> <s> of course when a major change in budgetary arrangements takes place there must be concern as to whether the whole situation will improve <e> <s> but my noble friend is quite right i have no doubt that there is a very good long-term future for the prosperity of this industry <e> <s> indeed i take note of what my noble friend lord jenkin said as regards publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i acknowledge that a good deal is going on in this respect however there is always room for more <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend lord peyton of yeovil realises that we have been here before <e> <s> my noble friend lord glenarthur answered as best he could the points which have again surfaced in this debate <e> <s> i think at the time that my noble friend said the government should have the good sense to go away and reflect upon his anxieties <e> <s> that is indeed exactly what the government have done <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that to be the case as regards the situation south of <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to all noble lords who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> we have already discussed the matter as my noble friend said when he moved his amendment the first of the two in this grouping <e>", "<cs> my lords schedule of the bill simply lays down a standard set of financial parameters for the consumers committees all of which are well precedented in other public bodies of this kind <e> <s> the committees are not intended to be composed of salaried officials but of lay members of the public who have a contribution to make in the field of consumer protection in their areas <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i shall indeed try to explain to the noble lord the two points which he raised <e> <s> first <e>", "<cs> my lords it is clear that the noble lord lord williams of elvel is looking for clarification with these amendments <e> <s> i hope that i am able to satisfy him <e> <s> it is the governments intention that the consumers committees should provide real effective lay representation for all electricity consumers <e> <s> it is clearly inappropriate that members of committees should be remunerated in the same way as chairmen <e> <s> it is to be expected that some like the chairmen of the existing consultative councils will have to make a greater commitment than other members of time and effort in running the committees <e> <s> it is therefore only right that they should receive adequate recompense for so doing <e> <s> however as is accepted practice in other bodies of this country <e> <s> the members will receive allowances when engaged on committee business <e> <s> the expression allowance in schedule already covers allowances for loss of remuneration <e> <s> this is clear from the context and contrast between the word allowance in paragraph and the words such of their out of pocket expenses as do not relate to loss of remuneration <e> <s> therefore i believe that the noble lords amendment in this case is superfluous <e>", "<cs> my lords yes that is correct <e> <s> that is why i have gone into this aspect <e> <s> we have looked at it very closely in relation to other bills with which we have been dealing <e> <s> the noble lord will find it precedented in the water bill which has just passed through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house yes that may very well be so <e>", "<cs> my lords again with the leave of the house i shall sew the matter up with my noble friend <e>", "<cs> my lords of course in answer to the noble lord lord ezra and my noble friend lord renton i shall study very carefully what has been said <e> <s> i shall look particularly at what my noble friend lord renton has said in relation to the two paragraphs that he mentioned to see whether any improvement could be made or is necessary to make it more intelligible <e> <s> i believe that the proposed drafting changes would leave the effect as my noble friend said exactly as at present but i am quite willing to consider the matter again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord williams of elvel and again i shall try to explain the matter <e> <s> paragraph a of schedule provides for the consumers committees to appoint with the approval of the director local and other sub-committees through which the committees may carry out such of their functions as they may determine <e> <s> in that respect he is right <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i fully understand what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> it is that the sub-committees members of which need not necessarily be members of the committee could go off at a tangent and do exactly what they wanted <e> <s> i understand that that will not happen because in setting up the committee the director obviously has a say and as is normal in any company the report from a sub-committee will go to the main committee for an ultimate decision <e>", "<cs> my lords with leave of the house yet again i have said the director has an input into the matter <e> <s> he will be interested in the practicality of the working of the sub-committee <e> <s> however i have undertaken to see whether the bill is watertight and if not i shall make sure that it is <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment would have the effect of making the financial statements which the committees must produce cover calendar years instead of financial years <e> <s> it would clearly be wholly illogical for these reports to be drawn up on a different basis from the rest of those accounts and indeed from the accounts of the rest of the public and private sectors <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that the noble lord will find comfort in my explanation <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house the director has the power to look at the figures of a particular committee and he is of course given the power to say what can and cannot take place with the moneys provided <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house of course he can modify <e> <s> he can have the report from the committee and can say yes or no to it <e> <s> however in saying no he can modify by saying that in view of the budget to which it must operate the committee can do certain things and not do others <e> <s> the powers in the clause give him the power to modify <e> <s> of course in reality that will be for discussion between the director and the committee concerned <e> <s> it could be that he asks the committee to cut its budget <e> <s> he has the power to say no and also to make other suggestions <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am happy to respond to my noble friend <e> <s> it may be helpful if in this context i make a short statement which fulfils the undertaking i gave on th june that i would have discussions with the chairman of the north of scotland hydro-electric board about the location of the boards headquarters and that i would return to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> no i am speaking only to amendment no <e> <s> which is not grouped on my list with that group of amendments to which we shall come later <e>", "<cs> my lords i listened with great care to the point made by the noble baroness lady seear in support of the amendment <e> <s> as i said on several previous amendments i think that we have been here before <e> <s> i understand that the noble baronesss intention in moving the amendments is that the public electricity supplier will have the power to install a pre-payment meter when the customer is in debt <e> <s> underlying that is the intention to ensure that no one who is in difficulty over the payment of their bills as a result of genuine hardship should be disconnected <e> <s> the electricity industry shares her desire to avoid unnecessary disconnection <e> <s> there is no commercial advantage in losing custom if an arrangement can be reached for paying for future supplies and recovery of the outstanding debt <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the purpose that my noble friend has in mind in moving the amendment <e> <s> however i happen to believe that her amendment is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord peston for raising this issue <e> <s> it was of course raised in committee <e> <s> first perhaps i may make two general points and then give the noble lord an example of a situation where what he calls a catch-all subsection is needed <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not believe that there is a necessity for the amendment because adequate provision has been made in paragraph of schedule for cases where wayleaves have not been agreed <e> <s> this provides for the secretary of state to tell the applicant that he will not proceed with the application for his consent for the line until the applicant has applied to him under schedule paragraph to acquire a necessary wayleave <e> <s> alternatively the secretary of state may grant consent for the line but subject to the condition that work may not proceed until he gives permission as appears in schedule paragraph b <e> <s> in deciding whether to give such permission he will take into account the extent to which the necessary wayleaves have been granted by that time <e> <s> he will also ensure that permission will be given to proceed with any work on part of the line only where that can be done without prejudicing the outcome of unresolved wayleave problems on another part of the line <e>", "<cs> my lords under clause the director general of electricity supply and the director general of fair trading will exercise powers concurrently the point about which we have to talk is the meaning of concurrent and joint in relation to electricity and certain of the latters functions under the monopoly provisions of the fair trading act and the anticompetitive practice provisions of the competition act <e> <s> one director or the other will need to take the lead role depending on the nature of the case at issue <e> <s> broadly the government envisage that if the case turns primarily on the generation transmission or supply of electricity the dges would normally take the lead whereas the dgft would do so if the case concerned more than that one industry or market <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i say with respect that the noble lords amendment seeks to insert the word jointly in place of the word concurrently and that that is the issue which concerns him <e> <s> our understanding of the word jointly is that everything is done jointly as siamese twins for instance in respect of every single issue which arises <e> <s> we believe that the word concurrent allows each to take the lead in the area in which he has responsibility <e> <s> however in no way does that infringe or impinge on the power of the director general of fair trading in relation to the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe the noble lord lord peston wishes to ensure that <e>", "<cs> my lords we have come a long way since the last stage of the bill because i seem to have obtained recognition from the noble lord lord peston that there is some purpose in this subsection <e> <s> i notice that his view differs from that of his noble friend lord williams of elvel who at that time called the subsection unconstitutional <e> <s> i suppose that it could be said that consistency exists in that the noble lord lord bonham-carter called the whole thing monstrous at the last stage while my noble friend lord peyton described the subsection as just horrid <e>", "<cs> my lords we all recall very well the discussions on this matter in committee <e> <s> i shall endeavour to assist the noble lord lord williams of elvel who made the point very well at the last stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have made that clear and that is the sensitive point <e> <s> if the secretary of state decides the future custody of the few documents which will remain it is for him to decide where they should reside <e> <s> they may very well remain within the purview of the secretary of state himself <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord looks at clause and the last line it states <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i can say that credit information will be covered by the data protection act <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords who have taken part in this brief exchange <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael expressed concern as he did at the previous stage and as two other noble lords have done about the disposal of properties <e> <s> the possibiliy of asset stripping was uppermost in your lordships minds <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has raised two questions <e> <s> to deal first with the question of access the government are well aware of the importance of public access to the commissions forests <e> <s> therefore as has already been said we are considering ways in which reasonable access can be preserved when commission forests are sold <e> <s> it is a complex issue however involving public access to private property <e> <s> we must therefore take time and trouble to consider all aspects and get the answer right <e> <s> there are many ways through voluntary means by which access to private woodlands has been achieved and we are satisfied that that part of the voluntary effort is working extremely well <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not know what proportion is being bought by foreign interest <e> <s> all i have to say is that widespread interest has been shown in the land that has been disposed of <e> <s> as i understand it that will continue <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very conscious of the importance of attracting smaller investors and indeed institutional funds into forestry <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that we shall consider carefully any proposals that come forward from the industry <e> <s> in addition i have been encouraged by the remarks of those who know about forestry <e> <s> a forest of opportunity an article in <e>", "<cs> my lords in answer to the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe i said that the government were looking very carefully at the complex issue of access <e> <s> what i did not say was that we had an answer to the legal problems that surround this particular issue <e> <s> i did say however that the owners of many private woodlands have an excellent record in allowing public access to those woodlands <e> <s> perhaps i may say in addition that when the forestry commission as the forest authority looks at plans for planting on its lands reasonable provision for public access is being encouraged and there has been a positive response <e>", "<cs> my lords we have looked very carefully at this particular issue <e> <s> there are problems relating to access <e> <s> there are various possible solutions to those problems but i should not like to go into them at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may answer the question as to what has already been disposed of in the way of forests <e> <s> as the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe mentioned in his original supplementary question hectares of land have been sold of which hectares were forest land <e> <s> the remaining hectares were non-forest land <e> <s> in the future one of the ministerial guidelines to which the commission must give heed when selecting properties for sale is the maintenance and development of the wood processing industry <e>", "<cs> both my lords <e> <s> basically it is land that is planted <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a complicated issue and as i understand it there are legal problems attached to it <e> <s> my noble friend may have a solution <e> <s> i must tell him that we are discussing the matter with great detail within government at the moment and we well understand the desire of most people to ensure that there is adequate public access to private land <e> <s> however there are major problems attached to the issue <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i have answered the noble lord the leader of the opposition before on this matter <e> <s> the receipts from the disposal programme are surrendered by the commission to the consolidated fund <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that the noble baroness said that rationalisation was complete <e> <s> that is not something that i have stated from the dispatch box <e> <s> further rationalisation can take place in the long-term interest of the forestry industry as a whole <e> <s> i believe that when we come to the turn of the century it will be seen that the forestry commission though somewhat reduced in size will be supplying substantially more timber to the industry than it does at present <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to correct the noble lord on his figure for new planting this year of hectares <e> <s> it is an interesting figure but it bears no relation to the facts at this stage although the noble lord may have information on the matter that has not come to the government <e> <s> so far as concerns the sale in scotland the forestry commission is well aware that it has the power to dispose of planted land as it sees fit <e> <s> as i said to the noble lord lord john-mackie most of that land is planted with trees at the present time or is available for planting <e> <s> i should have thought that it will continue as an investment for those in the private sector who are interested in forestry <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to both noble lords lord carmichael of kelvingrove and lord tordoff <e> <s> i am very glad to welcome the latter as an honorary scot for the purposes of passing the bill through <e> <s> first perhaps i may deal with the points raised by the noble lord lord carmichael particularly local bus services and the timetabling thereof <e> <s> the department involved the scottish development department is concerned about this <e> <s> we are looking at possible ways of improving the situation <e> <s> it may be that csla will be able to bring together the transport authoritites and bus operators to discuss how the improvement can be achieved <e> <s> we have invited them to consider the suggestion to see whether we can make some improvement <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for the way in which he put his amendment <e> <s> i have looked at the matter closely and i shall try to give him the reason why we take this view <e> <s> while i welcome the fact that he agrees that we should bring forward the amendment i believe that we need to discuss further the question of commercial confidentiality <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house it is a question of timing <e> <s> once the secretary of state discloses the information to parliament then there is debate all round <e> <s> however there may be a timing advantage to companies affected if disclosure was not given <e> <s> eventually the information would come into the public domain but at the time at which they were having to do what was required of them by the secretary of state they would still have confidentiality pertaining <e> <s> that is the way i read it and i hope the noble lord will understand why we have put this provision into this clause <e>", "<cs> my lords the effect of this amendment would be that all meetings of the nccc would be open to the public regardless of the subject under discussion <e> <s> in other words the ncc would have no discretion to exclude the public when confidential matters were under discussion <e> <s> this is because the rest of paragraph of schedule refers solely to the regional committees <e> <s> i presume that this was not your lordships intention and certainly not the intention of the noble lord lord peston in moving the amendment <e> <s> however even if this defect were remedied i am afraid that i cannot accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i hear what the noble lord lord williams of elvel says about the technicalities <e> <s> i accept the point that he makes about the drafting that the change would have to be made here <e> <s> however i am still very concerned about this amendment <e> <s> the gas consumers council does not hold its meetings in public <e> <s> the national <e>", "<cs> my lords i see no reason why the nccc should not call a press conference or have an open meeting if it so desires <e> <s> i think that to accept this amendment would go very far beyond that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord carter for moving these <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall begin by taking up the words of the noble lord lord williams of elvel who asked on second reading will it work in favour of the consumer <e> <s> will it benefit the environment <e> <s> will anyone invest in the industry at a fair price <e> <s> he then said i have no doubt that the answer is a resounding no <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree that in many arrangements there is always room for improvement <e> <s> however the present arrangements have resulted in significant reductions in the number of mentally handicapped and ill patients in long-stay institutions <e> <s> i am sure that the noble and learned lord who has a great interest in this matter will realise that <e>", "<cs> my lords yes

proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very long debate and i make no apology for the fact that i at least have listened very closely to what everyone has said <e> <s> i should like to start by running over some of the points made in the statement yesterday because this is an important debate as most noble lords who have spoken have admitted <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may recall

house the importance of the fish farming industry in the highlands of scotland for which i have responsibility <e> <s> a great deal of money has been spent by the united kingdom government on the industry <e> <s> i for one wish it every success although as the noble lord knows the industry is going through difficult times at the moment <e> <s> as regards the remarks of the noble lord on the nature conservancy <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble lord is a greater expert on salmon than i am <e> <s> obviously what he has said will be passed on to those who are researching in this matter <e> <s> a great deal of work is going on in this area <e> <s> i am sure the noble lord will be pleased to hear that wider powers to collect salmon statistics were taken in the water act <e> <s> that is a subject close to the heart of the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that particularly important point <e> <s> as he will know we are at present having some difficulties with norway as there has been a greater production there than we would like <e> <s> as a consequence the price of salmon has dropped through the floor causing considerable economic difficulties for many fish farmers in scotland <e> <s> i am aware of that point and i am also aware that we have to safeguard the interests of the wild stocks in the rivers of scotland bearing in mind the report which announced today that million had accrued to the economy of scotland as a result of that sport <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for that observation <e> <s> as i said we are concerned particularly with discovering the genetic relationships between salmon and trout populations <e> <s> that is carried on in our research programme <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his observation <e> <s> we have been discussing the question of gene banks in scotland <e> <s> this question has also been addressed by the north atlantic salmon conservation organisation <e> <s> it may not be possible to establish guidelines for databases or gene banks until more is known about the extent and the significance of genetic variations <e> <s> i can assure my noble friend that the wild stock know their way to their own rivers in scotlar d i hope that enough of them are allowed to get through by various people on the way who may seek to poach them particularly the irish <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the noble lord realises that the scottish office has great powers to do various things <e> <s> however arranging the mating of wild and farmed salmon is even beyond the powers of the scottish office <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move the motion standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> i am not certain that i understand what is meant by other charges we are trying to iron out some of the anomalies particularly in relation to church properties and so on which have now become obvious <e> <s> we announced that we wished to make those changes <e> <s> this is the first opportunity since we were able to take decisions on the matter we have had to bring forward proposals for legislation <e>", "<cs> i shall obviously look closely to see what the noble lord is asking me <e> <s> but my understanding is that we are dealing with people in respect of whom child benefit is payable and i made clear that it is where year-olds are at school or undertaking courses similar to school courses which is important at another establishment <e> <s> however if the noble lord has seen a report which i certainly have not seen i shall look into it <e> <s> obviously if there is something to be considered i shall consider it before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord the point he raises is an important one <e> <s> i think it is covered by this amendment but i shall look into it and will obviously be in touch with him before the next stage of the bill <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for bringing forward these amendments <e> <s> of course i sympathise with my noble friend lord balfour in his wish to see that those who look after and care for their relatives should get some respite from the difficult task they perform <e> <s> i do not want to dwell upon the technical deficiencies that i understand are prevalent in these amendments but i shall concentrate briefly on why for practical reasons we cannot accept them <e>", "<cs> i believe that in the regulations which will be laid it will almost certainly be the case that there will be a limit on the charge <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may remind my noble friend that we are dealing here with the right to buy legislation as it concerns the scottish scene <e> <s> i do not think that that has anything to do with the situation relating to a tenant farmer on anyones property <e>", "<cs> normally where a board proposes to dispose of land it will be as part of some wider scheme of development at the school most likely coupled with an application to the secretary of state for capital grant <e> <s> in such circumstances the decision is one for the secretary of state <e> <s> the education authority at this stage has no role in the management of the school <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord macaulay for bringing forward this amendment <e> <s> he mentioned clause which concerns further education colleges <e> <s> there are important differences between the use of words similar to this amendment in part ii of the bill and the attempt to apply them to clause <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> indeed i had an idea that he was trying to get behind what the government mean in this particular area <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do with the amendment perhaps i may make a few further comments <e> <s> i do not intend to engage in what could end up as a second reading speech and i do not want to be accused of swimming against the tide and shooting myself in the foot at the same time <e>", "<cs> i shall return again to this point because the noble lord raises the question of selection and his concern in this particular area <e> <s> the regulations under subsection of this clause must be compatible with the general provisions of this bill and existing primary legislation that will cover self-governing schools <e> <s> in particular regulations could not alter the basic characteristics of the school because that can be done only under the ballot procedures contained in clause that we shall debate later <e>", "<cs> with due respect to the noble lords lord carmichael and lord macaulay we appear to be going round in circles on this point <e> <s> i shall read very carefully what the noble lords have said in order to see if there is more substance in what they are saying <e> <s> i do not think it is possible to have the matter both ways <e> <s> does one want self-governing schools to match public schools in standards or not <e> <s> that is the simple question <e> <s> we believe that the provisions should be comparable <e> <s> that is why we feel that this subsection is necessary <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to my noble friend <e> <s> as usual he is very adept at seeing faults in the drafting of a bill <e> <s> i sought to explain the history of paragraph of part i of schedule which is the subject of the government amendment and the reason for its insertion in the bill <e> <s> paragraph is an important measure which was simply omitted from the order paper through a printers error as i have already said <e> <s> it was omitted on the day on which the bill was considered at report <e> <s> once that amendment has been accepted by the committee and is incorporated in the bill the correct reference to clause should be to paragraphs to of part <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord is not impugning the fact that i am bringing forward an amendment to correct a mistake <e> <s> i take it rather amiss that the will of another place on this matter which as i understand it had agreement on all sides should be questioned at this stage <e> <s> i know that the noble lord holds strong views on this matter <e> <s> we heard about them when the school boards legislation was before us last year <e> <s> nevertheless i wish to make it clear that this amendment is brought forward to correct what is in fact a printers error <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord macaulay for bringing forward this point <e> <s> i should like to go through the matter quite carefully because there is a genuine difficulty of balance here which we must try to address <e> <s> perhaps i may take two cases in which an attendance order might be made one is the case of persistent truancy the other a case where a child has had to be suspended or excluded because of his disruptive behaviour at school and the parent has then failed to make any move to get the child reinstated or to send him or her to another school <e>", "<cs> the two amendments to clause attempt to impose some additional restriction on the ability of a self-governing school to levy charges on pupils or on others for provision going beyond school education <e> <s> clause has been drawn up here we go back to the question of may or shall in such a way as to put the board in precisely the same position as an education authority operating under equivalent provisions of the famous education scotland act <e>", "<cs> my noble friend illustrates the problem we face in trying to restrict where we draw the line <e> <s> if he turns to clause b he will see that it states <e>", "<cs> i thank all members of the committee who have taken part in the debate <e> <s> at times scotland has been called a guinea pig <e> <s> when i sat here listening to the passage of the education reform bill through this house i understood that the english and welsh arrangements were put in place a year ago <e> <s> therefore we are able to learn by reading the book instead of looking into the crystal <e>", "<cs> that is correct <e>", "<cs> this is an important amendment <e> <s> i appreciate what the noble baroness says particularly about support for small primary schools <e> <s> i should point out that there are certain differences between england and scotland <e> <s> one of the differences is that clause allows a self-governing school to continue its use of certain support services <e> <s> there is no similar provision in england <e>", "<cs> i cannot give the noble lord the exact numbers of these secondary schools that have been given grant-maintained status <e> <s> all i can tell him is that my right honourable friend has accepted some with under pupils <e> <s> i should like to look at the figures and give the noble lord a detailed reply <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord macaulay presents us with a hypothetical case <e> <s> we shall deal with clause later but i should like to point out that the whole question of viability and the long-term future of a school of that size in a highland area for example would have to be considered most carefully by the secretary of state <e> <s> as i see it his prime duty is to ensure continuity of education for the children of a particular area <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> of course i take very seriously his point about trying to improve the bill <e> <s> during the course of this debate we have made some changes and the other side have also made some useful suggestions for consideration <e> <s> i believe that this matter is not best served by putting an arbitrary limit on numbers <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord carmichael for bringing forward this amendment and the noble lords who have spoken to it <e> <s> it is indeed important <e> <s> the passage of this bill through another place was a long one <e> <s> much discussion has taken place on this matter of special schools <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> i should also add that sense in scotland the national association for deaf and blind has also indicated its support for this proposal <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord lord macaulay <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot give him any comfort in what i am about to say but i shall try to elucidate some of the points <e> <s> as to the history of the situation in another place strong representations were made as to why this provision of choice should not be given to special schools as well as to any other <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord mackie of benshie and lord macaulay of bragar will no doubt wish me to dwell first for a moment on the situation of school boards <e> <s> that was discussed on the one oclock news by my right honourable friend the secretary of state <e> <s> we feel this may strike a chord with the noble lord lord mackie that the present position is commendable <e>", "<cs> the intention of the legislation is to give the authority of running a school to the people most closely connected with it <e> <s> as regards the whole gamut of proposals relating to education in scotland i believe that the noble lord lord mackie of benshie would not be very happy if we gave a free hand to those self-governing schools to do exactly what they wanted concerning the education of children <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord and i understand his difficulty in this matter <e> <s> when i started to look at it i also had some difficulties in understanding what was involved <e>", "<cs> as usual my noble friend asks the most simple question which turns out to be the most difficult to answer <e> <s> both mother and father have a vote <e> <s> however if he asks me to go further to various other cases i would need to look at this and write to him in full <e>", "<cs> i do not want to go into the long discussions we had on this matter at the time of the passing of the school boards scotland bill but there are sensitivities and difficult situations which concern families and their circumstances <e> <s> it was felt at that time this was across party lines that the list should be confidential for certain reasons <e> <s> if the noble lord cares to look at what was said at that time i am sure i can provide suitable information for him <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may answer my noble friend lord selkirk more fully than i did earlier <e> <s> i have it to hand that amendment no <e> <s> defines parent <e> <s> the noble lord lord carmichael asked why the board needs to have the list <e> <s> there will be a need to update the list and allow checking before the ballot <e> <s> the board locally can do this <e> <s> we do not believe that the electoral reform society would be in a position to do it <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord said <e> <s> i am unaware of the inference he made about these particular matters <e> <s> however i shall write to him after i have read what has been said <e>", "<cs> i have every sympathy with the view that schools should not be subject to the disruption of repeated ballots on self-governing status year after year <e> <s> we believe that there are adequate safeguards against that without this more restrictive amendment <e> <s> a school board or group of parents which indulged in a series of annual ballots would rapidly alienate any general support for its views among parents who would blame such people for the uncertainty inflicted on the school and of course on their children <e>", "<cs> i can see that this amendment is intended to qualify an education authoritys obligations to pay a school board in respect of such legal expenses as they may have incurred in any dispute regarding a ballot or the publication of proposals in respect of whether a school should become self-governing <e> <s> i note what the noble lord lord mackie said about that <e> <s> the amendment would have the effect of requiring the authority to reimburse the school board only in so far as the expenses incurred were reasonable <e> <s> that is reasonable enough so far as it goes but in the event of any dispute arising as to what were or were not reasonable expenses the matter would still have to be taken to a court for a decision <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for moving this amendment in the name <e>", "<cs> the policy embodied in the bill is that the ballot takes place on the simple question of principle whether the school is to become self-governing <e> <s> also that the information given to voters is what they require in order to understand the meaning of the question do you or do you not want this school to become self governing <e> <s> questions of school policy are left to be dealt with in the published proposals of the school board which follow the ballot <e> <s> i shall try to elaborate on that point <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to those who have spoken on both sides of the argument in this debate <e> <s> i recognise that this is a most important amendment <e> <s> as i start perhaps i could say to the noble lord lord macaulay that perhaps we may come to deal with the denominational schools when we discuss clause <e> <s> quite a lot hinges on what he said and i should like to deal with it at that stage if he agrees <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the noble lord lord mackie of benshie a few more figures <e> <s> yes indeed there are five schools in england which have been rejected for grant maintained status by the secretary of state <e> <s> the figures are these <e> <s> at the school with two ballots per cent <e> <s> were in favour <e> <s> the results at three schools were per cent <e> <s> per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and at one school per cent <e> <s> these are interesting figures <e> <s> but what is more important is that those with less than a two-thirds majority form per cent <e> <s> of the total of all schools approved <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael <e> <s> i think the proper word is specialism <e> <s> specialisms will come up for debate when we reach clause <e> <s> however i address the points he makes here <e> <s> the first concern is that a self-governing school must admit all who apply where it has places available <e> <s> it is in precisely the same position as a local authority school <e> <s> the board of a self-govering school will be anxious to ensure its success and will know that the amount received from the secretary of state will reflect changes in its pupil numbers <e> <s> no self-governing school will be in the business of finding excuses to turn away pupils <e> <s> i hope that gives the noble lord some comfort <e>", "<cs> that is perfectly true it could do whatever it liked in publishing its proposals <e> <s> that would not be very popular for those parents who have children at the school and who are living in the area which is excluded <e> <s> however that is one of the vital factors which the secretary of state must take into account <e> <s> as i have made very clear the secretary of state will consider most carefully any changes in catchment areas which as i have said are not necessarily bound rigidly because of changes which can occur in demography <e> <s> however it is my clear understanding that that is one of the basic factors in arriving at a suitable set of proposals <e>", "<cs> i am happy that the noble lord is interested in the debate and has posed an important question on the meaning of any special emphasis in this clause <e> <s> my understanding is that the phrase is not defined but from my reading of the bill special emphasis refers to what characteristics there will be for the school when proposals are put to the secretary of state <e> <s> i should like to look closely at this clause and subsection and elaborate on the matter in a letter to the noble lord in due course <e>", "<cs> i understand the noble lords anxiety but this must be a major part of the proposals put to the secretary of state <e> <s> indeed all i am saying to the noble lord lord mackie is that catchment areas do not exclude people who reside outside the area <e> <s> i see the force of what he says but i do not believe that in practice it is the sort of exclusion that could possibly be allowed by any <e>", "<cs> i have sympathy with the intent of this amendment <e> <s> i am also happy to say that the points that it raises are covered and safeguarded by the provisions of the bill <e> <s> there are certain basic legal obligations which any board of management will have to observe no matter what has been specified in proposals and later in the schools scheme of government as the special emphasis which is to characterise the provision of education at their school <e> <s> these obligations are contained at a number of different locations in the bill and it may be helpful to the committee if i identified the provisions which are relevant to the points raised by the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for taking the amendments together <e> <s> i shall deal with them accordingly <e> <s> clause b requires the board to include in its proposals a statement of the admission arrangements proposed for the school a statement of any special emphasis which is to characterise the provision of education at the school and any other aspects of the management of the school which the board thinks fit to include <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord that i shall see to it that he receives another set of papers as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i am advised that since the school board is under a statutory duty to publish proposals the bill itself must include any procedure which would allow subsequent withdrawal or modification of the published proposals <e> <s> the effect of the two amendments to clause would therefore <e>", "<cs> it would probably be helpful to the committee to indicate the circumstances in which we envisage that clause b might be used <e>", "<cs> in answer to the noble lord lord mackie of benshie as i said in my original reply it very much depends on the circumstances of the case and the amount of time that such a teacher will be employed in any school that is to become self-governing <e>", "<cs> as this is a very complex matter where the rules regulating teacher employment by education authorities are involved i should like to study the noble lords comments without giving a commitment at this stage <e> <s> however i do say to the noble lord that as i indicated i see nothing to prevent an individual if he is dissatisfied <e>", "<cs> i confirm to the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar to answer the point that he specifically asked me about that the government cannot offer a guarantee as i suspected of employment by the education authority to that particular person for the simple reason that it will be for the education authority itself to decide whether that person could be employed by that particular authority <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for moving the amendment and the noble lord lord addington for speaking to it <e> <s> the amendment <e>", "<cs> my noble friends first amendment to line is a fair expression of our declared policy in respect of financing self-governing schools <e> <s> she and others may well ask me why we do not write it into the bill <e> <s> before one buys a policy it is always advisable to ask to see the fine print <e> <s> whether or not we write that general principle into the statute local authorities may legitimately ask what it will mean for them in practice in other words they will want to go into a level of detail which we feel is more appropriate for regulations <e>", "<cs> that point takes us to the usual argument as to whether something should be on the face of the bill or in regulations <e> <s> the point came up on other matters during the first day in committee <e> <s> it is a complex matter and one which must be addressed as accurately as possible and we feel that it is better dealt with in regulations where we have the advantage i agree the point is important of discussing the regulations with those most directly affected in other words the education authorities <e> <s> i see clearly the point made by the noble baroness but i believe that the way in which we intend to approach the matter which is the same as the way that it was dealt with last year in the english and welsh legislation is the best way <e>", "<cs> that is a matter which must be addressed in two parts <e> <s> it must be addressed to the local authority where the economies of scale may be affected by the changes and by the self-governing school <e> <s> i hope that that reassures the noble lord <e>", "<cs> before my noble friend decides what to do concerning the amendment i should like to say that i understand what members of the committee have said <e> <s> however i fear that without the scale of detail in regulations there can be no watertight protection for each type of school <e> <s> that is why we feel that the correct route is the one that we have adopted <e> <s> i understand when the noble earl says that not everything done in english and welsh legislation need religiously be copied in scottish regulations or legislation <e> <s> i well understand that <e>", "<cs> we have touched on the workings of the clause several times in our debate particularly in relation to the principles laid down in parts of clause <e> <s> it is a necessary adjunct to allowing parents at special schools the choice of self-governing status <e>", "<cs> first may i say to the noble baroness that whereas the chamber may be quite empty the quality of those who are left in it leaves nothing to be desired <e> <s> i have a degree of sympathy with the aims of this amendment <e> <s> opting for self-governing status should not be seen as a route to changing the essential nature of the school <e> <s> the machinery in the bill quite deliberately prevents any change whatsoever in the characteristics during the process of a school becoming self-governing <e> <s> the secretary of state sees five years as a sensible minimum period during which the characteristics of the school should be expected to remain fixed <e> <s> this point is made at paragraph of the draft circular on the legislation issued for consultation on th october <e>", "<cs> these two amendments raise again an issue covered in part by an earlier amendment on clause <e> <s> my noble friend would i hope be pleased with the answer that i was able to give to the noble lord lord carmichael who moved that amendment on her behalf last week <e> <s> they deal with the aspects of the earlier amendment which i was unable to accept and my response here must be similar <e>", "<cs> in relation to the previous amendment i can answer the noble <e>", "<cs> if it is the intention of the noble lord lord macaulay to speak also to amendments nos <e> <s> and it might be convenient if he were to speak to them now <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord <e> <s> the first amendment to subsection of clause is i suggest unnecessary <e> <s> the education authority must be consulted by the board before a ballot is called <e> <s> the authority will know when a ballot has taken place and since it has a local presence it will know the result <e> <s> the ballot result can hardly be a secret <e> <s> my right honourable friend may not know when a ballot has been held and clause provides the first formal intimation to him <e>", "<cs> i thank my noble friend for bringing forward this amendment which is largely acceptable to the government <e> <s> i shall go on to explain why <e> <s> any major change in the characteristics of a self-governing school clearly has implications for public provision in the area generally <e> <s> the noble lord lord mackie of benshie earlier pointed this out <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state could not reasonably disregard the implications for the education authoritys own provision <e> <s> he would have to concern himself in any case with the public expenditure implications of either accepting or rejecting the schools proposals <e> <s> if for example the result was likely to be that another school had to be provided or a school extended as a result of the change at the self-governing school that factor would inevitably have to weigh with my right honourable friend <e> <s> any comments by the education authority on proposals from a self-governing school about such wider implications will be of concern to my right honourable friend <e>", "<cs> under clause any proposed change must have the support of parents in a ballot <e> <s> why should existing parents vote to deny entry in future to a similar mix of children <e> <s> that would be bound to mean the school refusing many of the children of their neighbours and friends and many of the younger brothers and sisters of those already at the school <e> <s> no that simply will not happen <e> <s> the bill gives parents a veto on any such change that is sufficient protection against the return to the old days of senior secondary schools so feared by the noble lord lord carmichael and many people <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to become involved in that argument but perhaps i could try to address what is germane to this amendment <e> <s> it tries to identify a set of parents beyond the particular self-governing school concerned with a future interest where the school is proposing to change its characteristics <e> <s> it would then extend to those individuals a say in the ballot <e> <s> the amendment depends on a very rigid view of which pupils will opt to attend which school <e>", "<cs> most of the amendment simply carries across words already present in schedule of the bill dealing with ballots on the change to self-governing status <e> <s> the context here is somewhat different <e> <s> in most cases the consequences for the self-governing schools of a suggested change in characteristics will be very clear to parents <e> <s> they will hardly need an explanation of a question such as do you want the school to open a primary department <e> <s> by contrast in a ballot on opting for self-government many parents will need something in neutral language explaining what in general self-governing status means for a school <e>", "<cs> if one studies closely as i have done what was said in another place on this matter it is apparent that there are two sides to the argument which took place on that occasion <e> <s> i am saying that this chamber has the opportunity now to fulfil what i believe to be a sensible amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> it is certainly important that the question posed to parents on the ballot paper makes quite clear precisely the change in characteristics envisaged by the board of management <e> <s> the question should be in suitably neutral terms <e> <s> the prescribed body responsible for the actual conduct of the ballot which is the electoral reform society will issue the voting papers to parents <e> <s> i imagine they will have their own views and would certainly object to anything in the nature of a leading question <e> <s> in these ballots as in ballots on self-governing status the prescribed body will have to observe such guidance as my right honourable friend the secretary of state may publish <e> <s> i shall happily undertake that we will discuss with the electoral reform society how the point of my noble friends amendment could best be dealt with in that guidance <e> <s> with that undertaking i hope my noble friend might consider withdrawing her amendment <e>", "<cs> we believe that these amendments could significantly undermine the intended workings of clause <e> <s> the clause ensures that a self-governing school can choose to make continuing use of local authority support services where the board wish to do so and are ready to pay a reasonable charge out of the recurrent grant available to them <e> <s> i would certainly argue that where the authority is to receive a fair price for its services there is no detriment to the authoritys own schools <e> <s> in some cases that fair price may be very high indeed for example if the scale of the request from the self-governing school would genuinely require the authority to take on an additional member of staff <e> <s> in these circumstances this would not be likely to prove a sensible arrangement for the school <e> <s> the fair price would simply be too much <e>", "<cs> we shall be offering to issue guidance which will help both sides in any negotiations <e> <s> long before the poor child is waiting to know whether he will face a problem i hope that the matter will have been decided <e>", "<cs> clause empowers the secretary of state where his consent is sought by a board of management for the disposal of land and that land was originally owned by the education authority or was purchased from the proceeds of the disposal of any such land to require that the land or the proceeds of the sale of the land be transferred in whole or in part to the education authority <e> <s> thus by means of clause the interest of an education authority in public assets with which it has in the past been connected can be maintained <e>", "<cs> the noble lord as usual is asking me to answer a hypothetical question <e> <s> i should like to look at various examples of where it may be possible for the board of management to have a right of retention <e> <s> i should like to seek advice on that point and write to the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for bringing forward the amendment which i agree is important <e> <s> i am sorry if i take a little longer to answer than i might otherwise do <e> <s> i consider that this is an important issue and we need to have the background as well as to deal with the amendments <e>", "<cs> clause provides that an education authority should supply the board of management of a self-governing school with all the information which the authority holds as managers of the school <e> <s> this amendment would have the effect of allowing employees to decide whether their staff records are to be transferred to their new employers <e>", "<cs> that is not right <e>", "<cs> i do not think there is much between us on this <e> <s> i am fascinated by the term tittle-tattle <e> <s> it is an interesting thought that the records of a local authority contain details of tittle-tattle <e> <s> what will be transferred are an authoritys records on an employee <e> <s> i do not believe an authority collects tittle-tattle or gossip however other members of the committee may be more knowledgeable on this matter than i at any rate in the formal records of members of staff <e> <s> however the serious point is that i feel we must look very carefully at this matter <e> <s> i intend to do that but i am not moved by the representations made <e> <s> i think we have probably got this matter right but i shall have another look at it <e>", "<cs> there is machinery within the bill as presently drafted which could be used by a board to achieve that result <e> <s> it may be helpful to the committee if i take time to explain in some detail how that would work <e>", "<cs> my reading of the bill as it stands is that there is no provision for a timescale for discontinuance of a board of management <e> <s> there could be circumstances in which something happened rather dramatically which would need to be addressed and which might mean the discontinuance of the school within a shorter period <e> <s> therefore it is my understanding that no timescale has been provided for that particular issue <e>", "<cs> we have dealt with change of circumstance in clause <e> <s> as i understand it that is an entirely different proposition from the proposal here which deals with a period of years before a ballot is held <e> <s> i believe that the period suggested is seven years <e> <s> as regards the changes in clause a five-year period is involved <e> <s> there is no stated period for a change back <e> <s> we do not expect schools to wish to go back <e> <s> that is the very reason why the secretary of state must take all the circumstances into consideration when deciding in the first place whether to allow a school to become self-governing <e>", "<cs> we could have long arguments about the working of democracy <e> <s> it is my understanding that the noble lord opposite and his party believe in devolution <e> <s> i should have thought that there was no better example of devolution for parents than that contained in the bill and in the school boards act <e> <s> i am sorry to repeat the fact this is where the noble lord lord mackie of benshie and i disagree that we firmly believe that there should be a majority of parents on school boards <e> <s> that point goes to the very root of the issue <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the noble lord that it is an important area in which we shall be addressing the subject of training and retraining with no doubt reference to the highlands and islands enterprise proposals <e> <s> we believe that employers should have the largest say on the new college councils since they are the ultimate consumers of vocational education and training <e> <s> they will be able to provide the expertise and <e>", "<cs> i must answer that question <e> <s> i tried to make clear that our definition of employer is widely drawn <e> <s> i have never thought of the health service and all its works as necessarily being motivated by other than dealing with the problems related to health in a particular area as indeed anyone who is involved in local business has his interest in the business which he runs <e> <s> i rest my case on what my moble friend lady carnegy of lour said <e> <s> she has first-hand knowledge of the situation <e> <s> for my part having been on a similar council as an industrial representative where incidentally there was a majority of those involved in the industry of the area i can see nothing wrong with the balance that the government are proposing here despite the persuasive arguments put forward by the noble lord lord mackie <e>", "<cs> the amendment provides the same access to information on the proceedings of college councils as is provided for <e>", "<cs> on this matter i can give a firm assurance to try to put in place what the noble lord lord carmichael would want me to say on the question of education authorities in this connection <e> <s> the impression may be that education authorities will be bound hand and foot by a mass of regulations on delegation schemes <e> <s> i give a firm assurance that that will not be our intention <e> <s> we have evidence of our intention in the form of the consultative paper <e>", "<cs> the principle of this amendment which seeks to ensure that admission arrangements to technology academies should not be based on selection by academic ability is in line with the governments policy and i think i can quickly reassure noble lords opposite about our intention in this respect <e>", "<cs> i can understand why this amendment has been tabled and i appreciate the concerns felt by noble lords opposite that there should be appropriate provision to ensure that teachers employed at technology academies should be suitable persons to be teaching that they should have appropriate qualifications and not be in that nice term technical cowboys <e>", "<cs> it may be helpful to give some details regarding the type of conditions and requirements which will be contained in a funding agreement and on which the secretary of state would require to be satisfied before making payments to a technology academy <e> <s> in particular the agreement will specify that the academy will be organised and managed in accordance with a scheme of government approved by the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> clause is a sensible safeguard <e> <s> my right honourable friend the secretary of state is simply seeking reserve powers which could be used if necessary to set out regulations about national testing with which education authorities should conform <e> <s> it is a useful safety net to ensure that parents in every education authority and self-governing schools receive the information to which they are entitled about their childrens progress in key subjects in a way which is consistent across the country and comprehensible in commonsense terms <e> <s> i am sure that education authorities and boards of management of self-governing schools will recognise the educational worth of the national tests that we propose and that the reserve powers need not be enacted <e>", "<cs> the amendment would be an unnecessary restiction on the secretary of states enabling power <e> <s> it would restrict the content and dimension of appraisal schemes which might be required of education authorities and prevent them from taking account of the different needs of teachers at different levels of responsibility and in different types of school <e> <s> we need to have a flexible power to ensure that authorities may be required to frame appraisal procedures appropriate for teachers at various levels and with various responsibilities <e> <s> if that power has to be used we want to be able to do so in a way which allows authorities to introduce and to apply appraisal in a manner suitable for the particular teacher or teachers concerned <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i need to look closely at that point <e> <s> on first looking at it my answer would be a qualified yes but i must double-check <e>", "<cs> i could not agree more with the noble lord lord mackie of benshie on this occasion <e> <s> the amendment appears to be designed to prevent an education authority assisting with the cost of attendance of a child or young person with special educational needs at an establishment abroad unless the main function of that establishment is to provide education <e>", "<cs> this amendment attempts to provide a means whereby education authorities can recoup direct from central <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord decides what to do about the clause perhaps i should just add that some of the information that has been obtained by my honourable friend mr forsyth who was in charge of education at the time of the commencement of the bill in relation to what might be called the peto situation in hungary suggested that it would be extremely valuable if this provision were included as there would be a record of assessment at a time when it is vital to try to sort out the problems that might be apparent when a child eventually arrives at a school <e>", "<cs> under section of the act the secretary of state has a range of powers to pay grants in accordance with regulations made by him <e> <s> section d in particular empowers him to make regulations under which he can pay grants to any persons providing education or educational services <e> <s> a body providing management advice to a self-governing school would not strictly speaking be providing an educational service <e> <s> it is the board of management that is providing the educational service in running the school and educating the pupils <e> <s> any advisory body would be providing an ancillary service a necessary support to education <e> <s> this clause widens the scope of section d as the noble lord lord carmichael said to include the payment of grant for such services <e> <s> there will be a need for such a body offering management advice and perhaps co-ordinating certain central services for self-governing schools particularly in the initial years <e> <s> it is appropriate that my right honourable friend should be able to offer financial assistance and this clause should stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> those last remarks are a very good advertisement for the <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will allow me to intervene <e> <s> we are very concerned about internal appointments being made without the authority going firth of a particular school <e> <s> that is what we wish to address <e>", "<cs> the purpose of clause and schedule of the bill is to give my right honourable friend enabling powers to remove a group or groups of persons from the ambit of the sjnc negotiating machinery <e> <s> that was in response to representations made by the hind teachers associations who did not consider that their interests were being properly represented by the teacher unions on the sjnc <e>", "<cs> i had a suspicion that the noble lord would return to the question of parents and in the meantime i have had a look at the whole question myself <e> <s> i should just like to take this time to explain it because it is an important point and the law of averages will of course work out in the end <e>", "<cs> it is my understanding that all will have a right <e> <s> but it will be up to the board looking at the various representations about that child as to how many people should qualify <e> <s> it could indeed be up to six <e> <s> however a husband and wife who have five children in school will have only two votes <e> <s> as i understand it that is the equitable way of dealing with this difficult matter <e>", "<cs> i should like to answer this point as fully as i can <e> <s> perhaps i may say to my noble friend the duke that the approval of the scottish office which he mentioned concerned the support sought by the hierarchy that the amendment was technically accurate <e> <s> i must say that no undertaking was given by the scottish office as to the acceptability of the policy as such and i think that is an important point at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and also to my noble friend <e> <s> if i may enlighten her as regards the safety net in the light of the announcement made by my noble friend lord hesketh in your lordships house on th october my right honourable friend the secretary of state for scotland has been considering the position north of the border where a safety net has been operated on a self-financing basis during the current year <e> <s> my right honourable friend will make a detailed announcement about this matter as soon as possible <e> <s> but his broad intention is that there should be comparable arrangements north and south of the border taking account of the fact that the community charge was introduced months earlier in scotland <e> <s> i hope that with that explanation my noble friend will understand the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank noble lords <e> <s> the solution to the problem was difficult to find <e> <s> once we had hit on it so far as attendance orders were concerned we were able to move quite quickly <e> <s> i thank both noble lords for the contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords if i heard my noble friend correctly she asked whether they were informed <e> <s> the education authority and the denominational interests will be informed <e> <s> returning to consultation i take seriously what the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove said <e> <s> we must be careful not to burden the school board at this stage in the process with over-formal requirements for consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i said at the earlier stage of the bill that we do not always slavishly follow the english and welsh legislation or acts in dealing with scottish measures <e> <s> this may be a case where we differ <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i mentioned the highland regional council <e>", "<cs> my lords we return to the arguments that the bill should indicate a two-year delay before any scottish school is permitted to move towards self-governing status <e> <s> if anything the amendment brought forward here is even more restrictive than the simpler version tabled in committee <e> <s> that provided for a two-year period with a power for the secretary of state to allow exceptions <e> <s> here we have a period of at least two years but this is then extended to some longer period when it is to be judged that the school board has gained adequate experience and competence <e> <s> we must assume that the secretary of state is to be the judge of this in every case <e>", "<cs> my lords this amendment is an attempt to oblige a school board which is calling a ballot on self-governing status to anticipate elements of the proposals which are very important at the end of the day which it would be obliged to publish after the ballot if the ballot result is positive <e>", "<cs> my lords the provision in the bill whereby there is to be a second ballot if the turnout at the first ballot is less than per cent <e> <s> of those eligible to vote was inserted by the government in another place in response to just the kind of concern that has been expressed by the noble lord <e> <s> it is common ground between us that the second ballot should be final and nobody wants an indefinite series of ballots <e> <s> indeed as a result of the amendment to clause which your lordships agreed earlier after a negative ballot result the matter cannot be re-opened for two years and not just for the months as proposed in this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to hear what the noble lord says <e> <s> we have been here before last year and we can now look at the book rather than look at the crystal <e> <s> we can see that in england and wales the secretary of state for education and science has on turnouts as high as per cent <e> <s> rejected schools with yes votes <e> <s> this is a complicated area <e> <s> we are dealing with childrens lives and with their education <e> <s> no responsible government can possibly do other than take into account all factors for this permissive legislation and that is what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords to assist matters perhaps we could dispose of amendment no <e> <s> and then move on to amendments nos <e> <s> and <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for proposing this amendment <e> <s> as has already been said by the noble lord lord macaulay i should find it most difficult to accept the amendment as it stands <e> <s> i understand what the noble earl is aiming for and i am indeed attracted by the wording of the first part of his amendment which reads <e>", "<cs> my lords as usual the point is not as simple as it might appear <e> <s> i see the thrust of the amendment and take note of the bodies which came forward with the proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i believe that the noble lord whether he is out of order or not is entitled to some explanation from me <e> <s> i apologise for the fact that the letter reached him only yesterday <e> <s> we have not had much time between the committee and report stages of the bill <e> <s> i apologise for that <e>", "<cs> my lords i am interested to note that the noble lord picks up terminology <e> <s> my understanding is that a denominational body will have a real and immediate interest in both cases <e> <s> the secretary of state would look for comments from the authority before reaching any decision <e> <s> in appropriate cases he would also look for comments from a denominational body <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a difficult area and it is one that we discussed in committee <e> <s> perhaps i may try to paint the picture again and i apologise for going back to the matter <e> <s> nevertheless i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael for bringing forward such an amendment <e> <s> we shall look at it in detail <e> <s> the fact that it has been tabled at rather a late stage and covers a tricky area means that when i have finished i shall tell noble lords what i should like to happen to the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house perhaps i should just say to the noble lord lord kirkhill i am glad to see him in his place that i remember his major speech at second reading <e> <s> his views are well known <e> <s> it is also well known that there are at present very good academies of knowledge which are not unconnected with the independence of education in the city of aberdeen <e> <s> however we shall leave that matter on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> perhaps i may say to the noble baroness as an aside that i heartily agree with my noble friend on this matter and perhaps i can give evidence of that <e>", "<cs> my lords the amendment by the noble lord would allow an exception to the rule that principal teacher posts should be advertised nationally <e> <s> i can appreciate the problem of authorities who have staff surplus to their requirement <e> <s> my noble friend indicates how this may be occurring <e> <s> however the principal teachers in secondary schools are a vital tier of middle management at the core of every effective secondary school <e> <s> they are important posts carrying salaries in a range from to nearly per year <e> <s> it is therefore important that when a principal teacher post falls vacant it must be filled <e>", "<cs> my lords noble lords will recall that during the discussion of my noble friends amendment at committee stage i asked him to withdraw his amendment and reintroduce it at report stage in order to allow me the opportunity to seek comments on this proposal <e> <s> i pointed out at <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> my noble friend is quite right to say that the sandeel reaches a maximum size of eight inches <e> <s> i accept that arctic terns have been under stress as the numbers that have died recently show but there is not sufficient evidence to know the precise reasons for the fall in sandeel recruitment at the present time <e> <s> however i can assure my noble friend that increased amounts of research and cash for research are being put into that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure my noble friend that counting sandeels is extremely difficult to do accurately as they exist in waters up to metres deep in sandbanks round about shetland where the problem happens to be <e> <s> however i assure my noble friend that current research will give us at least some further clues as to the problem affecting not only the fishery that exists in that area but the birdlife of the area <e>", "<cs> my lords the current expenditure on research into sandeel stocks by our marine laboratory in aberdeen is running at this year and is expected to increase next year <e> <s> in addition a project on the availability of sandeels to birds is being planned with consortium funding of from various conservation bodies <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for a very interesting dissertation on sea trout and salmon but as i understand it we are here dealing with the problems which genuinely exist around the coast of shetland <e> <s> i can assure the house that we shall take all necessary powers to deal with the situation if it means a further cutback on the amount of fishing effort <e> <s> however i am not persuaded at this time that fishing effort is the only problem in relation to the low recruitment of sandeels <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord <e> <s> there are two separate problems involved <e> <s> first of all the closure of the fishery from st july to the end of the year helps the small sandeels to grow and develop because that is the time when they are most at risk <e> <s> so far as concerns licensing which is the other aspect we have introduced licensing arrangements off the west coast to cover the minch area <e> <s> we shall be looking at licensing along with the question of the prohibition time by the end of the year in time for next year <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that both those points are actively being considered at the moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to draw the attention of the noble lord lord carmichael to my comments at the time of accepting the amendment tabled by my noble friend lord perth <e> <s> his noble friend lord macaulay is right in saying that majority is the important word in this legislation <e> <s> however the removal of that word does not change the position as regards this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i am sorry that the noble lord does not think so and i am sorry that the noble earl is not here with his views on the government amendment brought forward as a result of his amendment <e> <s> however the noble lord lord macaulay is entitled to his view <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the bill do now pass <e> <s> this is an important piece of legislation as is recognised by all noble lords who have taken part in our discussions on it <e> <s> although it deals with a number of areas including further education testing in primary schools and the machinery for recruitment and dismissal of teaching staff attention has rightly focused throughout on the creation of the new right for parents to seek self-governing status for their school <e> <s> where parents wish to exercise the option and where the secretary of state agrees to detailed proposals a wholly new form of school will be created in scotland <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have said nice things about the passage of this bill and those who have taken part in it <e> <s> it would be churlish of me not to offer again very many thanks to the noble lord lord carmichael of kelvingrove and the noble lord lord macaulay who brought forward many of the amendments that we have debated <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord carmichael and the noble lord lord ezra for their comments <e> <s> with regard to the latter point raised by the noble lord lord ezra we have had a fair debate on the constitutional aspects and i do not propose to labour that point in my reply <e> <s> i should like to take up the other points which have been raised <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for his question <e> <s> i shall visit dounreay next week <e> <s> i do not think that this statement makes any difference to the earlier decisions of the government on dounreay as a pwr <e> <s> this is obviously a matter that one will have to consider <e> <s> however my estimation is that it does not make any change at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot elaborate beyond what was said by my noble friend the leader of the house on this issue <e> <s> at second reading of the electricity bill the noble lord was very voluble as to how he saw the future of the bill <e> <s> so far as my noble friend and i understand it there is to be no change to the electricity act as it now stands <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord lord stoddart for his questions <e> <s> obviously he knows a great deal about the matter <e> <s> i believe that he was around at the time when his own administration not only consented to the construction of torness but also to preliminary work <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> i firmly believe that the two privatised companies which one must recognise cover not only a fair proportion of the generation as i have shown by the figures but also the transmission and distribution of electricity in scotland will be sizeable companies in their own right even in united kingdom terms <e> <s> we believe that far from changing the plans which i remember the noble lord lord mackie of benshie welcomed particularly in relation to the hydro electric board we have viable companies for privatisation <e> <s> i am happy to say that not only has the chairman of the sseb been most co-operative under these difficult circumstances but so has the chairman of the hydro electric board <e> <s> today he has issued a statement welcoming the decision <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall pass on the noble lords comments to my right honourable friend <e> <s> it is early days for scottish nuclear limited <e> <s> however much of the groundwork has been done because the set-up of the company has taken place <e> <s> the only difference will be the <e>", "<cs> my lords i was present on that occasion and i know that my noble friend sitting next to me told the noble lord in no uncertain terms that negotiations and discussions were and have been taking place as recently as a few days ago <e> <s> what is important and what seems to have been recognised by all sides of the house is that if the governments attention is drawn to information showing that the situation is not what they once believed they are entitled to come to this house with a decision which must be followed through <e>", "<cs> my lords i honestly believe that the noble lord is splitting hairs because he is inferring that on th october the government were responsible for a cover up <e> <s> that is not so <e> <s> what is relevant is that information has come to light as the procedure has carried on and this decision has been taken <e> <s> i do not think that i can go further <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise my noble friends concern <e> <s> however in a mixed fishery of various species as we have in the north sea the issues involved are complex <e> <s> we need to be sure that whatever measures are introduced are effective and free from major disadvantages <e> <s> a consultation paper was issued to the industry on th november and further discussions were held on th december <e> <s> we hope shortly to be in a position to approach the european commission with agreed proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords we are dealing with two separate issues here <e> <s> as the noble lord will know only too well we are dealing with the problem of monofilament nets as it relates to inshore fisheries and the difficulties caused particularly in the area south of barra and north of northern ireland <e> <s> the question we must address regarding white fish stocks is how to prevent discards which are large <e> <s> to that end we have several measures including further consideration of square mesh as opposed to diamond mesh and a reduction in the number of meshes around the cod ends <e> <s> these measures have been produced by my department in co-operation with the scottish fishermens federation to get round a difficult question and to try to bring about effective conservation <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his support of one of the measures in the consultation paper which was indeed suggested by the scottish fishermens federation <e> <s> i am in almost daily touch with the federation on these matters <e> <s> the prohibition of the carriage of both the millimetre net and the millimetre net on board the same ship is a matter we are addressing <e> <s> i have to point out and warn the noble lord that there are difficulties in this matter in particular difficulties with some of our european partners <e> <s> it is absolutely no good going ahead with conservation measures that are not agreed with brussels as well <e>", "<cs> my lords in answering the noble lord i should say that we do our very best to ensure that enforcement is effective <e> <s> as he will no doubt recall the very famous case <e>", "<cs> my lords the short answer to that question is yes <e> <s> indeed her majestys government along with many other member states have made quite clear to the commission that the proposals which have come forward from the fisheries commissioner and their timing are wholly unacceptable at this stage <e>", "<cs> my lords the arrangements and the necessary courses will be determined in the light of what the university and the college would wish for agricultural education <e> <s> the new campus principal who will be situated in aberdeen running the agricultural college on behalf of the sac will it is hoped at a very early date get down to the provision of the courses required and the arrangements necessary for the use of land property farms and so on which will be implicit in that <e> <s> i believe and i am sure this also goes for the new chairman of the sac that an early start must be made to those arrangements so that we can provide the education required through the right channels <e>", "<cs> my lords quota management of these stocks is extremely important <e> <s> discussions are about to commence with the industry as to how that should take place <e> <s> various measures will have to be taken and some of them will be very tough <e> <s> however we should not now decide what they should be <e>", "<cs> my lords i am aware of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> i was interested to read in <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for asking that question <e> <s> the government are still studying the text most carefully <e> <s> it may be necessary to make changes to fishing vessel licences <e> <s> the points made by the sheriff will be borne in mind when deciding the basis on which future prosecutions take place <e> <s> the government have not yet decided whether they will appeal against the judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure my noble friend will be well aware of the difficulties encountered by the de-commissioning scheme which was criticised most strongly by the public accounts committee and the nao <e> <s> the government have looked carefully at the options open to them and must decide what is good value for money <e> <s> there are major difficulties not everyone agrees that de-commissioning is an answer to the problem of over-capacity <e> <s> my noble friend should bear in mind the fact that the value of catches over the past years has increased dramatically <e> <s> fishermen know well that they must accept good and bad years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am well aware of the difficulties which may be encountered in any year as regards cutting the opportunities to fish <e> <s> however although there is a difficult situation as regards the quotas of north sea haddock and cod the government obtained the best possible deal at the december meeting of the council of ministers <e> <s> having obtained that deal we must try to ensure that the industry has a long-term future <e> <s> i accept that the noble lord has a point in saying that this year may be difficult <e> <s> but that was also the case a year ago <e> <s> i was not happy when the harbingers of doom months ago were saying that the industry was in a state of collapse <e> <s> it certainly was not <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord would have a point if this country did not fish in international waters but it does <e> <s> also one must realise and i accept that this is a very difficult area that one must reach an agreement as to the fishing opportunities of the various nations within ec waters <e> <s> that is a very difficult subject <e> <s> i do not believe that it should go unnoticed that four ministers from this government attended the council of ministers in brussels in december and the result was very much better than seor marins original plan suggested <e>", "<cs> my lords obviously if there is a problem in relation to the sheriffs judgment that will have to be taken into account by the government and taken into account speedily because we must move foward to arrangements for the proper management of quotas at a very early date <e> <s> that is why we hope to start those discussions with the industry very soon <e> <s> i assure my noble friend that discussions are going on rapidly within government as to the effect of the sheriffs judgment <e>", "<cs> my lords it is difficult in this case to make comparisons between one year and another <e> <s> i can confirm that the local authorities have produced certain figures which may be in the region set out by the noble lord <e> <s> strathclyde initiated warrant action against non-payers of domestic rates last year about per cent <e> <s> of the number of private sector houses in the region <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware there are various ways of recovering debt <e> <s> three ways are used in scotland at the moment <e> <s> one is poinding or warrant sales the second is through arrestment of wages and the third is bank arrestment <e> <s> these three ways of being able to obtain money from those who default are well known in scotland and are written into law <e>", "<cs> my lords i know what the noble lord is saying because we debated the matter at length when the bill passed through the house <e> <s> income support levels have been enhanced specifically to meet the requirement on recipients to pay per cent <e> <s> of the community charge <e> <s> in those circumstances if a person refuses to pay the charge it is only reasonable that local authorities should be able to recover the debt <e> <s> i understand what the noble lord says but there is a remedy <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always unfortunate that those who do not pay whether it be the business rate or the community charge referred to in the question make it more difficult for those who do pay <e> <s> they have to carry the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not see the programme <e> <s> i have special responsibility for the crofters <e> <s> i do not think that the government have let down the crofters in general terms bearing in mind the amount of support provided especially in the highlands and islands <e> <s> if one is poor one can obtain rebates <e> <s> why should a crofter be any different from someone who is poor in my area of the borders <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the whole introduction of this new tax has been a problem for local authorities <e> <s> however i am advised that local authorities are responding very well to the difficulties of such a situation <e> <s> i would not like it to be thought that the government think in any way that local authorities are not living up to and coping with what is a difficult situation <e>", "<cs> my lords we must look at the overall situation <e> <s> perhaps i may tell the house that over per cent <e> <s> of the poll tax has already been paid in two regions of scotland and in one area the figure nearly reached per cent <e> <s> i do not think that it is an impossible task but it is a difficult one <e> <s> moreover i am sure that local authorities are facing up to it <e> <s> while i am interested in the remarks made by the noble lord i have no doubt that a return to a property tax which perhaps his party is thinking about would not be very helpful to the nation at present <e>", "<cs> my lords there are always reasons for people paying or not paying tax <e> <s> i think that that fact will become clear as time goes on <e> <s> however perhaps i may suggest to the noble lord as he was concerned about warrant sales and so on that as regards the figure i gave for rate warrants issued in strathclyde last year out of the warrants issued only four or five people actually had to go to warrant sales <e> <s> that is a measure of the situation <e> <s> however we shall obviously keep this under review <e>", "<cs> yes my lords much has been done for the population of the isle of barra <e> <s> indeed this year we have instituted the vatersay causeway scheme at a cost of million <e> <s> the number of people living in those outer islands is very small <e> <s> of course we recognise that they need help and they receive this under the crofters capital grants system which helps them enormously and also through the agricultural development programme and so on <e>

debate that we had when the bill passed through this house <e>", "<cs> my lords first of all i should say that what is most important as regards the nuclear situation in scotland is the price that will be paid by scottish power and hydro electricity <e> <s> the price set in the supply contract to those two new companies will take full account of our commitment that tariffs should not rise in real terms as a result of the new industry arrangements <e> <s> i have to say that good progress is being made on these matters <e>", "<cs> my lords i know of the noble lords very distinguished

well that there is an equality so far as the hydro board is concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords so far as each individual case is concerned it is considered on its merits and so far as possible help is given <e> <s> but at the end of the day the individual consumer will have to bear the cost <e>", "<cs> my lords the government have taken account of the perceived injustice resulting from the fact

this year <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand the feelings in scotland about arrangements for the community charge there <e> <s> i am sure that my right honourable friend the secretary of state for the environment will take note of what the noble lord has said <e>", "<cs> my lords local authorities plan to increase budget expenditure in by per cent <e> <s> the increase last year was of the order of per cent <e> <s> it is gratifying to know however that the high increase in spending in the first year of the community charge is planned to slacken off in <e> <s> this suggests at least that some authorities are responding to the discipline of the community charge to restrain their expenditure <e> <s> perhaps i may add that i emphasise some authorities <e> <s> the lord provost of edinburgh refuses to pay the community charge <e> <s> the city district of edinburgh has an increase this year of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords that is entirely another question <e> <s> if the noble lord wishes to put down a question on the subject he is perfectly free to do so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has hit on an area which is my responsibility in scotland <e> <s> i can tell him that i attended

should add that above per cent <e> <s> of those who have received summary warrants have taken action to cover their debts <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord will be aware when we debated the

these days people will wake up to the fact that the per cent <e> <s> increase in that district this year is way above what it should be <e> <s> surely the councillors concerned should be accountable

right honourable friend <e> <s> as to how he advises my right honourable friend the prime minister that is a matter for him <e> <s> i say to the noble lord that it is well known now in scotland that local income tax has been rejected by his own party <e> <s> all i can find in the roof tax which the noble lords own party suggests as the alternative is a glorified version of the discredited and disliked rates system <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is usually very selective in the figures that he gives <e> <s> of course i realise that in strathclyde many people have not paid the community charge <e> <s> that is understood <e> <s> perhaps it has something to do with the level of the charge which is far too high <e>", "<cs> my lords i noticed that the noble lord lord taylor of gryfe said

that there are now only birds <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very big subject <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord will study most carefully the results of the governments consultation <e> <s> i can assure him that very strong views have been expressed on both sides of the argument <e> <s> i am well aware of the forestry commissions voluntary ban which i may say has encouraged us to bring forward a consultation paper <e> <s> moreover we should not have considered bringing forward a consultation paper had we not thought that there was a reason for having a good discussion about the

answer to the question of how we should go about preserving them for posterity <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble lord says to the effect that shooting is one cause of the decline <e> <s> the evidence of the game conservancy council when it becomes available will show that that body comes to a different conclusion <e> <s> the question of habitat is very important <e> <s> the forestry commission and the government brought in the same rates of grant for native pinewoods as for broadleaves in and that has encouraged the maintenance and extension of pinewoods <e> <s> to date the number of applications received by the forestry commission for planting native pines already exceeds hectares <e>", "<cs> my lords that is another question and one to which i shall not rise <e>", "<cs> my lords i am always grateful to my noble friend for bringing forward remarks of that kind <e> <s> i had no idea of it <e> <s> i am very glad that she has enlightened the house on the matter

ite is monitoring the population in glentanar <e> <s> i do not believe that that illustrates that the government and those working in that area are less than diligent <e>", "<cs> i shall have the natter checked but it is my understanding that the secretary of state will be required to appoint as one of the non-executive directors of the teaching trusts someone from the relevant university medical school or dental school <e> <s> i hope that that reassures the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i hope to prove to the noble lord that his fears are without foundation <e> <s> these amendments would create an anomaly in the national health service because they would deny to national health service trusts the right that is enjoyed by all directly managed hospitals to provide pay and amenity beds <e> <s> this power allows hospitals to generate useful income for the benefit of patients as a whole increases choice for patients and reduces the burden on the nhs <e>", "<cs> i need to look that up <e> <s> perhaps i may finish and then check that point <e>", "<cs> that question has obviously been uppermost in the mind of the noble lord for some time and i am glad that he has come to join us <e>

capital debt of the national health service trust takes account of the value of the assets <e> <s> looking at the rate of interest of per cent <e> <s> which is available for national health service hospitals it is unlikely that a national health service trust will go for a higher rate of interest <e>", "<cs> i shall be happy to do so and to explain in detail what the english amendments and the scottish equivalents are <e>", "<cs> i feel as though i were back in the only difference is that the noble and learned lord has gone to the cross-benches and is now a judge <e> <s> however we have all been here before <e>", "<cs> i am aware that a case for abolishing subsection a has been made from time to time <e> <s> it was a recommendation of a research study undertaken by the university of

year-olds are entitled to housing benefit to help meet their housing costs <e> <s> following concern expressed last year that some young people were falling through the net the government made it possible for and year-olds to qualify for income support in certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> i am always grateful to the noble lord <e> <s> i shall give him as much help as i possibly can in this matter which i find a little more difficult than others <e> <s> the amendment seeks to require the rent registration service to maintain a public register of the determinations rent officers make in their function of determining market rents for tenancies referred to them by local authorities in connection with payments of housing benefit <e>", "<cs> there are ways of obtaining information from many sources similar to the way in which the rent officer obtains information including advertisements and so on <e> <s> there is nothing to prevent a local authority publishing whatever it wishes in this connection as the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i was genuinely very interested to hear how the noble lord presented this amendment <e> <s> i am aware that a similar provision to that set out in the amendment exists in the parallel english legislation <e> <s> however amendment no <e> <s> b which has been accepted deals with cases where someone is threatened with violence to their home by someone resident elsewhere <e> <s> that is a more specific provision than that proposed by this amendment <e> <s> but i am aware that this amendment potentially affects a wider range of cases than people threatened with violence <e> <s> having heard what the noble lord has said i should like to consider further how far an amendment along these lines would still be desirable <e>", "<cs> i believe that this amendment aims to introduce a form of rent control but only for those tenancies which are let to people claiming housing benefit <e> <s> far from helping those people to obtain and retain accommodation the imposition of rent control would be likely to lead to a total drying up of the supply of rented housing for benefit claimants <e> <s> that in turn would lead to increased overcrowding and homelessness <e> <s> i am sure that is not what the noble lord desires <e>", "<cs> i recognise the concern that underlies the amendment <e> <s> we must all be concerned when citizens suffer harassment or violence because of their race and the government give their full support to effective measures to prevent harassment and to deal with those who perpetrate such unacceptable acts <e>", "<cs> we have heard both sides of the argument <e> <s> having taken the original measure through your lordships house i am well aware of the debates which took place at that time and how i had to tread a tightrope <e>", "<cs> i should like more evidence that there is a problem here <e> <s> i take the comments of the noble baroness lady seear seriously and i understand the position <e> <s> in those cases the person who moves in usually has somewhere where she has lived <e> <s> i should have thought that in view of the law she would be careful to realise what her rights in respect of the house into which she moves would be should the person whom she goes to help eventually die <e> <s> i am aware of the humane point that one must consider those situations <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for bringing this matter to the attention of the committee <e> <s> i was somewhat surprised but interested to learn that it was the save the children fund that identified this problem <e> <s> increasingly travelling families are staying on the growing network of permanent sites throughout scotland <e> <s> i noted the figures mentioned by the noble lord <e> <s> of course those figures exclude the provision of sites provided privately which i understand offer another to pitches <e> <s> in addition i am advised that over extra pitches are in the pipeline with others at the early stage of planning <e>", "<cs> i believe that the noble lord refers to what is normally called the nimby aspects of the case <e> <s> i would not suggest for one moment that he is wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lords lord gallacher and lord kirkhill for their observations <e> <s> i shall endeavour to answer the questions put by the noble lord lord gallacher before i deal with the point made by the noble lord lord kirkhill <e>", "<cs> yes i can give that assurance <e>", "<cs> i understand the object of the noble lords amendment <e> <s> it is an attempt to transfer from health boards to local authorities the responsibility for the registration of establishments when nursing care is provided <e> <s> other considerations apart <e> <s> i believe that it is defective and does not spell out how registration is to be administered nor does it alter health boards present statutory responsibilities for both registration and inspection of nursing homes <e>", "<cs> i can give an example <e> <s> the argyll/bute health board is being accused of being far too tough as regards the regulations that it wishes to impose for the establishment of a nursing home <e> <s> therefore i was saying that there are problems on both sides <e> <s> however i believe that the professional skills of those involved in nursing care on health boards should not be overlooked though at the end of the day the local authority has the right to say that it does not wish to use a particular home for the reasons that i stated in my earlier remarks <e>", "<cs> neither the noble lord nor i were about when the provisions in the act were brought in <e> <s> we have to go back to that act to find the meaning of this part of the bill <e>", "<cs> i want to look closely at what the noble lord has discovered about this clause <e> <s> i shall try to explain to him how i see the position <e> <s> the clause prevents local authorities from taking responsibility except in prescribed circumstances i shall come back to that for providing accommodation to people who are in residential or nursing home care on the day before the new community care provisions are due to come into force <e>", "<cs> i wish to look very carefully at that particular circumstance <e> <s> i believe that the funding arrangement for someone who falls into that category will follow that person <e> <s> it will be the responsibility of the dss to ensure that such a vulnerable client does not fall between two stools <e> <s> however i want to have another look at the matter because we have not made that particularly clear at this stage <e> <s> if it is necessary to make alterations to the bill we shall do so <e>", "<cs> i am not sure whether or not the noble lord lord carmichael was helping me in attempting to move the amendment <e> <s> all i can do is try to put the mind of the noble lord at rest <e> <s> i shall come to appeals in a moment as that is quite important <e> <s> he asked whether individuals could complain at the assessment stage <e> <s> the answer is yes <e> <s> the amendment does not prevent that <e> <s> i should draw his attention to my amendment no <e> <s> bda which states <e>", "<cs> the important point that the noble lord lord carmichael made concerned whether an individual could complain at the assessment stage <e> <s> i have given an assurance on that point <e> <s> as regards the specific point of whether someone who is leaving an institution is held there until something is settled i wish to consider that matter and i shall write to the noble baroness on it <e>", "<cs> i

i cannot quote the terms of the proposed guidance at this stage <e> <s> however they will be published as soon as possible <e>", "<cs> i do not think that it is <e> <s> the secretary of state has adequate powers to deal with the situation if as i think my noble friend suggests there should be any backsliding <e> <s> i am sure that that is the case but again i shall look to see whether there is a loophole here although i do not think so <e>", "<cs> i share the noble lords concern that proper regard should be paid to the wishes of individuals being assessed and their carers <e> <s> one of the underlying reasons for the reform of the community care services which the government have set in hand is to secure increased choice and more appropriate forms of care <e> <s> in seeking to achieve that position there should be no doubt that local authorities will need to listen carefully to the views of the people being assessed <e> <s> that requirement is stated specifically in chapter of the white paper <e>", "<cs> the secretary of state for scotland has reserve powers to require them to do so <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for proposing the amendments <e> <s> i shall be slightly longer in my reply because it is an area which requires a little explanation <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble lord will permit me to intervene <e> <s> that may seem so but if our intentions are not fulfilled then clause and the powers of the secretary of state come into play <e>", "<cs> i shall deal first with amendment no <e> <s> zb <e> <s> throughout this bill we have tried to strike a balance

respectively <e> <s> in the act the functions of the sda were expressed in more detail than the more general terms of the functions given to the highlands board in the act <e> <s> much of the detailed wording in clause is as far as highlands and islands enterprise is concerned subsumed within the wider wording of clause b and c <e> <s> i am advised that clause when read with clause i encompasses the erecting of buildings or other structures on land <e> <s> that gives highlands and islands enterprise the same powers as the highlands board under the act <e> <s> the noble lord thought that the bill did not re-enact section a of the act <e> <s> in fact it does through the wording at clauses c and i which relates to the carrying out of work on land <e> <s> i hope that the noble lord will accept that explanation and that his fears will be allayed <e>", "<cs> it was clause i <e>", "<cs> i can assure the noble lord lord carmichael that in policy terms there is little between us <e> <s> we agree on the importance of a strong strategic role for scottish enterprise and highlands and islands enterprise <e> <s> the attempts by honourable members in another place to amend what is now clause were technically defective <e> <s> i have to tell the noble lord that the proposed clause a is equally defective <e> <s> the difficulty as my noble friend lady carnegy of lour mentioned is one of definitions <e>", "<cs> clause a simply reflects section of the scottish development agency act <e> <s> it will allow scottish enterprise and the local enterprise companies to work with local authorities and new town development corporations in the exercise of certain functions including promoting the growth of industry providing sites and premises and environmental improvement <e> <s> but i see no advantage in extending those provisions <e>", "<cs> as we start this section of the bill i must say to the noble lord lord hughes that i rise with some temerity in view of his experience of new towns and his distinguished record <e> <s> i should like to pay tribute also to the work of all those who have made such a success of the new towns in scotland <e> <s> i thank him also for the generous words in which he spoke of the secretary of state george younger in that connection <e> <s> it is relevant at this stage as we start to note what a success the new towns have been <e>", "<cs> that is something a district council as such being a shareholder on which i would need to take advice <e> <s> one would need to look at the formation of those companies which may wish to put in bids for the various local development companies that come into existence <e> <s> personally i see no reason why it should not do so but i should like to check that point <e> <s> the difficulty is that it is a local authority which would seek to become a shareholder in such an operation <e> <s> i think that it may be possible but i should not like to give the noble lord an assurance without double checking <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is a little extreme in his views <e> <s> i think he must look to the economy of his own area in aberdeen and judge for himself as to whether the successful economy that the government have brought to that area is doing well or badly at the present time <e> <s> frankly i believe it is absolute nonsense to say that it is doing badly <e> <s> it is doing extremely well <e>", "<cs> the drill on winding up can more appropriately be discussed with the next amendment <e> <s> perhaps my noble friend might glean more from that discussion than from this debate which deals with consultation <e> <s> my ministerial colleague in another place ian lang has been most assiduous in his conduct of the consultation process and the development corporations have played a

make up their mind they may or may not accept a specific option <e> <s> i cannot give the noble lord further guidance as he well knows <e>", "<cs> i made it perfectly clear that the tenants are the people who matter in this exercise <e> <s> that is the reason we came forward with this document for circulation <e> <s> that is why we spelt out clearly when decisions have to be made <e> <s> the government will of course take into account what the tenants want <e>", "<cs> we are dealing not with tenants of the district council but tenants of the new town corporations which are to be wound up <e> <s> the tenants cannot stay with the corporation because it will be wound up <e>", "<cs> it is important that the noble lord should study between now and the next stage of the bill the differences in housing needs of the various development corporations <e> <s> they are all different and different considerations will apply when it comes to wind-up <e>", "<cs> we prefer to deal with the scottish situation as we are doing <e> <s> we believe that that is the proper way to tackle the problem <e> <s> i insist that the tenants have a prime interest in the whole affair <e> <s> i should be misleading the chamber if i did not say that the options contained in this famous document which i shall circulate are clearly spelt out <e> <s> when the time comes the decision for the government will be clear <e>", "<cs> i did not answer that question because the commitment does not appear on the face of the bill <e> <s> there are very few clauses which deal with wind-up but we are dealing with all the aspects of wind-up <e> <s> i said that the commitment of the government to the white paper is absolute and we shall carry through the whole operation of wind-up regarding housing in accordance with what is written in the white paper <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble lords amendment is to transfer the whole of the development corporation housing to the local authority <e> <s> as i understand it that is the amendment with which we are now dealing <e>", "<cs> i refer my noble friend to what i said about the options that will be available prior to the ultimate winding up of these corporations <e> <s> the options available which the government will consider at the time after consultation for all those tenants in the corporations will be housing associations housing co-operatives district councils and other landlords <e> <s> however as has been clearly stated by the government if at the final wind-up there is any residue those houses would have to be taken over

needs housing in the new towns is fundamentally important <e> <s> the corporations have been making steady progress over the years in reducing their waiting lists by attracting the private sector and

work actively with voluntary and charitable groups to provide housing and related day care and other facilities <e> <s> i refer to the red cross housing development at irvine which will open next

amendment down to the words interests and opinions <e> <s> it states a principle from which we would not dissent <e> <s> i can assure the committee that the government will take that principle into account in making appointments to the itc <e> <s> we have already <e>", "<cs> the amendments would require the itc as i understand it to admit members of the public to its meetings except where it was considering matters relating to its staff <e> <s> i share my noble friends view that business affecting the public should be conducted in public wherever possible and i shall attempt to draw to my noble friends attention some of the points of difficulty about this aspect <e>", "<cs> i believe that we are at one on the thought underlying amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we should all agree that the itc makes appointments in line with good equal opportunities practice whether on racial or sexual grounds and adopts the same policy in matters such as promotion and training <e> <s> where i differ from the noble baroness is that i do not agree that it would be appropriate to place the commission under a statutory duty to that effect <e> <s> the itc like any other employer will be subject to the race relations act and the sex discrimination act <e> <s> it will also inherit from the iba a strong commitment to equal opportunities <e> <s> perhaps i should state what that strong commitment is as set out in a letter from the iba <e>", "<cs> like my noble friend i am not attracted by the amendment <e> <s> it would require the itc to reach agreement on wages and conditions with a registered trade union <e> <s> the iba has always had a good relationship with those who represent its staff as demonstrated by the responsible and i believe sensitive way in which it has handled the consequences for its staff of the privatisation of transmission <e> <s> i have <e>", "<cs> we certainly envisage that the itcs annual report will be both comprehensive and pertinent and may include the areas set out in the proposed amendment <e> <s> the noble lord missed paragraph in which the commission is asked to prepare a general report of the proceedings during the year <e> <s> however we believe that the itc should essentially decide for itself the form and content of its own report <e> <s> we therefore consider that it is inappropriate for the bill to lay down specifically what should be included in the itcs annual report <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness lady birk decides what to do with this amendment perhaps i may comment again <e> <s> first i welcome the noble lord lord thomson to these discussions and i am grateful for his intervention because i take careful note of what he says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord thomson is going fairly wide and perhaps attributing to me more than i have offered that is to look at the terms under which the report is presented <e> <s> that is crucial to the ongoing monitoring of the performance of the various licensees <e> <s> with that assurance i hope the noble lord will withdraw his amendment <e>", "<cs> i assure the noble lord that i shall certainly look at that point to see whether we can do anything

from that discussed before dinner <e> <s> however the amendments are unnecessary <e>", "<cs> there is very little that i can add to what i have already said <e> <s> the practical fact of the matter is

some members of the committee believe that they do <e>", "<cs> according to my grouping amendments nos <e> <s> and are grouped together <e>", "<cs> before i answer may i take it that my noble friend is not speaking also to amendment no <e> <s> a which i thought was grouped with this <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e> <s> this amendment would place the itc under a duty to maintain and promote effective competition <e> <s> clause of the bill places the itc under a duty to exercise its functions so as to ensure that a wide range of services is available throughout the united kingdom and that there is fair and effective competition in the provision of such services <e> <s> that is a sensibly framed duty <e> <s> it effectively requires the itc to hold the ring in a regulatory sense between competing licensees <e> <s> my noble friends amendment would give the itc a more active interventionist role in promoting competition <e> <s> that would be inconsistent with our view that the itc should be a light touch body <e> <s> with that explanation i hope that my noble friend will withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i see some difficulty in how the itc could in practice ensure that united kingdom companies were able to invest elsewhere <e> <s> if there were any regulatory barriers preventing united kingdom companies from investing abroad it would be beyond the power of the itc to remove them <e> <s> we are precluded by our treaty of rome obligations from discriminating between united kingdom companies and companies from elsewhere in the ec <e> <s> equally this is important united kingdom companies should be allowed freedom to invest in europe <e> <s> we have indicated that we shall take up with the commission any complaints united kingdom companies might have about barriers to investing in europe <e>", "<cs> i too have an interest in regional television <e> <s> i do not apologise for that fact <e> <s> i understand well the thoughts behind the amendment which is intended to underpin the quality and diversity in regional as well as national services <e> <s> that is an aim which the government fully share <e> <s> if the noble lord will turn to clause of the bill he will find that it includes specific safeguards for regional television <e> <s> it provides that channel services must give a sufficient amount of time to a suitable range of regional programmes including news programmes clause c <e> <s> it also requires that a suitable proportion of the regional programmes should be made in the region concerned clause d <e> <s> further applicants for channel licences are required to state what regional facilities they would use clause d <e>", "<cs> clause b requires the commission to carry out its licensing function so as to ensure programme services which are of a high quality when taken as a whole as the noble lord said <e> <s> the amendment would remove that important qualification <e> <s> the general duty in respect of the range and quality of television programme services applies to services taken as a whole because it would not be reasonable we believe to expect all services to meet these criteria in their own right <e> <s> we must be careful not to give the commission unrealistic objectives <e>", "<cs> i agree with the noble lord that this is not a question of semantics <e> <s> it is an extremely important amendment <e> <s> it is very important that whatever we decide in this particular clause should be made to work <e> <s> however i have to stick to my feeling with which my noble friend lord harmar-nicholls agrees that taken as a whole this is the correct place to describe the working of the itc and how it should operate <e>", "<cs> this is obviously a very important amendment <e> <s> we on this side want to see a satisfactory level of training within commercial television <e> <s> but we believe that essentially this must be the responsibility of the programme-making companies whether they be itc licensees or independent producers <e> <s> if they see a need to create an industry-wide training body funded by a levy there is nothing to prevent them setting one up <e> <s> but we do not believe that either the government or the itc should impose such a structure <e>", "<cs> i am unaware of that last statement <e> <s> however i shall try to explain the governments view on this matter <e> <s> the amendment would enable the itc to impose licence conditions regulating technical standards for television programme services <e> <s> there are strong commercial pressures for broadcasters to achieve high technical standards <e> <s> viewers in this country are used to a high picture quality <e> <s> any television service which cuts corners on technical standards would therefore risk losing viewers <e>", "<cs> as i understand it and i shall need to look closely at this matter the government undertaking to which the noble lord lord ardwick referred related to clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord houghton may not be aware that clause b already requires the itc to draw up a code giving guidance on the rules to be observed when making appeals for donations in programmes <e> <s> perhaps

certainly share the views of the noble baroness on training and accept that the maintenance of high technical and production standards on channels and will require a correspondingly high level of training and retraining not only of programme production staff directly employed by the licensees but also of those employed by independent producers contracted to provide programmes for those channels <e> <s> the noble baroness made that point clearly <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite right there is no connection between amendments nos <e> <s> and a <e> <s> it was a question of grouping

area or different communities living within it <e> <s> the bill also provides that a suitable proportion of regional programmes should be made within the overall licence area <e> <s> this amendment

touches a chord with me when he refers to interest rates <e> <s> he realises of course that the major underlying problem is inflation <e> <s> he may look back on may with rose tinted specs because at that time unemployment in scotland was which was a very low figure <e> <s> but we were also experiencing inflation rising to per cent <e> <s> shortly afterwards <e>", "<cs> all right per cent <e> <s> but let us not forget that between march and march the inflation rate was more than per cent <e> <s> that was a very long time for industry to have to cope with the situation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may be a forecaster of great repute but i am not <e> <s> all i can do is to take todays figures <e> <s> the june figures for unemployment in scotland still show a downward trend <e>", "<cs> at present channel is wholly owned by the iba which broadcasts its programmes approves its schedules and decides its income <e> <s> the government appoint the members of the iba <e> <s> there have been no objections to those arrangements even although they involve government responsibility for the appointment of the ultimate controllers of channel <e>", "<cs> i do not know that i can add very much to what i have said <e> <s> i said that this is a long stop power <e> <s> channel will be a statutory body operating to a statutory programming remit <e> <s> as the noble lord said if there have been statutory requirements as in the case of the itc the bbc the bsc the bcc and the fourth welsh channel they all have boards appointed by the government <e>", "<cs> yes indeed <e> <s> it is very happy about it <e> <s> it feels in a much stronger position to deal with the situation <e>", "<cs> i note what the noble lord says <e> <s> i am sorry that he does not like the arrangement which may appear to him to be curious but which to others is satisfactory to try to move channel on from the current position <e> <s> in relation to the amendments to which i have spoken channel and the iba to which the noble lord contributed such distinguished service approve of the amendments <e> <s> the advertisers themselves have welcomed the separate setting up of channel air time <e> <s> it is wrong to suggest that the clause will cause disruption to the advertising market <e> <s> of course there will be difficulties and problems when new arrangements are made <e> <s> but by giving some kind of comfort to the company to proceed along the lines that we would wish we are letting it flap its wings the wings that are now emerging from the little chicken that the noble viscount produced <e> <s> i thank the noble lord lord thomson for the remarks that he made about this being one of the governments good decisions and for acknowledging the part played by the noble viscount <e> <s> however he is being a little tough in pouring such a large bucket of cold water over the whole of clause <e>", "<cs> i appreciate the intention behind a year licence period for channel <e> <s> it is to provide greater security for the licensee faced with large startup costs and a more uncertain financial climate than channel <e> <s> however we do not believe that the proposed amendment will help because it fails to appreciate how the licence system will operate in practice <e> <s> i shall try to demonstrate what i mean by that <e>", "<cs> i should like to draw the committees attention in particular to clause <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the noble lord lord gallacher for welcoming the order <e> <s> one of the difficulties for the industry at the moment as he rightly says is that the weight of fish landed has gone down considerably particularly haddock in northern waters but also other species <e> <s> that presents the sfia with problems regarding the rate <e> <s> the sfia is setting its levy on the weight of fish landed <e> <s> thereby hangs the problem which it now faces about the size of the increase of the levy <e>", "<cs> members of the committee are allowed to speak to any amendment that they move at the appropriate moment <e> <s> i thought that it would be convenient for the committee to hear my answer to the amendment moved as it might colour the views of those who wish to move later amendments <e> <s> it would then be up to them <e>", "<cs> this has been a useful exchange <e> <s> i thank the noble baroness for moving the amendment and for making clear her concerns <e> <s> i shall want to look closely at what she has said when we come to produce our own amendments for report stage <e> <s> i repeat my commitment that we are accepting the principle behind this set of amendments <e> <s> that covers all the amendments and all parts of them <e> <s> the noble lord lord goodman asked me a direct question <e> <s> yes indeed we shall look most carefully at those points <e> <s> my noble friend lord ullswater informed the committee on th july that the government intended to bring that teletext service within the consumer protection requirements in the advertising provisions in clauses and of the bill <e> <s> that is only half the story <e> <s> the other half has to be dealt with by amendments which we wish to bring forward at report <e>", "<cs> having heard what the noble lord lord bonham-carter and the noble baroness lady birk have said about the amendment it is right that i should clarify the position regarding <e>", "<cs> they will be the operators who are covered by the existing arrangements <e>", "<cs> the intention is to move to a situation in which there is more choice for those operating cable services <e> <s> that is why we feel at this stage that the must-carry rule should not apply to all who are involved in the transmission of cable <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes <e>", "<cs> i am interested that the noble baroness has produced this amendment <e> <s> i seem to recall having discussed quality earlier this evening <e> <s> we rejected the proposal because of the multiplicity of radio stations <e> <s> i suggest to the noble baroness that the argument she has just made takes us in a different direction <e> <s> i cannot believe that it would be right to remove as this amendment seeks to do the requirement for independent radio programmes not to offend against good taste and decency or to be offensive to public feeling or to transmit material which could lead to disorder <e> <s> those are long-standing requirements and i can see no possible justification for removing them <e> <s> radio is a different medium from television but we should not imagine that it is not capable of being tasteless or offensive <e> <s> in some ways it is even more vital that it should not be so given the importance radio has to people who may be vulnerable or lonely or both <e>", "<cs> of course one does not just move words from act to act <e> <s> i agree with the right reverend prelate that we are in the business of passing this bill and as a result we are sending out signals <e> <s> despite the subjective questions of quality and standards of decency in this case i would strongly object to any weakening of what is proposed <e>", "<cs> audience research will be carried out for the three new national commercial services <e> <s> it is peripheral work <e> <s> i also made clear that the request from the radio authority was also that of the iba <e> <s> it had thought about the matter considerably and had come to the conclusion that this would be the best way forward <e> <s> the noble baroness asked whether audience research would be carried out as regards television <e> <s> it will be carried out and it is provided for in the bill although i do not have the page in front of me <e>", "<cs> it is not completely removed <e> <s> i have made it clear that audience research will be carried out on the three new national commercial radio services <e> <s> we wish to remove from the bill the extra services that will come from local community radio <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may give the committee a little more background to the amendment <e> <s> it would be only a marginal limitation on the authoritys audience research duties <e> <s> they would continue to apply in relation to the stations which will form the bulk of the expanding independent radio sector <e> <s> they would continue to apply to all local radio services including commercial services no matter how small <e> <s> they would also apply to the new national services but they would not apply in respect of those forms of sound service such as data services tape delivered services and satellite services where there is unlikely to be competition for licences which could usefully be informed by audience research <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is quite entitled to his view about what i have and have not said <e> <s> i am prepared to look at the amendment to see whether the intended effect is achieved <e> <s> if it is not i shall ensure that an amendment is brought forward at the next stage <e> <s> i shall ensure also that the noble baroness and the noble lord lord thomson are written to on the matter <e> <s> in the meantime i commend the amendment to the committee <e>", "<cs> in that case i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his opening remarks <e> <s> it just proves that one should not believe everything one reads in the scottish press <e>", "<cs> my lords that is an entirely different question <e> <s> i know that in lothian there was a request for extra staff to deal with the community charge <e> <s> that brought about a court case because the local authority did not wish to appoint them <e> <s> however i am glad to know that the court case has now been satisfactorily resolved <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that some people in scotland can pay and will not pay that is perfectly true <e> <s> it just means that those who pay have to carry more of a burden <e> <s> i have to say to the noble lord that i am not particularly impressed with the replacement of the community charge by the roof tax as proposed for scotland <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> i thank my noble friend for that <e> <s> we made some changes during the course of last year <e> <s> only last week my right honourable friend announced further changes <e> <s> a number of improvements have been made to the community charge relief scheme including the extension of the scheme by two years and a reduction in the threshold for relief from to <e> <s> there are a number of additions to the prescribed classes for standard community charge purposes which i know my noble friend will welcome <e> <s> most important of all to me as the minister with responsibility for tourism bed and breakfast accommodation for up to six people is to be exempt from non-domestic rates <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord may well have a point <e> <s> nevertheless a considerable number of people have not yet paid the community charge <e> <s> i hope they realise what they are doing to those who have paid it <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot give the noble viscount details <e> <s> all i can say is that to date i do not think that the allowances which some authorities have made for bad debt provision i hope i may put it that way have been sufficient to meet the differential between what has been collected and what was expected to be collected <e> <s> at the moment the estimated shortfall is million <e> <s> however that should be compared with a budgeted charge income of million for that year <e> <s> i shall see whether i can find any further information for the noble viscount and i shall write to him <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> there is no doubt at all that in grampian region for example the rate of collection has been good <e> <s> as it happens grampian region had allowed for a bigger bad debt provision than some other authorities <e> <s> however it would be invidious of me to refer to any other authorities <e> <s> i believe we may be able to learn some lessons from the experience in england as regards the follow-up period after the time of collection <e> <s> in england the first bill can be followed up with action after one month whereas in scotland it is followed up after three months <e>", "<cs> my lords we are well aware of the difficulties that can arise with some local authorities <e> <s> there are ongoing discussions on how to improve the system <e> <s> cash provisions for making the necessary changes to the community charge have been well covered by the government <e>", "<cs> no my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill be now read a third time <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may briefly thank both noble lords for their comments <e> <s> i am rather surprised that the noble lord lord carmichael thinks that training is going in the wrong direction <e> <s> the fact that training functions come to scotland proves that we are trying to devolve powers in the proper way <e> <s> i believe that the combination of training and enterprise which the new bodies will have will be helpful for scotland <e>", "<cs> i have listed the amendments to which we are speaking at this stage <e> <s> this group of amendments has two effects <e> <s> first it replaces all references to including sound recordings in a broadcast by references to broadcasting sound recordings <e> <s> this is a change which would bring the language of the new sections to be incorporated into the copyright designs and patents act into strict conformity with the language of that act <e> <s> naturally i cannot object to that <e> <s> i must however resist the amendments because in addition they extend the scope of clause and the government consider this to be unacceptable <e>", "<cs> i apologise in advance for what will be a lengthy answer <e> <s> i hope that my noble friend will realise that i am trying to look beyond the obscuring walls of detail to which he referred <e> <s> i am also well aware that as the noble baroness lady birk has sometimes said of the bill this goes to the heart of the bill <e> <s> it goes to the heart of the problem of needletime and it is therefore important that i deal with all the amendments in this group <e> <s> i realise that the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has not necessarily spoken to his own amendments grouped in this connection but i hope <e>", "<cs> in that case perhaps we shall wait until we hear from the noble lord <e>", "<cs> i do not believe that i need to add very much to what i have already said except to say to the noble lord lord mulley that i have made commitments and they will be carried out <e> <s> the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran has placed me in the position of referee rather like at a rugger or football match between my noble friend lord colnbrook and himself <e> <s> i understand the difficulties to which he alludes regarding copyright law <e> <s> for that reason the government have to take measured steps to try to resolve the issue <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for moving his amendment <e> <s> i take it that in amendment no <e> <s> va there is a misprint <e> <s> it should refer to paragraph b of section c <e>", "<cs> in other words i assume that it is only when the licensing body has proposed unreasonable terms or no terms that it will be necessary for the broadcaster to notify his own terms <e> <s> i feel that that is inherent in the structure of the clause as it stands but i shall certainly consider whether the amendment proposed helps to clarify matters <e>", "<cs> i note that amendments nos <e> <s> ya and yb are in identical terms so we shall deal with them first <e> <s> as i understand it the amendments prevent a broadcaster who has already infringed copyright by broadcasting sound recordings without authority from benefiting from the statutory licence <e>", "<cs> these amendments taken together seek to create both criminal and civil remedies to deal with the problem of satellite signal theft <e> <s> this is a problem which we recognise is capable of causing considerable financial loss not only to foreign but also to uk broadcasters <e> <s> this is an area to which the government have recently been giving a good deal of thought <e> <s> my right honourable friend mr mellor announced on nd may that the government were launching a consultation exercise with a view to introducing further measures to curb satellite signal theft <e> <s> i am pleased to be able to tell the committee that we have made progress with this and that we intend to introduce our own provision on the subject into the bill at report stage <e> <s> we have not done so earlier simply because we were not ready to do so <e> <s> this is a complicated area and we want to be sure that we have our proposals exactly right <e>", "<cs> following the debate on programme listings which took place during committee in another place the government undertook to take away and reflect upon a number of the issues raised <e> <s> since then a further round of consultations with the major interests concerned has taken place <e> <s> in the light of that exercise the government announced on th april details of their proposals to end the listings duopoly which in some respects modify the original proposals <e> <s> two of the modifications to our original proposals relate to the extent of the information which broadcasters will have to make available and the timing of the release of that information <e>", "<cs> i have listened to everything that has been said and i am delighted that the voice from troon if i may say so believes in the governments view that the duopoly should be broken <e> <s> i refer again to what i said to my noble friend about the question of separation of the copyright and information elements of the value of the work <e> <s> i believe that it will be difficult to expect the tribunal to attempt to distinguish between copyright and information elements of the work <e> <s> the general approach which the tribunal will adopt in all areas of copyright is to establish what is a reasonable market value of the licence in question <e>", "<cs> yes of course i shall consider the point with care before the next stage <e>", "<cs> this is a most difficult case <e> <s> as the noble lord lord lloyd of kilgerran said the new clauses would introduce a whole new kind of intellectual property into the law of the united kingdom <e> <s> it is no light matter from either side of the argument <e> <s> as far as i am aware it is the first time that such a right has been introduced into legislation anywhere in the world <e> <s> it is therefore something that we should approach with great caution <e> <s> in the governments view the case for its introduction has not yet been made out <e> <s> i hasten to add that this debate takes the matter one stage further <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> we all have sympathy for that case which has obviously been upsetting <e> <s> we shall consider the suggestion made by the noble lord lord lloyd of hampstead <e> <s> i give the assurance that the noble lords lord peston and lord willis can make representations at any time on this matter although i am afraid that i can go no further than that at this stage <e>", "<cs> i beg to move amendments nos <e> <s> za a aa and ab <e>", "<cs> the second question is very important <e> <s> i have just ben discussing that issue with the noble lord lord macaulay of bragar who has a similar view to the noble lord lord prys-davies <e> <s> nothing is written down in that regard but it would be surprising in a committee of that sort if gaelic speakers were not included <e> <s> i note what the noble lord said <e>", "<cs> i understand that it is not but as i have just said the bbc said that it does not wish to draw on the fund even if it could <e>", "<cs> that is a separate issue <e> <s> we are not dealing with the bbc <e> <s> we are dealing with the independent television companies who will operate in scotland <e> <s> far be it from me at this stage to say which those companies shall be but it is perfectly clear that grampian and scottish television are the two companies which wish to take part <e>", "<cs> these amendments taken together seek to provide government funding for irish language broadcasting in northern ireland by means of the proposed gaelic television fund which is intended to supplement gaelic broadcasting in scotland <e> <s> they also provide that channel licences in northern ireland should be under a requirement to provide a wide range of programmes in the irish language <e> <s> as my right honourable friend the minister of state said in another place when this subject was debated there while we do not think that this issue is necessarily closed for all time we do not consider that <e>"]
