lords i am most grateful to all those who have taken part in this debate but i regret to say that many noble lords seem totally to have misunderstood the purpose behind this bill <e> <s> as far as the planting of trees is concerned naturally i realise that there is a very great enthusiasm for it but the whole purpose of this bill is not to further the planting of trees in a general sense but to further the preservation of numbers of certain varieties of trees <e> <s> the reason why i have said certain varieties is that they are the slow-growing trees which people who are keen on tree planting today are very unlikely to plant because they know perfectly well that they will not live to see them come to maturity <e> <s> they are extremely valuable trees not only from the point of view of their timber but also from that of appearance <e> <s> for instance i think it would be a very great pity if the oak tree were to become a museum piece in our countryside and was very rarely seen <e>", "<cs> yes i certainly would my lords of course but the point is that they are very much self-sowing and therefore are not likely to become reduced in numbers <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e>

of the fact that this bill has not received support from the government your lordships will give it a second reading <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow me to intervene <e> <s> i remember that era very well <e> <s> was not that due rather to the proliferation of different parties than the electoral system <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i think i can comfort the noble lord by saying that according to the amendment there is no compulsion to destroy any tree whether alive or dead <e> <s> the only thing that the amendment proposes is that you shall not be forced if you do to plant two others of the same variety <e> <s> on the other hand i think that there is a great deal in what both my noble friend and the noble lord lord kilbracken have said <e> <s> on the strength of that i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> what seems to have escaped so many noble lords in particular the noble lord lord kilbracken is the point i made on second reading that this bill is not directed at trees generally <e> <s> it is directed at a certain kind of tree namely those trees that are so slow growing that those who plant them are never likely to live to see the results <e> <s> while i have every admiration for the activities of many local councils not all of them admittedly but many of them in planting trees they seldom plant the right kind <e> <s> they are much more apt to plant a flowering cherry or something like that which will grow to maturity or semi-maturity within the lifetime of the present council or anyway of the present residents <e> <s> but that is not what this bill is supposed to ensure it is intended to preserve in the <e>", "<cs> we do not specify where

"<cs> may i point out to the noble lord that there is a clause later on in the amendments to rectify that <e>", "<cs> i entirely agree with the noble baroness that self-sown trees can be extremely useful <e> <s> however they can also be an infernal nuisance as i well know by the number of self-sown suckers that i have had to pull out in my garden <e> <s> i think that self-sown is certainly the solution but i would join with other noble lords in pointing out who knows whether a tree a years-old is self-sown <e> <s> one could not possibly tell <e> <s> therefore possibly a combination of the two namely self-sown trees of under three years old might be the solution <e> <s> in any case that can be put right at the report stage <e>", "<cs> i am sorry my lords that was entirely a mistake on my part <e> <s> i recognised it the moment that i sat down indeed practically the moment i said it <e> <s> suckers are not of course self-sown trees <e> <s> i meant to say seedlings <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilbracken has drawn a pretty grizzly picture of what might happen <e> <s> i quite agree that it is a weakness in the bill that there is no penalty for not complying with it <e> <s> on the other hand i must confess that what penalties to supply and how to enforce them is at the moment beyond me <e> <s> apart from that i am perfectly happy about the amendment and hope that the committee will accept it <e>", "<cs> what about those councils which have no regulations at the moment <e>", "<cs> i can only say what a relief it is to have government backing at last <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now again resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i was persuaded at the first part of our committee stage to include this amendment but i realise that it has its shortcomings <e> <s> on the other hand the question of an avenue is a different one because if a single tree in an avenue is felled or destroyed i should have thought the obvious intention of whoever is responsible for the avenue is to replace it by planting another of the same species <e> <s> however if your lordships think it is necessary to include avenues after wooded areas we can do so at the report stage <e> <s> meanwhile i should have thought that the clause as it stands would be satisfactory <e>", "<cs> may i point out to the noble and learned lord that thinning is not the same thing as slimming <e> <s> he may have got the two mixed up <e> <s> i should have thought that in the circumstances thinning would be an obvious word to anyone responsible for wooded lands <e>", "<cs> again i think it is merely a matter of choice <e> <s> i chose the area of one acre simply to ensure that the provision referred to major engineering works such as the noble lord referred to road building or something like that <e> <s> i do not think that just clearing a small area should be included <e>", "<cs> my lords i can quite see the difficulties in these words <e>

<e> <s> i must point out to the noble lord however that it is perfectly possible to tell the age of a tree by counting the years shoots on a branch without cutting it down <e> <s> however i think that this is a much better way and i imagine that before very long we shall all know what a metre is i think that it is something like a yard <e> <s> in any case we shall soon get used to it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that i am far too ignorant about generation and regeneration to be able to do that with any authority <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said that very few pensioners pay tax but i am wondering what is his definition of the word pensioner <e> <s> all of us who receive an old age pension are pensioners <e> <s> those who have retired from their job

the tube trains should not include a luggage van <e>", "<cs> i should like to agree with the noble lord lord morris <e> <s> no doubt not long ago many of your lordships saw on television the film about the late duke of windsor <e> <s> it was a good film and it was well done but i could not help feeling slightly uncomfortable during the whole of it because of what i imagined would be the feelings of those surviving members of the royal family who knew him if they happened to see the film <e> <s> that can happen in many cases <e> <s> there will be survivors who will perhaps feel hurt or even if the facts are false annoyed by what is being done <e> <s> we should not need to worry about restrictions on the bbc for their various productions if one could feel quite certain that they would use a very good sense of discretion as to what they produced and what they did not <e> <s> but unfortunately as we have seen on so many occasions they do not use that sense of discretion <e> <s> therefore i think that this restriction and ability to complain about what they have done is a good thing <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord consider it right that any public service that has a monopoly over its service should have the legal right in the light of consumer interest to forbid other services to encroach upon it <e>", "<cs> i feel very much inclined to support what was said by the noble lord lord donaldson of kings-bridge although of course i accept to a degree the remarks of the noble lord lord strabolgi <e> <s> however i think it most important that any advertisements

only about three occasions on which amendments moved by the opposition have been accepted by the government of the day <e> <s> i sincerely hope that on this occasion the noble earl will forget his party principles and give the amendment the support it deserves <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that while many of us in this country entirely support the governments policy on the

insert words such as <e>", "<cs> my lords could the noble viscount say whether there is any hope that if the proceedings of the house are broadcast those noble lords who make speeches will be paid

would use the existing network or would they themselves have to construct an entirely new network over the whole country <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been a most interesting debate and i am very grateful indeed to my noble friend for having introduced it <e> <s> in forming any transport policy one must of course take all forms of transport into consideration road rail waterway air and sea always being careful to apportion to each particular form the traffic which is most suited to it <e> <s> let me say from the beginning that i entirely agree with the noble lord lord lucas that road transport and rail transport are dependent one upon the other <e> <s> but what he meant i think was that rail transport is dependent on road transport <e> <s> i would point out to him that the way he put it also means that road transport is dependent on rail transport which i personally think it is <e> <s> for long distances there can be no doubt that rail transport is far and away the best and what is more the most economical since it is a scientific fact that steel wheels on steel rails giving a minimum of friction are the least consuming of energy <e>", "<cs> my lords is there no such thing as co-operation left <e> <s> i should have thought the two could get together and form a perfectly good policy <e>", "<cs> my lords could i ask the noble earl whether when talking in sums of

lords pardon i was of course referring to the noble lord lord kilbracken <e> <s> the whole purpose of introducing the bill was to stem the gradual decline in the number of hardwood trees which in normal circumstances would not be replanted by local authorities because they are so slow growing and naturally they wish to see a fairly rapid return on their work <e> <s> as a result it is practically impossible for the average person to get hardwood i expect it is more available for professional users and of course trees such as the oak ash and beech are such a typical feature of the english countryside that they should be preserved <e> <s> i have reinserted words so that if a tree of that variety is destroyed a tree of similar species will appear in due course <e> <s> the only other alteration to the bill is the insertion of clause which i think is the nearest one can get to a penal clause <e> <s> i have had legal advice on this and i believe that as it stands it will prove strong enough <e> <s> it is not absolute but it should prove strong enough to make the average local authority respect it <e> <s> there is little else to say except that i hope your lordships will give the bill a second reading and that it will not be too mutilated in committee <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all those who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i must confess that some noble lords do not seem to have read the bill thoroughly <e> <s> the noble lord lord birkett raised the point that if you plant an avenue and had to plant the trees close together once they had grown the trees in between would have to be chopped down <e> <s> but what about clause <e> <s> it says <e>", "<cs> i think that is making it over-difficult <e> <s> it could be so defined that any wooded area is an area <e>", "<cs> it may be stretching the point a little bit far but may i ask the noble earl what is the legal definition of dwelling-house <e> <s> surely a stable is a dwelling-house for horses <e>", "<cs> i support the spirit behind the amendment because i must point out that one animal which has been looked upon as doing a great deal of harm to fisheries is the otter which is now nearing extinction <e> <s> i suppose that the kingfisher could also be included in that category <e> <s> so even if the amendment is not accepted as it stands i hope that there will be provided an alternative which will have more or less the same effect <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like to support this amendment <e> <s> living in a suburban area as i do

hedge cutters electric car washers and polishers power drills of which i must confess ownership and many others <e> <s> electricity is used for anything in order to save making a little effort yourself <e> <s> of course electric mowers also use a considerable amount of energy <e> <s> therefore i think that an amendment certainly similar to the one proposed if not exactly the same is by all means necessary <e>", "<cs> having listened to the arguments i am not sure that the bill as it stands is satisfactory <e> <s> who is to know which the appropriate authority is <e> <s> i should be hard put to judge myself <e> <s> but i understand the objection to the nature conservancy council being the licence-granting authority <e> <s> it should be the ministry of agriculture in consultation with the nature conservancy council <e>", "<cs> perhaps i could just say how very much i agree with what was said by the noble lord lord melchett and by other noble lords <e> <s> this whole bill is not a party affair and perhaps i could remind the noble earl of that and of the fact that it really should not be a matter of religious conviction to refuse every proposed amendment to this bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that the house do now resolve itself into committee on this bill <e>", "<cs> i am not prepared to withdraw this amendment because i must point out to the noble lord lord skelmersdale that there is an amendment later which withdraws the clause which forces local authorities to take any action at all <e> <s> that clause was introduced merely because i felt that unenforceable law was undesirable and that was the nearest i could get to what was needed <e> <s> but i am about to withdraw that <e> <s> as regards forcing local authorities to have a narrow choice they really have quite a wide choice in this schedule and if we are to preserve the hardwood trees and the slow growing trees i cannot see any other way of doing it <e>", "<cs> i had a great deal of heart-searching over this clause and thought of various ways in which it might be possible to make this bill enforceable but there has been so much opposition to this particular clause owing to the fact that it would mean a lot of extra paperwork and a certain amount of bureaucracy that i decided in the end to withdraw it and to leave the bill to the judgment of local authorities which i think on the whole is very sound <e> <s> therefore i think that clause should be left out <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble earl for one moment <e> <s> would he agree that one of the great problems on the rare occasions when one can buy english hardwood is that it is only half seasoned <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to differ from the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby but i am inclined to support the amendment <e> <s> the noble lord says that the bill deals with the recipients of animals <e> <s> to take that a little further presumably it deals with the kind of home that they are going to have and certainly animals which are offered as prizes in lotteries are in cases out of a hundred going to get extremely poor homes <e> <s> therefore i cannot see that an amendment such as this would be is out of place in a bill such as this and i hope personally that the committee will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the police have a very difficult job to do and that they do it superbly well <e>", "<cs> my lords i fail to understand the noble earl lord onslow when he says that we are making too much fuss over this <e> <s> if it is wrong to do a certain

he was going to make the remarks he did <e> <s> as for the presence of the schedule i reinserted it on official advice <e> <s> the noble lord must realise that it narrows the application of the measure without it the regulations contained in the bill would apply to every tree in a local authoritys area <e> <s> as it is they are not forced to do anything about trees except those contained in the schedule <e> <s> as for the nature of the schedule the main object of the bill in the first place was to preserve hardwood slow growing trees of which local authorities would not be likely to plant many because they are so slow growing they would never see the result <e> <s> they are much more likely to plant trees which will reach a reasonable maturity within a few years <e> <s> further hardwood is practically impossible to obtain in this country today so it is high time we saw to it that the supply of hardwood does not shrink any further <e> <s> those were the two main objects of the bill and i must tell the noble lord that the wild cherry in which i have recently been working is very hard <e>", "<cs> my lords the silver birch is a much faster growing tree but its wood is widely used and i should have thought it was not one that was likely <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg to move that this bill do now pass <e> <s> i wish at this stage to record my grateful thanks to all

possesses a modicum of common <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for one moment when he speaks of defending the liberty of the individual does he include in that the liberty to

wholeheartedly with the noble lords motion i should like to raise one query <e>", "<cs> my lords i agree with the government amendment with reservations but i should like to ask whether once a day is really sufficient <e> <s> it is possible after all for an animal to be caught in a snare early in the morning perhaps at four or five oclock and to have to remain there until probably six oclock in the evening <e> <s> it was once my misfortune to find a rabbit in a snare <e> <s> it had been caught round the neck and by the time i got there the snare had sunk well into its neck and the animal was absolutely in its last stages <e> <s> personally i think the snare is every bit as inhumane as the gin trap and i wish that we had had <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the sale of lands end be the beginning of britains end <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this bill with certain reservations because i feel that it will do a definite job in reducing litter which is one of the greatest evils in our country <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble baroness lady birk is not here and i hope that she will forgive me i am sure that she will if i quote what she said <e> <s> when the noble baroness said that we are an extremely untidy and litter-producing nation i thought that she was making a great understatement <e> <s> when we get into public places i would describe us as a downright filthy and disgusting nation <e> <s> the revolting amount of litter that one sees in public places nowadays is gradually becoming almost unbearable and i think that possibly this has chiefly been the case since children have ceased to be taught that tidiness is a virtue that of course is unfashionable nowadays <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that the increase in cost would be the charge on the container which would be returned when the container was returned <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble lord whether due attention has been given to the fact that very heavy lorries are liable to cause damage not only to the roads but perhaps to the valuable architecture by the side of the roads <e> <s> in view of that fact would it not be possible to prohibit lorries in the highest weight range from using roads alongside which there is such architecture <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a very short and simple bill but i feel a very necessary one <e> <s> the noble lord lord hooson questions whether it is necessary <e> <s> i take exactly the opposite view <e> <s> it has become necessary as we heard from the noble lord lord houghton because of changing circumstances <e> <s> the export of these ritually-slaughtered animals has increased enormously and i do not think that it is right that animals that have been slaughtered by after all a method which we allow only on tolerance should be exported for the sake of money-making <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord would wish to make it clear that that method is now entirely outlawed in this country <e>", "<cs> if i may i would add a word from these benches <e> <s> i support this amendment for one reason <e> <s> i think it is important to draw a line between processions of the bodies mentioned by the noble viscount lord thurso such as the boys brigade the boy scouts and the salvation army from other processions in that they are not campaigning processions they are not carrying banners saying away with the house of lords <e> <s> or down with the chancellor of the exchequer or something like that <e> <s> i suppose that you might say that the salvation army is campaigning for increased interest in christianity <e> <s> if that is the case more power to their elbow but apart from that they are not politically campaigning in any sense of the word and therefore they should be given credence <e>", "<cs> my lords one point arises from what the noble earl has said <e> <s> would he not agree that the better use of the site as he said is rather a matter of opinion <e> <s> for instance there is a particular case in my own town of a site where a cinema was demolished and is about to be replaced by a supermarket <e> <s> no doubt a supermarket would bring more money into the council but on the other hand it has deprived the people of the town of a good deal of entertainment unless you consider going round a supermarket as entertainment which i personally do not <e> <s> therefore it is a matter of opinion <e> <s> there are many cases that i could quote where buildings have been demolished and which have been a great loss to many <e>", "<cs> i should like to follow the noble earl who has just sat down by supporting this amendment very strongly <e> <s> whether the government choose to accept it as it stands or whether they are going forward on their own line i feel that some amendment of this kind is very necessary although i agree that the necessity for it hangs on whether or not you consider <e>", "<cs> may i interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> would he also consider the constant efforts of noble lords ageing noble lords perhaps in this house myself included to abolish cruelty to animals a bad thing <e>", "<cs> may i ask the noble lord lord houghton one question <e> <s> he said that he considers it unfair to put out of business a man who is just selling magazines of a certain character <e> <s> how about the man who sells pornographic material <e> <s> is it unfair to put him out of business <e>", "<cs> i consider that one feature of this bill which is regrettable not to say disgraceful is the fact that it has been prepared and is being rushed through parliament before any consultation whatsoever with the indians themselves <e> <s> from a government who have made so much fuss about the rights of indigenous peoples particularly in africa as we have seen sometimes with regrettable results i believe this is a shocking example of complete insincerity <e> <s> i believe it is likely to lead to serious trouble in canada <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> is he suggesting those with personal experience <e>", "<cs> a great deal has been said about the matter of making compromises <e> <s> i think that we must all realise that some compromises are absolutely inescapable <e> <s> if one lives alone or without any domestic <e>", "<cs> my lords i too am extremely grateful to my noble friend lord lloyd for having introduced this debate because it is a subject that is not debated very often in your lordships house and it is one that rightly needs discussion <e> <s> the noble lord referred to copyright law as being a nightmare when you try to understand it <e> <s> i sat on the copyright council for a time and i must say that at the end of that time i was completely at sea regarding certain aspects of it <e> <s> nonetheless we must do our best as everybody has said during the debate to protect the rights of those who produce creative work <e> <s> i suppose that i must declare an interest here in that i now have one published work i had a few more at one <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how very much i appreciate this scheme which provides for authors a parallel to the performing right scheme which composers have enjoyed for so long <e> <s> i should like to ask the noble earl one question <e> <s> what will be the position for translators of foreign books <e> <s> i should declare an interest herein that i am in the process of making one myself <e> <s> will the right have to be divided between the translator and the author or what will be the position <e>", "<cs> my lords every noble lord interested in the arts will be grateful to the noble lord lord strabolgi for having asked this unstarred question <e> <s> i am sorry that more have not demonstrated their gratitude by being here in the chamber <e> <s> unfortunately that is the fate of those who ask unstarred questions <e> <s> they generally have to face an empty chamber <e>", "<cs> my lords has the government any information as to whether the main source of water in botswana could be expanded <e>", "<cs> i dislike nationalisation for its own sake as much as anybody but there can be no doubt that in certain cases it is the only workable system <e> <s> the post office for example has been a nationalised industry since the day of its inception <e> <s> can anybody imagine the post office chopped up into various individual enterprises <e>", "<cs> i am old enough to remember the days when electricity was in the hands of local authorities and i certainly would not like to go back to the days when there was no uniformity <e> <s> some current was ac and some current was dc voltages were different and there was no standardisation of fittings <e> <s> there is no doubt that in some cases nationalisation is the most efficient thing <e> <s> however much one may dislike it one should not be blinded to the fact that sometimes it is the best thing <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to congratulate the right reverend prelate on a magnificent maiden speech <e> <s> i was relieved to hear that practically everything he said confirmed what i have believed for many years only he said it in a far more efficient and easy to understand way <e> <s> i was particularly glad when he emphasised the importance of recognising the difference between good and bad something which seems to escape the notice of so many psychological reformers these days <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a fairly widespread feeling that if one tries to control what one definitely knows is a wrong activity there is a great danger that one is merely driving it underground and that it will proceed as usual <e> <s> is that not true of every single wrong activity that one knows of <e> <s> if one feels that an activity is a wrong one and i cannot think that there is a single member of your lordships house who does not realise that the activities that this amendment is trying to control are indeed very wrong then surely it is right that the law should try to control it even though one may feel that perhaps the law as is unfortunately so often the case in many walks of life may not have the desired effect <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord replies can he tell me whether there is anything in the bill i confess that i have not read it through very thoroughly to control the kind of gas that is supplied by an independent concern <e> <s> for instance it would be impossible to mix within the same main coal gas and north sea gas <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord will tell me about that <e>", "<cs> there is one difficulty <e> <s> at the moment gas in a main has to be at a given pressure which has to be maintained because that governs the pressure at which it is consumed at the users point <e> <s> supposing another firm comes along and wishes to introduce more gas its own gas into that same main either the gas corporation has to reduce its own gas so as to lower the pressure in order to admit the other or else the pressure is going to be in the main too high <e> <s> what is the solution <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord but that still does not explain one thing <e> <s> if a private gasworks is going to supply gas into the existing main at that pressure that means that somehow or other the pressure from the original gasworks will have to be slightly reduced otherwise the gas will not be able to get in <e>", "<cs> i apologise for getting to my feet so often but there is one point i must raise here <e> <s> when the noble lord spoke before he said that this was going to introduce an element of competition <e> <s> i admit of course that in some cases competition is excellent <e> <s> if there is competition between say one newsagent and another it is very likely that it will bring the service of one or the other up to a very much higher level <e> <s> but there will be no competition whatsoever here because the gas from the bgc and the gas from the independent supplier will be mixed together in the one main <e> <s> the consumer will have no idea which gas he is using <e> <s> he will not be able to say so and sos gas is much better than this <e> <s> the result will be no competition whatsoever <e> <s> i cannot see that that element will have anything to do with raising the standard of the bgc or of the independent companies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add one or two words of support from these benches <e> <s> it is only too easy to find economic or political reasons for avoiding doing that which is absolutely morally essential and i sincerely hope that the government will think very deeply over this amendment and will not fall into the trap of just taking the easy political way <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name on the list of speakers but i promise not to delay the house for long <e> <s> i wish simply to comment on the old three-wheeler car with which we are all familiar <e> <s> i hope the ministry of transport will see that that vehicle is gradually phased out and is replaced by a four-wheeler <e> <s> there is no mechanical reason why the car should not be completely similar except that it has two wheels in front instead of one <e> <s> there is no doubt that on a slippery surface one wheel particularly when it is the steering wheel is not very safe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not i am afraid a fully trained politician but the noble lord when he began his reply said that this amendment was in line with the governments own intentions of making the concern a fully commercial one <e> <s> can the noble lord explain what is the basis of their unwillingness to write their own intentions into the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl replies i wonder whether i may ask him to make one point clear <e> <s> would it be possible for the words by or under any enactment to be interpreted as referring to any future enactment or is that merely imaginary on my part <e>", "<cs> my lords i find a great deal in this bill which is very interesting although not all of it is very acceptable <e> <s> i am going to deal with one particular part of the subject and that is parking which has just been spoken of by the noble baroness lady gardner <e> <s> parking has been a little exaggerated in importance so far as motoring offences are concerned <e> <s> it is nothing like as bad as dangerous driving or even exceeding the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness is quite right <e> <s> i happen to be one of those who are entirely innocent in her eyes because i travel by train every day <e> <s> but there is no doubt that for a lot of people travel is rather awkward particularly if they live some way from a railway station <e> <s> the noble baroness talks about buses <e> <s> but the buses simply are not there <e>", "<cs> my lords from these benches i should like to support this amendment and to remind the government that being mentally ill is not in itself a crime <e> <s> no doubt they will remember that for some years now we have recognised that fact in that we refer to those who are mentally unsound as the mentally ill and not as lunatics as we used to <e> <s> i do hope therefore that this amendment will be allowed <e>", "<cs> i hate to oppose my noble friend but at a time such as this when conditions in ireland are extremely uncertain it would be very unwise to remove the disqualification <e> <s> after all we do not allow non-british citizens to sit in parliament <e> <s> i cannot see why it should be necessary to allow non-irish citizens to sit in the irish parliament <e> <s> in view of the extremely disruptive elements that there are in both ireland and i regret to say our own country what is proposed would be a very unwise step <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to ask him one question <e> <s> he said that these matters are best dealt with by persuasion and i am inclined to agree with what he said about the undesirability of very rigid legislation <e> <s> but can he tell me how this persuasion will be put across who will do it and what proportion of business magnates he thinks is likely to respond to it <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that when you reach the age of you pass the stage where general education is necessary and that from then on it is much more specialist education to suit the career which you are going to follow and that therefore being the case it will be a pity to have completely unselected education from to years of age at the expense of those who perhaps need it <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support these regulations although i admit to having had in the past some rather mixed feelings about them <e> <s> however i am sure that if the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say a word about this amendment i am in favour of it <e> <s> far be it for me to say anything against the police which in my <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support very strongly what the noble lord lord lucas of chilworth has just said although i shall not be able to do so as ably as he has <e> <s> one has only to think of the number of statutory speed limits which there are thoughout the country <e> <s> some are entirely justifiable <e> <s> those in built-up areas are absolutely justifiable <e> <s> those in semi-built-up areas are generally raised to miles per hour but they are still justifiable <e> <s> but there are many which are entirely unjustifiable and are there simply because the local borough council has chosen to erect lamp posts along the road <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord for a moment i agree with him of course that it is most important to get rid of racial prejudice but when he uses that term does he mean racial prejudice in both directions <e> <s> in other words does he mean racial prejudice not only on the part of white people against the coloured but on the part of coloured people against the white <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that it is very misleading to give the number of black unemployed without at the same time giving the number of white unemployed which i should suggest is quite comparable <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to give the house some assurance that no changes will be made in branch lines or at any rate the majority of branch lines until we have had a full-scale debate to examine the possibility of the use of these lines by private enterprise <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord polwarth has done a tremendous service to the arts by introducing this debate today <e> <s> this subject is not one which is usually given a great deal of time in your lordships house but to those of us who are connected with the arts it is a tremendously important one <e> <s> i should also like to join other noble lords in congratulating the noble lord lord marley on his maiden speech <e> <s> i can remember that when i made mine a good many years ago i too had waited for several years before doing so <e> <s> the only difference is that i think his has been much better <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for a moment <e> <s> i hardly think that such a bill as this is a party matter or even that party politics should be referred to <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister give even a rough estimate of how many fires during the past year have been caused by faulty wiring <e>", "<cs> i agree entirely with the noble baroness that a means-test is thoroughly undesirable <e> <s> it is degrading and an absolutely unnecessary invasion into a persons privacy <e> <s> as the bill stands a means-test is not specifically called for <e> <s> i presume that there is every likelihood that it would take place but it is not absolutely defined as being necessary <e> <s> would it not be possible to insert words to the effect that a means-test is not implied or is not to be used <e> <s> surely if a local authority cannot decide for themselves whether a person is or is not wealthy enough to pay then they have not sufficient intelligence to be occupying their position <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that amendment no <e> <s> was agreed to and two subsections of this amendment end with the words having regard to his means would the government consider deleting those words <e> <s> without them we would simply have as they consider reasonable which seems to me entirely satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the least efficient forms of industry are with a few exceptions the large monopolies whether private or public <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the least efficient forms of industry are the large monopolies whether they be privately or publicly owned <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl tell me whether it would be possible to divide the listed buildings into two classes a class a and a class b class a being those which would be worthy of aid and class b not <e>", "<cs> my lords i also thank the noble lord for repeating the statement <e> <s> may i ask him whether he has noted that i have at present a no day named motion about the future of the railways <e> <s> if the noble lord thinks that it would be better to wait until the government debate takes place i shall gladly withdraw my motion <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us how soon it will be possible for scientific research to have been carried forward so that people no longer need to use their brains <e>", "<cs> my lords i appreciate the difficulties of the noble lord lord st just as i used to live not far from where he does <e> <s> much has been said during this debate on the question of conservation but i should just like to make one point <e> <s> what could add more to the landscape than a beautifully ploughed field or a lovely field of wheat <e> <s> one forgets that a farm in itself can be a very beautiful thing <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may add a word as an entirely non-professional man may i say that it is not only in the medical profession but in any profession that the opinion of two is better than one <e> <s> in fact i am not sure that three would not be better still because you would then have the weight of opinion in one direction or the other <e> <s> but two is certainly better than one <e> <s> in any profession and most certainly in medicine <e>", "<cs> this is purely incidental but i cannot find anywhere in this bill where it is defined who the secretary of state is <e> <s> we all assume that it is the home secretary but as i have not discovered where this is defined in the bill perhaps the noble lord will be kind enough to tell me <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that in view of recent events in australia this is not merely a football problem but unfortunately it also extends to cricket <e>", "<cs> with the greatest respect may i suggest to the noble lord lord mishcon that the minister of state has also been democratically elected <e>", "<cs> my lords it is the custom in your lordships house when one follows a maiden speaker to give him all the usual congratulations and one is never absolutely certain of course with what sincerity one does so but in this case i can say that i do congratulate the noble lord lord ezra from my whole heart and say that i only hope as i am sure your lordships feel that we shall hear him many times particularly on the subject of railways and transport when it arises <e>", "<cs> i am no lawyer but an essential quality is justice as the noble lord lord mishcon has said <e> <s> the secretary of state lays down a limit above which the local transport authority may not go in expenditure <e> <s> he then forces the authority to have this inquiry which is going to cost a good deal of money and which will force the authority to go beyond the limit which he has already set <e> <s> is that justice <e>", "<cs> my lords i too most certainly hope that the house will accept the bill and give it a second reading <e> <s> i congratulate the noble lord lord houghton of sowerby on his persistence in trying to get the bill through the house <e> <s> i doubt whether i should myself have had quite so much but he has certainly shown great persistence which i hope will reap its due reward this afternoon <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand entirely the noble lords argument that expensive crossings such as this should be paid for by the user rather than by the ratepayer but does that not also apply to motorways everywhere <e> <s> they are not built for nothing <e> <s> should not a toll be charged for using motorways <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he give an english translation of millimetres <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that this is a very desirable amendment and i hope that the noble earl will not withdraw it <e> <s> although the present situation may be quite favourable towards wildlife and conservation this bill is to apply to many further generations or at least we hope so and they may not be so favourably disposed towards it <e> <s> therefore it is important that this provision should be written into the bill <e>", "<cs> i am no expert on this subject my lords but i find it difficult to understand why an approach to it which is what the noble lord lord campbell described as a piecemeal approach would necessarily be ineffective <e> <s> surely if one adopts a policy of that sort in one part of industry and the results are proved to be successful other parts of industry will be all the more willing to adopt it <e> <s> i should have thought that as an experiment it would be a good thing <e>", "<cs> i am no scientist and therefore i cannot speak with any authority on the question of nuclear power stations <e> <s> i wish that my noble friend lord halsbury were here because he speaks with authority on this question and he has assured the house more than once that it is perfectly safe <e> <s> there is one point which comes to my mind <e> <s> it is that we have very little else in the way of natural sources of power <e> <s> switzerland for instance has all the hydro-electric possibilities that it could want <e> <s> we have practically none <e> <s> if we do not adopt nuclear power stations i am wondering from where we are going to get our power <e>", "<cs> i should like to oppose this clause with all the strength that i have <e> <s> i do so because i feel it to be totally unjust <e> <s> the government seem to have a habit of taking a principle which they feel is desirable in some cases and in many cases it is and then <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to oppose the amendment in spirit but i wonder whether the noble earl would say in his reply whether there is any provision for generation at the correct voltage in other words that it should be ac and not dc <e> <s> also can he say whether the electricity so generated will be supplied to the national grid <e>", "<cs> i should like to say how very much i support the noble baronesss amendment <e> <s> it has been mentioned that female circumcision might be carried out for cultural or religious reasons but when one comes to live in a country which is not ones own one must first assume that one is going to obey the law of that land <e> <s> although we make very great allowances so far as religious and cultural practices are concerned i do not think that in a case such as this that point should be taken into consideration <e> <s> so far as the overcrowding of prisons is concerned i quite agree that that must be considered but on the other hand the offence will not involve very large numbers and so i do not think that that consideration should stand in the way <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord for a moment <e> <s> i do not think that to make two mistakes since is a bad record <e> <s> i wonder how that compares with the number of mistakes made in the other place <e>", "<cs> my lords having been a member of the teaching profession may i ask whether the noble earl would not agree with me that there are teachers and teachers <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by asking your lordships to forgive me if i have to leave before the end of the debate the excuse is the usual one i have to get home <e> <s> this has been a most interesting debate and there is no doubt

says that there has been general agreement that this would be a desirable change <e> <s> i wonder whether <e>", "<cs> my lords i merely asked whether the general agreement which the noble lord mentioned on the desirability of this change was chiefly that of women not of men <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a little strange that the government of this country which is nominally at least still a christian country should totally reject the practically unanimous view of synod <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness agree i am sure she will not that the whole of the british nationality act is very misconceived indeed in that it refuses british nationality to those who are obviously of british descent simply on the grounds that they happen not to have been born on british soil <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the large number of catastrophes that we have had with oil vessels implies that on the whole tankers tend to be rather too large and therefore not easily manageable at sea <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking as one who is wholly dependent on his glasses may i ask whether the noble lord can give us some assurance that this will not mean that we shall get second-hand lenses <e> <s> the noble lord must know that cutting a lens is a highly expert job <e> <s> i hope this will not mean that we shall be getting lenses that are not suited to us <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for speaking when i have not put my name on the list of speakers but quite frankly i thought that on a bill such as this the list would be so long that i would never have a chance of finding a place <e> <s> it seems to me a great pity that words such as free enterprise and competition which in their own right are excellent and very valuable words should have become mere political catch words and that is what they have become <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that there would be nothing in the way of retrospective legislation in ordering the fitting of

him <e> <s> with regard to his anxieties about sewage has he never been to the sewage disposal station near tilbury <e> <s> i am sure such a visit would dispose of his worries <e>", "<cs> one difficulty about this amendment although i am entirely in agreement with the spirit of it is the immense difference in the various areas of the entertainment industry <e> <s> there is music the theatre ballet and endless other forms of entertainment <e> <s> who on earth are you going to find with a really inside knowledge of the whole lot <e> <s> it is practically impossible <e> <s> you

in which the birds are allowed to remain in a crate <e>", "<cs> my lords might i interrupt the noble lord for one moment <e> <s> i am always astonished at the reluctance of certain people to prevent the criminal from going his own happy way <e> <s> how about the law-abiding person <e> <s> are his rights of liberty to be sacrificed because the criminal must have his way <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord not agree that the majority of the noise from heavy lorries is not exhaust noise but purely mechanical noise from the engine <e>", "<cs> we have had a good deal of conversation on what

logical will not make the slightest difference to the character of the bill or to its nature or purpose <e> <s> i cannot see any reason at all why the government should refuse it except of course that it is not one of their own which i think is an extremely unhappy and unsatisfactory reason <e> <s> so i sincerely hope they will have second thoughts <e>", "<cs> i should have said that this was a very useful amendment because after all it is a mistake to try to divide education into two separate categories one public and one private <e> <s> education is education <e> <s> it spreads over the entire population and i should have thought that many other bodies besides the local education authorities would have useful things to contribute <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether what i have to say

not a superman so i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i hope the noble lord when he replies will give some sort of assurance that this desire for competition which to the government seems a sort of magic that is a cure for all evils will not be pressed at the expense of service to the individual subscriber <e> <s> that is after all the main object of the bill and i hope that this idea of competition will not interfere with it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i have no technical knowledge of telephony but i must say that i find it extremely difficult to understand how one will get competition in a system which is entirely automatic as we now have in this country <e> <s> i am not talking of business firms or anything like that but of the ordinary private subscriber <e> <s> when

keying nine you can connect yourself to the main circuit outside <e> <s> it would lose a great deal of its usefulness if one could not do that <e> <s> surely the element of competition would also be reduced a great deal <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble and learned lord hut before withdrawing my amendment may i point out that he referred several times to the secretary of state <e> <s> i

points he has put forward which i found most convincing <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot help feeling that the noble lord lord lyell missed out the one essential point in the amendment and i am not sure that it was even mentioned by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> it is that there must be a single central authority for the allocation of numbers <e> <s>

would want to do is to irritate a minister and so i still beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must confess that when i looked through this list of amendments i felt a sense of surprise that there seem to be so many in your lordships committee who are anxious to preserve the rights and the comforts of the wrongdoer and who in doing so completely forget those of the law-abiding and innocent man <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> i can certainly confirm what the noble lord lord jenkins has just said about the quality of our broadcasting as compared with that in other countries <e> <s> we have had to stay with us many friends from both australia and america and without exception they have all said that our broadcasting is of a higher level than anything else they have come across <e>", "<cs> my lords so many attempts have been made to eliminate this pestilential nuisance without a great deal of success <e> <s> does the noble and learned lord think that something really drastic could be done in the way of threatening should there be another outbreak to ban all professional football matches for the space of one year <e>", "<cs> without wishing to make a nuisance of myself may i suggest that it would be possible in the list of definitions at the end of the bill to say that prisoner includes possibly mental health patients or otherwise <e> <s> no doubt the noble lord can think of appropriate wording <e>", "<cs> i cannot see anywhere in the bill where the secretary of state is defined <e> <s> i presume that it is the home secretary but i wonder whether it ought to be put down in black and white in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord consider that there is room for a slight tightening of the legislation on this subject for instance in the actual number of experiments <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one other point that needs to be emphasised <e> <s> although it is true that amendments have been made to clause which provides for advisory bodies those bodies are <e>", "<cs> my lords i hesitate to differ from my noble friend lady mar but i think that an instance such as she suggested could be described legally as undue discrimination <e> <s> i cannot see a situation like that occurring without legal protest <e> <s> i think that what the noble lord lord cockfield has said about maintaining the word discrimination simply for purely hypothetical purposes is quite correct <e> <s> this amendment so far as i see it is perfectly satisfactory <e>", "<cs> my lords i quite agree with the noble and learned lord that there are certain services where strike action should be avoided if possible <e> <s> i think for example of nursing <e> <s> would the noble and learned lord explain one thing which might put at rest the minds of those who are pressing for the amendment <e> <s> supposing that there was a widespread feeling of grievance among telephone workers about some conditions of their employment what would be their possible course of action to persuade their employers that their case was a valid one <e>", "<cs> my lords your lordships will realise that i am in no position to speak on behalf of my noble friends on these benches <e> <s> we have the rare privilege in parliament of speaking for ourselves and voicing our own personal opinions <e> <s> that has one disadvantage of course in that we are bound to think for ourselves but that i think is probably quite a good exercise <e>", "<cs> my lords i must confess that i found the ministers explanation a little confusing <e>

agriculture and that we are becoming dangerously short of wooded land <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be possible for those who are forced to have a repeat prescription say once a month or thereabouts not to have to pay the same prescription charge each time <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that while as the noble lord says many local governments will do their best in situations like this local governments after all are masters in their own house and there are some local governments who might be very unwilling to pay any attention to circumstances like these and also there will be many of the poorer tenants who do not know anything about what rights they have got <e> <s> how are they going to find out <e>", "<cs> my lords is it true as i have been told that only about two out

however the reputation of our country has already been damaged abroad by the activities of the football hooligans and others and it seems to me a great pity that we should allow it to be further damaged by the export of the sort of material we are considering today <e>", "<cs> it was rather strange to hear the noble lord using the word obnoxious <e> <s> i should have used that word to describe the situation that he wishes to <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble baroness whether she has heard of a case of which i know where the patient had her operation last year after waiting six years <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord whether there is any truth in the account printed in one of our daily newspapers that the libyan authorities themselves have stated that they can name the person who committed this murder <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble earl for a moment will he not admit that in the centre of london at any rate punctuality is practically impossible because no bus driver can say to what extent he will be held up by traffic lights traffic jams or goodness knows what <e>", "<cs> my lords i just want to raise a passing point which has not yet been mentioned and it is as follows <e> <s> one matter which has not been thought of by many councils is that when one reaches old age and i point out to the noble baroness lady denington that i am not in the least ashamed of that one needs transport of some kind or other <e> <s> one must be mobile <e> <s> even when one reaches my age one still wants to go shopping and one will probably want to be near a station particularly if one happens to be a member of your lordships house <e> <s> therefore i think that that is a matter which councils should take into consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords is not one of the difficulties that miners have not only their jobs but their homes and their families on the spot <e> <s> are any measures being taken to provide for them as well <e>", "<cs> in view of the uncertainty that is in many peoples minds at the moment i wonder whether the noble earl is in any position to say whether if the glc were to be abolished it would be replaced by some overall organisation which would cover the whole of greater london <e> <s> that is something which many people feel would be necessary and the noble earl might possibly relieve their anxiety <e>", "<cs> will not this clause give london regional transport totalitarian control over the entire operation <e> <s> the borough councils know most intimately what their needs are <e> <s> the amendment does not require the consent of the boroughs to be obtained before any changes are made it merely suggests that there should be consultation <e> <s> i should have thought that a suitable rapport between the boroughs and lrt is very much to be desired <e>", "<cs> may i ask my noble friend lord monson whether he has ever seen an act of parliament which has not banned something <e>", "<cs> my lords is it possible to have rather more efficient and urgent teaching in the schools to warn young people of the danger of taking drugs <e>", "<cs> while i am in favour of all the amendments which have been moved for concessionary fares it may be partly in the light of self-interest as i am one of those people who are kindly known as being of pensionable age <e> <s> none the less i feel that one of the great difficulties in a place such as london is that if one leaves this matter to the boroughs there will be a lack of uniformity <e> <s> one will never have all the boroughs agreeing to a single plan <e> <s> it is as much as they can do to agree among themselves <e> <s> one will never achieve a uniform plan throughout the whole of london <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry i shall not keep the noble lord lord bellwin for more than one moment <e> <s> i am no financial expert but surely is not the logic of the amendment just this <e> <s> local authorities will have to pay for the various services that the charitable organisations are providing <e> <s> they will have to pay for most of them because most of them are essential to a civilised society and they will have to pay a great deal more than they would be giving in the way of a grant <e> <s> i think that that should surely settle the anxieties of my noble friend lord marsh as to the logic of the thing <e> <s> if you are paying less than you would otherwise then you are saving <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the attitude of the noble lord lord bellwin that he does not want to interfere with local government decisions

the probation service represents the law of the land and surely that is something that overrides local borders altogether <e> <s> i should have said that in this particular instance there is something that local government opinions or decisions should not be allowed to influence <e> <s> i hope that the government will decide to accept the amendment <e>", "<cs> had given notice of his intention to move amendment no <e>", "<cs> my lords i support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i think that possibly some of us who are perfectly able to transport ourselves from one place to another are a

local authorities upon which this is being imposed it is upon the regional transport authority itself <e> <s> for instance i hardly think that the noble lord would think it appropriate when one takes a journey from london to cornwall to have different fares for each county through which the line passes <e> <s> the same applies in a smaller way here <e> <s> it is the single fare charged by the transport organisation <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not take up much more of your lordships time but i should like to ask the noble lord one point about enforcement <e> <s> i wholeheartedly welcome the clause as a whole <e> <s> especially with one-man buses becoming more and more usual on bus journeys the driver can see that you do not get on the bus without paying something at least but how on earth is he to check that you do not go further than the distance you have paid for <e> <s> a single man cannot possibly be expected to keep a check on the distance that all his passengers go <e>", "<cs> my lords presumably there will not be one of those on every bus <e>", "<cs> my lords after what the noble lord lord northfield has said i hope that the government will not decide to try bringing competition into the medical profession or any other particularly specialised profession because it will not help them <e> <s> i have recently had a good deal to do with optical specialists as not long ago i had operations on both eyes for cataract <e> <s> therefore i have had to have fairly accurate fitting of glasses and i can tell your lordships that extreme expertise is needed to do it properly <e> <s> even the matter of fitting a frame is not merely a matter of grinding the lenses making sure that they are accurate and so on <e> <s> fitting the frame and making sure that it is in exactly the right position is a very expert job and i entirely agree with what was said by the noble lord lord ennals <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the government will not decide to bring in this irresponsible idea of competition just for its own sake <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment <e> <s> we have here surely one of the problems that invariably arise when one breaks up an organisation that has been responsible for certain activities and then expects that responsibility to be accepted without question by a whole group of smaller organisations which in fact may or may not accept it <e> <s> there is nothing to compel them to do so and therefore this is what happens <e> <s> one cannot expect matters to run as smoothly as they have in the past though i am not holding for a moment that the glc is without its sins as none of us is <e> <s> but in breaking up such an organisation one has to realise that somehow the various responsibilities which it has had have to be firmly fixed elsewhere so that those who are without any kind of defence will not suffer <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said something about specially advanced examinations <e> <s> i did not catch quite what he said <e> <s> will this take the place of the present a-level and will it be a separate exam <e>", "<cs> my lords i think we are all very much at one in that we agree that music or the arts are necessary for any civilised country <e> <s> the only question that seems to have arisen is whether the arts council is really administering what it has very wisely <e> <s> before i come to any criticism of the arts council let me say that it has an immensely difficult task <e> <s> it has a very small grant from the government and it has to divide that up somehow or other between the whole of the arts not merely music in some way that it feels is just and fair <e> <s> it is rather like the task that the late lord rutherford had in splitting the atom <e> <s> therefore if the arts council does make mistakes i think one can forgive it <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree that the presence of parents on governing bodies would be very much resented by teaching staff <e> <s> does he not also agree that the place where parents influence is most important is in the home with their own children not in trying to modify the school curriculum or anything like that about which they know absolutely nothing <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord one question <e> <s> i think the thing that most of us are anxious about is the possibility of the wrongdoer masquerading as a plain clothes policeman <e> <s> do the general public as a whole know what a search warrant looks like <e> <s> would it be possible for the wrongdoer to produce a forged one which the person he was searching did not recognise or had to take as being the official one <e>", "<cs> i wish to refer to amendment no <e> <s> which is the one which is technically before us and which has been described as a wrecking amendment <e> <s> i cannot see that it is anything of the sort <e> <s> i am not for a moment implying that the third option which will eventually be proposed by my noble friend lord halsbury is not a better one but to call this present amendment a wrecking amendment seems to me to be absolute nonsense <e> <s> all it is doing is seeking to delay the legislation until a suitable time when it will work harmoniously <e>", "<cs> in that case i can say only that the amount of wrecking which various governments must have done during the course of their existence must be very considerable <e>", "<cs> however i dare say that this amendment will disappear into nothingness eventually but i should not like it to go with that label attached to it <e>",

policeman is the man who has something to hide from the police <e> <s> i cannot understand this idea that if the police stop a motorist in their effort to combat crime which incidentally is growing to be a very serious matter in our society today it should give any offence at all <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord give the house any assurance that the government will not try any such remedy as privatising the post office <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has said that the objection is that the record may not be provided whether or not the occupier desires it <e> <s> if the amendment is put into context the subsection will read <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment of the noble lord lord cullen very strongly <e> <s> as has been said during our arguments on previous

benches i also should like to thank the noble lords on the front bench for the way they have manoeuvred this bill to its final close <e> <s> i feel that any criticisms which one might have of the bill

smoking <e> <s> would the noble lord agree that drug taking is a far more insidious disease and is likely to be a great deal more dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to oppose the amendment but i should like to make one point <e> <s> the noble lord lord tordoff quoted a passage from the instructions which said that noble lords are urged to use public transport whenever possible <e> <s> that would give rise to many difficulties <e> <s> if one lives some way from a railway station one has to make arrangements either to park or to garage ones car while one is in london and that is not always easy <e> <s> it is expensive and it may be next door to impossible <e> <s> when one gets here of course one has to get a taxi to the house and taxis are getting more and more expensive every

the noble lords question would the noble lord lord elton agree that in this particular case it was perhaps necessary to bring home to the public the true horror of the situation in order that it should be taken seriously <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that on this question not really a great deal can be done by legislation and that it is much more a question of education generally <e> <s> would he also agree that it would be a good thing if those who came to this country from abroad were a little more prepared to adopt our way of life and that all the effort cannot be made just on one side <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord observe that while the difficulties which have been set up by the ethiopian marxist government have now been largely overcome many of us

debate on this subject at some time <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord include in the word unemployment all those who are not working in other words those who are on strike who certainly cause a

some really strong assurance that gibraltar will not be offered a half solution such as self-determination but that we shall maintain our sovereignty since apart from the fact that the gibraltarians

lords would the noble lord not agree that when he says that the people should have access in a civilisation such as ours there are perhaps many whose interests are not ours but are those of enemies of the country and therefore they would be free to convey such information to our enemies <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate and particularly the noble lord who has replied for the government <e> <s> i can tell him that the newly planned travel centre at waterloo will not be of much use to me in finding my way back to epsom but i expect that it will be of great use to other people <e>", "<cs> my lords what has been said by the noble lord lord mishcon is very convincing but on the other hand it is a little difficult to judge between

between them <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that the issue of road <e>", "<cs> i am always rather surprised at the passion which some people seem to show when it comes to the question of being allowed to do exactly what one wants <e> <s> i think most of the committee will probably agree that it is impossible to buy any milk in this country that is not pasteurised and that is a very good thing <e> <s> however surely the mere desire to have something that is not pasteurised that is perfectly natural is not necessarily a very urgent desire nor necessarily a very wise one <e> <s> it

property <e> <s> if they were to have their own sovereignty and we were completely to wash our hands of the falkland islanders how on earth would they ever be able to defend themselves <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble earl not agree that codes as we have them at the moment are of little use since those who observe them are probably those who would have observed them in any case and those who do not pay little or no attention to them <e>", "<cs> i support entirely what the noble baroness had just said <e> <s> elected bodies are no doubt elected and i should not wish them to be anything else

dentist i can say that from experience because i went to one this morning <e> <s> therefore election surely does not make you an expert on any subject and this is a particularly scientific subject

have had many highly controversial acts which have been passed by parliament but i do not recall a single instance in which a process such as this has been suggested <e> <s> i believe that those who are so keen to preserve the electoral system that we have today and who quote it whenever it is in their favour should remember that this bill now before us has been passed by the elected government of this country and therefore i cannot see why it should be necessary or even possible to question whether it is or even should be the law of the land <e>", "<cs> i am grateful to the noble lord for having raised that question because it is something i have wondered about in relation to every statute that we seem to have passed in this house <e>", "<cs> i should like to give this amendment my wholehearted support <e> <s> one of its most important features is the fact that as the noble lord has just said it allows for individual parties to present their own opinion <e> <s> we work in this country on what is known as the democratic principle which of course means that the public shall have a chance of expressing their opinion <e> <s> i must confess that on looking round at the machinations of parliament i have sometimes been tempted to think that that means precisely nothing at all <e> <s> but there it is <e> <s> we have the principle and we must abide by it and surely this amendment very much reinforces that in that interested parties will be able to object and also to give their advice which is very valuable <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the government will accept it <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the noble baroness lady cox must by now be tired of receiving the congratulations of every speaker during this debate but i should like to add mine <e> <s> she told me not long ago that she was terrified of the idea of making her first appearance at the dispatch box <e> <s> however perhaps i may tell her that she has absolutely no reason to feel like that <e> <s> she has done it a great deal better than many others <e>", "<cs> yes my lords i am sorry <e> <s> that is the whole point it is not used at every moment <e> <s> it is used only in extreme circumstances

be directly elected i grant that the fears that have been expressed that it would become an all-powerful authority over the separate districts might be well founded <e> <s> it is not to be that <e>

out for privatisation and that is british leyland <e>", "<cs> my lords i am personally very happy that the white paper states what it does <e> <s> i should like to make one point <e> <s> a march is

i think i was perhaps unwise enough to confine my interpretation of corporal punishment as being the use of the cane <e> <s> but of course if it is a matter of merely slapping a pupils hand naturally one does not want to confine that purely to the headmaster <e> <s> therefore i withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i really feel in rather a quandary here because i think it is essential to take out of the bill that discriminatory aspect of it which is going to make things so impossible for teachers <e> <s> i am speaking from a little experience i have been a schoolmaster myself and i know that that kind of thing would have made life absolutely impossible <e> <s> therefore i can only say that if we are so bound to the european convention that we dare not regulate our lives as we feel is best then

doing away with <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the drinking tap in the room off the peers lobby <e> <s> i have often noticed that tap but it is a curious fact that it is impossible to turn it on <e> <s> can the noble lord say why <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that only a minute percentage of people have both eyes with an exactly equal focus and that therefore spectacles with two equal lenses would be entirely inaccurate for them <e> <s> is it not also a fact that using spectacles which are not accurate for ones eyes is extremely bad for ones sight <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord mentioned the possibility of the return of british leyland to the private market <e> <s> can he give some sort of assurance that when that long-awaited event occurs british leyland will be broken up into its component parts <e> <s> i am sure that the noble lord will agree with me that there is just as little competition with a private monopoly as there is with a public one <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support this amendment very strongly <e> <s> i do not think there is any noble lord here tonight who would sincerely want to see the arts dying of starvation but i am quite certain that unless something is done by the government that is what will happen <e> <s> i must say it is very good news indeed to hear that the arts council is preparing to take over the south bank which of course includes the queen elizabeth hall <e> <s> but the queen elizabeth hall is not a great deal of use if there are no orchestras to play in it and that is precisely what will happen unless the government supply a little bit more in the way of funds to the arts council to support them <e> <s> not many noble lords realise perhaps that no major orchestra ever gives a concert without ending up in the red and it is that debt that has to be paid by the arts council or somebody else <e> <s> that is the painful fact of life for any orchestra <e>", "<cs> i sincerely hope that the committee will not listen to the opinion that has just been voiced <e> <s> this is not a question of education <e> <s> those who are trafficking in drugs are perfectly aware of what they are doing <e> <s> young people are seriously in need of protection against such persons and i sincerely hope that the committee will pay more attention to the description of this crime given by the noble lord lord mishcon <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry to interrupt the noble lord but if i have rightly understood the noble and learned lord he was holding that prostitution implied money <e> <s> of course there is a good deal of this which does not involve money at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for not having put my name on the list of speakers if indeed one can call a document with the noble earls name standing by itself in solitary grandeur a list <e> <s> i should however like to thank the noble earl for having introduced the bill <e> <s> he gave me a great deal of help when a short time ago i introduced a private members bill on the protection of trees <e> <s> i should like to congratulate him and to thank him for this very necessary bill <e>", "<cs> i too should like to support this amendment for a reason additional to those spoken of so far <e> <s> i agree with my noble friend lord buckmaster on the ethical side of this process but there is also the practical side <e> <s> when the child grows up or grows a little older he may have a feeling of great uncertainty as to who is his real mother <e> <s> a feeling of certainty is very necessary for any child <e> <s> to have that feeling of uncertainty in a relationship is very bad indeed <e> <s> it gives him a bad start to life and one that we can condemn altogether <e>", "<cs> my lords i had not really intended to speak on this bill at all since i felt that it had already gone beyond the point where it was possible to improve it <e> <s> however i should be very grateful if the noble baroness when she replies would tell me whether there is any legal interpretation of the words assault of a child <e> <s> i have heard of cases where somebody who just took a child by the arm to prevent it doing what it ought not to do was accused of assaulting it <e> <s> i think perhaps that ought to be more clearly defined <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not pretty plain after all these years of having had this publicity about cigarette smoking that people are going to do what they like regardless <e>", "<cs> i should like to support this amendment but before i go any further i should like to join in congratulating the noble baroness lady darcy de knayth on a very happy occasion and may there be many more <e>", "<cs> i think i can safely cast myself in the first category of elderly people <e> <s> i remember not too long ago trying to get on to a bus in london <e> <s> the conductor kindly stretched out his hand and said come on grandpa <e> <s> i think i am really in that category <e> <s> very little need be

taxi then somewhere to sit be it just an ordinary bench would be an absolute godsend to those who really do find standing for a long time very tiring <e> <s> a great deal might be done in that way <e> <s> i entirely agree that improvements to buses for those who find even greater difficulty are absolutely essential <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter spoke with great conviction as he always does although at the end of his speech i felt a little doubtful as to what it was he was being so convincing about <e> <s> one point emerged <e> <s> he felt that the amendment was completely contrary to the spirit of the bill <e> <s> does that make it wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that it is for the broadcasting authorities to decide what is coming over on their programmes <e> <s> in that case can he tell me just why we are sitting in this place <e>", "<cs> i hesitate to disagree with such a speaker as the noble lord lord renton but surely he is mistaken in saying that this clause does not deregulate the present system since if i read it aright it says that a licence shall be granted more or less to anybody who applies for it except under certain circumstances <e>", "<cs> i wholly agree with the noble earls amendment <e> <s> when one looks at the standard of driving on the roads today i do not think it is a point that can be emphasised

we are all aware of the fact that the wheels of government grind very slowly indeed but this is almost bringing them to a full stop <e> <s> there is no doubt a great deal of reorganisation to be done but surely we could have a slightly earlier date than <e> <s> could it not be possibly later than april <e> <s> if we wait until most of us will have forgotten what it is all about <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help but feel that noble lords who believe that once services are deregulated operators will work harmoniously to provide a co-ordinated service are being a little optimistic <e> <s> once bus services are deregulated the operators will take the word competition seriously and the one thing they will be trying to do is drive their competitors off the road <e> <s> they do not really care about co-ordinating services with anybody <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to confirm what the noble lord lord teviot has just said <e> <s> there is ample provision in this bill for implementing what the local authorities or transport executives think is best for the public <e> <s> but they are not always right <e> <s> the public are really the most authoritative on what they need <e> <s> there is very little opportunity as far as i can make out for them to say so or for their opinions to have any weight <e> <s> i think that this amendment is extremely necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords with the leave of the house i should like to point out that i only wish that the two noble lords who have just spoken lived where i live <e> <s> it is a highly built-up area but the only means of transport from where i live down to the middle of the town is a bus which runs once per hour <e> <s> nobody could care less about transport of that kind than the local council <e> <s> all it is interested in is how to save its own money <e> <s> i am certain that some means of public representation is highly necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel inclined to support the amendment <e> <s> i would be the last person to hold that economic questions are unimportant <e> <s> of course one has to observe what is and is not financially possible <e> <s> however at present there is too widespread a tendency in industry at any rate to consider only what is cheapest to produce and not what is best <e> <s> in this case for instance how about considering facilities for the public and whether of not there will be an improved form of transport provided <e> <s> it would be a great pity if we were to determine the matter only on the question of how much it will cost although of course as i have said one must always consider that aspect <e> <s> however in my view it should be as it were the last post to be passed <e> <s> i therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that if unemployment is increasing and since nobody in the country does anything but regret that fact in all probability unemployment is not due in any way to the policy of one party or another and that in fact that probably has nothing to do with it <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep your lordships long because we want to get on with the debate <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord will answer one question <e> <s> i have no doubt that the noble lord is aware of the tendency of urban local governments today to invite enormous supermarkets into their areas and that that has a very deleterious effect on employment <e> <s> i do not know whether the noble lord has ever penetrated one of these ghastly places but if he has he will realise that the chief feature about them is that there is never anybody about if one wants to ask a question or get what one wants <e> <s> that is very bad for employment <e> <s> they are also driving out the small shopkeepers who provide a very much better <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not true that it is not merely a question of mutual suspicion between the two powers because the situation is due partly to the rather well-known soviet desire for world domination <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt the noble lord he may remember that some years ago our <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to join with other noble lords in welcoming the bill which i think draws the strings of control about as tightly as they can practically be drawn <e> <s> nobody with any sensitivity can look at animal experiments without dislike but on the other hand many of those who are most vociferous over it forget that human suffering is also a very horrible thing <e> <s> many human beings have had their lives wrecked by one disease or another so that they have been unable to live what might have been very useful lives <e> <s> surely the sacrifice of a few animals in order to save that is not really unforgivable <e>", "<cs> my lords i was told with what truth i do not know that the percentage of experiments that are carried out for cosmetic productions is only about per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask whether the teaching of swimming is regarded as part of the curriculum and therefore must be confined to school hours <e>", "<cs> my lords are there any provisions for making sure that fires do

answer <e> <s> would he agree with me that that is an absolutely scandalous waste of money because the position of director of these halls is nothing but a sinecure <e> <s> all the work concerning the

have very great technical ability but it does not follow and i think it is highly unlikely that he or she will have the sensitivity to do the job properly and to observe all the extremely tight

bar the sixth forms of those schools from anything in the way of experiments <e> <s> after all the sooner that they learn about these matters the more likely they are to be responsible when they finally come to do the work <e>", "<cs> i should like to support both amendments or either whichever one is moved <e> <s> the reason is this <e> <s> we all know that alternatives to experiments at the moment are few and far between but we all hope that with research they will grow and become more numerous and when they do so we should make provision for it being compulsory to use them <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble lord <e> <s> he is very good at making things completely incomprehensible as is usual in politics <e> <s> but i entirely agree with the point of his amendment i also agree strongly with what the noble earl said <e>", "<cs> i am merely asking for information <e> <s> would it not be possible to accept the amendment as it stands and then to provide for the situation which the noble and learned lord lord simon of glaisdale has mentioned which i agree is very important in another clause later in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords while i agree that the noble lords answer was most encouraging may i ask whether he agrees that there is a great need not only in london but in all major towns for more concert halls of a sufficient size to cater for orchestral concerts <e> <s> can he give any indication whether there are plans to build some such halls <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the secretary of state will have enough knowledge of the subject to realise that that is the case <e> <s> this amendment is not in the least limiting him <e> <s> it is merely saying that he shall take into account the fact that there are other products <e> <s> that being the case i entirely sympathise with the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords one great thing that including this amendment in the bill might do is to stimulate research into alternative methods which at the moment are rather few and far between <e> <s> it is high time that a great deal more research took place it seems to me <e> <s> if we include this amendment of course it will stimulate that approach <e>", "<cs> my

nature <e> <s> the shopkeeper may well say to his weekday employees if you are not going to work on sunday then i do not want you <e> <s> they will thereby lose their jobs and he will find somebody

independent i cannot see why it should thereafter be bound to all the rigmaroles of parliamentary discussion <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that this amendment overlooks the fact that in most schools most staff are required to do duties of some sort outside their actual written engagement such as invigilating for examinations being on duty for lunch or something similar <e> <s> there are many minor details <e> <s> teachers might even be asked to be present on the ground during games or something like that <e> <s> it is narrowing down a schoolmasters activities very much to say that he may do

considerable courage <e> <s> can he say what steps if any the government are taking to draw more young people into the service because i understand that one of the great difficulties has been due to understaffing in the prisons <e>", "<cs> here again we have this business of having to consult both houses of parliament <e> <s> if we go on like that before very long we shall have to consult both houses of parliament before we appoint a teacher <e> <s> it seems to me that it would be much better to let the houses of parliament get on with their own work which certainly has nothing to do with education <e>", "<cs> my lords my first duty must be to follow the noble lord lord walston in one thing and that is to apologise to your lordships if i have to leave before the end of the debate <e> <s> i apologise particularly to the noble lord who is going to answer but i can assure him that i shall read every word that he says <e> <s> i am going to confine myself to one aspect only and that is what is known as intensive farming or factory farming as it is sometimes called <e> <s> this has not gained very great acceptance in our country <e> <s> it can be found but it has not spread very widely although in france it has spread so widely that the old-fashioned farm is almost a rarity <e> <s> i am hoping that we can do something to prevent that from happening here <e>", "<cs> my lords does not the noble lord agree that one of the most important aspects in accelerating this trade is to produce goods that appeal to the spanish love of high quality <e>", "<cs> my lords i was very glad indeed to hear what the noble lord lord ritchie said about teachers being professionals <e> <s> it is quite certain that they are <e> <s> however there is a slight danger here <e> <s> any teacher is devoted to his own particular subject and there would of course be a temptation for every teacher to try to push his subject in the curriculum at the expense of others <e> <s> from experience i have known that to happen <e> <s> that is certainly an aspect about which one would want to be very careful <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the fact that the government have frequently acknowledged the desirability of getting more traffic off the roads can the noble earl say whether they are considering the reopening of some of those branch lines which have been closed <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help feeling that there is a great danger in giving local education authorities too much control over the curriculum of the schools in their area <e> <s> one has to remember first of all that the governing bodies are not education specialists <e> <s> they are merely local government officials who are acting as a local education authority <e> <s> the governing body is far more likely to know

think that everything we do must be the subject of consultation with parliament <e> <s> if the secretary of state wishes to appoint a director general then for goodness sake let him consult somebody

practically impossible for them to agree on any subject <e> <s> by all means let the director have as many assistants as he wants but there should be one supreme director <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that the suspicious thing about this amendment is what is meant by enjoyment of the countryside <e> <s> those of us who enjoy it in the way that many of us do enjoy it for what it is and we want to keep it as it is <e> <s> i have a strong suspicion that there are a great many people who should like to enjoy it entirely for the kind of amusement which they consider gives them pleasure dropping litter all over the place having pop camps or caravan sites and that sort of thing <e> <s> i cannot think it is quite fair on a fanner to ask him to put up with all that <e>", "<cs> my lords with all the references that the noble lord has made to the various duties of the secretary of state it seems to me that this bill will make the gas corporation merely a different form of nationalised gas <e>

any unfair dismissal of any employee but i have sometimes felt that the employer should be given a little more power to control employees who perhaps are giving bad work either through laziness or possibly through just sheer inefficiency <e> <s> i am not saying that such examples are frequent but it is not unknown particularly in these days for a man to accept a job purely because of the money he is going to get from it without any willingness to fulfil the job that he has been given <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that very little will be achieved by persuasion and that uncoated lead will have to be banned altogether if progress is to be made <e> <s> is it not possible to make it compulsory if lead has to be used that it is coated with a non-toxic metal <e>", "<cs> my lords on a point of information can the noble lord say whether british gas will be responsible for the repairs to systems that are already installed in a house before the date of denationalisation <e>", "<cs> with the greatest possible respect to the noble lords who have put their name to this amendment and that is not merely formal praise because i do have the very greatest respect for them i find myself practically in total agreement with what <e>", "<cs> the amendment would result in very bad english if inserted <e> <s> surely the bill should read <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i quite agree that the courts which we shall have are of the greatest importance <e> <s> however surely the noble baroness would agree that even more important is the law under which those courts will operate <e>

they compete is a quick arrival at the destination <e> <s> would he not agree that that could present a serious threat to road safety <e>", "<cs> is this yet another case of the government regarding it as part of their duty to refuse any amendments that may come from the opposition <e> <s> what is wrong with the amendment <e> <s> all the activities listed in clause provide employment but there

light of what has been said can the noble viscount the leader of the house give any estimate it is probably doubtful as to how many of these amendments numbering over before us are likely to be discussed in a time span of about one hour <e> <s> it is becoming a little trying for members of the house to sit through all the proceedings <e>", "<cs> while the motives behind the noble and learned lords amendment are of the highest i think sometimes some of us are apt to forget that we the english people are also a race <e> <s> the hatred against the english people which is displayed sometimes by some of the minority groups which have come into our country seems to go completely unnoticed <e> <s> i draw the committees attention to the recent action in one north london borough where spies not english spies obviously are to be introduced into the schools to detect any possible chain of what might perhaps be called racial prejudice <e> <s> lack of racial prejudice is an ideal that we must all hope for but we shall never get it until it is mutual on both sides <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl replies perhaps i may ask him to tell your lordships whether if these words were included in the bill we the english people are or are not a racial group in great britain <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope the house will remember that there are many occasions on which it is <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with great hesitation that i make any complaint about the findings of the committee which considered this bill and of course i am not thinking of moving any amendment <e> <s> but i sincerely hope that whatever is said in the house tonight will be considered by the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords i go on to say that i have no intention of moving any amendment but i hope that the committee which deals with the bill in another place will take note of what is said tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the amendment but i agree with the noble lord lord campbell of alloway

"<cs> my lords i never thought that i should find myself differing from the noble baroness lady cox on such matters but on this occasion i feel that i must do so <e> <s> like the noble baroness i take the view that freedom of speech is precious and must be preserved <e> <s> however it must always be conditional because otherwise would we have for instance a law of slander <e> <s> there is a limit to the freedom of speech there as there must be in other areas <e>", "<cs> my lords why must we have this playing about with figures just for party political advantage <e> <s> party politics mean very little to those who are waiting to get into hospital <e> <s> is it not a duty of any government of whatever party or political colour to see to it that the figures come down as rapidly as possible

of any solution <e> <s> if only we could find some way of communicating with teachers a solution might be found <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord say in view of the increase in the number of

his feelings on this subject but would he not agree that on a subject like this most certainly there is a good deal of strength in the old adage that charity begins at home <e>", "<cs> my lords it is

lords i understand the difficulty over the wording <e> <s> will the noble lord agree that there are circumstances where not doing anything could be harmful to the product <e> <s> for instance the seller of livestock could have omitted to feed them properly during their breeding period <e> <s> that is not doing anything it is omitting to do it <e> <s> but it would have a harmful effect on the

we all know that some antibiotics are harmless while others do not agree with us <e> <s> other drugs are given but the trouble is that so often drugs are used of whose side effects not even the scientists themselves are aware <e> <s> but they are all there in the meat that one eats and one has no protection against them <e> <s> therefore i would say that this amendment is most certainly very necessary to protect the customer from something he has no defence against <e>", "<cs> my lords there is one final matter that i should like to raise <e> <s> i think that those mysterious initials are comprehensible to most people who read the bill but they may not be understood by all <e> <s> would it be a good thing if a translation of them were given in the clause which includes the other

rather excessive <e> <s> the noble lord mentioned some other alternative times in his speech <e> <s> i should have thought that any product on the market without complaint for a period of three years

deserves the same publicity <e>", "<cs> my lords i hoped that i would be in entire agreement with the codes but i am afraid that i only received them last night and therefore i have only been able to study the one on poultry <e> <s> however i should like to make a few criticisms <e> <s> for one thing these codes are all very well but for all that the noble lord says they are unenforceable <e> <s> those farmers who have consideration for their stock will no doubt already be doing what the code suggests <e> <s> those who do not have consideration for their stock will not be able to be penalised

freight would be a shuttle service so that there would be no delay at either end <e> <s> if one is going to have a shuttle service for lorries it is perfectly logical also to have a shuttle service for cars with enough passenger coaches to accommodate the drivers of the cars <e> <s> therefore i cannot see that it need necessarily be limited only to freight <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to the noble lord for the assurances he has given <e> <s> before i withdraw the amendment can the noble lord tell me whether i am right in thinking that there is sufficient protection during the course of construction of the tunnel <e> <s> when it is finished there will not be much likelihood of foxes and other animals finding their way through <e> <s> however during the construction of the tunnel there will be a great deal of rough earth and holes where rats could make their homes <e> <s> it is rather more important at that stage to see that there is adequate protection <e>", "<cs> i am sorry

achieve when it states <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord explain why if competition is one of the governments aims they have chosen for denationalisation all those industries where competition is impossible for example gas telephones the post office and various other things <e>", "<cs> my lords the scene in the education world over the past six months or so has not been happy <e> <s> it has been riddled by strikes which have had the bad effect of delaying the childrens education <e> <s> there are two industries which i have long felt should not be allowed to strike <e> <s> education is

striking should be allowed <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord be so kind as to tell me what millimetres is in english <e>", "<cs> i should like very much to support this amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble earl would say when replying whether the government have ever considered the question of hard labour as a possible alternative <e> <s> i know this would not always be practicable but there is a great deal of heavy work to be done particularly at present in the clearing up of the wreckage of the recent storms <e> <s> i wonder whether the government think that would be a practicable solution <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say how delighted i was to hear about the increased expenditure on education which is not only necessary but urgently necessary <e> <s> if the plans of the secretary of state for education for removing responsibility for education from the local authorities go ahead i presume that that allocation to the local authorities will not take place <e> <s> will there be any guidance as to how this money will be spent <e> <s> will it be spent on buildings new courses or what <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to comment on the financial side of the statement because no one could he more profoundly ignorant of that than i but will the noble viscount say whether there has been any advance in the research into alternative sources of power particularly wind power which as we all saw last month is no mean power <e>", "<cs> my lords may i suggest that that is only a weakness <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think anybody who is interested in such matters will feel anything hut heartfelt gratitude to the government for making that statement <e> <s> but i wonder whether the noble lord could tell me one thing <e> <s> one sees in every surgery and hospital

"<cs> my lords speaking purely as a layman i wonder whether there is not a slight danger with this amendment <e> <s> if my memory serves me correctly minimum sentences were first introduced because of the strong public feeling that many dangerous criminals were being given sentences which were far too lenient <e> <s> if we quash that power entirely i wonder whether it will be in the interests of

disapprove of intensive farming merely from a humanitarian point of view <e> <s> i dislike it also because of the danger to the consumer <e> <s> the animals which live an entirely captive and unnatural life become delicate and subject to all kinds of disease <e> <s> they have to be injected with antibiotics and as everyone knows calves must also be injected with hormones <e> <s> it is that which makes the meat eaten by the consumer unnatural and possibly even dangerous <e>", "<cs> my lords the statement is very good so far as it goes but it does not deal with what i feel is one of the crying evils of the health service today that is the appalling time which so many people have to wait in order to get a bed in a hospital <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me if there is any plan in the mind of the government about either enlarging the present hospitals or possibly building new ones <e> <s> i understand too that part of the difficulty is due to the lack of nurses <e> <s> have the

the name of the noble lord lord willis there are no exceptions for the blind <e> <s> however if the committee will look at subsection d it will see that the secretary of state may define the classes

like to support the amendment <e> <s> it seems to me that assertion is only a second form of copyright <e>", "<cs> i should like briefly to say one or two words about the amendment <e> <s> the committee should remember that while the composer wishes to retain his rights over his works and i speak here from a personal point of view he is nonetheless glad when they are performed because he

influenced by any of their electors opinions <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will permit me to intervene he said quite rightly that the local authorities can communicate with us in various ways but how do we communicate with them <e>", "<cs> i support almost everything that was said by the noble viscount lord falkland <e>", "<cs> i say almost because i believe he said the promiscuity is no worse

first decide on a desirable quota and then it must find people to fill that quota who are both resident in the neighbourhood and unemployed <e> <s> that may not be too difficult in these days of high unemployment <e> <s> but such a firm must then decide how many of those people are really suitable for the jobs which they are to be asked to do <e> <s> that was the point which the noble lord lord

told me <e> <s> i asked him whether this provision would make it in order for a music teacher in a school to make photocopies of copyright music for teaching purposes <e> <s> he tells me no because it merely means that he is not making a photograph <e> <s> but will the noble lord make that clear <e>", "<cs> my lords at the risk of being in a minority of one or perhaps two with the presence of the right reverend prelate i must confess that i oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> we have spent nearly one and three-quarter hours on this amendment so i hesitate to speak <e> <s> but i should like to suggest that we have rather wandered away from the amendment itself <e> <s> i cannot see what difference this amendment will make to the bill because that part of the bill as it stands states that the carrying out of functions as regards the national curriculum shall be the duty of the secretary of state the local education authority and every governing body or head teacher <e>", "<cs> i oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill because i believe that in respect of a bill of such size it is our duty to remove the unnecessary paperwork that will be produced by this and several

shy nowadays <e>", "<cs> i do not often dare to differ from the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter but surely to maintain a list means strictly speaking to keep it as it is and not to make various alterations that may be necessary <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord implying that he is convinced that there is no one in our democracy who goes in for tax evasion <e> <s> i do not think that that is a realistic attitude <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister explain to a complete layman what advantages the private monopoly possesses over a nationalised one <e>", "<cs> i wholeheartedly support the

something more definite in the bill as a protective measure <e>", "<cs> my lords may i interrupt the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to remind the noble lord that i not only lived in the united states but actually went to school there <e> <s> i am very glad that i now live in england <e>", "<cs> my lords i believe that i understand the meaning of the amendment at least i hope i do

parents or the teacher should be afraid <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel that this is a necessary amendment <e> <s> when reading the bill as it stands it states <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like strongly to support this amendment for another reason than that given by my noble friend just now and that is purely on numbers <e> <s> as every teacher knows it is practically impossible to teach an oversized

have spent many years teaching in a school <e> <s> when i did our general view in the common room was that the governing body was an infernal nuisance <e>", "<cs> my lords i should also like very strongly to support this amendment <e> <s> special education has been mentioned in the bill but no particular emphasis has been laid upon it <e> <s> one must remember that for those who need it special education is essential <e> <s> without it they would have to go without education altogether <e> <s> that is something which we do not want to see <e> <s> i believe that this is a very necessary amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl satisfied that all charities that the government support are really deserving ones <e>", "<cs> my lords i too support this amendment <e> <s> i agree with what was said earlier by my noble friend lord baldwin that the secretary of state is giving himself too much power in directing what shall be taught and what shall not be taught <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to say a few words with regard to music alone and i am speaking only about individual teaching of music <e> <s> it is very difficult indeed for anybody who is not a musician to assess the progress of any particular pupil <e> <s> in fact it is difficult for anybody except the pupils teacher himself or herself <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to ask the noble baroness whether it is possible that this delay is due to the computer going wrong <e>", "<cs> i very often agree with a great deal of what the noble lord lord mcintosh has to say <e> <s> however on

regret to say been met with a very half-hearted response <e> <s> something of this kind would be very opportune and i shall therefore support the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords is there not something that can be done about the situation in which a developer applies for planning permission the local authority and residents are both against the proposal which is turned down and the developer then goes behind the back of the council to the minister and central government and obtains planning permission <e>", "<cs> my lords speaking purely as a layman who has received a great deal of help from national health service doctors would it not be better if in line shall were replaced by may <e> <s> in many bills in the past we have felt that shall was better than may <e> <s> however this is a

management and of the business of education would probably be a great deal better influence than a majority of parents who did not have such knowledge <e>", "<cs> the minister says that the clerk may not be available <e> <s> he must remember that it is probable that any resignation of this kind will not take place until the beginning of the following term <e> <s> therefore there is plenty of time to wait until the clerk is available <e>", "<cs> i should like to clarify one point <e> <s> when parents are mentioned does that imply parents whose child attends a particular school and not those whose child is at some other school <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl referred to where the landlord is guilty of misconduct or mismanagement <e> <s> can he say by what standards those are to be judged and who is to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i respect what the minister said about this amendment and his attitude towards it because he is a politician and i am not <e> <s> but i should like to ask why it is that one has to wait and consult local authorities before doing something which is so eminently right <e> <s> the local authorities opinions may be right or they may be wrong but surely we have the conviction to recognise that an amendment of this kind is eminently right <e>", "<cs> my lords i have been in the teaching profession for some years arid should like to confirm every single word that the noble lord has said <e> <s> i sincerely hope that the fable of having parents on school boards in order to run schools properly will <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot help feeling that that argument is misleading <e> <s> the choice is not as to on which day we will have a flower show or something like that it is a highly important choice that will affect not just the tenant but the whole neighbourhood <e> <s> it is highly important that the minister should have not just a majority opinion but an accurate opinion of all the tenants before any proceedings are taken <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness say whether any scientific tests have been carried out to prove that there is a greater source of danger from battery produced eggs than from free range eggs <e>", "<cs> my lords how does the noble lord define the term working classes <e> <s> does it not apply logically to anyone who works <e>", "<cs> my lords earlier on the noble lord said that he considered that this was an insult to innocent spectators who go to watch matches <e> <s> perhaps he will consider a parallel case <e> <s> is it an insult to law abiding and responsible motor fists that we should have breath tests <e> <s> i believe that anybody who is not likely to he caught does not object to them in the least <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank all noble lords who have taken part in this debate <e> <s> i do not say that in the conventional way <e> <s> i feel that some constructive points have been made <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord brabazon for what i feel was a very encouraging answer <e> <s> i should also ike to remind the noble lord lord dunleath that the most uncomfortable place that i can remember waiting in was the organ loft <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the motion for papers <e>", "<cs> my lords until this provision comes into being would it not be possible to limit the vehicles concerned strictly to certain roads that are capable of taking them <e> <s> is that carried out at present <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may interrupt the noble lord <e> <s> he said that this amendment mentions supply but does not say anything about generation <e> <s> one cannot supply electricity unless it is generated <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount agree that the training of governors is of far less importance than the training of teaching staff <e> <s> does he also agree that governors are not likely to have a great influence on the future of the young whereas the future of the young is very much in the hands of able and efficient staff <e>", "<cs> i am speaking to amendment no <e> <s> ca only <e> <s> i believe that it is a reasonable amendment <e> <s> we all know that apart from pollution water has contents which affect its quality for

organisation <e> <s> that is most true as i know from painful experience <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not a fact that if we were to pay serious attention to all that we are told is bad for us

we may and may not eat particularly by american scientists <e> <s> it is surprising that some of us are still alive <e>", "<cs> my lords i am entirely in favour of the amendment but i wish that the noble lord had inserted two words at the end <e> <s> i wish that he had inserted the words or wind after the word tidal <e> <s> wind power is certainly a possibility <e> <s> i saw a film on television not long ago which demonstrated to me quite convincingly that wind power was a possible source of electricity <e> <s> although during the past few days one may have wondered what has happened to the wind there is no doubt that it still blows up in the north <e> <s> i therefore think that it would be a possibility to carry out experiments with wind power <e>", "<cs> my lords i am most grateful to

protection areas <e> <s> however are the government not being rather slow in providing only out of a possible sites <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord make this extremely complex statement a little clearer on the position of the pensionable and disabled <e>", "<cs> my lords the government seem unwilling to introduce legislation on a simple subject like this <e> <s> i hardly think that a little bill of the kind needed would cause the house to sit until minutes to five in the morning <e>", "<cs> i cannot help feeling that there is another side to this matter than that put forward by the supporters of this amendment <e> <s> a young child should have one of its parents at home when the child is at home <e> <s> it is highly necessary for the mother to be at home during the childs first two years after birth and for one of its parents at any rate to be at home afterwards <e>", "<cs> does the noble lord not agree that the best way to deal with under year-olds is to <e>", "<cs>

must say that in my view this is an excellent amendment <e> <s> it does away with what i have always felt was one of the chief evils in the employment of the young <e> <s> nowadays young people are too apt to go into a job and regardless of the fact that they know nothing about it expect that they will at once be paid exactly the same wage as experienced workers <e> <s> the amendment will give them the chance to make that good <e>", "<cs> that is another point <e> <s> it may not occur to the young person at first that he needs the extra training <e> <s> he may only realise it as he learns
