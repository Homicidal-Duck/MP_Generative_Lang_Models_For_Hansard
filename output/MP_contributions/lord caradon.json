["<cs> my lords i wonder whether the noble lord realises the culmination of the various actions which have been taken in this respect in recent months <e> <s> there is the consternation which has been caused throughout the commonwealth in particular with regard to the attitude on fees for overseas students <e> <s> there are the difficulties in which the students themselves are being put <e> <s> this is followed by the drastic reduction in the british council and its activities <e> <s> only last week i listened in another part of this building to the report of a reduction by half of the british contribution regarding world population activities <e> <s> it seems to me that we are embarked and i am sorry that it should be so with a secretary of state whom we so much admire on a policy of almost deliberately alienating world opinion and in particular commonwealth opinion <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that it might be said at this stage in the debate that we are fortunate to have been able to listen to the remarkable speeches that have been made to us today <e> <s> i would refer first to the very moving maiden speech by the noble baroness lady jeger <e> <s> i am sure that it is a happiness to all of us that in our rather dry male discussions we should have strong feelings put forward by the ladies <e> <s> i think that the speeches made by both the noble baronesses who have addressed us today conveyed to us the almost passionate feeling that many of us have when we think of the hardships and the sufferings of the people of cyprus on both sides of the line <e>", "<cs> my lords when it was suggested to me a little time ago that i might take part in this debate i was very doubtful whether i was competent to do so and i was not sure what the range of our discussions would cover <e> <s> however i wish to speak very briefly on one subject which seems to me to be of maximum importance <e> <s> i realise that it is only part of the very wide spectrum of subjects which have been discussed this evening but it is the one in which i personally have been interested and concerned for a decade or more <e>", "<cs> my lords i especially appreciate if i may say so that from a mere devonian that reference to cornwall should be so generous <e>", "<cs> my lords since reference has been made to the arrangements of may i refer in particular to the treaty of guarantee of which i signed on behalf of her majestys government which provided that the british government would stand against either annexation of any part of the island to greece or turkey or partition of the island <e> <s> can we be told whether the present government support that obligation which we accepted at that time and are not prepared either to neglect it or to reject it <e>", "<cs> in this connection my lords can the noble baroness tell us whether any decision has been taken following the very urgent representations made to the lord privy seal when he was recently in cyprus on behalf of the cypriot students <e>", "<cs> my lords i too shall declare my interest <e> <s> i do not forget that for a matter of nearly two decades i have worked in and for the united nations <e> <s> with the limit of time in mind i shall try to restrict myself first to a general question on policy and then to a particular appeal regarding matters of world development <e> <s> as i look back over a good many years i am bound to say that i am deeply depressed by my recollection of the circumstances in which the main issues of the present word have been discussed and decisions have been taken <e> <s> i speak to the text that there is nothing wrong with the united nations except the members <e> <s> the fact is that through the united nations we have had a growing development of ideals and purposes widely accepted and forcefully presented usually to be obstructed and particularly to be delayed by the principal powers including the united states and the western world <e> <s> my own experience goes back to when i remember a vote of the general assembly that the people of rhodesia should be allowed to settle their future by free election in their own country from which no one would be barred <e> <s> at that time the government instructed me as i was ambassador and speaking for my government on this issue in the united nations that we should not take part even in the vote <e> <s> i resigned and went away <e> <s> then years later the people of rhodesia were allowed to decide their own future by a free election <e> <s> i think sometimes of the bloodshed the suffering the increase in danger which took place in those years because <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the question i would certainly say that we are very greatly respected as lord ritchie-calder has pointed out for our past contributions and other speakers have given deliberate evidence to that effect what i am saying is that in regard to recent decisions in regard to the main political problems of the world at this moment and in regard in particular to the question of development we are in danger of throwing away the good reputation which we have earned <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish very strongly and sincerely to support what the noble lord lord mcnair said to us <e> <s> it is very opportune that he has brought this critical development to the notice of the house and the government <e> <s> i greatly admire the way in which he put the case <e> <s> the catastrophe which is imminent is almost beyond imagination <e> <s> that more than children should be denied the opportunity of returning to school in may that or more devoted teachers all of them palestinians who have done extremely well in serving their own people should be summarily dismissed and the possibility that these developments will take place inevitably if action is not taken by march throwing the countries concerned into confusion and indeed chaos and protest are things which are almost impossible to imagine <e>", "<cs> my lords arising from the discussion which is taking place this evening would it be agreed by the government that now having partially met the immediate and urgent need we should turn our attention to the long-term needs of this area which have been so badly neglected in the past and should take an initiative in advance of july through the united nations development programme for a long term project in that area <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether the attention of the noble lord has been drawn to a very remarkable and encouraging meeting which took place only a few days ago in london <e> <s> a mass meeting of cypriots both greek and turkish assembled to welcome a declaration which had been made by three editors from the greek side of cyprus and three editors from the turkish side who had published a call for reconciliation and understanding and at this meeting organised by the friends of cyprus people both greeks and turks came together to make a demand that understanding reconciliation the purposes of the original treaty should be carried out <e>", "<cs> my lords i have no intention this evening of going into the detail of this case which has been presented so fully and so ably <e> <s> when i saw that this proposal was to be brought before your lordships house this evening i was anxious to support that action <e> <s> for a matter of a decade or two i have been closely involved in the matter which we have discussed <e> <s> i do not particularly wish to remember it now but at one time i was appointed commissioner of namibia <e> <s> that appointment did not survive the complaint made by the soviet union at that time but for a day or two i did expect that i might be spending <e>", "<cs> my lords i cannot claim to speak with the intense knowledge of the noble lord to whom we have just listened and certainly i wish to observe the general instruction to be brief <e> <s> i expect that it will be the common belief of every member of the house that the external services of the bbc are something of which this country can be proud and which can be of benefit to the world <e> <s> it is unnecessary to go over that ground and we must start with that understanding and that agreement <e> <s> i must refer to the remarkable speeches that we have heard this evening in particular the maiden speech that we listened to a little while ago <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister not agree that the reactionary attitude taken by the present administration in the united states has led to this breakdown after more than a decade of consistent and agreed negotiations <e> <s> is it not therefore particularly distressing to us in this country that our delegation should in the end have abstained on a matter in which we should have been taking a positive and constructive part throughout <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the fact that the disagreement which clearly exists between the two sides in this matter is a serious one as the minister emphasises <e> <s> is it therefore not clear that it is more necessary than ever that there should be an independent initiative based on an understanding of the needs of both sides and that that initiative should not be left aside but should be energetically pursued not least by our own country <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had the opportunity the privilege of working for years or so in or for the united nations <e> <s> during that time there have been three main international enterprises to which the effort the time and the determination of the united nations as a whole have been given <e> <s> the first was the question of economic development and the search for a fairer balance of the resources of the world between rich and poor <e> <s> the second was the long effort to arrive at a better provision regarding the wealth of the seas to make the wealth of the seas the common heritage of all mankind <e> <s> the third was <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree that although talks have been continuing for years it is true there is a special obligation on her majestys government over this matter of cyprus <e> <s> i myself had the opportunity of signing the treaty in which we undertook to preserve the previous constitution of cyprus and is it not entirely unsatisfactory that our government should remain inactive exercising no influence and taking no initiative in a matter in which we have a primary responsibility <e>", "<cs> my lords i would wish first of all to congratulate if i may the noble earl who as a young man served as i did in the area of which we speak we had no hand in making high policy in those days nor have we now <e> <s> but we did together in times of difficulty and danger risk our lives on behalf of all the inhabitants of the territories which at the time the mandated government was administering <e> <s> i am very happy to hear his very remarkable speech here this evening and i believe that we all feel a sense of congratulation towards him <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord the minister not agree that quite apart from statements by one side or the other in the dispute which are of course important there is an obligation on this country in particular and also on the security council to seek a settlement of this problem based on the principles which have been accepted ever since the noble lord lord george-brown put forward his proposals in <e> <s> is it not therefore necessary that this country in particular having a special responsibility should in the security council seek a settlement of the dispute going back to the basic requirements of a settlement rather than spending time arguing about the exact wording of the statements from one side or the other <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we all wish to express to the noble lord lord oram our gratitude for initiating this discussion which has been of very great value and will have a considerable and wide effect <e> <s> the hour is late and we do not want to go over ground which has already been covered <e> <s> but outstanding in my mind is that everyone who has spoken has referred to the shameful failures of the government in dealing with questions of overseas development <e>", "<cs> my lords can we be given an assurance today that urgent action will now be taken to undo the very great damage which has been done to the reputation of this country by the recklessly reactionary decision taken by the government some years ago <e>", "<cs> my lords would the minister agree that it would be worthwhile considering with for instance the secretary-general of the united nations the possibility that where scattered and small territories in the world the survival of empire are at risk and difficulty in these times it would be well to attempt to work out some international arrangement whereby the international community could bring assistance and security to such communities <e>", "<cs> my lords it is obvious and true that we on these benches and indeed noble lords throughout the house welcome the decisions which have recently been announced and the statement which was circulated a few days ago and the opportunity for this debate <e> <s> we are grateful to the noble viscount lord boyd who spoke to us first this afternoon <e> <s> i regret that he was not a member of the government when these decisions were taken when i believe that the decisions would have been different <e>", "<cs> my lords is the minister aware that recent arrangements have been made between voluntary service overseas and the united nations volunteers by which they will work closely together in recruitment and in other ways <e> <s> would he therefore agree that it is important that this disadvantage as it can be should not be extended to international volunteers from any other volunteers <e> <s> indeed would he not agree that it is undesirable that this dosadvantage should apply to any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords i must declare a personal interest in this subject <e> <s> it was on behalf of her majestys government that i signed the treaty of guarantee in nicosia <e> <s> reference has just been made to that treaty of guarantee guaranteeing the independence territorial integrity and security of the new republic of cyprus and going on to prohibit the partition of the island indicating that if there was not agreement between the three governments of the united kingdom greece and turkey then yes one could act alone but could act alone solely for the purpose of restoring the situation which was brought about by the treaty <e>", "<cs> my lords i should first wish to thank the noble and gallant lord lord cameron for his contribution today and for the thoughts he gave us on co-operation between our country and the united <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think we can carry this very much further at the moment <e> <s> i would just remind my noble friend that when we were together at the united nations we worked to achieve a unanimous resolution a resolution which was welcomed by all concerned including israel <e> <s> it was a unanimous resolution which i believe provided the right answer for the middle east a withdrawal of israeli troops for the security and the peace which must be obtained on the basis of equality between the rights of the palestinians and the rights to security of israel <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not understood and appreciated what dreadful damage has been done to the reputation of this country and of the five and indeed to the authority of the united nations by the fact that south africa has been able for years to stand in the way of the declared intention of the international authority <e> <s> is is not a matter for grave <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly wish to thank the noble baroness for her comments and for illustrating the advantages of progressing in negotiation as opposed to the rejection which has been the attitude of the united states government from the beginning of the present administration in the united states <e> <s> if we are to throw away this opportunity after years throughout which time we have been able to participate and refuse to sign the convention and to enter the full negotiations which it will open up to us then we shall be making one of the major mistakes of our time <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that it will not be impudent for me to add one word of welcome to the noble earl lord stockton because i once had the privilege of working under him and he showed me very great patience and kindness at that time as indeed did the noble lord lord home and also others on my side of the house under whom i worked <e> <s> i am very glad to add that word of welcome from these benches <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness agree that in view of the great urgency for a new initiative which has been emphasised on all sides of the house and i am sure is widely supported it is essential that that initiative should be taken through the security council of the united nations so that approval and acceptance by the united states and the soviet union can be obtained <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the great importance as everyone can appreciate to universities schools and students all over the commonwealth and elsewhere of knowing what their applications can involve and lead to would it not be possible for the noble baroness to give a somewhat <e>", "<cs> my lords our debate has lessened our public support in this house and we cannot claim that what we say is going to carry great weight among those on the other side of the house or on this but nevertheless <e> <s> i think that the short debate which we have had this afternoon has been of real value well-timed and indeed most necessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to congratulate the two maiden speakers with us today and to turn to the subject raised earlier by the leader of my party <e> <s> it is an important question relating to the whole future of world policy for dealing with disputes and dangers <e> <s> it is the question of the tradition and the role of the united states <e> <s> we have read in the papers and listened today to accounts of the triumph of the president of the united states <e> <s> in sending him as i am sure the house would wish our congratulations on his triumph i should like to express the hope that his second term will be far more effective and far more successful than the first <e> <s> i believe that it is of first <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the suffering and bloodshed on such a widespread scale caused by the invasion will the minister assure us that our government will give every support to the efforts of the united nations to restore and maintain peace in the lebanon and bring some comfort to those who have suffered so very severely <e>", "<cs> my lords i think that we should all be grateful to the noble lord lord chelwood for having raised this issue which i think is inadequately discussed in our house <e> <s> i think that it is very necessary that we should recognise the great danger that exists in the middle east the danger of local conflict and indeed the possibility of a wider war <e> <s> therefore i think it is right and necessary that we should look to the contribution of europe and if we look back on recent years then i think we can only conclude that the record of europe has been one of inactivity and indeed shameful inactivity <e> <s> therefore i think that it is extremely opportune that this should be raised now in the context of the european contribution <e>", "<cs> my lords is not the minister aware of the very strong feelings that exist in this country and in cyprus about this case <e> <s> is he not aware that the belief is that there has been inadequate attention paid to the difficulties of these people in wishing to return to cyprus to find a place where they can live in security and to good effect <e> <s> is it not right that in spite of the delay that has taken place there should be another look at this particular case which internationally in our own country and in cyprus has aroused such strong feelings <e> <s> would the minister not be prepared to look once more to see whether it would not be to the credit of this country to look at this case with sympathy and compassion yet again <e>", "<cs> my lords i am anxious to say some words in this remarkable debate from an international point of view on the question of the evil of delay <e> <s> i was in the united nations some years ago when it was clearly decided by i believe every state there represented that namibia should be free <e> <s> i do not intend to speak this evening on the wider issues of south africa on which i hold the strongest views but about namibia in particular <e>", "<cs> my lords i think everyone in this house will wish to express gratitude to the most reverend primate the archbishop for coming himself to take part in this debate and giving us such a <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish first to express my respect and congratulations to the right reverend prelate who spoke to us earlier on a matter of such supreme importance <e> <s> i should like also to congratulate the noble lord lord forres on having spoken so effectively on a subject which to most of us is not within our personal knowledge <e> <s> the noble lord has a good right to come to us and speak of the problems of australia <e> <s> i am sure that we will all pay the closest attention to what he has said to us today and consider together what action should be taken upon it <e> <s> at any rate i am happy to be the first to be able to congratulate my noble friend on what he said to us today <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness accept that the very grave seriousness of the decision announced today is fully understood <e> <s> here we have a decision taken after some delay it is true during which arguments have been put forward which is directed against the activities of the united nations organisation <e> <s> that in my view is a very serious development indeed which is out of step with our commonwealth and other friends in the world <e> <s> everyone believes that this represents as i feel sure that it does a reflection of the views of the united states in regard to the united nations which many of us seriously deplore <e> <s> we have other matters on which if the actions of our government were to imitate those of the united states the situation would be very serious indeed <e> <s> take for instance the attitude of the united states on the law of the sea where the whole organisation worked for years to achieve a purpose which was eventually denied by the united states <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister assure us that in the discussions which have been taking place and i think are still taking place with a representative of the turkish government he has been made fully aware of the strength of feeling in this country at the long delay which is taking place and the obstruction <e>", "<cs> my lords first i should like to express my gratitude to my noble friend lord oram for dealing with the issue so clearly and effectively <e> <s> we are talking of an organisation which our country was largely responsible for forming in the first instance and right up to the end we have benefited more in financial and in other terms than we have contributed <e> <s> therefore the action taken by our government after some delay and uncertainty and very strong adverse feelings expressed for instance by commonwealth countries was very difficult indeed to understand or to accept <e>", "<cs> my lords as we look at the situation as we now see it and consider its consequences i think we must conclude that we have been misled by the united states in this matter <e> <s> it is not an isolated occasion <e> <s> we have on most of the main issues in international affairs been misled have we not <e> <s> on the question of central america on south africa and on the middle east <e> <s> we have also been misled on questions like the law of the sea and questions like unesco <e> <s> what has happened particularly in the past few years has been that the united states has taken a position and that our government have said me too <e> <s> that is not the way it seems to me in which we should make our contribution to international affairs in this country <e> <s> we should have a positive policy to pursue and the strength to take it to the united states and others and to seek their agreement rather than constantly giving way to policies with which we do not agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that everyone will very much welcome the excellent speech to which noble lords have been privileged to listen <e> <s> as the right reverend prelate went through each stage of his <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like first to say a few words with due restraint to my old friend the noble lord lord chalfont <e> <s> we worked together in the united nations <e> <s> i wish he had spent a little longer in the united nations and perhaps not so long in south africa <e> <s> he put forward tonight a view that i do not think for one moment can be accepted <e> <s> he said that we must not do anything further in regard to measures or sanctions that nothing will work because of the intransigence of the south african government <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i have had some effect on the thinking of my noble friend who <e> <s> in effect in the comment that he has just made agreed that measures even sanctions may be necessary to bring about the right result <e>", "<cs> my lords i am happy that i can follow a speech so thoughtful and so careful as the one we have just listened to <e> <s> i want to explain my position in this matter <e> <s> i was for five years

speak for only a very short time to my own prejudice and my own understanding <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to detain the house <e> <s> i want merely to congratulate the noble baroness who led us
