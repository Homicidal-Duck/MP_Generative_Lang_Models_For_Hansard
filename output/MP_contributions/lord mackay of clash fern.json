["<cs> i know that the question has arisen in the courts <e> <s> i speak in the presence of noble and learned lords who have had experience of dealing with these situations and who will be able to give their views on this matter <e> <s> i do not think it gave rise to much difficulty <e> <s> the sort of situation that is intended to be covered by this is the situation in which a person in the course of his evidence gives mutually contradictory answers and that kind of thing <e> <s> the noble and learned lord lord wheatley i am sure will be able to help us on this point <e>", "<cs> certainly we shall consider this matter in the light of what has been said but based upon present advice our view is that the considerations are of such importance that in the first instance the case should properly go to the high court <e>", "<cs> naturally i shall be glad to study the judgment to which the noble and learned lord has referred <e> <s> may i say just a word about the basis of this proposal <e> <s> the basis of it is that the present law allows the prosecutor to raise a fresh case where the court has deserted the diet without qualification against his will <e> <s> where the court does so desert the diet without qualification against the will of the prosecutor this clause proposes that that should bar further proceedings <e> <s> but of course that would be a decision of the court in that case which the prosecutor could appeal to have altered <e> <s> in trying to balance all the matters which should go into this bill we thought though i agree that it is a limitation of the powers of the lord advocate as they have hitherto <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may take just a moment to express my regret that the noble lord lord hacking was not able to be here on the second reading <e> <s> however i am very glad he is here now better late than never because he has drawn attention to an important matter which i am very happy to consider for a later stage of the bill <e> <s> i believe this is a matter which we ought to cover <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to noble lords for raising this matter and to the noble lord lord foot for reminding us of the thomson recommendations <e> <s> the reason why we have thought it wise to put this matter first on to the procurator fiscal is exactly the reason which has been quoted from the thomson committees report <e> <s> we think it vitally important that the accused should feel that there is someone independent who is there as the arbiter of whether the questions are fair <e> <s> human nature being what it is even in the exalted position of a sheriff if he is responsible for constructing the questions and putting them he cannot be quite such a good judge of whether they are fair <e> <s> it is much easier that he should be as it were the arbiter of that matter <e> <s> accordingly in the light of the thomson recommendations and for these reasons i would invite your lordships to agree that the sheriff should have the role of being in charge of the proceedings and seeing that they are fairly conducted but it should be left to the procurator fiscal to put the questions as the bill at present proposes <e>", "<cs> my lords i spoke of this amendment earlier and i believe the detail of it is reasonably self-explanatory <e> <s> i beg to move <e>", "<cs> i should like to remind your lordships that the basic award that is here in question for unfair dismissal is separate from any compensatory award that may be made and is payable automatically upon a finding of unfair dismissal <e> <s> the basic award is calculated like a redundancy payment by reference to the age and length of service of the employee <e> <s> currently it is reducible in cases of contributory fault only <e>"]
