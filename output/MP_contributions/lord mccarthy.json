["<cs> my lords i should like to begin by joining the noble lords lord melchett lord rochester and lord brown in congratulating the benches opposite in general and the noble viscount lord trenchard in particular on achieving office <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate them on certain what seem to me to be attractive features if not in their economic policy at least in the way in which they derive their economic policy <e> <s> for it seems to me that here we have a government which to some extent and in many crucial areas derive their economic policy from books <e> <s> i am in favour of that <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by begging the indulgence of the house on three separate <e>", "<cs> my lords or anywhere <e> <s> ours is not a competitive economy <e> <s> i think we agree that the reasons go a long way back in time and that they do not relate centrally how could they <e> <s> to what this government have done or even centrally to what the last government have done though all governments may have played their part and different members have placed the critical date at different periods in the past <e> <s> i thought that the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he will tell me whether he intends to answer the questions that i asked in the debate last wednesday about the governments policy in regard to the public sector the private sector and the nationalised sector which i thought he was going to answer today <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not agree that acas in fact is in an impossible position as a result of a series of decisions and the ambiguity of the act and that it is driven to go to the law in this way <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us on these benches find that we have to oppose both orders and since the noble earl has taken them together we have to take them together from this side of the house <e> <s> i should like to begin as he did with the unfair dismissal variation order <e> <s> we should like to oppose this on two grounds first the variation order is a licence to dismiss unfairly <e> <s> what is being suggested is that it is perfectly fair and perfectly proper that we should extend the period during which an employer can sack people without giving reasons without saying that it is a matter of conduct or capacity or the need to improve their performance he can in fact sack them even without facing them to explain why it is being done <e> <s> this variation order is suggesting that we should extend the period in which we go back to the good old practice of british management the note in the paypacket the dcm dont come monday <e> <s> no explanation no justification not even the need to face people with the reasons for their dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to come on to that point in more detail but at the moment i will say only that it is perfectly true that there is this period now <e>", "<cs> my lords the position is as follows <e> <s> in the past the justification given for the exclusion period whether it was two years one year or weeks was a question of case load <e> <s> the implication always was certainly it was my belief and i believe it was right that when the case load problem justified it there would be no exclusion period <e> <s> we are now being given a quite separate set of reasons for exclusion based on the so-called needs of industry which are the needs of industry to dismiss unfairly <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that what these people say is what he believes or is he saying he does not believe this and would like to take this occasion to say that what they are saying about the employment protection act is quite wrong and grossly exaggerated <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down since he comes and poses to us and i am glad he does as a friend of the employment protection act will he assure us that this is all he intends to do to the employment protection act or are we going to see reductions in the individual parts of the employment protection act when the house reassembles <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like at this time of night to do three things as quickly as i can <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the maiden speakers as others have done <e> <s> secondly i should like to summarise the essence of the attack which we have sought to make on government policy so far tonight and thirdly i should like to deal with one or two aspects of the debate and in particular the impact of government <e>", "<cs> yes my lords <e> <s> of course they were <e> <s> they made up the other per cent <e> <s> my point is that public provision underpins the voluntary social services <e> <s> as i was going on to say even an organisation which one would think was at the very heart of the voluntary area of social service the wrvs raises no money at all of its own <e> <s> so that voluntary provision depends upon the existence of earlier public provision <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble baroness really say that after what i have just said <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may be allowed to say so the noble lord is talking about the wrong thing <e> <s> he is talking about the psbr <e> <s> what the imf really wanted to concentrate on was psbr and if i had enough time i would draw the attention of the house to the recent work of taylor and threadgold published by the bank of england which shows that if only you realise that you can index the psbr you do not have to do all the funny things that the imf forced the labour government to do <e> <s> the reason why that worked and i am going to get on to that soon is not because we cut public expenditure but because at that time we had an effective incomes policy <e> <s> unfortunately in the subsequent year we had an ineffective incomes policy <e> <s> i am quite prepared to admit that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl allow me to intervene <e> <s> i am trying to follow him <e> <s> did i understand him to say just now that the policy of the governent has not affected inflation <e> <s> i thought that it was a common ground between us and that the chancellor of the exchequer had said that the vat added between per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> and the mortgage rate another per cent <e> <s> which makes per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords thought the retail price index meant rising prices <e> <s> the noble earls definition does not include rising prices <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl continue that quotation <e> <s> this is what was pointed out in another place last week <e> <s> the quotation continues and shows that the honourable member of another place wants to see that done so that other areas of public expenditure can expand <e> <s> it is not an argument for overall cuts in public expenditure if one reads the entire quotation <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and in the light of what he has just told us about the importance of wage settlements do the government still expect as they say progressive reduction in the level of wage settlements over the coming year in response to their fiscal and monetary policies <e> <s> if they do not what will be the consequences for the increase in the rpi <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord said some nice things about my speech with most of which i do not agree <e> <s> would he not agree that the very short-term successes of incomes policies coupled with their long-term problems which he spelled out for us are almost more true of our policies in relation to exchange rate control our monetary and fiscal policies over the last years and that that is why we are in the state we are in now <e>", "<cs> my lords we have listened to speakers once and two speakers twice <e> <s> it seems to me that <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect that is what the noble earl said just now <e> <s> when he was speaking first of all he said that the trouble with the retail price index was that if it included those increases in the index which arise out of the budget for example the or per cent <e> <s> increase as a result of vat this is unfair because it is working its way through the economy <e>", "<cs> my lords very well it is working its way through the economy for one year <e> <s> there are two answers to that <e> <s> the first is that people have to pay it in that one year <e> <s> one cannot go along to the man and say i am not paying it because it is working its way through <e> <s> while it is working its way through one must pay it <e> <s> the second answer is that of course it does not work its way through because it generates other cost increases and other changes <e> <s> that point has been made repeatedly on this side of the house <e> <s> as a result of the increases which have been introduced in vat the increases which have been introduced as a result of cuts in the public sector and increases in rates which are also coming through and as a result of increases in mortgage charges which are coming through we shall see a general and continuing increase in the retail price index <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the question of whether or not there has been secondary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the minister for repeating this statement and to welcome several aspects of it three in particular as i understand it <e> <s> i should like to welcome the fact that he does not propose any cuts in the youth opportunities programme and that there will be a natural expansion in that area although i am bound to say that on the governments own figures youth unemployment is likely to double in <e> <s> given that fact one is bound to ask whether this represents a real increase in relation to the problem <e> <s> secondly i think one would like to welcome the provision for the disabled under the job release scheme and thirdly to welcome the maintaining of the community industry scheme <e> <s> in many ways this is a welcome example that there are still cases where in the cabinet despite disagreements the doves can draw level with at least if not pass the hawks <e> <s> for that we on this side are very grateful <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for trying to answer at least three of my five questions <e> <s> i do not want to go into those <e> <s> it leaves me with two which i do not think he even tried to answer and i want to try again <e> <s> he did not say how far the proposals he put before the house today represent an overall saving or an overall increase particularly in real terms in the step <e> <s> he used two figures <e> <s> he said at one stage we were spending million and then million <e> <s> it seems to me that given the governments assessment of a per cent <e> <s> inflation rate which i think is grossly too low but i leave that aside this represents a real reduction <e> <s> does he agree with that and if so to what extent <e> <s> the second question which i ask him was my fifth question which he did not answer <e> <s> i referred him to the last paragraph of the statement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl resumes his seat does he not agree that what is disagreeable and what we on the opposition benches find unacceptable is not that the government have cut taxes but that they have cut direct taxes <e> <s> in order to do so they have raised indirect taxes with the result that the rate of increase in the retail price index has doubled in months <e>", "<cs> my lords despite the feelings on the part of the noble lord lord rochester that this has not been a very original debate and that we seem to have been going over much the same ground i have rather enjoyed it <e> <s> i have also enjoyed the spread of the speeches which i found extremely interesting <e> <s> there will be speakers in this debate eight supporters of the motion of the leader of the opposition two members from the liberal party and one cross-bencher <e> <s> we are going to have three supporters of the government two of whom are ministers <e> <s> so if we could decide on the basis of the voices on this motion tonight i would have no doubt about the result <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble earl aware of the despair in the minds of moderate trade union leaders which statements of that kind are bound to cause <e> <s> is he aware that the tuc feel that they have made representations to this government over and over again since they came to office not only upon the employment bill but also upon economic issues generally yet on not one occasion have this government shown the slightest indication that they are remotely interested in the views of the tuc which is why these things happen <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl concludes that what i am saying is wrong will he tell us of one significant case where this government have done anything as a result of representations made by the tuc <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by saying something nice about the noble earl lord gowrie because he said something very nice about me although i would exchange the nice things he said about me if he would take my advice a little more <e> <s> our advice is that this is not a good bill although i admit that the noble earl has made out a good case for it <e> <s> we believe and it falls to me to say why that this is an irrelevant and dangerous bill which makes an unfair attack at least in its present form upon both workers and their trade unions <e> <s> i must say to your lordships that if the house accepts the amendments we intend to put forward this bill will end its days in quite a reasonable form but in its present form it remains an irrelevant and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i wonder whether he could answer this question <e> <s> i am trying to follow his argument <e> <s> if he accepts that secondary picketing and secondary action is unlawful but that it existed for example at the time of the miners strike in and if he accepts that the act did not prevent it why should this act prevent it in the hard winter which the noble earl says is coming <e>", "<cs> my lords the point i am trying to make is this <e> <s> in indeed from to secondary picketing and secondary action was unlawful yet we had it most notably in during the miners strike <e> <s> the act did not prevent it <e> <s> why should this act prevent it in the hard winter that the noble earl says is coming <e>", "<cs> my lords i was arguing that it fell as a result of donovan and that it fell even sharper in and under a labour government <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord will give way <e> <s> i do not <e>", "<cs> i do not think i made that point my lords <e> <s> the point i was making about strikes and what the bill is doing about strikes will i think be developed by my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> i was saying that this bill is worse than the act because that act gave individual rights whereas this measure takes individual rights away <e> <s> in particular it takes individual rights concerning unfair dismissal away from people who work in small firms <e>", "<cs> it does <e>", "<cs> something like that <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down he is a fair and reasonable man can he help me <e> <s> i listened with great care to what my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton said <e> <s> indeed i had prior knowledge of much of what he was going to say <e> <s> i could not see any way in which he went beyond the position adopted by the labour party in committee and in the house in another place <e> <s> i should like the noble earl either to tell us specifically where he went wrong on this or to take back that remark <e>", "<cs> i must thank the noble lord for the additional assurances that he has given in replying to this amendment <e> <s> if i may say clearly again what it is that we are concerned about it is in the light of other amendments and of other statements and in the general context of the bill the possiblity that this clause might be used in order to have ballots outside the provisions of union rules and in particular outside the provisions of those authorised under the rules of the union to conduct such ballots <e> <s> that is really what we are talking about <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that the noble lord does not understand much about union government <e> <s> for a ballot to be held in a union whether it specifies in terms that ballots can be held there must be some body in the union normally the executive council or it could be the annual conference of the union which has under the general provisions of the rules the kind of authority which enables ballots to be held <e>", "<cs> i want to oppose the motion that clause shall stand part of the bill on three grounds <e> <s> this is the occasion on which we want to develop <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we cannot agree not to vote against the clause standing part <e> <s> i simply want to say that i had no intention of suggesting that i knew more about industrial relations than anybody else in this house <e> <s> what i was trying to say i think <e>", "<cs> i have no desire to rehearse the arguments that we have discussed previously about ballots <e> <s> i think that within the context of clauses dealing with ballots it is probably more sensible to have a secret ballot on the employers premises than as i had thought under the notes to clauses which the government published to confine the ballots to postal ballots <e> <s> i think that ballots on employers premises are often more effective particularly if those ballots can go along frankly with mass meetings <e>", "<cs> i do not want to press this amendment to a division but i simply say this <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord could tell us a little more about his intentions when we come to the question that the clause should stand part <e> <s> to answer the noble lord lord houghton the reason why we have the whole of this clause is because the secretary of state knows only too well that acas as presently constituted will not issue the kind of codes which the government want issued on picketing and the closed shop <e> <s> therefore somebody else has to have the job and the job is given to the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord not agree that in the case of the codes of practice that he is talking about these are codes of practice which derive from acas which is a joint body on which sit representatives of the tuc and representatives of the cbi <e> <s> what we are bothered about is the code of practice which emerges from this government given this governments attitude to picketing and the closed shop <e>", "<cs> we do not wish to make a great deal of this at this time of night but there are one or two points that we should like to raise <e> <s> we are not satisfied obviously with what has been said about the objects of the code of practice particularly in relation to criminal liability and to the role of the police <e> <s> we have had a division on that and we may raise it again on report <e> <s> there are two other issues i should like to raise on this motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill and i hope that the noble and learned lord may answer subsequently <e>", "<cs> if i may just intervene i do not want the noble lord to misunderstand <e> <s> our amendment is not suggesting that anybody cannot seek of course they can seek <e> <s> we are saying that if a person seeks and then is offered a job and is refused that job because he cannot get into a union then the bill should apply <e> <s> nobody is saying you cant seek <e>", "<cs> the point is that we are not saying that anybody should be refused entry into a union <e> <s> of course there is a difference between a craft union and a general union <e> <s> indeed the general unions will take anybody who will come and they are keen for members <e> <s> we are not trying in our amendments nor are the government to affect that in any way <e> <s> what we are saying is that if for some reason a non-craft union refuses entry or exercises its right of expulsion under the rules from our point of view it is more sensible that this bill should begin to apply from the point where the individual in those circumstances has the prospect of a job loss than that anyone who says he cannot get into the t and g or into equity whether or not there is any prospect of a job can allege that there is a prospect of a job and that he is seeking a job in what is in the case of equity an entirely closed shop area and can go along to the tribunal on what we would regard as not being the purposes of this clause <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to know how to react to what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> for part of the time he was saying that where there is a closed shop there is no union card and therefore no job and that that is bad <e> <s> that would be covered by our amendments <e> <s> we are not suggesting that this should not be <e>", "<cs> in the light of the assurances given by the noble and learned <e>", "<cs> i am tempted to say to the noble lord that justifiable restrictive practices are mine and unjustifiable restrictive practices are yours <e> <s> but i shall not say that <e> <s> i am not talking about restrictive practices i am talking about entry control <e> <s> the fact is that a large number of unions that practice entry control are not doing it for reasons of restrictive practices <e> <s> they are very often doing it with the condonation admission and encouragement of the employer himself <e> <s> they are doing it as labour agents to regulate entry to the trade <e> <s> it is not the same as a restrictive practice <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we cannot agree to withdraw the amendment <e> <s> the noble and learned lord said as i predicted he would and as indeed he was bound to say that the bill concerns itself with the notion of reasonableness and why not leave it all to the tribunals to be reasonable <e> <s> well i tried to state the reasons why we do not think that that is an acceptable answer <e> <s> all i can say in addition is that in the first place if this were to be the case not all tribunals would come to the same decision <e> <s> probably various tribunals would come to quite different decisions some of which would be appealed against and some of which would not and to some extent whether the tribunals came to one particular decision rather than another would depend on the side members <e>", "<cs> we are not satisfied by the reply of the noble lord but i do not want to press this to a division <e> <s> i think we want to record our disapproval in the usual way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has chosen a rather poor example we have here a pre-entry closed shop where there is a check-off <e> <s> if such a man ran out which is the term used he could by the payment of two weeks subscription re-enter the union <e>", "<cs> i am very glad that the noble lord lord lyell is to take away the amendment and consider it <e> <s> i hope that when he considers it he will read what i have said and will understand the difference between lapsing and expulsion <e> <s> that is the issue that we are talking about <e> <s> on that basis i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i cannot accept what the noble earl says <e> <s> he has not moved one iota from the position set out in the replies to the amendments <e> <s> he still relies entirely on reasonableness as interpreted by trade tribunals and that is not enough for us <e>", "<cs> i do not think that we can accept entirely what was said by the noble lord lord lyell <e>", "<cs> it is only logical that we should oppose this clause since we opposed clause of the bill and this clause is intended to extract the compensation which arises in circumstances in which trade unions are found to be responsible for unreasonable exclusion or refusal to admit <e> <s> so it is logical that we should oppose this clause <e> <s> but i think there are additional reasons which have arisen out of the debates which we have had in regard to the amendments <e> <s> the government would not give us any reassurance about the very reasonable concern which we expressed in regard to the position of the eat <e> <s> we still believe that the compensation element in this bill is too high <e> <s> it has not been rationally justified <e>", "<cs> is the noble earl really telling us that he now has another reason for this part of the bill <e> <s> way back in another place and to some extent on second reading in this house the government were saying that they actually had evidence that they had surveys and that those surveys indicated that small firms were really hurt by these provisions in the employment protection act <e> <s> then when it was pointed out to them that most of those surveys had a per cent <e> <s> response rate and that at least one of them was run from the conservative central office they changed their minds <e>", "<cs> if the noble lord will allow me i am not talking about what small firms need i am talking about the employees who work in small firms <e> <s> they are the people who need the provisions of the employment protection act not their employers <e>", "<cs> on the contrary i would say to my noble friend look at the governments economic policy <e> <s> that is what is throwing firms out of hampstead <e>", "<cs> so far as i understand the amendments that have been moved they are in fact ruling out any form of union membership agreement at all <e> <s> the governments position is that they want to narrow the circumstances in which union membership agreements are lawful <e> <s> it shall not just be as it is at the moment an exception for those who have genuine religious convictions <e> <s> there should also be exceptions for those who have deeply held personal convictions and there should also be exceptions for those who are existing members <e> <s> there should also be an ability for individual employees to say that they object to joining particular unions <e>", "<cs> i was only shaking my head because i thought that if the noble lord lord orr-ewing took that view he should have put down an amendment to that effect <e>", "<cs> i hope that the committee will accept that i am sorry that i must ask the committee and my noble friend lord houghton to look again at the bill and look at the amendment <e> <s> what we are doing is leaving conscience in <e> <s> what we are taking out is other deeply-held personal conviction so that the clause if the committee voted for our amendment would read <e>", "<cs> i am not convinced by the noble and learned lord <e> <s> we are trying to say that there is a very clear difference between people objecting to trade unions <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord does not seem to know whether they are necessary or unnecessary <e> <s> i consider that they are unnecessary and that therefore we should take them out <e> <s> of course we tried to do something about other aspects of the bill but if you fail to do something about other aspects of the bill then you try to do something about this aspect of the bill and this is the narrowest single area in which we could ask for some reassurance <e> <s> indeed at the dispatch box a few days ago the noble lord lord lyell said something rather nice about the issue of subscriptions when we were talking about exclusions and expulsions <e> <s> he said that the government would think again about subscriptions <e> <s> what we are saying is that it is quite impossible even if the government are right that there are other deeply-held personal convictions which should be put into the bill other than religion that even they could say that a refusal to pay the money is a matter of conscience <e>", "<cs> it is not fair of my noble friends on this side to ask noble lords on the other side for figures <e> <s> they are not using figures tonight <e> <s> they are using anecdotal evidence <e> <s> they are as unconvincing as ever and i would not wish to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i think the position is quite simple <e> <s> we took the view that the government were going to say what they said in another place and point out that this is a totally impracticable and ridiculous amendment <e> <s> they seem to be thinking again so we shall come back on report <e> <s> we oppose this <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i cannot accept what the noble earl has said <e> <s> he can say if he likes that he does not care what the evidence says but he cannot say that he has the evidence on his side and when we demonstrate as we have done repeatedly tonight that the balance of evidence is against him he cannot then say that he does not care <e> <s> he talks about small firms and there being no evidence that small firms are worse in unfair dismissal cases than large firms <e> <s> the best piece of evidence and there is quite a lot comes from the department of employment for which shows that firms with fewer than employees lost per cent <e> <s> of their cases at industrial tribunals whereas firms with over employees lost only per cent <e> <s> of their cases <e>", "<cs> we wish to oppose clause <e> <s> we have not heard that there is any case for restricting the rights of firms employing fewer than employees and for allowing them to dismiss unfairly up to two years <e> <s> no protection has been given for lump labour though we moved an amendment to that effect <e> <s> we have not moved one of our amendments because of the time of night which dealt with the fact of moving to a fixed-term contract and reducing it to a period of one year <e> <s> for all those reasons i do not think we feel like voting for this clause this evening <e>", "<cs> in view of the lateness of the night i beg leave to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i will not delay your lordships for very long but we have to oppose this clause <e> <s> the result of this clause is a whole series of barriers which women must get through in order to return to work after maternity <e> <s> the situation is first that the notification must be in writing <e> <s> it is not clear who tells the woman this or what happens if she forgets or does not know it <e> <s> if it is not given in writing she has not got over the first hurdle <e> <s> she must specify the date of confinement <e> <s> it is not clear who tells her this or whether she has to buy a copy of the act or what <e> <s> she must confirm that she wants to return days after the estimated date of pregnancy <e> <s> in our amendment we have tried to get the government to say that there should be some standard form <e> <s> the government say no <e> <s> that would be bureaucracy <e> <s> therefore there is no way of telling whether the woman can understand the request made of her <e> <s> there is no clear way of knowing what would happen if she did not get the reminder or if it was sent to her or if her letter was lost in the post <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> i really do not know how we are to please the noble earl <e> <s> if we ask for minor things he says they are minor things and not worth having <e> <s> if we ask for major things he says they are far too significant to give to us because they go to the heart of the bill <e> <s> if we say that we merely want to declare for him in a clear way what we think he intends he says it is there already <e> <s> unless of course it is for the small firms he can always put it in and make it as precise as the very dickens for the small firms but not for the women small or large and not for the small shopkeeper <e>", "<cs> i want to say just one or two very quick things about this clause which in general terms we are very glad to see there and which we welcome <e> <s> i remember that the noble earl said in response to a question of mine in an earlier debate that he had done something as a result of pressures from the trades union congress and that it was unfair of me to say that he had not <e> <s> he trotted out time off for ante-natal care and i am very glad to see it there and we welcome it <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we have to start carping again at this stage gently <e> <s> we regard what is being done in clause as small-scale meanness <e> <s> it restricts the guaranteed pay provisions to no more than five days in a rolling period of three months as against the present fixed period of three months <e> <s> this is a technical issue to many people but it is really quite simple <e> <s> it means in effect that workers are not likely to get <e>", "<cs> on that point may i quote what the institute of personnel management said <e>", "<cs> we wish to oppose this clause <e> <s> the government have said that the aim of this clause is as it were to stretch a kind of penumbra around the area of the closed shop so as to say that if closed shops are only to be related to the carefully defined union membership agreements so far as dismissal is concerned <e>", "<cs> not at all <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will allow me to intervene i should like to say that i do not want to upset him unduly <e> <s> i was trying to say that it is in fact impractical and i would add unjustifiable to tell a member of a union perhaps a man with or years membership that the law prevents him from going to the aid of other members of his union <e> <s> that seems to me to be both unjustifiable and quite impractical <e> <s> it does not mean to say that because the law permits him to go to the aid of other members that the entire million members of the transport and general workers union will turn up at every picket <e> <s> the fact is that sometimes it is extremely difficult to get anyone to picket <e> <s> picketing is not all that popular nor all that easy <e> <s> i am suggesting that it is impossible to stop some members perhaps half a dozen of a union going to the aid of other members of the union <e> <s> the law should limit itself to what is possible <e>", "<cs> i do not want to help the government but the governments bill would allow every single member of british leyland in oxford to turn up on a picket line in oxford <e> <s> that would be the mass picket of the year <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot do that <e> <s> i am thankful to the noble earl for not making the speech that he was about to make <e> <s> it enables me briefly to answer some of the things which have been said behind <e> <s> as far as my noble friend lady burton is concerned she will have no trouble with me she is still a pin-up of mine <e> <s> i am not threatening her with anything <e> <s> nobody is threatening her with anything except perhaps with not agreeing with her <e> <s> that is all <e> <s> i hope that we can answer some of her fears <e>", "<cs> not being a minister of the crown i do not have to read broackes <e> <s> i am sorry the noble earl does have to read him but with respect i should like to get back to this amendment <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot withdraw it <e> <s> i quite see that he feels it may go too widely and i listened with great care to his concern <e> <s> he is concerned as i understand it about bussing <e> <s> i would suggest to him that bussing on the whole by and large is an unofficial activity and that what we are concerned about here is official activity <e> <s> i wonder whether he would think again or whether he could say whether he would look favourably on another amendment if we were to put one down at report stage dealing with official activities <e>", "<cs> i am thankful to the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls for his intervention because i have obviously not made myself clear <e> <s> he mentioned a narrow point and a wider point <e> <s> what i was saying on the narrow point when i said they will not do it was that the trade unions would not defy the law <e> <s> that is what they would not do <e> <s> what i was saying was that in the interests of industrial peace and of disciplining the picket line they ought to be able to draft in the convenors <e> <s> they ought to be able to draft in trade union officials from other regions <e>", "<cs> on the basis of the noble earls undertaking on that point i am very pleased to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the government would not expect us to allow this clause to go through without opposition <e> <s> the clause is designed to limit picketing to the place of work and to limit the role of trade union officials <e> <s> we have tried to argue in the series of debates on our amendments that there is no case for this and we have sought to suggest in particular in respect to limiting the role and scope of the trade union officials that this is not in the governments interest even given the general purposes of their bill <e> <s> nothing has been given us on these points <e> <s> all these amendments have been moved <e> <s> nothing has been promised <e> <s> therefore at this stage despite the time of night we must force this matter to a division <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we cannot accept the answers of the noble and learned lord <e> <s> as i have said it is a fortuitous fact whether there is a contract <e> <s> we have given many examples of when there need not be a contract and from what he said the noble and learned lord has actually suggested to employers that they should not have contracts and should tell their workers that they have not got contracts and that therefore they cannot use secondary action <e> <s> i am afraid we cannot withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> despite the lateness of the hour the committee would not expect us to let this clause go by without saying something <e> <s> we must recite very quickly how we see this clause very much as it was when it began <e> <s> the clause removes the overall protection of section of tulra where strikes involve breach of commercial contract and involve workers not party to the original dispute <e> <s> we see no case for the removal of that general protection <e> <s> this clause promises to establish an extremely limited area of secondary action protection on the most stringent conditions <e> <s> indeed many members of the government party opposite have said tonight that they believe that the conditions are so stringent that in fact there is no cover at all <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has been kind and stated clearly the intention of the government that primary action should not be affected <e> <s> if it turns out that the noble lord lord wedderburn is right and the government are wrong and that primary action is affected may i therefore ask him will the government then introduce legislation along some lines or other immediately to protect primary action <e>", "<cs> the noble lord was wrong <e> <s> he was looking at the wrong place in his notes that is all <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord alport will be pleased to know that i have found my place <e> <s> we do not support this clause <e> <s> we wish to dissent from it but i do not wish to burden the committee with another speech <e>", "<cs> i am sorry that the noble earl cannot go any further <e> <s> i want to say just two very quick things <e> <s> first on what he said about inter-union competition i would argue that outside the very difficult area of union recognition inter-union competition largely as a result of the activities of the tuc since is nowhere near the problem that it was <e> <s> so far as the recognition problem is concerned i agree with the letter which the noble earl read from mr mortimer of course but there we must say that as i remember it that letter was written at the time of the <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold up the committee but we cannot accept this clause and i merely want to say so <e> <s> there are other issues on which we have not moved amendments dealing for example with the road haulage wages affair and other issues and because we <e>", "<cs> yes it is <e>", "<cs> i understand if i have got it right that we are still on <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for that answer <e> <s> i hope he will accept that when i put the question down i did not know that in fact the government intended to publish an account of the first part of this study in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that what the survey shows is that the overwhelming majority of small firms have no problems about maternity return <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that all that the survey shows is that he only needs to know once every years <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed with the governments reply <e> <s> with respect as i understand it they have given us two pseudo-reasons for rejecting the amendment <e> <s> the first relates to trade union rule books <e> <s> i note that the government do not quote any trade union rule books <e> <s> there are trade union rule books where people have a trip were they are liable to expulsion <e> <s> however if people continue not <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid we cannot agree to withdraw this amendment <e> <s> i should like to start very quickly because i do not want to retrace the whole argument as that would abuse the time of the house <e> <s> it seems to me that the noble earl lord gowrie really did not answer the amendment <e> <s> it is rather strange to say that he would have answered the amendment because i thought that was the job of the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and of the noble lord lord lyell <e> <s> what he sought to answer was why we should not put down this amendment on clause and i would have thought that having listened to him the noble lord lord robbins can see what we are up against <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how long it would take if you went through this procedure <e> <s> i am not able to say how long these things take <e> <s> what i am saying is that in fact the case he was talking about was dealt with by conciliation and the man got his card back <e> <s> he might have got his card hack from the independent review committee if i am allowed to say that because we do give cards back but you will not get your card back under this clause <e> <s> all you will get is compensation <e> <s> therefore for all these reasons i am afraid we must press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords when we raised the very difficult problem about what would be the relationship between the tribunals and the common law courts in respect of trade union expulsions i understood noble lords on the opposite side of the house to say that in some way these would continue <e> <s> i would want them to continue <e> <s> my problem is what their relationship will be but that is their problem <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the lateness of the hour and the length of the marshalled list i withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to say that it is nice of him to quote me however selectively but will he quote himself again <e> <s> he mentioned i think the orc poll but as i understood it and i am asking for clarification here he conflated three different reasons which people had for saying that they should not be in a closed shop <e> <s> i think he said moral political and conscience and he added the three reasons together and made per cent <e> <s> that is not fair is it <e> <s> for one question <e>", "<cs> my lords there were three reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords it is with very great respect that i cross swords with the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor on this point but let me first deal with the points raised by the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> he said first that other people have been consulted <e> <s> he said that he got his per cent <e> <s> as the result of consultation <e> <s> i should like to know whether those consultations included the trades union congress the trade unions and those who have the practice of running union membership agreements <e> <s> i do not think that is the case <e> <s> nobody who knows about closed shops would have advised him to have ballots of this kind <e> <s> the figure of so per cent <e> <s> is normal where unions recruit or even per cent <e> <s> of membership without the closed shop before they go forward and demand a closed shop <e> <s> that has nothing whatever to do with the figure of per cent <e> <s> in the context of a ballot <e> <s> so i do not think there is any connection with that at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed at what the government have said but not surprised <e> <s> the noble lord is quite right there is an ideological element in this the work of dr stanworth shows that this is the case that the attitude of small firms is related to their ideological beliefs i not say prejudices about the government that introduced this legislation <e> <s> that is a fact <e> <s> the noble baroness lady seear is perfectly right in saying that the government would do much better if they told people the facts about unfair dismissal legislation rather than pandering to the prejudices of small firms in this way <e> <s> all the evidence indicates that small firms have a whole range ofprejudices not just about unfair dismissal legislation but about the effects of taxation legislation and planning authority rules <e> <s> the evidence indicates that they are absolutely obsessed by all kinds of factual inaccuracies about the world which surrounds them <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very disappointed in what the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl makes four points <e> <s> he says first that we are better off in many respects than other countries <e> <s> so in some respects we are but in general in other countries they do not have qualifying periods so that we are not universally better off <e> <s> secondly he says in the real world he does not feel there would be much resentment of this <e> <s> if he would look in the postbag that i am sure he gets as i do from womens organisations from the equal opportunities commission from all kinds of pressure groups in the womens movement he will find that this is an aspect of the bill which is particularly resented by them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord does not help <e> <s> if he looks at the amendment he will see that we are saying by reason only <e> <s> we are not saying there would be a general policy to force people into unions in the way he suggests <e> <s> obviously if there was an attempt to force people into unions as part of a whole series of motives the tribunal would say that it was compulsion <e>", "<cs> my lords i wonder whether noble lords on the other side of the house have any idea of the sense of despair which they send to us when they make speeches of that kind <e> <s> we have never denied that there are people on picket lines who do not want to maintain order <e> <s> we have never denied that there are rent-a-crowds we have never denied that there are people interfering in industrial disputes for their own purposes <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl is ceasing to surprise me he is fencing with us now <e> <s> he knows very well if he has certain objections to the construction which might be put on the words we have proposed in the amendment that we are simply asking for a commitment in principle <e> <s> there may be other ways of phrasing what we propose in order to rule out certain ambiguities <e> <s> the great majority of people coming from outside in recent disputes would have been ruled out for example they would have been ruled out in the case of the flying pickets in and and picketers coming from the private sector of the steel industry would have been ruled out earlier this year <e> <s> it is no good just talking about the groundswell of opinion although on the issue of groundswell and whether one can legislate by groundswell we shall discuss that when we come to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a charitable man i assume that the misunderstanding of our position is innocent misunderstanding and not misrepresentation <e> <s> i would only say that we have never suggested and never supported violence <e> <s> we have said repeatedly from this side of the house that we would not support illegal unlawful picketing even on the basis of this law when this bill becomes the law <e> <s> we have repeatedly said that we believe that there are ample powers for the police affecting virtually all the acts complained of in respect of mass picketing and flying picketing and we have always said that we would agree in broad terms with the evidence which the chief constables gave to the employment committee of the other place on this matter <e> <s> so we cannot be represented at any time as supporting violence or intimidation or unlawful picketing of any kind at all and with the possibility of trespassing on the time of the house i must say that yet once again <e>", "<cs> my lords it falls to me to explain the view which we on this side of the house take of this amendment and i want to address myself to the amendment even though it would be very tempting to address myself to the clause <e> <s> as the house will know we have put down a whole series of amendments to the clause and we shall be moving them later tonight <e> <s> i must say that much that has been said in favour of the clause by supporters of the clause and of the government on the other side of the house has not made the situation easy for us <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the cbi supported this amendment <e> <s> i am sorry if i gave that impression <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the noble and learned lord cannot see his way to accepting this modest amendment <e> <s> i could take the view that if it is in the clause and it is declaratory of the existing position then he might perhaps give the trade unionists a little reassurance by allowing it into his clause <e> <s> but i shall not say that <e> <s> i would rather say that one can give examples <e> <s> it may be the case that he believes that some of the examples i gave would be covered by the clause but there is also the case which is quite clearly specified in the amendment where we say whether by financial means or otherwise <e> <s> it could be for example people who were giving additional credit facilities to an employer involved in a dispute or there could be people who were forgoing insisting on certain contractual obligations to an employer involved in a dispute <e> <s> they would be in fact assisting him quite materially but it need not be a matter of direct supply <e> <s> we can give examples and we think that the government should have accepted this amendment but i do not intend to press it at this time of night <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i sympathise with the noble lord lord kilmarnock <e> <s> the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor ranged all over the subject with great enjoyment and in several languages but once again he gave no reason why the amendment should not be passed <e> <s> i despair of them <e> <s> we shall not divide but we shall not withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that on this motion the house would want us to congratulate the noble earl for having reached the end of the road on this bill which he has piloted through with his usual combination of urbanity and competence <e> <s> we on our side of the house would only wish that such competence had been put to better use <e> <s> to us this remains a reactionary an unrealistic and an irrelevant mixture of measures and the noble earl would not want us to join him in the restrained jubilation which he will no doubt show <e> <s> the emotions running through our minds at this time at least running through mine really are three a feeling of frustration a feeling of despair and a feeling of foreboding <e>", "<cs> my lords as far as is possible i always like to agree with the noble earl when i can and i should like to start by agreeing with him in deciding to take these two codes together though moving first of all the picketing code because they do cover a very common area in fact their approach is identical and i think it is right that we should have a general debate about them <e> <s> i agree also that we are not here to rehearse the arguments which we rehearsed some time ago about the employment act <e> <s> we are prepared to leave that act to heaven and see what comes about <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him whether he still agrees that the government gave sufficient time to consider the provisions of these codes in the light of the views of the house of commons select committee on employment <e> <s> that committee said <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble baroness sits down may i ask her whether or not she agrees with me that the essence of the distinction is whether the code is based upon agreement <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case how does the noble earl explain that in the code of practice on closed shops on several occasions the government are in fact defining what unreasonable exclusion and expulsion might mean <e>", "<cs> my lords while the noble earl is on his feet will be give us some evidence of that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down <e>", "<cs> i simply want to ask the noble earl whether he will give one simple undertaking namely in respect of section f of the picketing code where <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble lord lord renton for giving us this opportunity to debate the green paper <e> <s> i do so personally particularly because i was sad not to be here last week when the house discussed the closed shop a subject i always like to debate <e> <s> as i shall point out it is most appropriate for a number of reasons that we should be discussing the governments green paper on ail fools day <e> <s> i am enthusiastic to discuss the green paper and i am keen that we should bring out many of its issues and we on this side may be slightly more enthusiastic than noble lords opposite that the issues in it should have a full and frank discussion <e>", "<cs> i am a fair man even when i am being heckled and so i shall begin by assuming that there is something in the arguments <e> <s> let us look first at those that were tried and failed in <e> <s> i have in mind for example proposals to extend liability for damages in court in the context of a trade dispute proposals to encourage the legal enforcement of procedure agreements that is what is meant as the noble lord lord renton rightly said and all those restrictions on industrial action that are mixed up with notions about essential services the public interest and so on <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> no my lords i do not think so because we are talking about procedure agreements <e> <s> there is no reason why an employer and a trade union should not sign a legally enforceable procedure agreement which would be enforceable on the trade union for breach of contract <e> <s> the fact is that they do not do that because we do not have that system and that derives from our absence of fixed-term agreements and our recognition of a distinction between disputes of right and disputes of interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down would he not agree that although i proposed in my speech no further legal changes and i do not think that he did in the final section of my speech i suggested that what is really needed is a more stable system of pay determination in the public sector <e> <s> i am sure the noble earl remembers the first occasion when he and i debated in this house <e> <s> it was upon a motion advancing specific proposals a motion which i put down in i think <e> <s> when he sums up is the noble earl going to refer to the need for a more stable system of pay determination <e>", "<cs> my lords before my noble friend sits down would he agree with me on the issue of polish solidarity that of course virtually all the actions of solidarity would be quite unlawful in this country <e> <s> it is very doubtful that if there is a trade dispute in poland under the terms of the act the action of solidarity would be largely enforced by off-site picketing and forms of secondary action which would undoubtedly be quite outside section of the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i can assure the noble earl that the noble lord lord wedderburn is in no sense and in no way in favour of a positive rights system <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl tell us whether his statement represents a significant advance on previous provisions <e> <s> if it does not is he in the very near future to tell us whether the government are in his own words to work towards a situation in which all unemployed school-leavers get some vocational preparation as resources permit <e> <s> when are we to have a statement to that effect if the last statement was not so intended <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish at the outset to thank the noble earl lord gowrie for offering us the incorporated version which will be available in the vote office and for the explanatory notes <e> <s> i wish also to congratulate him on what is for him i think a vintage performance <e> <s> as i listened to him summarising paragraphs to of <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl allow me <e> <s> would it not be true to say that an alternative suggestion is that of course it is far too easy to get exemption and that is one of the things that is wrong with the act and indeed that despite the fact that all these people have got exemption we still do not have nearly enough training <e>", "<cs> i am sure the noble lord lord lyell has done his best but i do not find his explanations very convincing <e> <s> indeed he seems to have two explanations the first being that he will not do it very often rather like the lady who was raped and was told <e>", "<cs> i wish to intervene only to say that i am afraid i could not agree with what the noble lord lord mottistone was saying <e> <s> it seems to me that he believes that the tremendous discipline of market forces produces training <e> <s> i think that tremendous discipline just produces poaching <e> <s> so far as concerns what the government say is germaine to this i understand the noble lord lord lyell to say that the amendment is largely unimportant and irrelevant but that there are certain residual functions in clearing up the results of abolishing an itb which the msc might like to have <e> <s> i should be in favour of their having something and therefore i would be against this amendment <e>", "<cs> without attempting to follow the noble earl into that issue i do not think that the noble baroness was saying that these people or bodies are uninterested <e> <s> of course they are all interested <e> <s> what she was asking was what would be the mechanism and why at this point the government want to dismantle in effect in the areas where they do dismantle it the only effective mechanism we have <e> <s> i think we are going to take that up in subsequent debates and so i will now return to this particular amendment <e> <s> many of the things the noble earl said one must have sympathy with <e> <s> this amendment takes one individual small area where as he rightly said the industrial training hoards have done a very great deal <e> <s> it is a very important and vital area where the government as he rightly said wish to see a six-fold increase and it is saying surely in this area you would be prepared to say in a statute that you are going to take the question of what happens to unified vocational preparation schemes specifically into account when deciding whether or not to get rid of a particular training board <e>", "<cs> in reply i am very disappointed with what the noble earl has said <e> <s> he has a narrow reason and he has a wide reason <e> <s> it seems to me that between his two reasons one cannot get anything through that there is no way through <e> <s> the narrow reason is better than the wide reason <e> <s> it is quite true that one could have the case in which one wanted to run a particular industry down and if the noble earl had said he wanted to take this aspect away and think about it and perhaps suggest a change of wording that would have been different <e> <s> but no <e> <s> it is the wide reason that is the crucial reason the noble earl does not want anything on the statute which specifies what the criteria shall be <e>", "<cs> we must oppose clause stand part because this is the heart of the bill <e> <s> the object of this part of the bill is to change the position so that the manpower services commission no longer proposes what happens to industrial training boards and the secretary of state disposes a relationship which was established under the previous acts <e> <s> we have to say why the relationship was the correct one and why it is that the government have still failed to explain their reasons for change <e>", "<cs> the committee would not expect me to agree with what the noble earl has just said <e> <s> he has not cleared up my difficulties and i doubt whether he has cleared up the difficulties of my noble friend lord hatch of lusby <e> <s> i must say that i do not like disagreeing with what the noble lord lord mottistone says but i do not think that my noble friend lord hatch went too wide <e> <s> i believe that this clause is the heart and the centre and the pulse of this bill <e> <s> what we are saying is that this bill is designed to change the fundamental way of running industrial training in this country <e> <s> the point at which to make that as sharp as we can is at this point in this debate on a motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> the answer is yes and no <e> <s> yes of course i am proposing that there should be a power for a general levy <e> <s> yes of course the deployment of that general levy or the training which would be financed by that general levy might not benefit particular employers <e> <s> that is the case with the industrial training board system as it at present exists <e> <s> so yes that is true <e> <s> however i would not regard that as narrow i would regard that as extremely broad and very necessary <e>", "<cs> in view of the fact that the amendment which follows is also an important amendment and indeed in some ways a more important one i do not intend to press this amendment <e> <s> the noble earl has not convinced me <e> <s> when he says nice things about me they are always followed by nasty things <e> <s> i suppose it is the same on this side <e> <s> the main point is that we are not satisfied with voluntarism <e> <s> but i am prepared to withdraw this amendment <e>", "<cs> i support the amendment because it is absolutely true as the noble lord lord rochester said that this is the closest we can get and it is very close to a consensus alternative mechanism <e> <s> it is not a mechanism which is as radical and far-reaching as the previous one which i did not press but it is a consensus mechanism and a very good mechanism too <e>", "<cs> i do not want to misrepresent the noble lord the minister and i do not believe that the liberal party want to misrepresent him <e> <s> we are not saying that because the minister does not want a board he does not want to do anything <e> <s> there are all kinds of things the minister wants to do by laws <e> <s> he wants to do something about strikes which i do not want to do anything about but that does not mean that i do not want to do anything about strikes in a different sense <e>", "<cs> the version expressed by the noble lord lord mottistone of what i call the poachers revolt in is not my version <e> <s> the act was not introduced because there was a great rash of levies over per cent <e> <s> even the levy he mentioned was of only per cent <e> <s> the act did not become unpopular because the levies were too high not by my version of the events <e> <s> there was a poachers revolt <e> <s> from the point of view of many people the trouble with the act was that in effect you could not get exemption there was no way out <e> <s> if you did not train they took the money away from you <e> <s> that is what i liked about the act <e> <s> once we got rid of the act and replaced it with the act we got into all the bureaucracy which arises from the need to ensure that exemption is not a fiddle <e> <s> that is why we have now got to a position where some kind of case can be made out for passing it all back to the boards and that is my reply to the noble lord lord mottistone <e>", "<cs> i am quite sure that if i could follow the noble lord i would agree that the amendment is technical <e> <s> as it is it is incomprehensible <e> <s> whether it be roman or arabic it is gibberish <e> <s> but let us pass it <e>", "<cs> i did not want to intervene in this debate but after listening to what the noble earl has said i feel that i must <e> <s> the noble earl says that even if the darkest cloud is in the sky you must not cry you must not sigh you spread a little happiness as he goes by <e> <s> and what does he do <e> <s> he turns down this modest little amendment <e> <s> with great respect it is not enough to say that it has been in a statute since <e> <s> it was not intended that governments would go around winding up industrial training boards but that is the intention of this government and he cannot tell us that he will not wind up any of them <e> <s> so one cannot go back to <e>", "<cs> the noble earl said that we were entering i think the exciting area of enterprise zones <e> <s> i would have preferred what he said earlier on terminal levies namely the somewhat clouty situation of enterprise zones <e> <s> we have to debate for a moment or two the issue of enterprise zones so that we can see why it should be the case that industrial training legislation should not apply to enterprise zones <e> <s> it may be small it may be petty but we have to debate for a moment what is the theory of enterprise zones <e>", "<cs> i am afraid i must press this amendment <e> <s> the position is as described by the noble earl <e> <s> in effect the employers have been given a veto where money is concerned <e> <s> you need a positive decision to spend money and you cannot get a positive decision to raise a levy unless you have a majority of the employers <e> <s> that as i take it is what paragraph means and that as i take it is what the minister thinks paragraph means <e> <s> the noble lord thinks it means something else but on the basis that it means what the government say it means i must divide the committee <e>", "<cs> my lords with respect i think that the noble earl is actually replying to the second amendment <e> <s> this is the first amendment <e> <s> it is not even technical it is a matter of punctuation <e>", "<cs> my lords i am a little confused by this amendment <e> <s> perhaps the noble lord can help me <e> <s> i followed the noble lord in fact i voted for him at the committee stage on his original amendment <e> <s> it was in fact amendment no <e> <s> at committee stage <e> <s> the intention of that amendment as i understood it was that if a training board had not got enough money the treasury had to put the money in <e> <s> i could see that <e> <s> it seemed reasonable <e> <s> the noble lord has got it on the marshalled list this time and it is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> therefore we are going to get a chance to run round that track again <e>", "<cs> i would have done <e>", "<cs> my lords may i just ask the noble lord whether he is wanting to press amendment no <e> <s> because i still do not see the connection between amendments nos <e> <s> and <e> <s> if he wants to press amendment no <e> <s> i am with him but he has not spoken about it <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to support this amendment with every possible force because it seems to me it has been moved with admirable modesty and clarity by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> i believe it is an unanswerable amendment <e> <s> we are not asking for the specification of published criteria to define the aims or outputs for acceptable training arrangements which was that part of the previous amendment moved at the committee stage which as has been said was objected to by noble lords on the other side <e> <s> we are taking out the extension of the area to cover for example the public service that has gone <e> <s> we are moving as a separate amendment those parts of the original amendment which dealt with the raising of monies <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps the noble lord lord mottistone will look at the position last time <e> <s> i still maintain that there was a difference between us but that he was wrong <e> <s> but if he will look at the position now there is no difference between us and as the noble earl has said it does not really matter whether we have his words or the words that are proposed in the bill <e> <s> the present position is in effect a kind of x y situation that there should be an equal number of employers and trade unionists plus a number of educationists <e> <s> what he is proposing is that there should be a number of persons who are employers and an equal number of persons who are trade unionists <e> <s> there is in effect no difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to pause just for a moment at this stage at this time of night to specify as i see it the nature of our disagreements <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble and learned lord agree that so far as the question asked by the noble lord lord orr-ewing is concerned there can be no case for altering the present law since the european court took a decision on the basis of the previous law which the government have now changed and which i understand the secretary of state said on the publication of the european courts decision would in fact cover the case very well <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising to the house in general and to the noble lord lord wolfenden in particular if this debate goes on beyond six oclock because i am afraid that at that stage i have to leave to fulfil another engagement <e> <s> perhaps it will not and i hope that it will not in that context i shall try to be as brief as i can <e> <s> as regards my own remarks i should like to do four things <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate the noble lord on another valuable report one of many valuable reports that he has produced over the years <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he could reassure me in what i seem to see as a conflict in the direction of his criticisms <e> <s> is it not true that most of the suggestions he proposes want to make the directive more vague and imprecise for example what he says about article but that one or two seem to want it to be more specific <e> <s> for example in article he wants to specify a way of making external organisations responsible and most particularly in article as i understand him he wants to insist that the representatives should be democratically elected <e> <s> this would make it much more precise and surely that is in conflict with the other things he says <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he not agree that i made no attack upon her majestys judges and no attack upon conservative lawyers but merely described their point of view <e> <s> my attack was on her majestys government <e> <s> will he not agree that it was because of what her majestys government said or what their representatives said before this committee <e> <s> which was that they could not agree with the committee first because there was no agreement on both sides to do anything and secondly because this would impose a single inflexible system <e> <s> all i said was that if that was their view i wished that they had taken that view on the employment act <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl agree that at the rate at which the present government are producing the next trade upturn five years will be ample <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord spens for initiating what i am sure will be an interesting debate on an unexceptionable motion <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot say that all the arguments he has deployed in support of his motion are new but that is because i have had the fortune of listening to him with his usual force and clarity deploying them in the select committee on unemployment <e> <s> i am afraid i cannot say that i have been persuaded by them but at least i have been persuaded to think rather more about why i do not find myself persuaded by them <e> <s> secondly i should like to apologise to the house for the fact that due to the fact that this debate has been called at somewhat short notice i am afraid i shall have to leave during some period of it and indeed because of the statement we heard from the government earlier this afternoon i shall have to leave quite soon after i sit down <e> <s> i apologise for that in advance <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not say that the employer did not have to pay <e> <s> i said that in the overwhelming majority of redundancies in the industry which the noble lord took particularly as an example no redundancy pay is available <e> <s> let me turn to the other aspects of employment protection <e> <s> there is a wealth of evidence most of which we put before the house at the time of the employment protection bill to show that the overwhelming majority of employers do not give employment protection legislation in respect of unfair dismissal or equal pay or equal opportunity or maternity rights as anything like the most important reason why they do not take people on for work <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a lone interesting and good-tempered debate in fact a debate in which we have seen this house at its best <e> <s> it falls to me to make the penultimate speech from this side and i wanted originally to do three things first to reply to the points made against the noble baroness lady david which were not anticipated on this side of the house by other speakers secondly to advance certain points of my own about certain aspects of training which she did <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for giving a faithful account of the reasons which the under-secretary of state in another place gave on monday <e> <s> indeed it is quite clear that they read the same brief with a similar lack of enthusiasm <e> <s> the under-secretary of state in another place in the middle of a counter-attack by the neanderthal men on the back-benches of his party blamed the labour government for this nasty little thing because he said that a labour minister signed this directive in <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord really suggesting that two wrongs make a right <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he allow me to say that he has mentioned though not answered my questions one two three six and seven mainly by repeating the examples from his speech but he has made no attempt to answer my questions four and five <e> <s> would he think again and give me answers in writing particularly to questions four and five <e> <s> the noble lord is very fond of referring to our long ago tutorials and the essays that he read to me <e> <s> perhaps he w ill recall that after he had finished reading an essay i sometimes said to him what did you read for that essay <e> <s> well he did not read the directive <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house are very pleased to be able to congratulate the government on some movement in some direction in one area <e> <s> if this is not a u-turn if it is not an l-turn it is at least a departure from the straight narrow path of monetary lunacy <e> <s> at least we arc not being told in this critical area that the best government is the least government <e> <s> at last the government have taken on some responsibilities <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask him for an answer to the question asked by my noble friend lord stewart of fulham <e> <s> his question was really about the cost to local authorities <e> <s> this will undoubtedly mean an additional significant cost to local authorities <e> <s> maybe at this moment the noble earl cannot tell us what the governments policy on that will be but if he cannot then surely he should tell us subsequently <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord cockfield for his careful lucid if slightly sepulchral exposition of a thoroughly bad case <e> <s> i must say that towards the end of what he said i was particularly concerned about the way in which he appears to be making haste slowly in his seven league boots and telling us how there may be a son of a son of this bill still in the womb of time <e> <s> but as he rightly said we have to consider the bill as it is before us <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble lord has the book there <e> <s> if he has he will find that it goes on to say that over a very wide area it is an essential element in trade unions achieving any collective bargaining influence at all <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder whether he would answer this question <e> <s> on the four examples that he gave of the differences between germany and ourselves would he not agree on reflection that they do not prove very much <e> <s> the first one on strike ballots <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble earl for his reply because in some ways he has reassured us on this side of the committee but not entirely <e> <s> i must answer one or two questions which have been asked <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says to me who is gennard <e> <s> he has clearly never heard of gennard <e> <s> i do not know whether gennard has heard of him <e> <s> gennard is a professor at strathclyde university who has written widely in the area of industrial relations <e> <s> more important in this respect today gennard is the man the government rely on except of course they do not give us the evidence <e>", "<cs> it would be a nice thing to do with an amendment to say that no one individual should be suffocated <e> <s> no i did not say that <e> <s> i did not say that i am not concerned about injustice because there is only a small amount of it about <e> <s> i did not say that <e> <s> what i did say and i say this in reply to the noble lord lord aylestone was that we ought to have trade unionists and employers involved <e> <s> he seemed to be saying at one stage that they will not have the evidence <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is as ever helpful but he does not answer the case <e> <s> as i understand it he is saying that he cannot accept the amendment because the kind of evidence which will be required is advice on the exercise of discretion and that is the kind of advice for which you do not need the judicial process <e> <s> it seems to me that in practice that sort of advice will be about the facts advice based on some system of cross-examination in which you attempt to establish what happened with one group of people saying one thing and another group saying another and in the end you will take a decision on the balance of whatever you believe to be the case and accordingly you will tender your advice to the secretary of state on the exercise of his discretion <e> <s> that is all a matter of fact and i should have thought a matter very fit for the exercise of the judicial process <e>", "<cs> i think that we are getting closer and closer to the point <e> <s> it is perfectly true that anyone can give examples from precedent and the way that administrative decisions have been taken <e> <s> it is absolutely right of course there are administrative decisions arising out of the pneumoconiosis issue and the employment agencies issue in which the way that the noble earl has described it is the way in which it has been done <e> <s> there are also many other tribunals such as rent tribunals and tribunals dealing with social security payments and unemployment benefits where the judicial process is carried out <e> <s> we are saying that this is something which is part of a tribunal procedure which requires a judicial process <e> <s> it is not a simple matter of administration and therefore it ought to be part of the judicial process <e>", "<cs> they both quote the same part of the bible that is why i have got them mixed up <e> <s> i am not sure whether the noble lord is making a statement from a sedentary position or whether he wants to intervene <e> <s> yes the christadelphians and the seventh-day adventists both have the same position and both quote st <e>", "<cs> i am afraid we have been drifting away from our comparatively modest amendment <e> <s> i suppose that was inevitable and it augurs badly in terms of the times of the committee for what is going <e>", "<cs> it gives me great pleasure to agree with the government on something tonight <e> <s> we would put forward three arguments against accepting the amendment <e> <s> first it goes back to a point which i made earlier <e> <s> it is a consequence of the wrong basis for compensation <e> <s> because the government are seeking to make a distinction for these people and to introduce a quite different system of compensation based on actual loss rather than anticipated loss they reach an apparent anomaly in which they are anticipating or trying to assess something which has moved as a result of inflation <e> <s> if they had accepted our basis for loss they would not have this problem <e> <s> secondly the amendment would if accepted be a further departure from the way in which industrial dismissal compensation is assessed and from the way in which compensation is assessed in all other forms of tribunals <e> <s> they do riot get their assessments inflation hedged <e> <s> thirdly as the noble earl has said and as he has been supported by the cross-benches built into the clause as it stands because of what we have on interest payment is a very substantial element of indexing anyway <e> <s> we oppose this amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord does not help me he makes me despair <e> <s> i do not see how he can say that he is not trying to establish the rights of individuals <e> <s> on exactly this basis the government tell us the rights of individuals will be established by industrial tribunals under the act <e> <s> the act will decide in precisely the same circumstances the government tell us whether or not there has been an unfair or a fair dismissal and they will do it by the system of a tribunal they will do it by a judge they will do it by a quasi-judicial process they will not do it by trusting the secretary of state <e>", "<cs> we now come to the question of schedule and clause because they are as all sides of the committee have accepted intimately related to each other <e> <s> we come to a situation where totally unamended we have to decide whether we can support them or not <e> <s> we have said and the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton said in particular in opening the debate on the first amendment why we find these two sets of provisions unacceptable <e> <s> as he said there was no consultation with the other interested parties <e> <s> every other part of the bill whatever one might think about it was the subject of consultation with the cbi the tuc the employers associations the institute of personnel management and so on <e> <s> every part of it was in a way in the green paper and in the consultative document <e> <s> that cannot be said of these provisions <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble lord is right but it does not affect the point <e> <s> i am saying that there was a whole series of cases in which in common law judges accepted what they came to call the trading interest defence <e> <s> indeed they were bound to do so if they were fair since the <e>", "<cs> it will not fit the noble earl <e>", "<cs> the noble earl really cannot have that because in the definition of a trade dispute <e>", "<cs> i do not want to detain the committee <e> <s> the noble earl has started talking about clauses and but we shall go on to do that after dinner <e> <s> on the single point about the act i would refer to the provisions of section of the trade union and labour relations act so far as the closed shop is concerned <e> <s> subsection <e>", "<cs> i do not want to hold up the committee but i should like to contribute to this <e> <s> it has been a very interesting discussion and i should like to congratulate the noble lord lord mottistone on raising an issue of which in general one was aware but not in the specific terms in which he put it <e> <s> i think that he put it extremely well <e> <s> it is no accident that he makes his point advised as he says by the general council of british shipping because they with the national union of seamen have the heart and guts of this problem <e> <s> it is a very serious problem for them <e> <s> we have some amendments down on this issue but i am bound to say that i think that the way the noble lord has put it is the best way to put it and the narrowest way and it may provide the right solution <e>", "<cs> when we adjourned the committee stage we are discussing an amendment moved by the noble lord lord jacques and we have had a very interesting debate so far <e> <s> i felt that the points made by the noble lord lord oram and the noble lord lord jacques about the extent to which a closed shop was compatible with good industrial relations and that was the answer to the noble baroness lady seear were well expressed <e> <s> but it seemed to me that the most unusual contribution we had and the one i enjoyed the most was the short but pointed contribution by the noble lord lord stewart because of course he was making the correct distinction between the different kinds of objection to joining trade unions <e> <s> i am sorry to say that the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter did not appear to understand that distinction although as he said it was clear and lucid enough <e> <s> the distinction as i understand the noble lord lord stewart was between what one might call the active objector and the passive objector the man who if he does have a conscientious objection and it need not be a conscientious objection has his conscientious objection as a still small voice in the words of the late lord attlee who said <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to speak to this debate and indeed i had agreed not to speak but the noble lord lord howie of troon has asked for the views of this side of the house on this amendment <e> <s> he stated that we did not give our views last time and since he has put down a similar amendment i must spend just a few moments saying what our views are <e> <s> they are unusual but they are nevertheless welcome because we agree with the government <e> <s> we agree with the government because we agree with the noble viscount that we are talking here about the conditions of fair and unfair dismissal <e> <s> what the amendment wants to do is specify in effect an additional eround for fair dismissal <e> <s> the noble viscount says that it was already covered in the bill <e> <s> we think that it is covered and we thought so at the time when the bill was before the house <e> <s> in the lieht of the bill we do not consider that this amendment is required <e>", "<cs> no i am not making any promises either way because i am never quite certain what they are <e> <s> it always seems to me that second reading speeches are speeches delivered in committee that you do not like <e> <s> this speech at least is designed to change the bill <e> <s> i should have thought that that is what speeches are designed to do in committee they are designed to support amendments designed to change the bill <e> <s> this amendment is designed to change the bill <e>", "<cs> in view of all that has been said and the time of night i am pleased not to press it <e>", "<cs> the next amendment will not be moved but i suspect that the one after that will take a very long time so i think we should adjourn <e>", "<cs> i think we find this amendment non-controversial <e> <s> of course it recognises the fact that there was not anything very much either in the act or until this moment in this bill and i take it these provisions will also cover ballots in future umas as to how these ballots are in fact going to be conducted <e> <s> the government have at last begun to realise some of the problems in running ballots of this sort <e> <s> but we still see that there is nothing in either of these pieces of legislation affecting ballots about the joint regulation of ballots or about any examples of independent assessments of results and of course there is still nothing in the clause about what would happen on any appeal or dispute about the results of these ballots <e> <s> nevertheless it is something to see that the government have begun to realise that you could not have ballots extending over only one day <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to keep on about this point and i do not suggest that the government have indulged in any sharp practice because fortunately i have available last nights <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that we do not find this a non-controversial issue in the bill at all <e> <s> the fact is as the noble viscount says that it was previously admittedly in some ways there was a doubtful <e>", "<cs> i am still trying to understand what the noble viscount says and i hope that he will bear with me <e> <s> he is not saying that in some way this bill protects people who might want to operate agency shops <e> <s> he is not saying that this bill except in respect of the clause that he is placing before us at this moment in itself would make agency shops unlawful <e> <s> as i understand him he is saying that in order to be sure <e>", "<cs> this answer is not acceptable <e> <s> the noble viscount is seeking to narrow the area of union membership agreements <e> <s> he is doing it late at night with a recent amendment and we must divide the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble earl comes back and not only does he come back but he agrees with us <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> i am not sure where this debate has got to <e> <s> it seems to be getting more and more confused <e> <s> it reminds me of the kind of debates that students have when they exchange their views about the system of proportional representation which they think is possibly the best one for their party <e> <s> it is not unlike the arguments which i am sure the medieval school men used to have on how many angels should dance on the end of a pin <e>", "<cs> i said have a sample <e> <s> you have two examples <e> <s> it was not a stratified sample <e> <s> but it does not follow from the fact that that is what happened there that that is the principle that we ought to have in a ballot <e> <s> the fact is that you cannot extract these principles out of the air whether you split two figures or use an isolated example <e> <s> you can say logically that there is something called a majority decision and there is something called a minority decision <e> <s> that is the way in which we normally decide things when we have votes if you want votes at all <e> <s> but where and how you can decide whether is right is right or / the first time is right i do not know <e> <s> all you can say and everybody has said this and this is why we will support these amendments if any of them go to a division is not that they are particularly logical but they are better than the bill <e>", "<cs> it really is astonishing to be told at this time of night that a small group of workers for example let us give them a chance who conduct their ballot and get / per cent <e> <s> and they work it out that they have really got per cent <e> <s> but the employer says per cent <e> <s> should go to the high court <e> <s> we are solemnly told at seven minutes past that they should go to the high court hundreds and thousands of them all over the country should go <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could tell us the point of this question <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord gets in to help the government he gets them further into the mess <e> <s> he is now telling us that it might be that an industrial tribunal would get in <e> <s> that is what the noble viscount is saying <e> <s> he said in answer to my noble friends question that if it came about that somebody was unfairly dismissed or claimed he was unfairly dismissed and went to a tribunal and said but the ballot was wrong <e> <s> it was rigged and of course it might have been two years earlier and they might have thrown away all the records then the industrial tribunal not the high court despite what the noble lord said would not have exclusive jurisdiction <e> <s> but <e>", "<cs> i shall not delay the committee for long in view of the hour <e> <s> we oppose this clause which we regard as extremely important <e> <s> the clause is designed to do two things <e> <s> the first is to create a category of specially deserving people in cases of unfair dismissal or those subject to pressure short of dismissal and on another occasion we shall be discussing all the extra special advantages in terms of compensation and awards which will be given to those who are dismissed on grounds of union membership <e> <s> we do not accept that this is a true and proper comparison <e> <s> we do not accept that the non-unionist the man who does not want to join a union is in exactly the same position as the man who wants to join a union and is prevented from doing so <e> <s> we do not accept the parity of those two positions <e>", "<cs> my lords this is indeed a strange story <e> <s> we are facing here a draft order to provide funds for trade union ballots <e> <s> this arises as the noble lord said out of the provisions of the act which gave the government power to subsiide ballots for a very wide variety of purposes for trade union elections trade union amalgamations changes of rules and of course strike decisions <e> <s> the government could run a scheme and trade unions under the provisions of that scheme could provide funds to assist them in running ballots for a very wide variety of purposes <e> <s> but in the act there was a phrase which was of very much concern to us on this side of the house at the time indeed it was of very much concern to those of us in another place <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not really satisfactory is it <e>", "<cs> my apologies my lords <e> <s> before the noble lord sits down would he care to answer any of the questions posed to him by both myself and my noble friend lord wedderburn of chariton <e> <s> i counted that my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton got to at least seven questions and would the noble lord lord glenarthur answer at least one of them <e>", "<cs> i am afraid that i cannot accept any of that reply <e> <s> the question that i asked the noble earl and he has not answered it is what is different <e> <s> what is the difference between a dismissal for trade union membership and other types of dismissal <e>", "<cs> the minister explains himself further and further and i am bound to say makes his case weaker and weaker <e> <s> it is perfectly true as he says that this is in some ways an extraordinary amendment <e> <s> but then this is an extraordinary bill <e> <s> it is somewhat strange to see these figures coming out of the air and of course they do come out of the air and the noble lord lord aylestone cannot really suggest that they do not come out of the air <e> <s> but then the figures in the bill come out of the air <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether noble lords opposite refuse to see or genuinely do not see <e> <s> it is easy enough to attempt to answer in as reasonable a way as one can the various points that are put to us from the other side of the committee and i shall try to do that but as my noble friend lord jenkins reminded me we are reaching the point when something much more fundamental is involved <e> <s> it is the fundamental hostility which we felt and which is coming into all the normal procedures and methods of carrying through trade union organisation <e> <s> with respect to noble lords opposite what is most difficult to take is that it is all being done and all the time it is being said it is being done by people who have no hostility at all to trade unions <e> <s> in some ways i prefer the attitude in another place of the secretary of state who does not pretend in that way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has misunderstood me and before we get worked up i must correct him <e> <s> i am not talking about the chairmen of tribunals i am talking about side members <e> <s> a tribunal is a tripartite body <e> <s> the chairmen are legally qualified and i am not talking about them <e> <s> i am saying that we have here side members and that these side members are trade unionists <e> <s> with great respect there is a precedent for what i am saying <e> <s> i hear what the noble lord says and i want to know whether the government agree with him <e>", "<cs> would the noble lord take it from me that all the phrases he has used fussy objectivity abiding by the majority are the language which trade unionists use about non-unionists about oddballs <e> <s> they say why must they be fussy <e> <s> why must they be objective <e> <s> why cannot they accept the majority view <e> <s> he understands that people can have genuine conscientious objections which make them stand out which make them look fussy which make them look subjective which make them reject the majority view <e> <s> what he cannot do is allow that those things can genuinely be a part of the outlook of a trade unionist <e>", "<cs> we hope not to delay the committee for long at this time of night but we feel that we must make our point about the clause as a whole and divide on it <e> <s> we have said repeatedly in relation to the many amendments we have moved why we regard joinder as a mistaken procedure <e> <s> the government have not put forward any arguments which in any way improve on the arguments which were adduced so unsuccessfully by the member for rochdale in another place at the time in when he sought to make the act substantially as this bill now is under clause <e>", "<cs> the situation that i was describing existed in swedish law on which i am not an expert and i dare say that the noble lord would not need three guesses to find out from where i got the information <e> <s> it was a situation in which there was a peace obligation clause which was of course legally enforceable in swedish law and which when broken was enforceable against the trade union <e> <s> but it was also enforceable against individuals and as i understand it in those circumstances the damages were very limited <e> <s> it was a peace obligation clause it had nothing to do with unfair dismissal <e>", "<cs> this is running over the ground that we ran over on clauses and <e> <s> it does not make it any more acceptable <e> <s> in fact it makes it less acceptable because we are dealing here with action short of dismissal and not with actual dismissal <e> <s> what is being said is that the convenient way of seeking to deal with one of the problems of non-unionism by offering the conscientious objector or the reluctant trade unionist a possibility of paying to a charity or some other organisation indeed on occasion to the union which is a form of agency shop shall be denied shall be unlawful and it shall be unlawful even if the action taken to bring it about is only action short of dismissal <e>", "<cs> it comes to the same thing <e>", "<cs> i agree to your amendment but i shall come back with mine on report <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord mackay said that there were certain mistakes in the amendment i thought for one wondrous moment that the government might have relented <e> <s> i did not believe this amendment when i saw it and i hoped maybe they had thought better of it and of course one should think better of it <e> <s> but it was not the case <e> <s> i do not say that this is the most important new clause i do not say it is the most important clause <e> <s> i say it is the most objectionable i say it is the most immoral i say it is the most unjustified <e> <s> i say it represents a further incursion into trade unionism and the ordinary day-to-day practices and beliefs of those who believe in trade unions <e>", "<cs> i do not want to intervene twice in this debate but i have been asked a number of specific questions and i would like to reply to those briefly <e> <s> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter was surprised at the degree of unanimity between myself and the noble lord lord underhill <e> <s> so far as i can remember we have never disagreed yet so perhaps it <e>", "<cs> i would only say let us see what <e>", "<cs> before the noble and learned lord sits down i think he referred to the trade union immunities green paper <e> <s> may i ask the noble and learned lord where in the trade union immunities green paper to which i am sure he referred there is anything at all on prohibition of union recognition requirements <e> <s> i do not think it can be found anywhere <e> <s> indeed i cannot find a direct reference in it to any of the previous clauses on union requirements <e> <s> but specifically i think the noble and learned lord will find that there is nothing at all on the prohibition of union recognition requirements <e> <s> it is something which the government have invented in this committee at the last moment <e>", "<cs> what the noble and learned lord says does not come as a surprise but as a disappointment <e> <s> he used such phrases as fitting in with practical reality but the practical reality is not the practical reality of union government it is the practical reality that the government are determined to get the unions one way or another <e> <s> even if they have to make up an imaginary system which has nothing to do with actual power relationships in the union they are going to get someone because he says an action is called by someone and therefore of course someone has to be got for that action <e>", "<cs> i want to say only a few words because the case from our side of the committee has been put very well by my noble friends behind me <e> <s> i merely want to say that we agree with what they have said and we agree with what the noble lord lord rochester has said <e> <s> we believe that this is something which has actually been tried <e> <s> it has been tried as he said with the compulsory ballot and it failed <e> <s> it has been tried in the united states <e> <s> it has been tried in canada <e> <s> it has been tried in british columbia <e> <s> it has the effects that he said it has the experience is that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action and that as a result they restrict the freedom of officials to settle <e> <s> i am quite certain that whatever reasons the front bench give they will give different reasons but they will come to the same conclusion that for those reasons or other reasons the government will decide at this stage at least not to support this amendment <e>", "<cs> we do not wish to hold up the committee at this time of night but we feel at this stage that we must say why we believe that this clause is a bad clause and is opposed <e> <s> essentially the clause is simple <e> <s> it aims to repeal section of the act and therefore it aims to open trade unions to tortious liability in the area of an industrial dispute <e> <s> it is as well to ask because until we got to clause stand part it was not logical to ask why that is necessary today <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord kilmarnock will know that i always try to agree with him however difficult that may be but it is not all that difficult this time because although the figures in the amendment have been plucked out of the air they are slightly more acceptable and welcome than the government figures which are equally clutched out of the air <e> <s> to adapt once again the noble baroness lady seears principle it is a small baby but we should not smother it <e> <s> it is a good deed which shines like a candle in a naughty world <e> <s> although it is a very small candle and a very small good deed and although it leaves most of the problems intact we should like the government to accept the amendment <e> <s> but we know that they will not <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down would it not be true to say that it is not quite true to say as he said that these figures caused no trouble in <e> <s> they applied to registered unions and there were no registered unions <e> <s> but the other unions had unlimited damages and that caused a great deal of trouble <e>", "<cs> but nobody did so we do not know <e>", "<cs> let me try again <e> <s> first the noble and learned lord says at least i understand him to say that the tuc is covered and i am glad that we know that he says that it is covered <e> <s> what we are saying is that it should not be covered <e> <s> i want to know whether the government think that it should be covered <e> <s> presumably they do <e> <s> therefore we have to work out the consequences of that <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances we shall not press this amendment to a division but we shall not withdraw it and we shall raise the issues which the noble and learned lord raised in the course of our next amendment <e>", "<cs> i think that the noble earl lord de la warr would accept me if not as a friend then as a well-wisher <e> <s> i am not sure that it does him much good if i say that i have always found him by far the wettest conservative in your lordships house <e> <s> i think that he is so wet that he cannot even be wrung out but i think that from me he will take that as a compliment <e>", "<cs> i did not intend to intervene again but the noble lord kindly quoted me at great length and helped to prove the converse of what was asserted earlier tonight namely that i never criticise the trade unions <e> <s> but would he not agree that i also say at <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has made an amazing announcement at this time of night <e> <s> will he answer one <e>", "<cs> i have an even shorter question to ask of the noble lord lord spens and it relates to one word in subsection <e>", "<cs> to adopt the language of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway i would say that i share the enthusiasm of the noble lord lord oram <e> <s> i am mildly in favour of the amendment <e> <s> it surely can do no harm to have in a directors report a statement describing what the company did to inform consult and involve the employees <e> <s> what is really interesting is to find out what excuse the government are to give for not accepting a single amendment to the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down i am trying to follow him and perhaps he can help me <e> <s> how does he reconcile his desire not to rush into a mild inoffensive statement about a directors report waiting to see whether the voluntary system works well and so on with his desire to rush pell-mell into ballots and further legislation against the rights of union members <e>", "<cs> we would urge once again that the government look favourably upon this amendment <e> <s> in fact inspired by the success of my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton in gaining an amendment i believe that this must be the only amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to keep the house long <e> <s> according to my calculations we have had seven speeches in favour of this amendment and i think four against it <e> <s> i want to support it in much the way in which we on these benches supported it when it came up on committee <e> <s> i think that the arguments for it have been put very fully this afternoon much more fully of course because we have discussed it at a much better time than when the arguments were put last time <e>", "<cs> my lords i would not say that the noble earl has disappointed me but there it is <e> <s> he has gone through each amendment and as he has said he has repeated his well-worn track answer that it has nothing to do with anybody other than the government and the complainant <e> <s> what we are saying fundamentally is that it has something to do with other parties and that they should have at least the very limited rights that we are suggesting <e> <s> i do not feel disposed to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i accept what the noble earl says and i thank him for it <e> <s> certainly he is perfectly correct to say that if our amendment were introduced as it appears on the marshalled list at least i think he is right we might be getting at people who had in the terms of i think he said the pneumoconiosis legislation used due care and diligence and i would not want to do that <e> <s> i would say that if somebody has done his best to present the truth and i think due care and diligence is a very good phrase it should have been in our amendment then i should want to leave him outside <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not want to intervene in this debate but the noble viscount the minister has made a number of statements which i think must be corrected <e> <s> we do not argue on this side of the house for trigger ballots <e> <s> if someone comes along and introduces statutory ballots and it is the government who would introduce statutory ballots automatic statutory ballots in certain circumstances by and large there is a balance of advantage in favour of trigger processes rather than automatic processes <e> <s> it is as broad as it is long <e> <s> the problem with this amendment is that although it gets rid of automaticity it introduces a trigger ballot over a rather shorter period but we are not coming before the house arguing for trigger ballots <e> <s> unfortunately the main objective which was to get the social democratic party to say what they would like to do has not been fulfilled because they will not say anything <e>", "<cs> my lords i feel like the guardsman who was out of step and the lady who was left waiting at the church <e> <s> firstly may i say that we agreed with the minister <e> <s> when we saw it came at an early stage though no doubt the minister had his reasons for the first time this clause and i do not claim now to have fully explored its ramifications because it is not exactly like the one put down by the noble earl for it goes beyond statutory professions for example we wondered what were the reasons for the minister having changed his mind because he was extremely persuasive <e> <s> as he said again today section of the act protects section of the act protects the code of practice protects and in the only case that is cited the professional man won his case <e> <s> yet he comes to us today and does not say that he has changed his mind <e> <s> he does not say that as a result of all the correspondence and listening to all the arguments he now finds that he was wrong <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very grateful to the noble lord lord jenkins of putney for putting down this amendment <e> <s> i do not think that i am betraying any confidence in saying that we sought at first to find if we could a way in which we could put down an amendment at this stage in the proceedings to deal with the special narrow problem that he has discussed with such knowledge and such eloquence tonight but in fact we could not find one <e> <s> the fact is that there is no way <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised at that reply my lords and i wish to take up only one point the noble earl made because he was right to say that we have been round this matter a number of times <e> <s> we have given examples of cases where we believe people could in fact do suffer as badly if not worse outside closed shop areas <e> <s> however i wish to take up one point he made because it has been made repeatedly in these debates and this may be the last opportunity to answer it <e> <s> it is the point that there was something uniquely reprehensible in the conduct of walsall and sandwell councils in the sense that they defied the act <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to jump up at the precise moment at which the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead did to answer the points made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway although i wanted to intervene briefly in order to put one or two points to the noble earl lord gowrie <e> <s> but the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead has covered virtually all the points that i was going to make to the noble lord lord campbell of alloway except one <e> <s> the point he made which was not answered by the noble lord lord pitt of hampstead was that in cases which he had been concerned with especially i believe he was saying in relation either to exclusion or expulsion from a union or it could have been unfair dismissal sometimes a case took a long time that it might take two years <e> <s> that is exactly what could be said about any dismissal case or any case of unfair exclusion from any organisation <e> <s> it all takes a very long time <e> <s> so far as i know there are no figures which would justify our giving extra compensation on the basis that a particular kind of dismissal takes rather longer to get to the tribunal than any other kind of case <e> <s> i do not think that is a distinction which we can accept <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mottistone is a dangerous man because he always sounds so reasonable <e> <s> this amendment is what i call the insult to injury amendment <e> <s> it is an attempt to add still further to the discrimination to the bonanza which the government insist on introducing for the non-unionist <e> <s> as the noble lord says it has the effect of removing any limit on compensation at all for this one single group of unfairly dismissed people <e> <s> the government have just turned down our attempt to put sex and race discrimination at square with this <e> <s> now we are being asked further to widen the difference between those who are dismissed on grounds of union membership and all other forms of dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is it not true to say that it is not quite as he said <e> <s> it does not stop at <e> <s> he gets the basic in addition <e> <s> of course if he applies and the tribunal decides that it is not practicable he still qualifies <e>", "<cs> automaticity or not i am afraid it was automatic that the noble earl would reject the amendment and we shall have to leave it there <e>", "<cs> well the noble earl must be the only one left in the world who has not seen gennard he and the secretary of state <e> <s> it is worth seeing believe me but it will be too late when the government publish it <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that it is not acceptable <e> <s> we know that it is not acceptable <e> <s> he does not give us any reason he just keeps saying that he does not think it will happen <e> <s> he does not say why we should not believe the under-secretary of state on th march <e> <s> i do not withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know whether the noble and learned lord the lord advocate was present when the government were saying in a previous amendment that of course they knew it did not make ally difference but they could not be sure so they would accept it <e> <s> i said at the time that i wished they would be equally generous all night but they are clearly not going to be <e> <s> we will not press this to a division <e>", "<cs> my lords i must say immediately that i acquit myself of any desire to put myself in the same class as the minister <e> <s> i was not trying to do that at all but merely implying that the noble and learned lord the lord advocate outclassed me certainly when it came to the case law or what i always refer to in relation to my noble friend lord wedderburn as <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise just one point before the noble earl finally sits down <e> <s> this is a very important matter and the noble earl is giving us great help <e> <s> but i should like to ask how does one move towards that situation <e> <s> there is now the situation where everybody is on the same rate of pay and one wants to move towards a situation which the noble earl says would be lawful where trade unionists receive per cent <e> <s> more than non-trade unionists <e> <s> but the only way to achieve that is to give a per cent <e> <s> increase to trade unionists and nothing to non-trade <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may say this to the noble lord look at the clause <e> <s> in number and circumstances the clause already defines these things in the widest possible way <e> <s> if you ask to whom a duty is owed then already a large number of people are mentioned in a whole range of circumstances <e> <s> the clause covers all or part of work done under a contract for the supply of goods or services it covers lists of suppliers it covers failing to permit a particular person to submit a tender it covers work done or likely to be done <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not want to delay the house for very long <e> <s> i merely want to point to something at the end of a very helpful letter from the noble and learned lord <e> <s> lord mackay of clash-fern in which he says and if he thinks about it he knows that he connot mean it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very glad to hear that the noble baroness lady seear supports this amendment because it was in a sense designed for her personal satisfaction <e> <s> it is what i call the argument from ibm because the noble baroness made the case last time that there might very well be employers who were paying union rates and who may be paying more than union rates and who in every way could be regarded as excellent employers except that they did not recognise trade unions <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord kilmarnock says that he is not against trade unions and i accept that from him and i am not against ballots <e> <s> we on this side of the house who are saying that we are against this amendment are not against ballots <e> <s> i am not even against unions having more ballots or having more rules which regulate ballots <e> <s> but that is not what we are being asked to do <e> <s> we are being asked to say that per cent <e> <s> or and if a union has members it comes out at can invoke a procedure before there can be a strike <e> <s> that procedure imposes upon a union the necessity of a ballot of all the members so that for example as has been said by one of my noble friends on this side or by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway in the case of the transport and general workers union which now has a membership of just under million of those members from anywhere throughout the union could stop not the whole of the t g because the whole of the t g never goes on strike as less than per cent <e> <s> of the t gs membership is in any one bargaining unit but could stop any powerful occupationally identifiable group in the t g unless there had been a ballot of the whole of the unions membership <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl finally sits down i must apologise for leaving the chamber but i was so interested in what the noble earl was saying that i got a copy of the green paper <e> <s> i understood the noble earl to say that the consultation in relation to the green paper was to the effect that most employers did not like compulsory ballots <e> <s> i cannot find this in the green paper <e> <s> i also understood the noble earl to quote a few instances but i cannot find those quotations in the green paper <e> <s> they may be there so my point and question is this is that the case and can we have further quotations of this kind <e> <s> can we have a supplement to the green paper <e>", "<cs> is that published <e>", "<cs> my lords may i say that of course if that is the case we would be prepared to get the noble lords vote to have this looked at again by the government <e> <s> but i always thought that the united kingdom included water round the united kingdom up to three miles <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is quite amazing that the noble lord can come and say this <e> <s> let me first deal with the remarks made by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway <e> <s> it is the case that there are countries where it is very difficult to maintain this kind of dispute <e> <s> nevertheless in sweden denmark norway and to some extent in italy and in other countries too the situation is that it is possible for the international transport workers federation to operate whereas in this country we have not only the proposed bill but the effect of section of the act so the government are doing this twice <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to agree with almost everything which has been said by the noble lord lord rochester but i want to spell out what i take to be the alternative to this amendment <e> <s> we are certainly not being asked whether we believe that industrial action in the national health service which deprives people of their life or health is a good thing <e> <s> we are not being asked whether we have any comments or views tonight on those who are in dispute at the moment in the national health service <e> <s> i have no intention of saying anything about the merits of that case <e> <s> i do not believe that it is our job to comment upon on-going disputes and as i have already said we are not asked to say whether we believe in the kind of industrial action which does the kind of thing which the amendment aims at <e> <s> of course we should deplore industrial action which had that effect <e> <s> what we are being asked to say is whether we think that this amendment would help <e> <s> that is the way that the noble lord lord rochester faces the problem would this amendment help <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble earl <e>", "<cs> my lords i know that the noble earl does not want to misrepresent me <e> <s> i did not say that i would not comment on the circumstances of this dispute <e> <s> what i would not comment on is the merits of this dispute that is for example whether the employer should improve upon the offer <e> <s> on the consequences of this dispute yes in terms of life and limb yes we have been talking about it all the time <e>", "<cs> my lords most of the points which could conceivably be made from this side of the house have already been made but since the object of the amendment is to cripple the labour party it may be right that somebody from this front bench should say what we think about it <e> <s> nevertheless as i say it has been said most ably by the speakers on this side and i merely want to go back to the points originally made by the first speaker who spoke in favour of this amendment and say that the thing to ask is how we got into this position <e> <s> as my noble friend lord underhill said we got into this position because of the <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like from this side of the house to join with the noble earl in all that he said about the staff and the wonderful work that they have done for us and will go on doing for us and to join with him in all he said about this debate <e> <s> it has been a well-tempered debate <e> <s> it has been a long night and i do not intend to keep you here any longer <e> <s> we have not moved the elephant but at least we have pulled his tail <e>", "<cs> my lords i certainly have no wish to dissent from the passage of this amendment <e> <s> indeed the house may remember that we supported the slightly stronger version of this amendment which the noble lord lord rochester put down at an earlier stage of the bill <e> <s> i am very glad to see that the govern <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by apologising if i did not thank the noble earl for his acceptance of the previous amendment <e> <s> i give him half a cheer and i willingly congratulate him <e> <s> however i hope that he will not change his mind on this amendment <e> <s> the noble lord lord mottistone is right <e> <s> the noble lord says that broadly speaking two arguments were put up by the government on the last occasion that the unscrupulous might benefit and that this was not the kind of power to put with tribunals <e> <s> but i would argue and indeed we did argue at the time that there are far more weighty arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords we did feel that they should be remedied <e> <s> the noble lord will remember that we put down a motion to provide these advantages to all people who were unfairly dismissed but i do not remember the noble lord voting for us <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a ragbag of objections <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway says that he does not like the words in the last part of the amendment <e> <s> if we were not at this present stage of the bill of course we could say to the government go away and give us some other words <e> <s> we have never said in any of these amendments that we stick upon particular words <e> <s> but we cannot do that today <e> <s> they are the best words we have <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the time in the evening when we congratulate everybody and i have no wish to stand out against that strain <e> <s> i congratulate the house on the way in which as the noble earl lord ferrers has said we have conducted this debate which on the whole has been in a good humoured and good natured way <e> <s> i congratulate the ministers and there were a remarkable number of them this time the noble lord lord cockfield the noble earl lord ferrers the noble viscount lord trenchard the noble and learned lord lord mackay the noble lord lord glenarthur and even the noble earl lord gowrie came with us all reading their briefs and making their arguments so well <e> <s> i congratulate those who wrote the briefs <e> <s> never were there such good briefs for such a bad case <e> <s> it is remarkable that we have had this great array of talent <e> <s> it is a considerably larger and longer array of talent than the one we had on the act when we had to make do if i may so put it with the noble earl lord gowrie the noble and learned lord the lord advocate and the noble lord lord lyell who for some reason has been taken off the batting this time <e> <s> we congratulate them all on the way in which they have defended their case as they have seen it <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three tasks today <e> <s> first i should like with great sincerity to thank the house for allowing me to serve on this committee <e> <s> i was never very clear by what process we were chosen but i am glad that we were chosen because i cannot think of any activity in which i have taken part in this house which i have found more enjoyable and more instructive <e> <s> secondly i want to define the general view of the labour party members of the committee to this report and thirdly i should like to explain the somewhat limited nature of my own contribution to this debate today <e> <s> but before i do any of those three things i should like to say that together with the noble baroness lady young who has been commanded elsewhere i have not been commanded elsewhere i have a long-standing engagement which unfortunately means that if the or so speakers that we have on the list today take their usual time i must apologise for the fact that it is very unlikely that i shall be here at the end <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to do two things this evening <e> <s> i want first of all very much to congratulate the noble lord lord seebohm and his committee on an excellent report with which i think we on this side broadly agree <e> <s> i will say a little about that in a moment <e> <s> secondly i want to explore what i take to be the main objections raised by the noble lord lord glenarthur which are as we would have expected the usual alliance of views of the secretary of state for employment and a representative group of small businessmen the institute of directors and the rest of the circle of people who go round and round the mulberry tree in lord north street <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i say this <e> <s> the noble lord has referred to my reference to sainsburys <e> <s> would he agree with me that if you read the report carefully what the representative of sainsburys was saying and this is on page is that his assumptions of per cent <e> <s> were of the worst kind that is to say nocontracting-out of his own pension scheme and no statutory scheme <e> <s> both assumptions which are in fact quite false <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made an extremely important statement on behalf of the government and i want to make absolutely certain that i have got it right <e> <s> as i understand it he said that there was some unjust discrimination whereas the secretary of state for employment in his letter to the committee stated on page <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree in the light of all that has happened and particularly in the light of what he has just said about the need to clarify the legal position that it was very unwise of the government to withdraw the defence put in before the commission and in pleadings by the previous government <e> <s> that is to say the defence <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the motion that this order should be agreed <e> <s> indeed there is very little i want to say about it <e> <s> i have only two points to make <e> <s> first as i have said we argue that such a levy is essential if there is to be any training in what is undoubtedly a key industry <e> <s> if the government ever wake up and generate some work for the construction industry we shall immediately run into the shortage of craftsmen that we have run into in previous times when there has been an upsurge of work in construction <e> <s> therefore there must be training and that training will not be done on a voluntary basis by the industry <e> <s> consequently we are very glad to see that the industry has retained its training board and is now proposing to raise a levy worth million a year <e>", "<cs> my lords i have pleasure in agreeing to this motion on behalf of my side of the house <e> <s> we have no intention of going into the provisions of this act as the noble lord lord glenarthur suggested we might although i understand that my noble friend lord davies of leek wants to say something about those matters after i sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad that i intimated to the noble lord lord glenarthur some of the questions that i wanted to put to him because at least he has given us a great deal of argument about why these particular increases in both of these orders are what they are <e> <s> it is much better for the house and for us that we should have had that kind of answer than i say this with respect the kind of answer that we had when the noble lord lord lyell was here and was asked a question that he could not answer <e> <s> he took the view well if caught out use a tennis analogy <e> <s> at lease we have some figures at least we have some <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down would it be fair for me to summarise what he is saying in this way that the governments view is that where you compensate for redundancy and insolvency you take into account the economic situation but otherwise not <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that he is going to have to publish gennard in the end <e> <s> would he not agree that it would be rather better if he could tell us now that the government intend to publish gennard as it is given to them and not in any way to take out bits that might be contrary to their policy <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by congratulating and thanking the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter for initiating a debate on this very interesting subject and for the moderate and critical way in which he has approached the green paper <e> <s> i do not say that i agree with everything which the noble <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down would he not agree that the true parallel between company law and trade union law is not the degree of liability but the fact that company law is not related to a single principle of ballotomania and participation and secondly that on the whole the business community accepts the present framework of company law <e> <s> if the trade union movement accepted the present framework we should not be arguing <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may interrupt it is all a matter of the division of functions <e> <s> it all rests on the noble lord lord underhill who will answer in full <e>", "<cs> my lords i always hope for the best from the noble earl and in the first few moments of what he said i thought i had got it <e> <s> he said that the code of practice be approved <e> <s> i thought he said be improved because there is plenty of room for that <e> <s> he then went on to say that the picketing code is not in need of amendment <e> <s> we are not discussing that today but i cannot agree <e> <s> it is very much in need of amendment because the objective of the formal provisions of this code of practice is precisely the same as that of the previous code of practice and the code of practice on picketing <e>", "<cs> if the noble earl will let me finish my lords i will tell him why it is a cheek <e> <s> all this time we have not been given professor gennards report and it seems as though we are not to be given it now not to be allowed to examine it <e> <s> it is now to be used against us because bits of it are to be selected by the government <e> <s> they will be those bits that suit the government and they will be pretty little bits <e> <s> maybe we will have another three years in which all we shall know about the gennard report is what the government are prepared to tell us about it <e> <s> i think that is a cheek <e>", "<cs> i did not say that i had not read the report my lords i said that the government will not publish it <e> <s> those of us who know professor gennard those of us who have attended seminars and those of us who have read <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl agree that the summary in irr is a reasonably accurate summary and therefore does not support the code of practice <e>", "<cs> my lords the difference is quite simple and i find it difficult to believe that the noble earl does not follow what i mean by it <e> <s> the fact is that this practical guidance is as i said written with precisely the same tone of voice as the sections on the law <e> <s> it is not made clear in section c itself that it is simply advisory and unlike the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is being unfair to the government surely he would accept that as a result of the act there is no immunity in tort and there is no immunity for individuals any more <e>", "<cs> my lords i begin by congratulating our twin maidens this evening the noble lord lord ingrow and the noble lord lord bauer <e> <s> they produced lucid and interesting speeches and i hope that we hear them often again <e> <s> as regards the first noble lord i was particularly interested in the discussion that he gave us of the problems of aiding small businesses <e> <s> as regards the second maiden speaker i particularly enjoyed the distinction he drew between what he called non-controversial statements as against non-provocative statements <e> <s> i hope that he tries to make that distinction again in this house although i cannot promise that he will meet with the same result <e>", "<cs> my lords in view of the statement that the noble earl made about no further legislation <e> <s> is he in fact saying once again that the government have no proposals to do anything at all about the vredling proposals and that once again this is considered some kind of substitute for those proposals <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin my speech by agreeing with a very large part of what the noble viscount has said i do not agree with it entirely but i agree with a very large part of it and by thanking him for raising the issue this evening in this house because it gives us an opportunity to do two things <e> <s> it gives us an opportunity first to discuss the real pressing problem of what the noble viscount says quite rightly is a vital british industry and secondly to raise a number of general issues about how that industry has come to its present stage <e> <s> it is an industry which i suppose has undergone one of the most consistent systematic sets of investigations inquiries and various forms of government intervention based on inquiry investigation and in the end legislation of almost any industry in this country <e> <s> yet it comes to be in its present state and maybe we could learn a few lessons from that situation <e>", "<cs> my lords they have to be sufficiently important <e> <s> the noble baroness and myself sat i think upon an inquiry when we did not know of a solution before we began the inquiry by the time we produced the report we had found a solution <e> <s> we can use inquiries if we have the right people to find solutions to problems <e> <s> it is possibly with great reluctance the only way in which we can proceed <e> <s> i should however like to indicate the two areas i have in mind <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that reply <e> <s> i also asked him and i hope he will tell me about the figure of which is the figure that the dock labour board said originally was the figure below which it would not need to lose any more labour <e> <s> is that still the position <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not agree that on the three tests of our comparative employment performance we have got much worse in terms of the absolute level the rate of increase and the size of our employed labour force <e> <s> does he not agree that in each one of these three ways the record is much worse than it was in <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord for the clear way in which he has presented this order <e> <s> we welcome the order <e> <s> i found his explanations were in marked contrast to some of the explanations which have been put forward in another place on orders of this kind <e> <s> while welcoming and supporting the general intentions of the order i want simply to ask a number of questions some about detail some about form and some about scope <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to do three things this afternoon <e> <s> first <e> <s> i should like to thank the noble lord lord byers for putting down this motion and say why i agree with virtually everything he said although perhaps i should also like to say some other things which he did not <e> <s> secondly i should like to see whether i understand what is the governments slightly different opposition to the proposals in the report of the house of lords select committee on unemployment as they have been advanced by the noble lord lord gray of contin to see whether i appreciate the slight differences <e> <s> if i do not no doubt the noble lord will be pleased to tell me that i am wrong <e> <s> thirdly i should like to spend just a few moments talking about what i think of the theoretical dogmas indeed the prejudices which lie behind the various excuses justifications and reasons which the government put forward for doing nothing whatever significantly about positive job creation <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has answered many of my questions extremely well and i thank him for that <e> <s> in fact some of the answers are to questions that i did not ask <e> <s> however there were two questions which i asked and as the noble lord is moving on to other speakers i should like to know whether he is going to answer them now or will write to me <e> <s> i asked in particular about the last year of the yop in and how many people actually obtained full-time jobs when they came off the scheme as against just being recycled into further education <e> <s> further on the first year of the yts what proportion does the minister expect will get full-time jobs as against either going on the dole or being recycled into further courses <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not trying to be difficult but i asked a question which has never been answered <e> <s> i should like the minister to go away and try to get the figures to answer my question <e> <s> however the department will never tell what the breakdown is between people who actually get jobs and people who get recycled into courses <e> <s> the figures of per cent <e> <s> and per cent <e> <s> given by the minister push all these together <e> <s> we would like them separated <e>", "<cs> my lords may i press the noble baroness on this <e> <s> the last information that we had in the house was given on nd november and it was that the rate of take-up was about per cent <e> <s> of the numbers required in a full year that is to say when what is required is <e> <s> this is a rather low rate of take-up <e> <s> if it is to be further detracted from by refusals and premature terminations what will happen to the youth training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have listened very carefully to the noble earl <e> <s> does he say that he has actually answered the question of my noble friend lady david who asked him whether the government would compensate local authorities for the places which they have made available when they will get money only if people take them up <e> <s> if they do not take them up and local authorities lose money will they be in penalty or will they be compensated <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very distinguished long debate <e> <s> i do not wish to delay the house unduly <e> <s> i think we can argue on this side that we have had the balance of the argument <e> <s> we have certainly had the balance of the numbers <e> <s> what we have been arguing can be summarised under a series of heads <e> <s> we have been saying that this regulation is a miracle of complexity and obscurity and that simple men and even non-simple men cannot understand it <e> <s> that is what the noble and learned lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble earl for answering the question in a rather uninformative way <e> <s> is he not aware that severe disappointment will be bound to follow in all parts of the house from what he has just said <e> <s> does he not recall that in the debate that we had on th december an unusual number of distinguished members of the house told him that what he had in his hand were incoherent protracted regulations which did not discharge our obligations to the european court or under the eec directive <e> <s> would not the noble earl agree that on that occasion he said what he is now saying that his advisers have told him that we shall be all right on the night <e>", "<cs> my lords while thanking the noble viscount the leader of the house for that clear exposition of the constitutional position i hope we can have from the noble earl that he also accepts that position and that he knows why we did not divide the house last monday week <e> <s> may i put this question to the leader of the house <e> <s> he said that he made changes in the procedures and rules <e> <s> i accept that <e>", "<cs> my lords it is always pleasant to be able to agree with the noble baroness especially at this time of night <e> <s> we on this side of the house find ourselves in total agreement with what she has said <e> <s> the noble baroness stated that the heart of the objections raised by the joint committee go to the role of the expert <e> <s> this was not the issue which was debated when this general question of the statutory instrument was considered by the house on a previous occasion <e> <s> at that time most of the debate centred on other defects in particular on defects in the regulations <e> <s> the government had made last minute changes to the procedural rules <e> <s> i say this now because if i do not it is conceivable that the noble earl may say it <e> <s> i said on th december at col of <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the noble lord a question to see whether i have understood him right and if so ask through him whether the government will say that they agree with him <e> <s> the noble lord appears to be saying very clearly that these rules mean that one can have three reports i take it that he means one which is the tribunals initiated and authorised report one from the employer as it might be and one from the union for the worker <e> <s> is the noble lord telling us and if he is telling us this do the government agree that all three reports have equal status before the tribunal <e> <s> is he saying that they have <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl give way <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl seems to me and i am asking him whether he accepts this to be contradicting himself <e> <s> as regards the first part of what he said he seemed to be saying that as a result of the debate on th december he had changed something <e> <s> but as i read the final schedule which is published here i find that it is word for word the same as the draft that we had before us at th december <e> <s> is it not the case that after th december when we debated both the regulations and the draft rules absolutely nothing was changed <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by thanking the noble lord lord dean of beswick for initiating what has been one of the most interesting debates that we have had in this house for a very long time on one of the most important subjects that we have discussed in this house for a very long time <e> <s> i feel it can be said of almost everything that has been said not everything that those who have spoken have chosen quite rightly to see the issues in this debate as very fundamental as moral issues as issues of freedom as issues of security and in the end as issues going to the good faith of the government themselves <e> <s> although we on this side have very little hope at this stage of the debate and particularly after listening to the foreign secretary in what he said this morning to the select committee that this obstinate government are going to change their mind on this critical issue we feel that we must try <e> <s> we feel also and this is what i want to do in the short time that i shall speak that we must try to get the record straight on a number of issues and we must ask once again whether the government and the minister will try to clarify some of the contradictions in the various explanations of the things which the government have done <e>", "<cs> no my lords i am not in favour <e> <s> i do not think people should be bought in this way but if people pick figures out of the air particularly if they are rather small mean figures they are entitled to be asked where they got them from <e> <s> if they are asked four times and they do not answer i intend to ask a fifth time <e> <s> where did they get the figure of from <e> <s> they must have got it from somewhere <e> <s> even the thirty pieces of silver must have been calculated on some basis <e> <s> therefore i ask them what the basis is <e>", "<cs> no i did not <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i should like to ask him whether he would not agree that i have in fact asked him a whole series of questions which he has not even begun to answer <e> <s> will he answer them subsequently or will he not answer them at all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by making three preliminary remarks <e> <s> i should like to join with the rest of the house in congratulating the noble lord lord forte on his maiden speech <e> <s> i too like most others here have put my trust in the house of forte in the past and when you travel by british airways you have very little alternative <e> <s> i only hope that the noble lord lord forte will find it in his time to give us still more food for thought in future <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two duties to perform tonight <e> <s> the first and the pleasant duty is to thank the noble lord lord wilson of rievaulx for the motion which he has put on the order paper and about which we have had such an interesting discussion <e> <s> the noble earl lord gowrie said that quite a lot of people on our side of the house were wilson men or had wilson to thank or had wilson to blame <e> <s> i have wilson to blame somewhat belatedly for having the chance to answer this debate <e> <s> i thank him for that too <e> <s> so i come to my second task which is to try to summarise the debate as it has been put forward on our side of the house and to say where we disagree with the arguments to which have been put forward on other sides of the house <e>", "<cs> my lords let us wait and see what <e>", "<cs> my lord <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the noble earl agree in the light of what he has just said about the impossibility of driving down the level of wages in this way until we can reach full employment that it makes nonsense of what is said by those in his party who believe that we should make the labour market work by driving down the level of real wages until we can get full employment <e>", "<cs> my lords i like to begin as the house well knows by saying what i can say in favour of the government and it will not take very long <e> <s> i should like to congratulate them on the title of the bill <e> <s> at last we have finished with employment bills <e> <s> we had the first trade union bill which was called an employment bill and the second trade union bill which was called an employment bill and all the time the level of unemployment rose and now we have the third trade union bill and at least thank the lord <e> <s> it is called a trade union bill <e> <s> it is half right in that because of course it is not just a trade union bill <e> <s> like the first two trade union bills it is an anti-trade union bill <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i wonder if he would agree with me <e> <s> he says the members demand a change <e> <s> he says they demand part i of the bill <e> <s> would he therefore accept an amendment which was designed to find out whether the members would prefer their existing arrangements so that part i of the bill only came into operation if members voted against their existing arrangements <e> <s> would he support an amendment of that sort <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to make it quite clear in answer to all those questions which i think the noble earl will find i did answer but i shall answer again that we are not against any of those things in union rule books <e> <s> we are against the government attempting to impose their way of doing it through the law <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble earl not think that this has come about as a result not just of political considerations but of economic considerations and the fact that certain members of the ucw might think that the youth training scheme has become a cheap labour scheme <e> <s> in this connection would it not be better if the government were to support the efforts of the tuc and for example raise the limit which has been exactly the same since <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl not agree however that even a training scheme allowance deserves to be updated for inflation <e> <s> therefore why <e>", "<cs> i should like to briefly reply to some of the points raised <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell if i understand him says that this amendment would not simply undermine part i of the bill but also part ii of the bill <e> <s> i do not think so <e> <s> part ii of the bill could exist entirely on its own <e> <s> it is a restriction on the right to strike <e> <s> the sanction is the sanction which might be brought by either an employer or an injured third party <e> <s> it does not depend on there being a part i of the bill at all <e> <s> if you say that this amendment undermines part i of the bill yes that is what it is intended to do <e> <s> it is intended to make part i of the bill optional yes flexible yes <e> <s> if that is undermining the intention of part i of the bill that is the object of the exercise <e>", "<cs> exactly <e> <s> so is the amendment <e> <s> we are not suggesting in our amendment that you would have to change the rules <e> <s> we are saying in our amendment that you would use your existing rules your existing constitutions in order to decide whether or not you wished to be bound by clause of the bill so you would not need to change your existing rules <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord lord denning i thought was saying he rather liked the amendment in the sense that it went to the machinery of the amalgamation act <e> <s> if he says to me that necessarily means that our amendment if passed would involve a postal ballot i say i would accept that if that be what the amalgamation act means <e> <s> that is a matter for someone to establish if they wish by challenging a decision of a union either on amalgamation or if this bill went through on a decision under that provision and going to the certification officer and if they did not like the decision they got from the certificating officer they could appeal against that decision <e> <s> i would abide by whatever it is the court says is meant by the amalgamation act and if that means a postal ballot so let it be a postal ballot <e> <s> we are not against postal ballots <e>", "<cs> does the noble earl not agree though that the straitjacket which parliament is in is the straitjacket of the noble lord lord howie <e> <s> what the noble lord lord howie wants is precisely the way in which parliament works in which parliament elects the mps and the mps elect the cabinet and the prime minister elects everybody <e> <s> it is a system of indirect election and so is this noble house <e> <s> that is the straitjacket <e> <s> why can the trade unions not have what parliament has <e>", "<cs> no no <e>", "<cs> as we have already indicated we support this amendment and i hope that the noble lord <e> <s> lord rochester will press it to a division <e> <s> it operates slightly differently from previous amendments that have been moved because he has had the courage to take hold of part i of the bill and suggest that the test under which the union members should decide whether or not they want to keep their existing system or change to another system should be the test of the bill itself not the constitution of the union which we suggested and not even the provisions of the amalgamations act which we suggested but clause of the bill <e> <s> i do not see how anybody can object to a choice of that kind <e>", "<cs> me to the central issue of clause <e> <s> it is necessary to point out to the committee that clause of this bill is not clause of this bill because the noble earl has been telling us throughout this committee stage that clause is reasonable flexible and easy to accommodate because clause is <e>", "<cs> yes <e>", "<cs> i do not want to repeat the speech i have just made <e> <s> the point i was making i thought was simple <e> <s> it was that every other institution including clubs and parliament is allowed the privilege of an indirect election the government want to take that away from trade unions and they do not justify it <e>", "<cs> i did point out when the noble earl was out of the chamber that the particular poll about which he talks does not in any way sanctify the bill <e> <s> what people were asked was are you in favour of secret ballots <e> <s> what this bill does is to do away with indirect elections <e> <s> they were not asked to sanctify part i of this bill <e>", "<cs> where is the evidence <e> <s> there is no evidence <e>", "<cs> i want to address myselfif i canto the remarks of the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> the only thing that i want to say about the noble lord lord marshis that i thank him for his concern about us as we go if we do marching through the lobby with the government <e> <s> but the noble lord should know how we feel <e> <s> after all in his time he must have been through every lobby that there is <e> <s> so do not worry about us all that much we shall survive <e> <s> i would <e>", "<cs> i would not accept that the great majority do so but it is perfectly true that some do so <e> <s> the point is that the law does not insist that they do so that is the issue <e> <s> nor does the law insist that it happens in general elections or in local elections <e> <s> you cannot get a compulsory postal ballot you cannot even get the postal ballot on demand in general electionseither you have to be ill or you have to be abroad <e> <s> you cannot get it even when you are on holiday <e> <s> but in the trade unions the amendment says yes <e> <s> trade unions are not like clubs companies <e> <s> parliament or professional associations they and they alone are so corrupt that you can get a decent election in a trade union only if you have a compulsory postal ballot <e> <s> that is the sense in which the noble lord lord beloff is in line with the government because they also believe that unions are very peculiar things <e>", "<cs> the answer to that is no i am not saying that and if the noble earl had listened he would have known that <e> <s> i am glad that i have struck home <e> <s> all these insults can be made about trade unions and there is no reaction at all <e> <s> i should have mentioned cricket clubs i will say it again malpractices exist in cricket clubs <e> <s> of course there are malpractices but for the most part they are insignificant and for the most part they do not affect the result <e> <s> very often they are simply the result of people not carrying out precisely what is said in the rules because they can think of a rather easier way of doing something <e>", "<cs> nothing like it <e> <s> we can be quite certain that if we had we should have read all about it in all the newspapers <e> <s> so we are not saying that there are not malpractices we are saying that the degree of malpractice that exists in voluntary organisations exists in trade unions that by and large they are no worse than anywhere else and that what exists does not justify what is being proposed in this amendment and does not justify what is being proposed in the bill <e>", "<cs> that is partly because i am being interrupted but i shall try to get on <e> <s> one argument which might be made for having postal ballots would be that it would lead to greater participation but the ground has already been given up by the noble lord lord beloff <e> <s> he has already admitted that the evidence indicates that the greater degree of participation is caused by a mix of systems <e> <s> that is what the undy book indicates <e> <s> if you have a mix of systems you can have workshop ballots when you can get them when the employer will co-operate or you may have postal ballots or you may have people simply voting in the branches or shop stewards taking round the voting boxes <e>", "<cs> i know that every time people hear the words shop stewards they suspect something <e> <s> the evidence indicates that the best way to get the highest degree of participation is to have a mixed system and that if you have postal ballots in many unions in for example unions with high rates of turnover the result will be relatively low levels of participation <e> <s> the other side do not mind that <e> <s> they have given that away and so they bring forward their amendment <e>", "<cs> i always thought we had some immunity from law in this house and i always thought that companies had immunity from law <e> <s> if the noble viscount is saying that one is like a trade union if one has immunity from law many people would come in <e>", "<cs> it may be the case as my noble friend lord wedderburn says that we begin with a certain degree of agreement with the government <e>", "<cs> i am very sorry that the minister felt that he had to respond in that way <e> <s> it is not satisfactory at all <e> <s> we have had the noble earl lord gowrie coming to the dispatch box on the previous amendment and in effect criticising as we have done and as my noble friend lord wedderburn has done the effectiveness the utility and flexibility of the phrase reasonably practicable and putting another phrase in its place <e> <s> we have said and my noble friend lord wedderburn from this dispatch box has said that if the government were to spatter all over the bill the phrase which they have just put into an amendment in place of the phrase reasonably practicable we would very much like that and perhaps would not need amendments of this kind <e>", "<cs> i quite see what the noble earl lord gowrie is saying <e> <s> he is saying that he wants to get on with the bill and that there are large parts of the bill which have nothing to do with clause <e> <s> that is true but we happen to be on clause <e> <s> my difficulty is that throughout clause except at the moment in the case of counting where the government have moved an amendment which we have accepted and which has changed the situation the test of the extent to which the unions have to observe these provisions is reasonable practicability which the noble lord lord wedderburn says lawyers call the disproportionate test <e> <s> what we are saying is that that test is too severe <e> <s> the government themselves have accepted that it is too severe in respect of counting and we thank them for that and in the place of reasonable practicability they have put accidental and not affecting <e> <s> they allow the unions to escape if the mistake is accidental and if it does not affect the result <e>", "<cs> would the noble earl tell me which amendment it was which did what he has said it did <e>", "<cs> i am sorry i am afraid we must press it <e> <s> the fact is that amendment no <e> <s> as the noble earl now informs me it is has been changed from an earlier draft so that the constraint imposed which it protects against is a constraint imposed by the union or by any of its members <e> <s> there is no mention of employers in it at all <e> <s> we must press this to a division <e>", "<cs> the noble earl referred to my speech last tuesday <e> <s> does he not recall that i was making the point that all other institutions from golf clubs through companies to parliament are allowed more flexibility and freedom in deciding their elections and their leaders than the government propose that trade unions should be allowed <e> <s> this was my point <e>", "<cs> and the cbi too <e>", "<cs> i do not know whether the noble earl is aware of it but he has made an important statement <e> <s> he has put forward as a reason for not voting for our amendment the complementary nature of the common law protection in the rules <e> <s> as i understand it it has been the position of the government throughout this bill that the whole object of the bill is that the rules will not count any more <e> <s> indeed clause of the bill says <e>", "<cs> i do not want the noble lord lord gray of contin to make another speech <e> <s> however as we are now dealing with clause i would beg him please to give us an explanation as to why he is not answering our questions about why the government do not know what they are going to put into clause <e> <s> i beg the noble lord not to continue all night to fail to answer our questions <e>", "<cs> i must congratulate the noble earl on what i would say was possibly the most laconic address that he has given to this committee on a matter of great importance in the area of trade union and labour relations <e> <s> this is a very important amendment <e> <s> we oppose this amendment not just because of what it contains but because of what it symbolises <e> <s> this is the first opportunity that we have to discuss clause of the bill and together with clause of course the provisions in clause which run together and constitute the heart of part ii of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down and he is a fair and reasonable man i wonder whether he would care to give me an example of the kind of intimidation that he has talked about <e>", "<cs> i am not talking about the national union of mineworkers <e> <s> the example that the noble lord gives seems to me to consist of people cavilling at a majority decision <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness is absolutely right <e> <s> it only goes to show how moderate we are <e> <s> i moved amendment no <e> <s> which raises the time period from four to but we had amendment no <e> <s> which i do not intend to move because we have got to get through the business but which in some ways was more flexible because it said that you could put a date on the ballot paper <e> <s> i could have moved an amendment which said no date at all <e> <s> the noble baroness was perfectly right <e> <s> that would be even more sensible because the whole idea was silly in the first place <e> <s> but we are trying to be modest <e> <s> i come back to what the minister has said <e> <s> it is not me who is afraid it is not me who has suspicions it is negotiators it is trade unionists <e> <s> they are being told that they will have to go as the noble baroness has said through this complicated procedure and it is very complex <e> <s> it is even more complex in respect of clause than it was in respect of part i of the bill because also as a result of clause which is referred to at the end of clause they have to muck about with having returns and sending the results of those returns with all the spoilt papers away to their members <e>", "<cs> i do not feel like withdrawing the amendment <e> <s> i am sorry that the noble lord cannot find it in his heart to come any way towards us and yet he does not really deny what i am saying <e> <s> it is no real argument to say that notice of termination does not involve breach of contract when the noble lord goes on to say and he is quite right to say it that virtually no strikes involve termination <e> <s> the fact is that when workers go on strike they do not want to terminate their contract <e> <s> what they want is to suspend it they want to put it on the shelf <e> <s> the trouble is that common law will not recognise the ordinary continental notion of suspension and therefore there is no right to strike in this country <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is being less than his normal fair self <e> <s> we have never argued from this side of the committee that members should not be consulted <e> <s> i myself said earlier that what we are arguing is that they do not necessarily have to be balloted and in particular they do not have to be balloted according to the provisions of this bill <e> <s> we do not say that they do not have to be consulted and we do not say that they are not consulted <e> <s> we say they are <e>", "<cs> i do not think we can withdraw this amendment <e> <s> the minister has not given us much of an argument <e> <s> his argument as i understand it is that this is the position and the government want to face trade unionists with the position as it is <e> <s> but of course as we have said repeatedly they only go so far <e> <s> they do not face trade unionists with the consequences of interference that is not there only breach of contract <e> <s> they have struck that out of the bill because they do not know what it means <e> <s> so they present trade unionists with that part which they know the meaning of and we say that part is intimidatory <e>", "<cs> i suppose according to the way the bill is proceeding we should be thanking the members on the other side of the committee because this is our old friend amendment no <e> <s> put in as amendment no <e> <s> for the fact that in the case of strikes they are getting rid of workplace ballots altogether and making them per cent <e> <s> postal ballots not just for union elections but also for strikes <e> <s> but unless we take that extreme view i do not think that we can welcome this series of amendments <e>", "<cs> i want to delay the committee just a few moments on the question that the clause shall stand part of the bill <e> <s> much of the argument against the clause has been made by my noble friend lord underhill in speaking against the previous amendment <e> <s> but it is necessary very briefly to point out to the committee that quite apart from the restrictions on trade unions and the operation of the political levy as it exists at the moment the government propose two major changes in part iii of the bill <e> <s> as regards clause of the bill we are about to consider our attitude towards one of those changes that is to say that the ballot in future will have to be run every years <e>", "<cs> the generosity that the noble earl shows to his opponents makes mr gradgrind look like father christmas <e> <s> it has been explained to him quite clearly why and how this is done but he does not want to know <e>", "<cs> as i understand it the noble earl wishes to take back the clause <e> <s> that is why i did not move amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord can see the difference between a meeting which is held by a trade union yes to support a given candidate that was covered as against a general meeting during which some of the time of the meeting is spent discussing labour party business <e> <s> that we suggest is going to be covered by the bill <e> <s> there is a difference <e>", "<cs> will the noble earl not admit that companies can sack people and not take on people <e> <s> the employment relationship is a dependent relationship <e> <s> to suggest that companies do not control people is nonsense <e>", "<cs> the noble earl is starting as he began <e> <s> his argument on this new clause is the same as all the arguments that he has used throughout the passage of this bill <e> <s> it is what i call the exclusion principle <e> <s> one simply says that trade unions are different <e> <s> you do not have to say how they are different they are different <e> <s> you exclude them from all principles of similar treatment equity fairness and now even evidence <e> <s> you do not have to have evidence if you want to do things to trade unions because they are different <e> <s> they can be excluded from all evidence and all rationality <e> <s> so the noble earl tells us that there is overwhelming support for the amendment <e> <s> we are not given any evidence of that overwhelming support <e> <s> his attitude is what i say three times is true <e>", "<cs> i am extremely disappointed by what the noble earl has said <e> <s> perhaps it is my fault <e> <s> perhaps we should have found some way to introduce the amendment earlier <e> <s> it points to a question which was not raised in another place <e> <s> i readily accept that it was overlooked in another place <e> <s> the noble earl has his prepared brief and he answers in the prepared way but the answers he has given will not do <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord campbell of alloway says that we have made no case <e> <s> the case is the case which justifies this practice existing in all other associations <e> <s> it is felt by all other associations including government associations professional associations and companies to be helpful if they can have at least some and in many cases all of their executive elected by systems other than direct elections so that they can balance the executive and make sure that they have the right mix of expertise and so on <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord howie of troon has threatened to bring this issue back to us at third reading <e> <s> apart from that possibility this is the final time of asking <e> <s> the noble lord lord beswick has put his position and his argument in terms of balpa in his characteristically moderate and convincing way <e> <s> he has clearly spelled out once again as we have tried to spell out on this side the fundamental functional justification of indirect elections in the case of trade unions <e> <s> there are many instances balpa is one but there are others where the membership is so scattered where the level of turnover is so large where the knowledge of the detailed experience and expertise required is so <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has made it clear that he is moving as it were as part of a general debate a whole series of amendments but we have made it clear through the usual channels and it has i think been accepted that we do not quite agree that all these things go together in one universal package <e> <s> we see why the government say that but we consider that in particular amendments nos <e> <s> and dealing as they do with the position of the certification officer and bringing the certification officer into the debate and into the bill in a way that he has not been there before raise separate questions and we would want to debate them separately when amendment no <e> <s> is called <e>", "<cs> my lords this is a new amendment we have not debated it and it is very important <e> <s> i should like to make sure that i have the noble earls position clear <e> <s> the question that i think the noble lord lord wedderburn is trying to ask is this <e> <s> if the union wins in the sense that a member complains and the matter goes to the certification officer and the certification officer decides for the union and makes a declaration in favour of the union as we understand it the noble earl is saying that the member can go to the court and challenge that declaration <e> <s> that is fine <e> <s> what we are asking is suppose that the members win <e>", "<cs> suppose that the union wins no <e> <s> my first case was if the union won <e> <s> my noble friend is confusing me <e> <s> my first case was that the union won and we know that the workers can go to the high court <e> <s> now we get the case where the workers win <e> <s> if the workers win and if the declaration of the certification officer is in favour of the workers can the union appeal to the high court <e> <s> the minister seems to be saying no but we think that is unfair <e>", "<cs> for what <e>", "<cs> many <e>", "<cs> no <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord aylestone says and with great respect i have to say that i resent this that we on this side of the house will oppose his amendment because nobody bites the hand that feeds him <e> <s> this is not the basis on which we oppose this amendment <e> <s> we oppose it on grounds of equity on grounds of comparison and on grounds of the undertakings which the government have given to the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down because he did refer to what i said may i ask him whether he appreciates that he has done it again <e> <s> does he appreciate what we have had to put up with throughout this bill <e> <s> he comes across men you do get men he knows these chaps we are never told their names or the circumstances we live in a fog of generality <e>", "<cs> my lords i have only two points to raise as a result of what the noble lord has said <e> <s> first this is covered by the understanding which the government has with the tuc because the understanding with the tuc is that the government will not change the present contracting-out arrangements <e> <s> it was on that basis that we complained about the governments amendment which has now been passed and which says that an employer can cancel the check-off on the initiative of the individual worker <e> <s> this whole question of dealing with the contracting out and contracting in position was covered by the agreement <e>", "<cs> my lords there is a sense in which one welcomes this amendment <e> <s> it is the sense that since the government are imposing upon trade unions the necessity to have periodic ballots in the case of political levies and since they are imposing upon them a preference whereby they are going to end up as a result of the provisions of the bill probably having postal ballots and indeed most ballots for political funds are carried out by postal ballots one ought i suppose to be pleased that the government are making the money available and in that sense i welcome the amendment <e> <s> but the fact is that there is something strange about this amendment something one might almost say curiously mean about this amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down would he not agree then that if that was the intention of the government the best way they could have done it would have been to introduce some qualification to say that you can get the money only once every five years or once every three years but not to say that you cannot get the money at all <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl sits down would he not admit since he has quoted undy and martin that what undy and martin show is that you can divide trade union rule books into three groups <e> <s> there are those which allow in effect the executive to decide when there will be a strike there are those which allow certain delegate conferences to do it and there are those which consult the members often by ballot <e> <s> but under the provisions of this bill everybody has to do it by ballot everybody indeed has to have a mandatory ballot <e> <s> in order to have a mandatory ballot undy and martin say that in something like per cent <e> <s> of unions if not more you would have to change the rules <e> <s> this is the argument <e> <s> does not the noble lord the minister accept the argument <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that the main reason why we on this side do not cheer when he announces a rising number of people in employment is that an even larger number of people are out of employment <e> <s> the fact is that the size of the labour force is going up and of course there will be more people in employment <e> <s> the question is the balance <e> <s> is not the critical thing that the government should have some policy and that they should announce some target on how they will bring down the rate of long-term unemployment <e> <s> in fact they have policies and targets about the psbr public expenditure prices and the exchange rate but no policy at all to bring down the long-term level of unemployment <e>", "<cs> rubbish <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord not aware that that is a first-class definition of the governments community industry programme <e>", "<cs> my lords we are seriously worried by the speech of the noble minister <e> <s> i want if i can to <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down and i am sure he does not want to misrepresent me would he not agree that what i was saying was not that i did not have time to gather together or cobble together objections but that i thought that on the face of it amendment no <e> <s> was contradicted by amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> says that you bring it in at once and all together when you bring in part i and amendment no <e> <s> says that you make an exception in the case of clause <e> <s> i do not see how you can have those two things together <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not wish to make a meal of this amendment but it strikes us that it indicates further as we have been arguing in previous amendments the degree of complexity which the government now expect from the certification officer <e> <s> the noble earl says and i think i have it right that the objective of the certification officer in this part of his functions is to provide a quick reliable and inexpensive remedy <e> <s> but of course the way that he proceeds to provide that remedy is by an inquisitorial and investigating function <e>", "<cs> oh <e>", "<cs> my lords since the committee stage of this bill we have been reflecting on how we could describe our feelings during the remainder of that stage then on report and now at third reading <e> <s> it seems to me that we must have refuge in a naval analogy <e> <s> we have felt like the crew of the frigate which was commanded by rear-admiral gascoyne dascoyne in the film kind hearts and coronets <e> <s> no doubt the noble earl will remember that the rear-admiral eventually noticed an ocean liner looming out of the fog and ordered a course hard astarboard <e> <s> the only problem was that the liner was on the starboard bow and despite the plausible reasonable pleadings of his shipmates all the rear-admiral would ever do was to heave more and more hard astarboard because he had never been known to change his mind <e> <s> that is how we have felt throughout this debate <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl will know because i have told him before that i never comment on contemporary disputes which are going through the process i hope of resolution <e> <s> but quite clearly since he asks me everybody is involved in that dispute <e> <s> the government are in the end the holding company the government are in the end to some extent the employer and of course everybody involved in that dispute is responsible for it <e> <s> i hope that they settle it very soon <e>", "<cs> my lords first may i congratulate the noble lord lord seebohm on his excellent report <e> <s> we on this side of the house agree with almost everything that is contained in it <e> <s> there are one or two areas with which i disagree <e> <s> at least i think i disagree if i have got it right <e> <s> it may be that i have not got it right and that therefore i shall find that in the end i agree <e> <s> i wish also to ask a number of questions of the government spokesman <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to try to do three things this afternoon <e> <s> first i wish to congratulate the noble lord lord gregson and his distinguished colleagues on their admirable report <e> <s> secondly i want to say i say it with some temerity where i agree and where i disagree although like the noble lord lord nelson i am not a medical man and did not serve on the committee <e> <s> neverthless there are two areas where i do not think yet that i quite agree with the committee <e> <s> finally i want to comment on the governments response <e>", "<cs> my lords may i intervene <e> <s> in the light of what the noble lord said earlier can he tell us what service is being reduced in order to enable that service to be expanded <e>", "<cs> my lords this has been on the whole a good-tempered relevant and well-meaning debate <e> <s> in the time available to me i cannot hope to sum up either the case on our side of the house or the arguments set against it in other parts of the house <e> <s> i should like to say very quickly one or two words to those of us who i am afraid i would argue with great respect have introduced an irrelevancy into this <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down may i ask whether he is suggesting that the financial disincentives to work of which he makes so much and by which he justifies tax cuts were significantly different when unemployment was per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord made a great deal of the fact and we have minutes for the answer that the financial disincentives to work are now so much that we must have tax cuts <e> <s> i am asking him if the financial disincentives were any different when unemployment was per cent <e> <s> but we had more jobs <e>", "<cs> my lords i want to do three things very quickly <e> <s> first i want to thank the noble lord lord rochester for reminding us of this small section in the employment act for which he was responsible and then i simply want to remind the house very briefly as to how we came to obtain this section because it leads into the second thing i want to do which is to obtain if i can understand it the governments view of this section and to see if i can get it right <e> <s> no doubt if i get it wrong the noble lord lord belstead will tell me <e> <s> thirdly i should like to go back to the central point of this question and from our point of view on these benches ask something about the conclusions reached by her majestys government in monitoring the actions reported and indeed some questions about when we are going to get if we are to get them the results of that monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords that is perfectly true <e> <s> in fact it was withdrawn in committee and reintroduced on report <e> <s> but the government at that stage told us why we should not pass the amendment if we had gone to a division <e> <s> they said it would impose a rigid legal system <e> <s> they said that it would be unwise to rush in pell-mell in advance of the vredeling proposals but the noble lord was not to be put off and as he said he brought the amendment back on report and the government once again said that it was rigid inflexible and at the same time anodyne <e> <s> however the house voted for it on that occasion by votes to votes <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he confirm that i have understood him correctly <e> <s> will he confirm that the government have no intention of publishing the results of their monitoring exercise <e> <s> is that what the noble lord is saying <e> <s> we all know about the workshop survey it had no questions about section <e> <s> the noble lord says that he is monitoring the results <e> <s> will he publish the results of that monitoring <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord lord rochester says he feels diffident as a latecomer to the committee i feel positively humble as someone who was not on the committee at all and who did not even give evidence to it as the noble baroness lady platt of writtle did <e> <s> nevertheless i want to say something about this excellent report <e> <s> first i should like to congratulate as everyone who has spoken has done the noble lord lord seebohm on the oversight of such an excellent report which is quite unanswerable so far as it goes <e> <s> secondly i should like to separate out as i see them the two different sorts of arguments put forward by those who oppose the directive and the recommendations in the report <e> <s> thirdly i should like to say something about what i regard as the only significant argument that can really be put forward against this proposal although unfortunately for the government <e> <s> i do not think it is an argument that is available to them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it fair to say that the kind of problems that the noble lord is talking about are intended to be dealt with in the provisions under the draft directive on leave for family reasons <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord young of graffham for repeating the statement <e> <s> i can tell him and i could have told the noble lord lord barnett had he been here that we like the second white paper much more than we like the first white paper after all it actually proposes things <e> <s> most of the things indeed i would say all of the things that it proposes we are very much in favour of ourselves <e> <s> i should like to concentrate if i may as did the statement on what is suggested in the white paper for the youth training scheme <e>", "<cs> my lords i have three things to do this evening <e> <s> first i must thank the noble lord lord barnett for initiating this debate <e> <s> second i must sum up the argument as we see it on this side of the house <e> <s> third i must like every other speaker who has spoken in this debate except the noble lord himself congratulate the noble lord lord murray of epping forest on an outstanding maiden speech <e> <s> it is not surprising that that should be so because lionel murray was an outstanding general secretary of the trades union congress <e> <s> if i agree with the noble lord lord marsh about only one matter i agree with him about that <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord telling us that before the consultation process begins he has already decided that wages councils are no good because they destroy jobs and must go <e>", "<cs> as the noble lord lord winstanley has said we pass now from the somewhat elevated debates that we have been having so far on the bill about the constitutional role of the house and the political assumptions behind the bill to consider the consequences for the staff <e> <s> we shall be arguing that the bill in many respects contains a number of very serious consequences for the staff which derive from the fact that for almost the first time although not quite the government are departing from established principles for dealing with staff problems in matters of reorganisation that have governed these things almost since the years after the second world war for years or so <e> <s> the government are fundamentally departing from those principles <e>", "<cs> now that the noble lord lord rochester has as it were moved his own amendment i would agree and we on our part would agree with everything that he has said about his amendment <e> <s> they are two alternative ways of doing much the same thing <e>", "<cs> i am amazed at the general arguments of the noble earl <e> <s> it seems to me that each one he advances contradicts the one before <e> <s> he says that this is not an exercise designed to make large numbers of workers redundant <e> <s> there might have been an argument for saying that one could not have accepted one or other of our amendments if indeed it could be admitted that it was an exercise designed to make large numbers of workers redundant <e> <s> however if as the noble earl said it is an exercise to shrink the labour force over time and if the number of the redundancies or the number of the run-down in the labour force mentioned in the bill as is a greatly exaggerated figure and if the numbers are very small then this emphasises our case that people could be given a general guarantee <e> <s> it is only if the government really intend to dismiss large numbers of people that either of these amendments would be dangerous to them <e> <s> but if they mean what they say then certainly there is no reason that i can see why the government should not accept amendment no <e> <s> ad which is put forward by the noble lord lord rochester <e>", "<cs> i have no objection to the amendment <e> <s> my objection is to the clause <e> <s> but that will be raised when the noble lord lord irving moves his opposition to the clause standing part <e>", "<cs> my lords i am in a little difficulty <e> <s> the noble earl has put these three amendments together and i had understood that we had agreed through the usual channels that these amendments should remain apart <e> <s> nevertheless i will put them <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that what the noble lord the minister has said today contradicts what he said to my noble friend at column of <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understand the noble lord he says that the differences result from a greater ability to create wealth <e> <s> does he say that since all the increases in the upper decile as against the lower decile which are quite unprecedented and did not occur in any country over this period were examples of increased ability to get wealth <e> <s> what has that to do with pricing people into work <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not for me to forecast the ways of god and man <e> <s> however i wonder whether the noble lord realises that he has achieved for him and indeed i think for all secretaries of state in this post another first because since when the ministry of labour was created all ministers of labour and secretaries of state have been in the other place including of course mr bevin mr bevan and the present leader of our own house <e> <s> but even before when labour affairs were under the control of the board of trade as you go back into th century history you find that the president of the board of trade with responsibility for labour affairs was still in the other place and very distinguised presidents of the board of trade they were including winston churchill david lloyd george and joe chamberlain <e>", "<cs> my lords i shall not keep the house very long <e> <s> we have listened with care and close attention to the case against our amendment which has been advanced on the other side <e> <s> no measures were proposed by the secretary of state and least of all by the noble viscount which would achieve <e>", "<cs> my lords we have no quarrel with the order as it stands <e> <s> our questions which are directed to the secretary of state relate to how far the order goes because we want to be clear about that to whether the order goes far enough and to whether the order as it stands deals with many of the problems of workers being declared redundant as a result of the act problems which we raised in the house at the time <e> <s> i should also like to ask about the way the order relates to the recent announcement of the government that they are going to end the system of sharing the part cost of redundancies as far as the employer is concerned from st october next <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord concludes may i ask him to be absolutely clear <e> <s> is he telling the house that there is no need to shed additional unnecessary labour and therefore no need for the redundancy payments act <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that the estimates of the cbi to which he does not seem to want to refer are if anything conservative <e> <s> the fact is that the job loss since is far greater than the estimates which the cbi suggests for the job loss next year <e> <s> if the noble lord will not give figures on the cbis estimates will he tell us in what direction the government expect to see an increase in employment next year <e> <s> is it to be in the service industries <e> <s> and if it is to be in services which part of services <e> <s> can the noble lord give any figures at all <e>", "<cs> my lords in the general climate of christmas good cheer i should like to thank the noble lord for his explanation in particular of the first order that we have to consider which we fully support <e> <s> let me also say since i think that i heard him say during the speech of the noble lord lord bruce that he had been reduced to second-hand nightwear that i hope that he gets some for christmas <e> <s> we have no point to make on the first order <e> <s> on the second matter the regulations i should like to ask the government from where they get the per cent <e> <s> what is the basis on which there will be an increase in the payment of claims maximum of per cent <e>", "<cs> my lords the mystery deepens <e> <s> the noble lord has told us that the increase under the pneumoconiosis payment of claims regulations is per cent <e> <s> to my question why <e> <s> he says that it has something to do with the fact that the government take into account the ability of industry to pay <e> <s> i do not regard that as a satisfactory explanation <e> <s> i would have thought that it should be based on the retail price index and the movement in that index in order to ensure that the receivers of these benefits maintain the real value <e> <s> indeed if that were the reason the pneumoconiosis payment of claims regulations and the per cent <e> <s> increase might be said to be in line with requirements <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that there is a basic inconsistency in what the government are saying <e> <s> in general terms they say that real wage improvements destroy jobs that is what the chancellor is saying all the time but in particular cases the government give increases which are far above increases in the cost of living <e> <s> very significant real wage increases are given to people at the top of the scale and then we are told that it does not destroy jobs <e> <s> where is the consistency and how can the government reconcile the inconsistency <e>", "<cs> my lords the task of somebody on this side of the house in replying to a debate of this kind i suppose should be discharged in three ways <e> <s> the first is to thank the proposer of the motion which i do most heartily and i congratulate the noble lord lord jacques as my noble friend lord oram said on putting the case in his usual crisp no-nonsense way <e> <s> the second is to summarise as i see it the nub of the case that has been put from this side of the house and <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble duke asks me these questions and i must therefore be allowed to answer them as briefly as i can <e> <s> if the noble duke will look at a review by treasury officials on the relationship between employment and wages which was published by the government he will see that there the chancellor argues that there is a relationship between the rate of increase in money wages and real wages and the rate of increase in employment <e> <s> also the noble duke will find that quite recently <e> <s> in another place the minister of state for employment said that if only the level of wages had not risen as fast as it did over the last few years we could now have a million more people in employment <e> <s> this is what the government said <e> <s> it is not so much a cut in wages that is asked for as a reduction in the rate of increase in wages and in particular a reduction in real wages <e> <s> that is government policy <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i have asked him two questions for the second time <e> <s> will he tell me when he is going to answer those questions <e> <s> maybe he could answer now the third question <e> <s> in the light of the intervention from the noble duke the duke of norfolk is it not true that it is government policy to bring about a reduction in unit costs by a fall in real wages <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness not agree that although we know that crown immunity has existed for a very long time we do not know why it continues to exist <e> <s> what is the justification for it <e>", "<cs> i should like to support the noble baroness lady turner in her amendment <e> <s> there are several reasons one can give for this some of which have already been given <e> <s> the first is that the strongest arguments which have been made in the committee for the bill have related to the modifications in the sunday opening provisions <e> <s> all the arguments about anomalies fish and chip shops and only being able to buy the bible at london airport and all the <e>", "<cs> no <e> <s> i am referring to the wages councils <e> <s> it is in this bill <e> <s> even then as i was saying all kinds of things which the wages councils can now do which might enable the wages councils to look after young workers including the half day off and so on should be taken away from the powers of the wages councils <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that tea breaks and lunch breaks do not matter to these workers or is he saying that they get them without the law <e>", "<cs> i find it difficult to follow the arguments of the last two speakers <e> <s> the position is simple <e> <s> the minister told us before dinner that the trouble with this part of the act is that it is out of date we have not been told precisely how <e> <s> we have been told that time has marched on and left it behind <e> <s> we tried to say before dinner hang about <e> <s> that is not an argument because there are amendments on the marshalled list which in a sense help to bring it up to date <e> <s> that is what the amendments try to do <e> <s> to some extent they try to meet the point that times have changed in ways that were not specified by the government and there are things which can be done to improve part ii of the act <e>", "<cs> may i finish what i am saying <e> <s> it does not seem to me that that follows <e> <s> what we are saying is that the scope of over two-thirds of the act has been taken away but that does not seem to us to be a reason why we should not improve the part which remains <e>", "<cs> i have found difficulty in understanding what the minister has said for the last five minutes has to do with the case against the amendment <e> <s> he has been saying that many people want to work on sunday <e> <s> but surely these people who want to work on sunday so much would not object to getting double time <e> <s> they would not object to having a hour week <e> <s> that is all the amendment says <e>", "<cs> the noble lord tells us that this is not the something to come <e> <s> he has not yet shown his copper bottom <e> <s> we only hope that it comes before the night is out <e> <s> he does not deal with two of my arguments and he puts forward three of his own <e> <s> i think that one of them is an own goal and i will come to that <e>", "<cs> i thank the noble lord for telling me that but i hope he sees the implications of what he is saying <e> <s> if it be the case and i should be very surprised if it were the case that the government are not going to introduce a bill dealing with wages councils into this place or the other place before they get the review of young people through published and considered by the equal opportunities commission and whoever else does it and if they are going to wait that is fine and the noble lord has an argument <e> <s> but if they are not going to wait if they are going to introduce a bill in another place before this review comes in the noble lord cannot use as an argument to me that nothing can be done until the review comes in <e> <s> it does not affect the wages councils so why should it affect the shops act <e>", "<cs> that does not convince me <e> <s> what i am saying is that the government are quite happy to go on making changes in the conditions of protection of young people <e> <s> they do not use that as an argument except when we put down amendments <e> <s> then they use it as an argument and say changes cannot be made because they are undertaking a review <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister makes two arguments <e> <s> one of them is much more effective than the other <e> <s> he says that it cannot be done because the object of the bill is to deregulate <e> <s> every time an amendment is tabled which arrests the inevitable and inexorable process of deregulation he believes that the government can stop us by just saying we cannot have that because it arrests the process of deregulation <e> <s> we say that deregulation irrespective of the consequences for workers rights and the protection of workers is something that we do not support <e> <s> that goes back to the speech much earlier today of the noble earl lord stockton <e> <s> he said that in this bill the government are giving us another example of deregulation and nothing but deregulation irrespective of the consequences and in particular irrespective of the consequences for workers rights <e>", "<cs> the centre of the argument against the amendment seems to be that nobody need work on sunday and that nobody need work in a shop <e> <s> with great respect that seems to be a tunnel vision s argument <e> <s> perhaps it was true in when unemployment was per cent <e> <s> or less that nobody need work in a shop or on a sunday because there were plenty of jobs available for everyone <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord take this opportunity to say that the government accept the unique advantages of the mode b scheme and that although it is more expensive it has a number of considerable advantages in that it narrows in on the unemployed and the long-term unemployed <e> <s> will he give an undertaking that the government anticipate that at least the present proportion the present distribution between mode a and mode b whereby mode b accounts for about per cent <e> <s> of the total number of places will be maintained <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to raise a point on the crystal-clear amendment moved by the noble and learned lord lord denning <e> <s> in order to do so i should like to see whether i understand the ministers speech <e> <s> i shall not enter into discussion of what the minister said and what he meant in reply to the questions which were asked about the schedule because if he reads it again and i hope that we shall all read it again he will probably be still more confused <e> <s> apart from that his other points did not really support the argument that he put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter says as he has said several times in the course of these debates that we are seeking to put shopworkers i think i have him right in a special position to make them a special case <e> <s> he subsequently said that this would give them a privileged position <e> <s> our position on this would be that they are a special case and that the government accept that they are a special case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that is equally important and equally affects trade unionists and non-unionists but it will be moved separately <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble baroness asked me whether i was moving amendment no <e> <s> and i said no <e> <s> i am moving amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords in the circumstances and since it has not been discussed it would be better for amendment no <e> <s> not to be moved <e> <s> when we reach that amendment i shall not move it <e>", "<cs> my lords i wanted to remind the house that we are not talking about the right not to be dismissed at all <e> <s> there is no right not to be dismissed <e> <s> in schedule the heading is right not to be dismissed and one might think without reminding oneself that that is being offered to all shopworkers in future <e> <s> what there is is a right to compensation if one is unfairly dismissed <e> <s> what is being proposed is that we should establish a new right which would not exist without the schedule for shopworkers who have been unfairly dismissed because <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that that is not correct <e> <s> it is true that once again we use the language of right to reinstatement but if the employer refuses to reinstate or re-engage there is no right of reinstatement <e> <s> there is simply an additional award of compensation <e> <s> all you get is compensation <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness allow that she has totally bemused us <e> <s> we appeared to be discussing an amendment put forward by the noble baroness lady seear about time off in lieu of sunday working which so far as i can see makes no reference whatever to sex discrimination or to any of the matters with which the noble baroness has just regaled the house <e> <s> the amendment says <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him this question <e> <s> i am not quite sure what he is saying <e> <s> is he saying that he would come back at third reading for example and propose an amendment to paragraph so that instead of reading an agreement it read a provision in the contract of employment <e>", "<cs> the committee will know that we like to agree with the government when we can and we find that we can <e> <s> at least we find that we cannot agree with the amendment <e> <s> i should like to ask some questions to clarify the significance of the amendment and how the amendment stands with other parts of the bill <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment wishes to leave out subsection but not to leave out subsection <e> <s> yet subsection is a way of carrying out some of the things that the government want to do as a result of subsection <e> <s> it is not clear to me why the amendment did not want to get rid of both subsections and <e> <s> i should like to have that clarified <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down may i see whether i have his argument right <e> <s> although he wants to apply the act he seems to be saying that the problem with applying the sex discrimination act to the employment of fewer than five people is that on the one hand it will cause difficulty but on the other it will not <e> <s> if it be the case that all kinds of administrative resources are required to avoid discrimination i should have thought that all we wanted was an absence of prejudice he has an argument <e> <s> but he cannot at the same time say that in fact there is no prejudice and no difficulty <e> <s> what is it to be <e>", "<cs> we support this amendment <e> <s> as i tried to suggest in the discussion on an earlier amendment we find this part of the bill rather ambiguous and rather complex <e> <s> we should have preferred a much more straightforward inclusion within the provisions of the sex discrimination act of private households and undertakings <e> <s> nevertheless the government have provided a qualified way of doing that and that is done in the part of the clause which the noble baroness considers should remain <e> <s> i find it very difficult as she does to see what is the discrimination which needs to be retained and which needs to be practised on the basis of this part of the clause <e> <s> the <e>", "<cs> we are prepared to accept this amendment <e> <s> in fact we believe that it is a perfectly logical provision to insert into the bill <e> <s> we find it difficult to understand why the government themselves did not put such a clause into the bill <e> <s> after all the act makes a distinction between employment in establishments and employment in other bodies <e> <s> it then goes on to provide that the provisions of the act shall apply in a whole range of other bodies including trade unions qualifying bodies employment agencies the msc the police and so on and of course partnerships <e>", "<cs> i find it very difficult despite listening to the noble lord lord monson to understand the logic of this amendment <e> <s> i am not surprised to have learned from the noble lady lady saltoun of abernethy that in fact it was not their first choice <e> <s> it seems to me that it is just possible to argue as they did before well to hell with the sex discrimination act to hell with the european court we are not going to change our present legislation <e> <s> that is damning but it is logical but it has been defeated <e> <s> it is just possible to argue i suppose and it seemed to me that a large part of the noble lords speech was arguing to put the whole thing off for three years rather in the way that the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> may i explain my argument to the noble lord lord monson as i think he may have misunderstood me <e> <s> i was trying to say that it would be logical but not lawful to postpone matters for three years if that was what he wants but i know that it is not because at least one might argue that people who are affected would have to get ready for what is coming <e> <s> but if you allow it to happen for three years and then stop it happening that is both illogical and unlawful <e>", "<cs> i am genuinely astonished at the ministers reply <e> <s> i would argue that virtually everything he said could have been said about the governments own amendment in the case of the shops bill <e> <s> i do not see how the government can put forward a totally separate set of arguments in these circumstances <e> <s> of course it could be argued that this amendment loads the dice against employers as the minister said <e> <s> of course it could be argued that this amendment is unnecessary <e> <s> of course it could be argued that the provisions of the acts which the bill proposes to abolish are themselves outmoded <e> <s> but all these are arguments which could have been brought against what the government proposed in the shops bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord questions whether i can see the difference <e> <s> i cannot see the difference <e> <s> this is the argument that the noble baroness lady seear is very fond of calling its only a small baby argument <e> <s> if anybody is smothered it will only be a small baby or it will not be more than a few babies and surely we are not bothered about just a few babies <e> <s> of course if it were a large number of babies and they were smothered in a very nasty way then we would be in the situation of the shops bill <e>", "<cs> the noble lord knows that he very rarely convinces me and he has not convinced me today <e> <s> i want to press this amendment to a division <e>", "<cs> we have no objection to this amendment or had no objection to this amendment as it stood but we believe that our own series of amendments which were passed earlier this evening in effect supervene this amendment <e> <s> nevertheless since the noble baroness has moved it we see no reason why we should not support it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord really cannot expect to come to this house in committee at this time of night and get away with those things <e> <s> he is going back again into the dichotomy into the contradiction which we have had all day long on that side of the committee <e> <s> first of all they say that nobody wants to do these things so therefore we can get rid of the protections <e> <s> then they say that if we are not allowed to get rid of the protections then nobody will be allowed to do what it is essential that they should do <e> <s> you cannot have it both ways <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to learn that we oppose this clause standing part of the bill <e> <s> the purpose of clause is to abolish the baking industry hours of work act <e> <s> the government are very fond of saying that things are out of date old-fashioned and so on <e> <s> we would say that in the present context the regulations in the baking industry hours of work act are eminently reasonable <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to begin by welcoming the noble lord lord trefgarne who is to reply for the government to this debate <e> <s> this has become an annual debate i am afraid between on our side of the house the noble lord lord rochester who was responsible for section of the act and myself and a series of ministers on the other side of the house <e> <s> as the noble lord said we have had the noble lord lord belstead we had at the beginning of it all the noble earl lord gowrie and we have i suppose some hope that if things go on as they are next year we may actually have the secretary of state himself <e> <s> meanwhile we welcome the noble lord lord <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i put this point <e> <s> if he says as i think he did that the survey of the ipm can be faulted because it is considerably less comprehensive than that which was provided by the doe in june will he then give an undertaking that a fuller and equally comprehensive survey will be undertaken by the doe in the immediate future <e>", "<cs> my lords we should like to thank the minister for accepting the argument put forward at committee stage by the noble baroness and for introducing this amendment at this stage <e> <s> it was a general argument which had general support in the committee at that stage that if the government were acceding to the request to remove discrimination from small firms then they should also do it for small partners as it were <e> <s> we are glad that the government have done this and we are interested to hear of the further amendments that the government are going to introduce in another place as a result of other decisions <e>", "<cs> my lords we wish to support this amendment <e> <s> as we understand it and as the noble baroness has said the amendment is an attempt to return to the code of practice that very carefully and clearly seeks to take into account the objections that <e>", "<cs> my lords does that refer to taking a bath <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for his tribute to my broadmindedness <e> <s> we welcome this amendment so far as it goes <e> <s> we took the view that there was never any need for the second limb of clause and as a result of that we supported an amendment by the noble baroness lady platt at committee stage to delete the second limb <e>", "<cs> my lords at the time of the second reading the obvious way to epitomise the attitude to this bill on this side of the house would have been to say that it was a curates egg of a bill <e> <s> the only problem was that the idea that it was a curates egg of a bill suggested that it was all mixed up and it was not easy to say which bits of it were excellent and which bits were not so excellent <e> <s> but of course this bill was not quite like that because all the excellent bits were at the top of the egg <e> <s> as you worked your way down the egg the egg got worse <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down he will agree that he is not without influence in another place let alone in downing street <e> <s> is his statement that he marvels at the wisdom of this house any indication that he may recommend that the government accept that wisdom <e>", "<cs> my lords the last time that the secretary of state and i debated a government measure to regulate the labour market it was the sex discrimination act <e> <s> i said at the time that it seemed to me to be something like the curates egg except that all the good parts were at the top of the egg <e> <s> i am afraid that we cannot say that much for this bill <e> <s> there is not much to our taste to any part of this bill <e> <s> there is nothing fresh in the bill there is nothing new in this bill and there is no part of the bill which on balance we find in any way appetising <e> <s> indeed from this side of the house the bill resembles not so much an egg as a stale meat sandwich the kind of stale meat sandwich one was lucky to find in a wartime station buffet <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that it is impossible to predict <e> <s> how does he explain the figures given by the secretary of state of between and <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i accept that he has attempted to answer many of the questions we have posed but he has still not tried to answer the question of how far the government believe that wages will be required to fall in order to produce a significant employment effect <e> <s> the government must have assumed some elasticity of demand for labour in order to produce the bill <e> <s> what is the assumed elasticity of demand for labour <e>", "<cs> i think it was our intention that although the noble lord lord rochester could speak to both amendments there would be a separate vote on our amendment <e> <s> we intend to press our amendment to a separate vote <e> <s> therefore if the noble lord were in a position in which he wanted to support one rather than the other he would in the end be able to do so <e>", "<cs> not again <e>", "<cs> the noble lord really is amazing <e> <s> if he wants to say that he should like our amendment to propose one-fifth rather than one-twentieth of course we will do that but otherwise what he says is quite irrelevant <e> <s> we say one-twentieth because we are trying to be reasonable <e> <s> it is not an argument against our reasonability for the noble lord to say that we should have been unreasonable or less reasonable <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to find that we wish to oppose the motion that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> i wish to say a few words about what the clause does what the government have said and done this afternoon and what the consequences we believe will be <e> <s> this clause is to replace the provisions of the or so acts dealing with deductions and payments by workers with two broad tests what is allowed and provided by the statute and what is contained or implied in the contract <e> <s> we have sought in various ways to argue that this is insufficient <e> <s> we have sought to argue that it is an imperfect form of protection in particular in relation to section of the truck act and most especially in relation to that part of the act that has been represented this afternoon as the reasonability test <e>", "<cs> i know what the minister has in front of him but he could always change it if i say it but i shall say it all the same <e> <s> he might say well it is all there in the act <e> <s> why do we need a provision of this kind <e> <s> after all there is in the act a provision which relates fairness or unfairness to conduct <e> <s> is this not conduct <e> <s> would not any decent tribunal say that you cannot dismiss someone for conduct of this kind <e> <s> or if conduct does not fit he might say what about some other substantial reason which is there in the act <e> <s> would that not cover it <e> <s> surely no tribunal he might say would uphold such cases if it could get them by covering it with some other substantial reason <e>", "<cs> may i develop that point because it is an interesting one <e> <s> as far i understand the noble lord he is saying three things and if i get it wrong i ask him not to say so now but to go away and think about it <e>", "<cs> in those circumstances and in the hope of a better morrow i shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i must ask the minister in the light of what he has just said what his answer would be in relation to the agricultural wages board <e> <s> the minister says that one cannot have selectivity that one cannot have two systems <e> <s> however he has two systems because the government are not designing to do away with the agricultural wages board or to impose upon it that which they are proposing in respect of all the other wages councils in this bill <e>", "<cs> if we rely on common sense we could have it any way we liked <e> <s> the question that i ask the minister is whether he will cite that research <e>", "<cs> which research <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to find that i am not convinced by the ministers arguments <e> <s> let us make clear what we are saying <e> <s> we are not saying and i have never said that there is no employment effect <e> <s> i am not saying that we can double and treble peoples wages and there will not be an employment effect <e> <s> i am not saying that if their wages are cut in half there will not be a reverse employment effect <e> <s> of course there is an employment effect <e> <s> somewhere out there there is an employment effect <e> <s> i keep asking the government what they say the employment effect is and they keep refusing to answer the question <e>", "<cs> i do not deny that that is an example <e> <s> i do not deny that such things happen <e> <s> i do not deny anything that the noble lord has said but that is not the general trend <e> <s> of course there are individuals who will not employ people unless they can pay them less than the wages council rates <e> <s> there are many people now who are employing people below wages council rates and they are very unlucky to be caught <e> <s> if that girl walked down the street she would probably find an employer who would pay her less than the wages council rate and he would not get caught <e>", "<cs> we naturally wish to oppose that this clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> we have opposed various bits of it tried to improve it in various ways and we have failed <e> <s> if we defeat the clause we shall not defeat the bill as i said in moving our first amendment <e> <s> this clause takes young workers out of the bill <e> <s> we shall still have the single rate we shall still have the employment test and we shall still have removal of all kinds of rates premia and holiday arrangements which can be set under the existing wages council legislation <e>", "<cs> will the minister not accept that other studies have been quoted in this committee which indicate that eight out of ten jobs were substitutions <e> <s> if it is such a wonderful scheme why are the government not continuing it <e>", "<cs> the noble lord the minister says that these things are best left to the employer and the <e>", "<cs> i have three points to make about this late amendment but first and i do not like doing this i must protest at the lack of notice that we have had not only in relation to this amendment which is the first new amendment that we have had to protest about but also in relation to the other late amendments which the government have put down <e> <s> in some ways the case against the lateness is worse on this amendment because i think i am right in saying that this is the first time in my period in the committee but other members go back much longer than me that an amendment has been printed not as an amendment but in a marshalled list and not even in the first marshalled list but in the second marshalled list <e> <s> this amendment first appeared in the second marshalled list this morning <e> <s> i think that that is something to complain about <e> <s> the advantage is that it is at least a simple amendment <e>", "<cs> i have heard that story too <e> <s> we can all retail stories <e> <s> what is remarkable is the way the minister keeps changing his reasons <e> <s> i must congratulate him <e> <s> he now says he did not say it before that they are doing it because people do not turn up <e> <s> if people do not turn up you sack them <e> <s> it is only a day <e> <s> you would not be sacking them from anything they would not want to be sacked from <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is better than he was his response is better than saying that people do not attend wages councils but still it will not do <e> <s> wages councils orders are not all lengthy and complex <e> <s> most are very short and are only a few pages long <e> <s> in the case of orders that are lengthy one does not have to read all of them because they are the same year after year after year <e> <s> you need only read the parts where the rates change <e> <s> sometimes the orders are in different colours <e> <s> the government would be doing something much more useful if they said that the orders ought to be in different colours then even the smallest or dwarfest of businessmen could understand a wages council order <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised to hear that i have not yet understood the clause and the amendments <e> <s> what is surprising is that my noble friend lord wedderburn of charlton who is unfortunately not in his place tells me that he has not yet understood them <e> <s> they are extraordinarily complicated <e> <s> i can say without fear of contradiction that we are frequently told that sir humphrey appleton is in the house and that he has done this that or the other <e> <s> sir humphrey was not responsible for this <e> <s> he would have done it much more simply <e> <s> in fact he might have done it much in the way that the minister did it money plus justifiable deductions and payments minus unjustifiable deductions and payments equals minimum pay entitlement <e> <s> had it been done like that we might have known where we are but what we have is a formula <e>", "<cs> i cannot quite follow what the noble lord said <e> <s> surely in that situation the employer would be able to ask for payment for anything he has supplied <e> <s> if the worker agreed that that payment should be made in the form of a deduction that would not be illegal <e> <s> it would be wrong to do that whether or not the worker agreed and then to say you have your minimum <e> <s> that would be wrong but let us not go into that <e>", "<cs> it is one thing to write to me but many other members of the committee are interested in the clause and i think it should be published <e>", "<cs> i agree with the point made by the noble viscount <e> <s> as i said earlier the government will not touch the agricultural wages board because they have too many friends among the farmers <e> <s> they will be all right <e> <s> it is the the industrial workers who are for the dark <e>", "<cs> it almost takes ones breath away <e> <s> i am prepared to make an offer to the government if they will read our amendment <e> <s> if they are serious they have delivered themselves into our hands <e> <s> the amendment states <e>", "<cs> what the noble lord will not let them have is a statute that says they must have a holiday <e> <s> i am saying that british industry god above can stand and can understand and will not fall down if a few workers have a statute that says that they can have a holiday <e> <s> i want to know what the minister would say if we came back with that proposal <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to keep going on this but we are due to stop at seven oclock anyway <e> <s> i am not saying that the amendment is a bad amendment <e> <s> it is a very modest amendment <e> <s> what i am saying is <e>", "<cs> if that is what the worker wants and if the worker is in a position to influence the employer as to what he wants and is not so dependent on the employer that he has to take what the employer gives him i have nothing to say about it <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment but we shall come back to the matter on report <e>", "<cs> as my noble friend lord stoddart said this amendment is about fixing appropriate premium payments other than overtime rates <e> <s> therefore it is right that we should look at what the wages councils orders do in particular cases to see what it is that the government are taking away <e> <s> as i argued earlier the occupational variations which wages councils fix are sensible and so are the premium payments which they fix for things other than overtime rates <e> <s> what the government are saying is that none of these things can be fixed by wages councils in future <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised that we are not convinced by the minister <e> <s> he uses these arguments about fundamental overhauls <e> <s> we are never told precisely what the employers said and precisely what they meant by fundamental overhaul and we are never told why a fundamental overhaul could not in fact allow us to have appropriate premium payments <e> <s> nevertheless we are not going to force a division on this tonight <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to pursue this matter but i am not convinced by what the noble lord has said <e> <s> this is an extremely modest amendment and the next amendment is even more modest <e> <s> nevertheless i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said something interesting <e> <s> he now says that the two halves of the clause are complementary that they are not alterna-tives which balance but that they reinforce each other <e> <s> i understand <e> <s> i think that late at night at twenty-five minutes past eight oclock we are having a statement of policy <e> <s> we are now being told that where rates are generally low let us use the crude words where they are near starvation level one would particularly take into account the factors which are likely to lower them still further <e> <s> that is what is being said <e> <s> we are being told that where they are generally low one should take into account the possibility of a negative employment effect and the lower they are the worse they get <e>", "<cs> on the contrary there are very few wages councils so far as i know maybe there are one or two which set a london rate <e> <s> the general practice in wages councils is not to set premia which are related to different parts of the country <e> <s> anyway the government would be taking this provision out because even if it were done under this bill it will not be allowed in the future <e> <s> under this bill there will be one single rate <e> <s> with her usual preciseness the noble baroness has made the point much better than i did in a much longer and more flaccid way <e>", "<cs> on the contrary <e> <s> the noble lord cannot get away with that remark <e> <s> there was a general level referred to in the act <e> <s> this was applied by the cac for years and years with no problem whatever <e> <s> it is a concept that is very generally known in industrial relations <e> <s> i am not trying to correct the noble lords ignorance but he cannot come along and say that a phrase such as general level is unknown in industrial relations <e> <s> it is very well known in industrial relations whereas the concept of the average is just a statistical isolated nothing <e> <s> as the noble baroness has said unless one is facilitating the breaking of the law <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is clearly saying that he will not take this away and think again <e> <s> nevertheless it is twenty to nine and i shall not divide the committee <e> <s> with great reluctance because the government are quite hopeless on the subject <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord cannot get away with that <e> <s> we are dealing with an amendment that asks the committee to put into the bill the effect that the rate will have on the pay the living standards the efficiency and the rate of turnover that is what the amendment says of the workers to whom it applies <e> <s> the noble lord says that he cannot have this because these are the words that he has used he wants to unshackle the workers and employers <e> <s> he wants to liberate the workers and the employers <e> <s> he want to get rid of the complexity that weighs down the workers and the employers <e> <s> i agree with the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> when the noble lord utters words like unshackle liberate and complexity <e>", "<cs> we wish to oppose that the clause stand part of the bill <e> <s> it is nice to be told that at some time this evening we shall get a little sugar loaf a little knob of sugar of the kind that you might throw to the dog <e> <s> it is nice to be told that it is coming but it has not come yet <e> <s> it has not come on this clause <e> <s> we have moved a whole series of amendments but the government have been obdurate <e> <s> the noble lord does not like us to say that he has stonewalled but the fact that he has stonewalled cannot be in doubt <e> <s> he has offered us absolutely nothing <e> <s> one might argue about whether when he stonewalls he is reasonable or justified but that he stonewalls cannot be in doubt <e> <s> we have tried to put back occupational rates sunday premia piecework minima holiday pay and shift premia and he has said no every time <e> <s> we even tried in a very modest attempt to concede something to say what about just putting in holidays without holiday pay <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he is very fond of saying and has been saying all night that nobody can understand wages councils awards <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord has ever tried to understand a wages council award <e> <s> i happen to have by me a good or so wages councils awards and most of them are very short <e> <s> for example the mutton award covers only two pages and the toy award covers only two pages <e> <s> most of these awards are very simple and the great majority do not change year in and year out <e>", "<cs> the noble lord said when he moved this amendment that he had spoken to it <e> <s> i accepted that but we wanted to have this clause moved separately <e> <s> i do not want to quarrel over that at this time but i should like to ask him whether he would <e>", "<cs> my noble friend lord stoddart is a much older hand and is shrewder than i am about these matters <e> <s> i wonder whether the noble lord the minister can let us know whether we passed the sugar plum <e> <s> we are at this time of night trying to help the committee and so we are not moving everything <e> <s> it would be a tragedy if as a result of not moving a particular amendment we were to lose the sugar plum <e>", "<cs> i should like to be absolutely clear on what the noble lord is saying because it may be worse than i feared <e> <s> i had thought that the intention was that after the bill became law the government would not seek to impose new orders without the intervention of the wages councils <e> <s> of course it might be the case as he says that a dilatory wages council would sit around and try to delay matters for months or so <e> <s> the government would therefore need as the noble lord said this reserve power in subsection <e> <s> of course they could always replace the members <e>", "<cs> with very great respect it gets worse <e> <s> i do not want to hound the noble lord but he has done it again <e> <s> he has replied to amendment no <e> <s> and everything that he says fits amendment no <e> <s> it is rather like holidays again but he does not reply to amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> was tabled precisely because we thought that the minister might very well say just what he did say about amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> is it being said that the government will not write the letter <e> <s> if the noble lord were to come to me and say we shall do that anyway because they often say that over there they say that they will do it anyway so why put it in the law it would not convince me but it would be a little more defensible <e> <s> is the noble lord really telling me that they do not intend to write to them but that it will come out of the dark if they decide to violate the rights of the wages councils even if the wages councils are only saying we shall do it on the due date <e> <s> maybe they will do it in january and the minister cannot wait that long <e> <s> is he saying that the government cannot agree to that amendment because in those circumstances they do not propose to write to the damned fellows let them stick it <e>", "<cs> i do not see that but we shall not get anywhere on this <e> <s> i would say that we shall come back to the matter on report but there are now so many things that we are to come back to that i do not know whether we shall have time and so although i am very unsatisfied i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i have no intention of intervening in this debate and the committee will be glad to learn that i shall not make another speech <e> <s> i had thought that we would keep this debate to the narrow issue of the amendment <e> <s> it has now rightly widened as i suppose was inevitable to encompass the whole question of part iii of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords in relation to the reply given by the noble lord to my noble friend lord hatch is it not the case that the government criticised the select committee of another place saying that it had exaggerated the extent to which there would be job creation as a result of its policies and that in fact there would only be per cent <e> <s> net job creation <e> <s> does that not apply to the governments own policies <e> <s> does it not apply to the job start scheme <e> <s> does it not apply to the new worker scheme <e> <s> does it not mean no more than jobs in positive net job creation in respect of the jobstart scheme because there is not enough money to do more <e> <s> would not the same apply to the new worker scheme <e> <s> is it not the case that the same criticism that the government levelled at the select committee in another place can be levelled at their own policies <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister please believe the horror that is felt on this side of the house whenever he tells us that the poor cannot create wealth that only the rich create wealth that we need them to create wealth so much that they can receive pay rises which are two three or four times the rate of increase in the cost of living but the poor must receive rises of only half the increase in the cost of living because the noble lord believes that the poor cannot <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that there is no precedent for what we are suggesting <e> <s> i take it that that is the thrust of what he is saying <e> <s> will he not accept it from us that the best precedent i do not suggest there is an exact precedent is the notes for guidance on health and safety which it is true are issued by the health and safety executive <e> <s> but they are issued by the health and safety executive on the authority of the act of parliament <e> <s> if the noble lord says to us that he would like acas to issue such a code as this by authority of act of parliament that would just be yet another amendment which perhaps we should bring back at third reading <e>", "<cs> my lords i see that the sweet bag has been put away <e> <s> may i first deal with the point made by the noble lord lord somers <e> <s> we are not trying to say in this amendment that any of the criteria which exist in the present unfair dismissal legislation under which the tribunals can decide whether someone is fairly or unfairly dismissed shall be changed <e> <s> therefore the kinds of situations the noble lord was talking about could easily be found before a tribunal to be a fair dismissal <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sorry that the secretary of state should take that line <e> <s> i am glad that he said that there is no implication of criticism even of those members who do not turn up <e> <s> i am glad that he says also that he does not want to change the composition although he did not actually say that he would not put small businessmen on the councils <e> <s> that point was put very strongly in another place at the committee stage <e> <s> the point that surprises me is that the secretary of state now says that there is no real problem because it would be perfectly possible by the existing rules to put on the councils people who would come <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised at what the minister said <e> <s> obviously we have nothing left in the sweetie bag tonight <e> <s> however i have to comment on some of what he said <e>", "<cs> my lords it is not true to say i am always dissatisfied <e> <s> i am well satisfied if anybody gives me a concession <e> <s> the trouble is that nobody does <e> <s> the minister is right <e> <s> it does not matter which noble lord replies <e> <s> they are equally difficult intransigent obstinate and bigoted <e> <s> neither gives an inch <e> <s> the sack and bag wages council order does not have six pages that deal with holidays <e> <s> most of the complexities concern premium payments and rates of those payments <e> <s> four weeks holiday is not a complicated provision <e> <s> it is simple <e> <s> it is a provision that is universally operated in a wages council industry <e> <s> i do not believe that the great majority of employers in those industries at the moment are not observing minimum holiday periods <e> <s> everybody knows what the minimum period is <e> <s> the evasions of wages council provisions with which the inspectorate is now much too small to deal for the most part relate to pay <e> <s> they arise partly because i admit premia can sometimes be complicated and because many employers do not want to pay the minimum rate <e> <s> most of the people most of the time will observe what the holidays are <e> <s> it is generally known in the particular wages council industry what the holidays are <e> <s> there is no complex-ity <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister made three or four remarks none of which was to the point <e> <s> he says that our argument is complicated and muddled but he does not say the precise way in which it is complicated and muddled <e> <s> i say that his bill is partisan and bigoted and i have spent a long time saying why <e> <s> the noble lord says that i have given a dimbleby lecture but he does not contradict any of the figures <e> <s> that is the trouble with this lot they never contradict the figures they ignore the figures but they told us earlier that they do not like evidence <e>", "<cs> my lords may i ask the minister to explore what he said <e> <s> i want to understand it <e> <s> i apologise if i misrepresented him earlier this afternoon in saying that he did not believe that the poor could produce wealth <e> <s> however he seems to be saving something rather strange today and we ought to try to understand it <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the first chance we have had to debate clause with full notice because the house will know that it was presented in committee at a very late stage <e> <s> this is the very first chance we have had to consider it with the benefit of the notes on clauses which the noble lord lord trefgarne promised to send us at the committee stage <e>

written and complicated clause <e> <s> it still shows no sign of having been written by sir humphrey but it is better than it was and two of the three points that we want to make about it will be made at another time <e>", "<cs> my lords i was going to say there was once again need here for strong black coffee but i am not sure that is right <e> <s> when one reads the face of the bill in the light of what the noble lord the secretary of state has said he is quite right in saying that this does seem to give us the substance of what we want <e> <s> i suppose that if we had written this amendment ourselves it would have read written consent or contractual consent and it would then have been perfect but this is a very long way forward and we thank the noble lord for it <e>", "<cs> my lords i gave notice that we wanted to say something about clause <e>", "<cs> my lords it was said at committee stage that this was the first opportunity we had to discuss clause and it was admitted at that stage that in fact since we could not discuss clause an opportunity would be given to us to do it at report stage <e> <s> however if i am told it cannot be done it cannot be done <e>", "<cs> my lords what the secretary of state says is quite amazing <e> <s> i ask the house to give the noble lord leave subsequently to tell us what he means when he says that some of the visits are unnecessary <e> <s> unnecessary in gods name from whose point of view <e> <s> is it unnecessary if the wages inspector goes there and finds that the man is actually paying the wage <e> <s> i do not call that unnecessary <e> <s> that is necessary to ensure a reasonably high level of compliance <e> <s> i hope that the secretary of state will tell us what he means by unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords the only part of the trilogy of amendments that the noble lord has moved on which i want to comment is amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> amendment no <e> <s> embodies for the purposes of that part of the bill the principle introduced into clause <e> <s> that was the clause on which we could not speak because we had neglected to put down an amendment <e> <s> the new clause simply re-enacted in a somewhat harsher form the principles laid down in the old section of the act <e> <s> the principle is the principle of apportionment according to the time spent on the work that is covered by a wages council <e> <s> this was made clear by the notes on clauses which the noble lord lord trefgarne gave to us on clause which were also intended to cover amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords following upon the answer which the noble lord has given can he tell the house what the likely impact as a result of this counselling and these questions will be on the unemployment figures <e> <s> i understand that it has been said that there is an expectation that the number of registered unemployed who have the counselling will be reduced by per cent <e> <s> is that his estimate and what impact will that have on the unemployment figures <e> <s> can the noble lord also say if a failure to follow the instructions given by the counsellors whether the individual is illiterate or not will result in the automatic suspension of benefit for weeks <e> <s> if this is so why weeks and what is an example of a failure of literacy <e>", "<cs> perhaps he can read the answers <e>", "<cs> my lords i am now moving to a general debate on amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> this is the point where we want to widen the argument as the noble lord lord wedderburn said <e> <s> we gave a muted welcome to the general

little to say on this amendment <e> <s> it is yet another example of deregulation <e> <s> the secretary of state is quite right it was generally welcomed in another place as a way of encouraging still more single sex vocational courses for women <e> <s> it was said in another place that there are no single sex vocational courses for men and that is an indication that things are moving in the right direction <e> <s> quite clearly there are a number of jobs and areas with professional qualifications and craft skills where we all want to encourage the provision of more training for women and if that is to be done by single sex vocational courses that is the way it should be done <e> <s> i merely want to make one or two points and see whether the secretary of state can reassure me on any of them <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord gives the same selection of reasons <e> <s> they are no more convincing now than they were then <e> <s> he gives no more details <e> <s> i cannot claim to have written all his reasons down but he says that the existing legislation is not particularly suited <e> <s> however the noble lord neglects to tell us in which precise way it is unsuited <e> <s> he says that it is a burden on business he does not say how <e> <s> in the noble lords own publication <e>", "<cs> my lords we do not wish to spend too long upon this particular point in the business tonight <e> <s> however there are a few comments to be made <e> <s> this provision was produced by the noble baroness on the other side of the house and was first suggested at the committee stage of the bill <e> <s> a number of reasonable objections were made to the particular form of words which the noble baroness used some of them on this side of the house <e> <s> as a result the noble baroness came back with an alternative form of words on report therefore the bill now includes this particular clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i must thank the noble viscount for his attempt to explain what the government are doing this year but it does not become any more consistent as the years go by <e> <s> each year the government advance a different minister to deal with the christmas updates <e> <s> last year it was the noble lord lord trefgarne <e> <s> each year the minister tells us a different story and each year when one looks closely at the figures one sees that the government tend to favour their favourites and discriminate against everyone else <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble viscount for the way in which he has introduced the bill <e> <s> it was much less provocative and with much less coat trailing than the way in which it was introduced in another place <e> <s> the opposition do not disagree with him <e> <s> we do not dispute the bills three main objectives to change the name of the coal board to extend certain financial commitments arising out of the disastrous dispute of and to facilitate the recognition of the union of democratic miners

questions now being asked and that these questions in effect ask people whether they will take work anywhere at any price and do any job <e> <s> that is what i am complaining about <e> <s> we are saying that the calculation that has been done by the government suggest to us and it has been said i <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that will be noticed in the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> is the noble lord seriously suggesting that we on this side of the house have not been concerned about unemployment since his government took office since and that we have only recently become concerned <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord looks at what i said he will see i did not say that at all <e>", "<cs> what i said was that those special measures are neccessary and i am not against them in order to prevent a level of unemployment over million <e> <s> if the government had not introduced those special measures that is what the level of unemployment would be <e> <s> i am not saying that there should be no special measures <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he make the position clear <e> <s> is it right that he is not challenging the effect of what i said in my examples <e> <s> by adding in the army and the self-employed the rate is reduced by per cent <e> <s> by taking <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he agree

has the highest unemployment rate of all but two countries <e> <s> the situation is not quite as the noble lord says <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for giving way <e> <s> i am not quite sure whether he is concluding that there should be higher wages or lower benefits <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the house in general and the speakers in particular for what i agree was a good debate <e> <s> the discussion has been wide and has ranged far <e> <s> i make it speeches <e> <s> twelve for the motion at least friendly and seven against at least less friendly <e> <s> this is a judicious balance although i am not saying that if we were unwise enough to empty the bars and vote we should get the same result <e> <s> with that thought in mind i beg leave to withdraw the motion and make way for a discussion of the moral fibre of the tabloid press <e>", "<cs> my lords i must begin by thanking the secretary of state for the explanation which he has given of the forthcoming green paper <e> <s> it is difficult for us to react to this very substantial set of proposals having had very short notice of them <e> <s> i <e>", "<cs> i hope that the people who are carrying on in this way will get up later and give their evidence to the house <e> <s> there is plenty of evidence of violence on picket lines there is also plenty of evidence that we have laws to deal with that

chapter and verse <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down may i ask him to make one point clear <e> <s> he said that he wants the new commissioner to be acceptable to trade unionists <e> <s> is he going to ballot the trade unionists on that <e>", "<cs> we are naturally disappointed by the replies of the noble viscount <e> <s> i accept that he has done his best to answer many of the points that have been raised though i am sorry that he did not refer particularly to the points made by my noble friend lord wedderburn in respect of the <e>", "<cs> my lords would the noble lord agree that in fact the total number of strikes has been going down for the last years <e> <s> the significant thing about the total number of strikes this year is that it is per cent <e> <s> above what it was last year <e> <s> nobody wants to suggest that that is the governments fault <e> <s> the noble lord surely would agree that whatever happens to the number of strikes or working days lost has little to do with the government and little to do with legislation and a great deal to do with whether or not there happens to be that year a major dispute in the public sector <e>", "<cs> my lords would it not be better if the noble lord did not make selective quotations from particular years but looked at general trends <e> <s> we can all take selective quotations from particular years <e> <s> i notice that he does not quote from when million working days were lost the third largest number since the general strike <e>", "<cs> my lords at this moment i should like to thank the noble baroness for initiating this debate <e> <s> there is widespread agreement in the house upon the nature of the problem <e> <s> the answer we are <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble viscount sits down perhaps i may say that he has given us many details of steps that other people are taking but apart from mentioning the programme of monitoring these assaults he has not replied to the questions that we asked about further action on the part of the government <e> <s> can he reply to those questions <e> <s> first is there any possibility that the government will finance macro-studies to find out the size of the problem <e> <s> secondly is there any possibility that the government will finance some more general handbook dealing with ways in which one might mitigate the problems <e> <s> thirdly what about the compensation provisions <e> <s> have the government any proposals to make in that regard <e> <s> those were specific questions that we asked the minister <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord try to answer the question <e> <s> is it a fact that more people were taken off the register than were given jobs not unlawfully or wrongfully taken off the register but taken off the register in merseyside <e> <s> can he answer that <e> <s> does he also want to say that a positive answer will he given to the letter he received earlier this week from the general secretary of the trades union congress asking for an objective independent study into restart and other employment creation programmes <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not unfair to say that noble lords on this side <e>", "<cs> my lords is it not the case that the answer to the last question of the noble lord lord hatch is i a job <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the minister a question about what he said concerning consultation <e> <s> he said that sport and leisure as a possible subject for compulsory tendering was subject to consultation <e> <s> however when it has been made subject to consultation will the government be influenced by the consequences of the consultation <e> <s> my noble friend lord graham mentioned what he thought people in the sport and leisure industry thought of the idea of compulsory tendering <e> <s> he said that they do not like it <e>", "<cs> the noble baroness said that in the interests of emergency services she believes that <e>", "<cs> before the minister sits down perhaps i may make sure that i have understood him <e> <s> is he saying that masterpieces such as the first sonnets of shakespeare or large parts of the <e>", "<cs> before the noble earl answers that question could he simply tell us whether it is a private mother grundy who brings the case or a government mother grundy <e> <s> is it a civil liability or criminal liability <e>", "<cs> before the noble baroness sits down i should like to say that it is not a question of selecting some works of art <e> <s> the first sonnets of shakespeare are a love poem from one man to another <e> <s> would she catch that or not <e>", "<cs> it is all right if it is shakespeare but not somebody else <e>", "<cs> the noble earl has said that the department of education and science was consulted <e> <s> will he tell us at what level it was consulted what it was asked and it said <e>", "<cs> my lords i support the amendment <e> <s> we have a problem in that i understand from the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls that under our rules of procedure we cannot say much after hearing the minister <e> <s> since we do not know what arguments the minister will be using we must attempt to anticipate his arguments <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister a question on the same point <e> <s> surely the thrust of the amendment is to say that the local authority itself will be able to have regard to any additional costs and if it does it will be within the law <e> <s> it will make the estimates and if it says were not going to go out to tender because when we take into account additional costs as a result of disabled and handicapped persons we are still under the price of the external tender then it will keep it in-house and it will be within the law <e> <s> there will be no bureaucracy it will be up to the local authority <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down can he tell the house when the government received that information <e> <s> presumably it must have been received since the committee stage of the bill in this house since the amendment was not put down at that time <e> <s> it must have been in the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i want to see that i have understood him correctly <e> <s> he said i think that he would support the closed shop if there was first a qualification but secondly membership of an association

if the unions run an examination <e>", "<cs> i am not <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had an interesting if not a balanced debate <e> <s> i make it seven speakers for the government and speakers against the government <e> <s> that assumes that the noble earl <e> <s> lord dundee will support the government <e> <s> if it has not been a balanced debate it has also not been a very novel debate <e> <s> indeed some of the arguments that have been used on both sides of the house have been a bit old hat <e> <s> that is not really our fault <e> <s> every other year this government introduce an anti-trade union bill <e> <s> i disagree with my noble friend lord graham of edmonton only in the fact that there was one other bill which he did not mention and that was the wages act <e> <s> therefore there is the employment act the employment act the trade union act the wages act and now we shall have the employment act <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord renton when he said that there will be more <e> <s> after all we have it on the highest conceivable authority <e>", "<cs> we gave notice that we wished to oppose the question that the clause shall stand part of the bill

place that all they are doing is something which they said they would do at the time of the general election and at the time of the publication of the green paper <e> <s> they are merely giving to trade union members that which they gave to employers in part ii of the act the right to stop a strike not subject to an authorised ballot under the terms of the act <e>", "<cs> this side of the committee withdrew amendment no <e> <s> so that we could participate in support of amendments nos <e> <s> and tabled in the name of the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> i hope that on this amendment

government were to protect the worker against the employer who sacked thousands of people at wapping because they broke their contracts and at the same time protect the workers against the union <e>

that they do not know what they are doing in so far as they know they intend it and they do not intend to do any good to the trade union movement <e>", "<cs> the noble lord almost opened his reservoir

amendment <e> <s> this is the amendment above all for which there is no need <e> <s> this is the amendment which is unnecessary unwise and unacceptable <e>", "<cs> shame <e>", "<cs> i should like to ask the noble lord to consider something else <e> <s> he spells out the case and spells out the bill but he does not make the case <e> <s> he says that these characters who have votes but who are covered by a workshop ballot can rely upon the act <e> <s> of course they can rely upon the act <e> <s> the minister makes the act <e> <s> we want to know the reason why the government have decided that they are allowed to rely on the act whereas those who have no votes the general secretaries and presidents who turn out to be a very small number cannot rely on workshop ballots <e>", "<cs> i should like to give the noble earl a concrete example of the kind of situation that we have in mind and then perhaps he will repeat his assurance <e> <s> is he saying that the secretary of state would never think of including in the code a statement to the effect that a union will not be allowed to explain its own case to the members on the ballot paper if it does not explain the employers case at the same time and to the same extent <e> <s> or that the union should not be allowed to call a strike even though it had its ballot within days if it has not first put the employers subsequent offer to its members <e> <s> they are two simple restrictions which the secretary of state may decide to include in his code of practice <e> <s> are we being told tonight that he will not do so <e>", "<cs>

i agree with everything which the minister has said <e> <s> of course it is impractical to define national industrial action in the way that the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford suggests <e> <s> of course <e>", "<cs> my lords i was not aware of that <e> <s> i apologise to the house <e> <s> if that is the case i shall sit down <e>", "<cs> my lords did the noble lord say tyrannous <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a most interesting debate and i should like to begin by thanking all those who have supported the amendment namely the noble lords lord rochester and lord donaldson who stressed the fact that the amendment was reasonable <e> <s> we certainly intended it to be reasonable as the noble lord lord rochester inferred and the word reasonable appears many times in the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is again missing the point <e> <s> the mandate as he insists upon calling it or those who operate the union i suppose he means the properly elected leaders derives from a majority ballot that expresses the will of the majority <e> <s> i am bound to point out that the principle of a majority as against the minority is accepted in this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to misstate what the noble lord said <e> <s> we shall have to see what <e>", "<cs> my lords i hope that this will help the noble baroness <e> <s> when the matter was discussed in committee we said that we thought that this was an eminently reasonable amendment and we hoped that the noble earl would be able to do something <e> <s> he said if i remember rightly that the amendment was not necessary it was unnecessary because macmillans could not recruit a nurse and then get the nurse to ask for the records of the royal college of nursing journal <e> <s> my answer to that which i think the noble baroness lady seear mentioned when this was being discussed was that even if it was unnecessary why not make it clear and reassure the royal college <e> <s> to which the noble earl lord dundee replied that this was one of those amendments he wanted to take away and look at <e> <s> by his silence we are afraid that it may be one of those which fell through the hole so we hope that he will help <e>", "<cs> my lords it is quite clear that we shall agree to the amendment moved by the noble lord lord mottistone <e> <s> indeed these benches would be equally pleased with the amendment to be moved by the noble lord lord rochester <e> <s> looking at this matter from the governments point of view the amendment of the noble lord lord mottistone appears to be more copper-bottomed and provided with the necessary clauses to prevent manipulation and so on <e> <s> i refer in particular to paragraph ii which states that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble earl sits down i should like to be clear about one matter because he may have said something which will be most helpful <e> <s> i understand him to have said that the sensible backbone of trade union officials can be in the executive without necessarily being elected <e> <s> one might say that they are the sensible backbone of bureaucracy <e> <s> is he suggesting that it will be possible for one of the members of the sensible backbone the head of bureaucracy to be the general secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords what the noble earl has to say is important so i should like to phrase the question in another way <e> <s> noble lords on this side of the house have said that it could be made clear that the head of the cabinet the chief bureaucrat would not be a member of the executive <e> <s> it could be made quite clear that he was not a member of the executive but could he be called the general secretary <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may ask the minister one question which relates to the substance of the amendment <e> <s> it is with regard to the fourth line of paragraph a which states <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has told us four things <e> <s> he says that the agreements largely reverse what was agreed at committee stage <e> <s> they do not do that they only do it after rd march <e> <s> we are saying that it would not be fair to do it in a retrospective way <e> <s> they can have their way after rd march <e> <s> we are not largely reversing what the government wish to do <e> <s> we are simply trying to introduce a modest amendment to clear away the possibility that it might be done for some private interest rather than some public interest <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he not agree that it is very unfair to say that we are holding up the bill <e> <s> we are committed <e> <s> noble lords can laugh but they should listen as well <e> <s> we are committed to finish this bill at report stage tonight <e> <s> we shall finish this bill at report stage tonight <e> <s> the noble lord may go home if he wishes but we shall finish this bill at report stage tonight <e> <s> the procedure that my noble friend lord wedderburn is suggesting does not take the time of the house <e> <s> it does not take the house to sit <e> <s> it can be done upstairs <e> <s> we have not asked that the house should be adjourned <e> <s> we have produced a procedure that does not delay the bill at all <e> <s> i think the noble lord should withdraw <e>", "<cs> my lords the trouble with the noble lord lord wyatt of weeford is that every now and again he tries to be fair <e> <s> we know who will pay for the scrutineer it will be the union <e> <s> the union will not get the money back because it gets only half the money back now <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble baroness admit that it is not a matter of people merely making remarks <e> <s> for example the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord uncovers a distinct difference in emphasis between myself and the noble lord lord wedderburn of charlton <e> <s> it seems to me that every time we turn to this part of the bill it is impossible for anyone to speak sense <e> <s> it is gibberish from start to finish <e> <s> it is gibberish and no one can make any sense of it <e> <s> our amendment is trying to make sense of it <e> <s> we say we should put something sensible in and say <e>", "<cs> my lords i understand what the noble lord says <e> <s> i believe that his criticism whether or not it is valid should be directed at my noble friend <e> <s> i am telling the house whether i accept the governments answer and whether i wish to divide the house on my amendment <e> <s> i believe that even under the modified rules i should be entitled to do that <e>", "<cs> i shall do it as quickly as i can my lords <e> <s> i wish that the issues were simple <e> <s> however the more i am interrupted the longer i shall take <e>", "<cs> my lords we are not surprised <e> <s> the noble lord says that it is consistent with normal practice <e> <s> in other words you will never know who you will get until we find one of us and then you get him <e> <s> we have never said why should we <e> <s> that we are ruling out other considerations <e> <s> of course we are not <e> <s> we are saying that one of the considerations might be experience in trade union affairs as against ignorance of trade union affairs <e> <s> the minister is suggesting that ignorance is perhaps a better way than knowledge <e> <s> he then says although we prefer ignorance to knowledge and although we cannot tell you anything about it you ought to have confidence in us <e> <s> that is not possible but i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down would he not agree that the extremely useful role of the commissioner which he has outlined so well digs away at the case for the commissioner <e> <s> the fact is that the certification officer works extremely well and he dismisses the great majority of complaints that come against him <e> <s> yet when he finds against trade unions they invariably carry out everything he suggests <e> <s> if things are so well run by the certification officer does that not indicate how little we need the commissioner <e>", "<cs> my lords we on this side of the house agree with what has been said so far <e> <s> we have all tried on several occasions to get the government to look again at the terms of clause <e> <s> as the noble lord lord rochester said the practical difficulties and obscurities of the clause have been pointed out not only in this house but in the other place <e> <s> as the noble lord lord rochester said the noble lord lord trefgarne acknowledged the complexity of the clause <e> <s> so did mr <e> <s> cope in another place reported in <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not sure that i understand the minister <e> <s> is he saying that the amendment removes the right of trade unions and members to have facilities under the act not only for workshop-based ballots but for postal-based ballots too <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not wish to keep the house any longer than is necessary <e> <s> however as the noble lord lord mottistone has introduced the <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord wyatt is too modest <e> <s> this is not a minor change to the amendment which he put down when we discussed the bill on report <e> <s> it is a direct reversal it is turning through degrees <e> <s> on report he moved that if there was national industrial action a strike ballot should by law be a postal ballot <e> <s> now he is saying that if it is not national industrial action and therefore if it is not authorised by a union if it is not an official strike but if it is a local unofficial strike there should be a legally binding postal ballot <e> <s> virtually all national strikes are official and the overwhelming majority of unofficial strikes are local including one-hour walkouts overtime bans and things of that kind instantaneous stoppages <e> <s> the noble lord is suggesting a total reversal of a position so that the law should impose a postal ballot upon small-scale fragmented unofficial strike action something which this government have never attempted to do <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down will he agree that although he is now talking about strikes which are officially endorsed below national level he has actually been writing about all strikes that are not proposed or intended by the national executive <e> <s> therefore whatever he may be talking about now the amendment covers unofficial strikes <e>", "<cs> my lords when three separate noble lords say that this amendment is unnecessary i suppose that it is better than one noble lord saying it three times <e> <s> there have been many instances of one noble lord saying it three times <e> <s> i am mildly reassured but i still do not see why this provision cannot go into the bill <e> <s> nevertheless i do not propose to press the matter to a division <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords if one sits here long enough it comes to be ones responsibility to say that something is unnecessary <e> <s> i really cannot understand why the government want this amendment at all <e> <s> as they always get suspicious when i propose amendments that they regard as unnecessary i am afraid that i must reciprocate <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down is he denying that the government could bring the bill in by royal assent on th may with a commencement order on th may for clause <e> <s> if so why do we need the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down i understood him to say that the code of practice will only cover those items referred to in amendment no <e> <s> <e>", "<cs> my lords will the code of practice cover say ballots for elections ballots for strikes and political ballots or will it be more limited than that <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps he can tell us what it is in the words of the transport and general workers union on the back of the ballot paper that he thinks is misleading <e> <s> we think it is just a statement of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords can the noble lord tell us precisely what he thinks is misleading on the hack of the transport and general workers unions ballot paper to which he referred at report stage <e> <s> we think it is simply a statement of fact <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord have time to answer the question of my noble friend lord basnett about the evidence of the alleged <e>", "<cs> i am sorry not to see the noble lord lord beloff in his place but is he not together with the noble baroness lady young asking us to forget the policy objectives of the bill <e> <s> very senior ministers indeed the prime minister herself have made it clear that one of the central thrusts of the bill is that the government wish to see as many schools as possible contract out <e> <s> that is why the secretary of state has to say that he thinks that a great number of schools will contract out and that is why the figures are so low <e> <s> this is the central thrust of the bill <e>", "<cs> i wonder whether the noble and learned lord could explain the governments policy on this matter <e> <s> quite recently on the employment bill the noble lord lord basnett put down an almost identical amendment dealing with training and the government accepted it <e>", "<cs> i would probably agree more with the noble lord lord grimond than i would with the noble lord lord quinton on the case for an academic majority <e> <s> however the question is what do the government think <e> <s> they should tell us what they have in mind because if one looks at the bill it appears that the government do not seem to know what they think <e> <s> they say that there should be academics should be between six and nine and non-academics between nine and six <e> <s> therefore there might be an academic majority or there might not be <e> <s> what do the government want <e>", "<cs> perhaps the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor will permit me to intervene <e> <s> would he consider it conceivable that it might include a trade unionist <e>", "<cs> would the noble and learned lord the lord chancellor say that the position which he is now adopting squares with the argument which he put forward on second reading <e> <s> on that occasion he drew a very clear distinction in his own mind between that which was fair and just and that which represented academic freedom when he said <e>", "<cs> it may be argued that what the noble and learned lord said about the amendment which the government intend to move amendment no <e> <s> zab covers the point in relation to amendment no <e> <s> b <e> <s> that is to say so far as concerns the selection for redundancy the amendment which the government intend to move is in its own way supposed to cover that point <e> <s> however paragraph d of amendment no <e> <s> b proposes that there should be a proper selection procedure <e> <s> i do not think that what the noble and learned lord said covers that point <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord accept that in that case it would be very likely tenure <e> <s> it would not actually be tenure because you could not guarantee that subsequently you would not have to take it away <e>", "<cs> is the noble and learned lord suggesting that into academic life would be introduced the general policy in relation to pay that one should have merit rates special payments for extremely distinguished people over and above the scale and improvements in pay rather than improvements in job security <e> <s> is that the alternative accolade <e>", "<cs> as i understand the noble and learned lord he said that when universities had fixed-term contracts that were funded the possibility of redundancy did not create a problem <e> <s> i do not think that is quite right because contracts now are often subject to review <e> <s> they may be subject to review at two years or three years with the normal expectation of those contracts continuing for five years <e> <s> however if the university wishes to attract some senior person to head a research unit in order to run that contract it is normal to give that person an expectation of tenure <e> <s> indeed if one could not give someone of professorial status an expectation of tenure to take up the leadership of a funded unit for say a period of five years one probably could not get anybody of a sufficient calibre to take up that post <e> <s> therefore the ability to offer at least heads of research units the possibility of tenure is extemely important <e> <s> i should have thought that for that reason the government should accept this amendment <e>", "<cs> i should like to take the noble and learned lord back to the previous amendment namely amendment no <e> <s> aa <e> <s> many questions arise in this connection <e> <s> i should like to know whether the vice-chancellors have seen the amendment because as i understand it they are saying that they see no reason for an amendment of this nature they never asked for it and they do not know where it came from <e> <s> that would make sense because it is an odd type of provision to find in clause <e> <s> i remind the committee that clause has a procedure for specifying what must go in the statute so that you can be dismissed by reason of redundancy so that you can be dismissed for good cause <e> <s> it includes a system of appeals <e> <s> the system of appeals is one which the individual academic who thinks that he has not been fairly and justly dismissed can use to obtain justice or fairness <e>", "<cs> that is probably my fault <e> <s> i understood that these two amendments had been grouped together and that as a result of that one was expected to speak to both of them <e> <s> i am in fact dealing with my own amendment but i am very happy with the amendment standing in the name of the noble earl <e> <s> in some ways his amendment is stronger than mine <e> <s> but i shall speak to both if the noble earl does not mind <e>", "<cs> the noble and learned lord has converted me to the reason why we put down amendments <e> <s> we learn things <e> <s> we learn important things <e> <s> the noble lord lord wedderburn asked him a complicated question <e> <s> perhaps i may ask him a simple question <e> <s> what is the remedy if despite the fact that the university has no power to dismiss the individual academic is dismissed anyway <e> <s> what does he do <e>", "<cs> we must thank the noble and learned lord for giving us a most interesting lifting of the carpet <e> <s> a great deal may follow <e> <s> we must reserve our position if we wish to come back on report <e> <s> at the moment we are pleased to beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> i understand that we are dealing with amendment no <e> <s> cb <e> <s> as i understand it the amendment of the noble earl lord halsbury would take out one category which the government say they want to include in the coverage of the bill <e> <s> the government say that anyone who was appointed to tenure before the publication of the bill will be excluded but that anybody who is promoted although he was appointed before the date of the publication of the bill will be affected by this provision <e> <s> the effect of the noble earls amendment is to say that even if he is promoted he is still excluded from this provision <e>", "<cs> may i draw the noble and learned lords attention to my problem <e> <s> it is quite clear <e> <s> mr jackson in another place said that he wished under the existing provisions of the bill that is before this amendment to describe <e>", "<cs> i shall give a simple example because i am worried about much simpler things <e> <s> let us take figures out of the air <e> <s> there is a lecturers scale with a maximum of a readers scale with a maximum of and a professors scale with a maximum of <e> <s> they are all existing scales <e> <s> they all receive a per cent <e> <s> increase <e> <s> they are all new scales and tenure is lost <e>", "<cs> i hope that the noble lord will not take it wrongly if i say that we have heard him in a familiar strain this evening <e> <s> it is a familiar strain which has not been so familiar this evening <e> <s> it is a strain which says that that which is irrestible on logical grounds can always be opposed on the grounds that it is unnecessary <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to take advantage of academic freedom which is what most of todays debate has been about <e> <s> as a fellow of an oxford college i disagree with almost everything that i have heard so far <e> <s> i must accept what the noble lord lord beloff says <e> <s> i am not sure that there is any sense in which the university of buckingham receives public funds <e> <s> probably it does not <e> <s> but it is the purest fallacy to suggest that the colleges of oxford university for example do not receive public funds <e> <s> the whole cuf lectureship scheme is a way in which the government assist colleges <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to begin by thanking the noble baroness lady turner of camden for initiating the debate <e> <s> it has been very interesting if rather unbalanced <e> <s> as several noble lords have said all the contributions have come from this side of the house <e> <s> we have sympathised with the loneliness of the minister not only in terms of speeches but in regard to the benches behind him <e> <s> on the other hand we know that he is used to being the boy on the burning bridge <e> <s> we know that he has a good heart <e> <s> we hope that he has a good brief <e> <s> if he has a good brief perhaps i may observe that he has no need to be brief <e> <s> he must feel free to say as much as he wishes and to talk as long as he desires to try to answer some of the very reasonable points made in the debate <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with an article in the authoritative current edition of the bank of england bulletin on the causes of productivity <e> <s> that article suggests that the main reason for the rise in productivity in the s compared with the s is that in the s employers were reluctant to dismiss people whereas they are not reluctant to do so now <e> <s> if that is so the high productivity is the consequence of high unemployment <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case will the noble lord tell me the point of saying that the code will be taken into account by the courts <e> <s> if it cannot give rise to liability why take it into account <e>", "<cs> my lords as has been said by previous speakers we are all in the debt of the noble lord lord rochester for beginning and launching us on this debate on the training aspects of the white paper <e> <s> so far it has been a very good debate <e> <s> i have agreed with almost everything that has been said <e> <s> nobody can disagree i should have thought with much of what the noble lord lord rochester said about the role of the government in training and some of the criticisms he made which i want to <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble earl has been kind enough to refer to several of my questions but has not answered any of them <e> <s> i want him to answer one question on itbs <e> <s> what is the evidence that things have got better in those areas where the government have abolished itbs <e> <s> in the government put forward plans to abolish a large number of itbs <e> <s> what evidence is there that training has become better in the areas where the itbs were abolished as against the areas where they remain <e>", "<cs> my lords we shall not be surprised when we listen to the cheers and happy comments on the other side of the house <e> <s> we shall not be surprised when we hear about the champagne suppers that the port employers will be having in every port in this country tonight <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> will he tell us whether the article in the <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that his scientific survey is completely contradicted by three much more scientific surveys based on replies which completely disprove everything in his report <e>", "<cs> my lords can we take it from the answers so far given by the minister that the government have no criticism of the academic performance of newbattle abbey <e> <s> if that is the case can we take it that the government have no desire <e>", "<cs> my lords there was no consultation and no discussion <e> <s> the government will push the bill through in that way <e> <s> there has never been a precedent for such action certainly not in the field of industrial relations

been such a precedent in the field of industrial relations nor has there been a precedent outside <e>", "<cs> my lords it would be fair to say that the government have found a gp in hove who says that there is much to be said on both sides of the case <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that we should all want to thank the noble baroness for initiating this important debate asking why there is not a law to stop age discrimination <e> <s> so far as i can see from the bill which she has put before us she is concerned centrally with direct discrimination and not with indirect discriminationthat contrasts with sex discrimination legislation for example <e> <s> nevertheless i think that it is very important that we should debate the matter <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister agree that he cannot get away with it by saying that it is a matter for acas that under the terms of the conciliation act the secretary of state has the <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord return to the question asked by my noble friend lord molloy <e> <s> is not the difference that in the past when the authorities sold off land they kept a large part of the proceeds at local authority level <e> <s>

practice of blinding us with history <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister has referred to the fact that i sought to debate this subject with him before <e> <s> that is true <e> <s> on that occasion he is quoted in <e>", "<cs> my lords if i may <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord asked why the transport and general workers union wants industry-wide regulation <e> <s> the answer is that the tg knows that the only way it can negotiate with employers for minimum standards minimum standards which will prevent casualisation minimum standards on piece work hours and wages is by negotiating with all the employers through the national joint industrial council <e> <s> that council has been in existence for years and long before the tg <e>", "<cs> my lords i must <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord

proposals of the national employers association and per cent <e> <s> of the voters said no <e> <s> so it is not the tg which has decided it is the tgs members <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may point out to him that the transport and general workers union is not asking for the reproduction of the dock labour scheme by negotiation <e> <s> all that is required is a framework agreement that sets certain minima <e> <s> there are ports which vary from london with workers to falmouth with workers <e> <s> surely some kind of framework agreement is required <e> <s> it is the refusal of the employers to consider such a framework agreement that may produce a national dock strike <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord give way <e> <s> does he not agree that the labour government at that time said rightly or wrongly that there was a major economic crisis which required that bill as a central instrument of their policy <e> <s> is that what this government are

disappeared over the sky line in that speech <e> <s> he has even taken away the very vague statement made by the minister in another place which suggested that at least the transitional period might last a year <e> <s> now the noble lord tells us that he cannot give us a time-scale <e> <s> i think he is really saying that he cannot tell us what it is for <e>", "<cs> i readily agree and of course appreciate that the bill ensures that he cannot pick and choose <e> <s> i do not know why i said that <e> <s> probably it was because i became mixed up by the fact that we do not intend to move the next amendment which would have given him such power <e> <s> however i quite agree <e> <s> the bill makes it absolutely clear that he sacks them all together and appoints someone to replace them <e> <s> that is absolutely right <e>", "<cs> perhaps because it is getting near the dinner hour the arguments from the other side are becoming thinner <e> <s> the minister has the cheek to tell me that the parties involved might frustrate the choice of one of us <e> <s> how could they possibly frustrate that <e> <s> persons are only being consulted <e> <s> it is not joint determination <e> <s> the government are not serious <e> <s> they can do better than that <e> <s> i know that it is late at night <e>", "<cs> it seems to me that the only thing to do is to table much simpler amendments <e> <s> i do not say that we shall get any further but at least we may receive better answers <e> <s> i thought that i had made it clear that there is no scheme for voluntary severance <e> <s> i asked the minister how can the present scheme be better than the scheme already in existence if there is no payment for voluntary severance <e> <s> at the moment can be paid and it hardly ever is for voluntary severance <e> <s> now you receive nothing unless you are sacked <e> <s> how can you compare what you receive when you are forcibly dismissed with what you receive when you choose to leave voluntarily <e>", "<cs> my lords this is the fourth time that the government have taken this attitude with the nurses <e> <s> the government took them off the regional executives they took them from the supervisory boards they have taken away their budgets and this is the fourth time they have tried to take away the managerial functions of the nurses <e> <s> why do the government do this <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that uninformative answer <e> <s> does he deny that the secretary of state said publicly that he was considering proceeding against unofficial strikers <e> <s> is it not true that if he does so he must proceed by the criminal law locking them up or he must proceed against their union <e> <s> that will mean that the government are saying you must discipline your members if they strike but you must not discipline members if they do not <e> <s> is that feasible <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord not agree that we have not started this hare <e> <s> it has been started by the secretary of state who has gone around the country making vague statements about how sometime in the future he wants to proceed on the issue of unofficial strikes <e> <s> we are asking what he is going to do and why he is going to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise if i misunderstood the noble lord <e> <s> did he mention an increase of per cent <e> <s> over a -year period <e> <s> that would be an annual increase of per cent <e> <s> can that be right <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not entirely displeased with what the minister has said not entirely pleased but not entirely displeased <e> <s> let me turn first to what the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said <e> <s> i thought i might have got some support from him because on th june at col he asked the minister in response to a debate that we initiated on a similar amendment for some indication of the governments thinking <e> <s> we did not get any indication of the governments thinking on that occasion but we had a tiny bit of indication this afternoon that i hope i have got right <e> <s> i shall come to it in a moment <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has said that over and over again and over and over again we have asked him to come to the dispatch box and give us some figures for labour costs comparing scheme and non-scheme ports <e> <s> he points me to books which do not contain those facts and never gives me any figures <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not give me any encouragement this time <e> <s> however perhaps i may turn first to the remarks made by the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter <e> <s> he at least has found another reason for rejecting our amendments <e> <s> he had three reasons in the past they were vicious they were unnecessary and they were on the face of the bill <e> <s> now however he says that they are illiterate <e> <s> as the noble lord lord mellish said he can always rewrite them for us <e> <s> indeed we would be most happy to accept his drafting of our amendments if only he would agree with them <e> <s> but of course he does not agree with them because he thinks that they are vicious unnecessary and on the face of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am grateful to the minister for giving me some figures <e> <s> he asked me to look at table on page <e> <s> i shall do that and come back to him at third reading although it did not seem to me that he said much about labour costs <e>", "<cs> my lords i am sure that the noble lord understood everything that he said <e> <s> i do not think that i did <e> <s> i am sure that he will allow me to read what he said <e> <s> if we do not like it we reserve our position at third reading <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords we have had a very wide debate on third reading <e> <s> i hope it will serve as a precedent of what we can do on third reading <e> <s> i shall deal first with what the noble lord lord rochester said <e> <s> i am not saying and i would not wish to say that in this amendment we are providing by a back door a right to suspension in the case of industrial action <e> <s> there is a very clear difference here <e> <s> the employer concerned has to re-engage <e> <s> we are not protecting a man who is dismissed in a strike <e> <s> as regards his contract that is the end of it <e> <s> the employer concerned has to re-engage <e> <s> but what we are asking is when an employer voluntarily re-engages a man does his service stand to the benefit of that worker <e> <s> the minister says that service does stand to the benefit of the worker concerned in the case of the redundancy payments legislation <e> <s> as regards that legislation it is the case that service does not have to be continuous <e> <s> if it is considered as uninterrupted as regards the redundancy payments legislation why cannot the same apply in this case <e> <s> that is my answer to the point made by the noble lord lord rochester <e>", "<cs> my lords if non-scheme ports are so excellent in every way can the noble lord tell me what the minister never tells me why is their productivity per cent <e> <s> below that of the scheme ports <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord mellish is quite right <e> <s> one should begin by saying what one can say for the government <e> <s> one can say and one is pleased to say that the noble lord lord brabazon has conducted the case in a smooth gracious and efficient way <e> <s> but that is all one can say for the government <e> <s> those of us on this side of the house are bound at this stage of the bill to wonder what we have gained by our opposition to the bill <e> <s> i am afraid that we have not gained an inch of ground <e> <s> perhaps two clarifications fell from the lips of the noble lord <e> <s> at one stage i think it was on report he told us that he would not insist on an arbitrary end to the transition period and subsequently he said that the way he reads the bill covers voluntary severance as well as compulsory redundancy <e> <s> those are small matters and i do not believe that they amount to an inch of ground but in every other way as previous speakers have said he has rejected all our attempts even i do not agree with his description our last final attempt to change the drafting of the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the minister for that answer <e> <s> however is he aware or will he deny that the provisional record of the th session of the ilo shows that the committee on the application of standards has in fact criticised the government on eight counts for being in breach of ilo conventions <e> <s> if the government do not accept that then the only thing the committee can do is to go to the international court of justice <e> <s> therefore what are the government going to do <e>", "<cs> my lords surely the noble lord would not deny that the governments own spokesmen according to the report of the provisional committee praised the work of the committee of experts <e> <s> indeed there are three successive committees who have indicted the government on four occasions <e> <s> the government must say if this continues to happen whether they will conform to those conventions or decide that they will go outside of them and line up with such countries as burma panama and nicaragua <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister is a reasonable man <e> <s> he says that the statutory system has not worked <e> <s> will he take the point that we are saying that the non-statutory system has not worked either did not work before and that is why a statutory system was brought in <e> <s> what does he intend to do if it turns out that this non-statutory system does not work <e> <s> will he come forward with any further plans to increase training in this country which he knows is much too low <e>", "<cs> my lords those of us with a sense of history if not of irony cannot help feeling that there is piquancy in the fact that in this noble house we are considering on the th anniversary of bastille day yet another bill to abolish workers rights <e> <s> that has not been mentioned by the government <e> <s> we know that the french revolution is an event which the prime minister told french viewers the other day she does not wish to remember and would not care to see repeated <e> <s> we know that she believes that our own revolution as she calls it we would say counter-revolution is much more important much better managed and as she said quieter <e> <s> what we say today is that it is becoming noisier and more divisive every minute <e> <s> what we are saying today is that this irrelevant and small-minded bill is unlikely to calm things down <e>", "<cs> my lords as the noble lord is quoting me i am allowed to correct him <e> <s> i said the governments policy was to say that they could do away with anything that everybody did not have <e> <s> that is not fair <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is now changing the subject <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down with regard to equal treatment is he saying that he cannot explain the inconsistency between the interventionist policy in northern ireland and the abstentionist policy elsewhere or that he does not care to explain the inconsistency or that he will write and explain it <e>", "<cs> my lords can the minister throw light on the today statement by his right honourable friend in another place that <e>", "<cs> my lords we are talking about the amendments tabled by the government in respect of the training commission <e> <s> as the matter will not be dealt with until tomorrow it may not be unfair to ask the government to provide an explanatory memorandum before tomorrows debate <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down will he think again on this matter <e> <s> surely it is good supply-side economics which he is supposed to believe in <e> <s> if we need more women we must encourage more women into the labour force <e> <s> if we <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may ask the noble lord a question on that point <e> <s> has he any evidence that industral tribunals have decided as they might possibly be free to decide that dismissal on grounds of contracting aids is unfair on i suppose the grounds of some other substantial reason <e> <s> have industrial tribunals taken that view or have they taken a different view <e>", "<cs> we are very pleased to welcome the amendment and to see that we are passing through a part of the bill where we have no reason to move any amendments at all <e> <s> we have passed many clauses and a schedule and we now come to this amendment <e>", "<cs> will the minister give way <e>", "<cs> the minister said that there are more jobs and more people entering those trades <e> <s> that does not prove that they are not being exploited or that they do not need protection <e> <s> it merely proves that there are more jobs <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell us about the worst chef the worst waiter and those who are continually sacked <e>", "<cs> i hope that we shall receive a straight reply <e> <s> the minister is a most attractive replier on behalf of the government because first he leaves his brief a most remarkable thing to do and secondly he appears to believe what he has been sent to do <e> <s> that puts him in a weak position <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has left us without any confusion <e> <s> the question is quite simple <e> <s> we have asked it and he has answered it <e> <s> can this hypothetical woman obtain her unemployment benefit and income support if all she is is horrified and terrified about this but the social security gentleman says that she is qualified <e> <s> the answer was no she cannot obtain it and therefore we shall divide the committee <e>", "<cs> the noble lord will not be surprised that he does not convince us <e> <s> he said he was not sure which act we were referring to and then he told us the act we were referring to <e> <s> he is quite correct that is the act we were referring to <e> <s> the minister believes that an amendment should apply to dangerous machinery and that as drafted our amendment may apply to any machinery <e> <s> if the noble lord is prepared to tell me that he will accept the amendment if we reword it to make it clear that we are only talking about dangerous machinery we shall bring the amendment back on report as half a loaf is better than no bread <e> <s> however i suspect that is not the case <e> <s> i suspect that the ministers answer will be the stock answer that has been given in another place which is that everything is all right because we shall still have parts of the act in operation and we shall still have the act <e>", "<cs> i am prepared to accept the fact that many of the points made against the two amendments strike home <e> <s> however that does not put me off the basic objective <e> <s> as the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter said the effect of the amendment would be to delay the operation of clause in order to ensure that it is safe <e> <s> we do not believe that it is safe <e> <s> we do not believe that the evidence suggests that it is necessarily safe and therefore we wish to have an investigation <e> <s> that would result in delay that is perfectly fair <e>", "<cs> the noble lords lord boyd-carpenter and lord renton as i understood them raised constitutional objections to what we propose particularly in respect of the role which we appear to be giving to the health and safety commission and the equal opportunities commission <e> <s> what they do not appear to advance are arguments on the merits <e> <s> once again i say that we are not committed to the words of these amendments <e> <s> we are seeking to flush out the government to find whether they have a case <e> <s> however the noble lords did not give me the governments case only the mistakes and the weaknesses they see in the drafting of the amendments <e>", "<cs> that is right <e> <s> they say we are the bosses we are parliament and can do what we like <e> <s> however the government say that they consulted <e> <s> when somebody says to me at this stage of the bill trust us it is only consequential and anyway we will consult the health and safety <e>", "<cs> i believe i heard the noble lord say that the legislation in this area is about to be repealed <e> <s> is that correct <e>", "<cs> never mind <e> <s> i gave the noble lord an example of where it was necessary to have a ballot <e> <s> i may have misunderstood and the matter is not central so we can get on <e> <s> i understood the noble lord to say that section of the factories act is about to be repealed <e>", "<cs> the noble lord should not make remarks like that at oclock at night <e> <s> in my experience we have been debating these issues at least since <e> <s> he has been here all that time he knows that we have fought to the best of our ability the greater part of that legislation <e> <s> he knows what we have said and what we think <e> <s> it is a bit thick to come along at this time and to ask us to agree with him that the government are not hard hearted <e>", "<cs> i and those on this side of the committee who have participated in this debate fully appreciate the complexity the difficulties and the problems involved in the government acting in the way they have done <e> <s> nobody suggests that their decision has been an easy one <e> <s> i do not want to suggest and i do not think anyone on this side of the committee suggests that in making their decision they have acted in any other way or with any other motive than to wish to respond to a genuine and deep-felt demand <e>", "<cs> we are pleased to support the amendment <e> <s> we supported the bill proposed by my noble friend lady phillips on second reading and we shall support it on third reading <e> <s> my reasons complement those already advanced by the noble baroness lady seear <e> <s> i believe that it is a matter of equity and fairness <e> <s> discrimination on grounds of age is as unjustified in principle as discrimination on grounds of sex race religion or political conviction <e> <s> it is just as bad and just as unjustified <e> <s> in any legislation there is just as much a case for including age <e>", "<cs> the point is that we cannot help any of those things <e> <s> we cannot help our sex our race or old age <e> <s> therefore we all need the legislation <e> <s> it is exactly square <e>", "<cs> so far as i understand what the noble lord is saying even if the clause is passed the small employer still has to give the man a note but it does not have to contain the procedure <e> <s> i do not understand the benefit of that how it will induce people to be employed and how by itself it will reduce unemployment <e> <s> it is an enormous burden on business whether or not the procedure is in the note there must be a note <e>", "<cs> i wish to draw the attention of the noble lord to section of the act which provides a duty on an employer to permit an employee who is an official of an independent union recognised by the employer <e> <s> if there is no recognition in the first place then no rights adduce at all <e> <s> we are talking about what happens when there is some recognition <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter seemed to be saying that our amendment was trying to give rights to the trade union official without recognition <e> <s> we are not trying to do that <e> <s> we are not trying to give any rights where recognition does not exist <e> <s> we are going along with the present section of the act whereby the rights arise for an official of an independent trade union which is recognised <e> <s> that is the answer to the noble lords point <e>", "<cs> i do not recognise that and i do not believe that the history of tribunals bears that out <e> <s> it would be putting the tribunal in an impossible position if one expected it to say whether it was reasonable to recognise the union for this or that purpose <e> <s> in the tribunal context the tribunal is bound to take what the employer says are the boundaries of recognition <e> <s> without an investigation into what happens day by day in the plant no tribunal could say whether <e>", "<cs> i am pleased that the noble lord asks me that question although i do not understand why he has not got the point <e> <s> section a of the act states that there shall be a duty on the employer to permit an employee who is an official of an independent trade union recognised by the employer to take time off <e> <s> if the employer recognises trade union b but does not recognise trade union a he has no need whatever to give any rights to the unrecognised union <e>", "<cs> the object of the amendment is to give the tribunals and shop stewards something less subjectively determined by the employer than the single word recognition <e> <s> that is the object of the amendment <e>", "<cs> the committee will not be surprised that we cannot leave the position as it stands <e> <s> we have to oppose the motion that the clause shall stand part of the bill <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down in the light of what he has just said will he answer this question <e> <s> if the government were finally to be condemned by the last committee in the ilo which <e>", "<cs> it is with considerable pleasure that i support the noble lord who has just sat down <e> <s> i am very pleased that the party that he represents has thought fit to put down the motion <e> <s> if they had not done so because we might have thought that the topic had been debated again and again both in this chamber and in another place we might not have had an opportunity to ask the government why they propose this measure at this particular time <e> <s> when one looks through the various statements which have been made it is remarkable how rarely the government have been forced to give any explanation for what they now propose to do <e>", "<cs> will the minister tell us what he means by methods of appeal <e> <s> how do appellants appeal <e> <s> do they go to the tribunal <e> <s> do they go to the eat what do they do <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord give us a single piece of evidence for the astonishing things that he said <e> <s> he said we had one of the worst most dangerous trade union movements in the world <e> <s> what scrap of evidence will he adduce for this at five past nine <e> <s> i know nothing <e>", "<cs> we now turn from the unsubstantiated and offensive allegations of the minister about the british trade union movement to the actual small-mindedness of the government <e> <s> we turn to clause which is all about the storage of nitrate film <e>", "<cs> i am glad that the noble lord has explained to the committee why the government have not given any explanation <e> <s> it is because there is not one <e> <s> he says that this measure is outdated <e> <s> he does not know whether it is outdated <e> <s> he means that there has not been a fire lately <e> <s> he does not know whether there has not been a fire lately because of the regulations <e> <s> he has absolutely no idea <e> <s> he does not care anyway <e> <s> he is going round the treadmill <e> <s> he is on automatic pilot again <e> <s> there are regulations to be abolished before lunch time <e> <s> that is what this is all about <e>", "<cs> it is not whether the noble lord agrees with the health and safety commission it is when it agrees with him <e> <s> i see the position <e>", "<cs> we may be talking only about the transfer of land in respect of these amendments <e> <s> however the minister has tabled a vast number of further amendments which are even more complicated <e> <s> there are amendments nos <e> <s> and they go on for pages <e> <s> in relation to those is the minister talking only about land <e> <s> will he tell us what he is talking about when he reaches the point or will he rise and say that he has already done so <e> <s> are we to have an explanation of the rest of the amendments and will it be about land <e>", "<cs> i did not say that <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has had a long and exhausting time at the dispatch box <e> <s> he has taken on the committee stage of the bill single-handedly and quite understandably he is tiring <e> <s> even his advisers are tiring <e> <s> at this time of night to come up with such a reply is not very good <e> <s> the minister referred to three levels <e> <s> the tuc will not like them but leave me with the tuc <e> <s> the staff on the walworth road site will not like them but leave me with them <e> <s> the tuc and the staff on the walworth road site are extremely flexible these days and they will adopt something quite similar <e> <s> in any case it is not much of an argument to come from this government <e> <s> the tuc will not like it the walworth road staff will not like it and god almighty it is minutes past ten oclock <e> <s> the government can do better than that but they do not do so <e> <s> when they have exhausted that new line they go back to the old one <e> <s> the government say that the matter should be left to employers <e> <s> it is not a matter of asking the leopard to change its spots but rather a matter of asking it to change its skin <e>", "<cs> my lords the house will not be surprised to know that we are not satisfied with the ministers reply <e> <s> for a large part of what he was saying i thought that he had the wrong notes <e> <s> he seemed to be talking entirely about the position of women as though the clause and the amendment had nothing to do with young persons <e> <s> they do <e> <s> the issue does not concern women alone <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter does not like the word conscience <e> <s> i can remember when in this house in we were trying to get the government to say what was the difference between conscience and a deeply held personal conviction <e> <s> finally we persuaded the minister to say that there was no difference <e> <s> a conscience meant a deeply held personal conviction and <e>", "<cs> my lords i am coming to that <e> <s> it is because i am seeking to convince the government <e> <s> the last time i asked the government to take out conscience because deeply held personal conviction would do they would not do so even though the government finally admitted that they could not see the difference <e>", "<cs> my lords i know the minister said that and i shall come to that point in moment <e> <s> whatever the officer is called he is interpreting a subjective definition <e> <s> that is the point we are making <e> <s> furthermore the minister said that religious and conscientious objection can be taken into account <e> <s> it is taken into account but is is not necessarily a ground for saying that the person does not have to work down a mine <e> <s> that objection is taken into account <e> <s> mental stress and severe dread are also taken into account <e> <s> the trouble with these arguments is that the more persuasive they are and the more the minister seeks to convince us and we take them on board the more we cannot understand why the minister rejects the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords it may do so but i have already argued that there is already much discrimination in the bill for all kinds of legitimate and positive reasons <e> <s> i go back to the fact that the more the government seek to persuade us that they are doing <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord harmar-nicholls speaks of the nanny state <e> <s> so far as i understood him he said that all machinery is unsafe although he subsequently said that the cleaning of all machinery is unsafe <e> <s> of course the regulations as they are now do not apply to all machinery they apply only to moving machinery which is dangerous <e> <s> if we took the view taken by the noble lord that the moving of all machinery is unsafe <e>", "<cs> my lords very well all machinery is potentially unsafe <e>", "<cs> my lords very well if it is dangerous then it is unsafe <e> <s> therefore the noble lord is saying that we cannot have any regulations in the matter and that if we try to do so we shall have a nanny state <e> <s> if the noble lord really takes that view he is perhaps in advance of his party <e> <s> he should not be in support for handing the matter over to the health and safety commission or the health and safety executive he should be in support of the abolition of the health and safety executive <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord saying that there has been a change in government policy towards increasing the number of inspectors <e> <s> this is a remarkable time to tell us that <e>", "<cs> my lords i think it is time that the noble baroness set her speech on training to music <e> <s> it is getting very much like blank verse <e> <s> even if it does not rhyme it is extremely persuasive although of course the government say nothing <e> <s> i wish to vamp a little in the background <e> <s> i agree with everything the noble baroness says <e> <s> this is a training bill and that is set out in the long title <e> <s> the training <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that the exemption must be in place before the regulations come before the house <e> <s> if i have misunderstood i hope that he will tell me but if i have understood the position correctly when the regulations come before the house they will contain an exemption or the provision for an exemption order <e> <s> why cannot the government build on that <e> <s> if they want something more than that why cannot they put that in the regulations <e> <s> why do we have to have this measure now <e>", "<cs> my lords <e>", "<cs> my lords i apologise for interrupting again but the noble lord was kind enough to write to my noble friend lady turner on th october <e> <s> i have not read this letter out but i must do so now <e> <s> it concerns what the minister has just said <e> <s> as i understood it he has just said that there is no evidence to suggest there are likely to be any more accidents or damages as a result of the exemption <e> <s> in his letter to my noble friend the minister stated <e>", "<cs> my lords i recognise that it would be extremely difficult for the minister to withdraw the clause today <e> <s> therefore in a sense i am talking not to him but to those who are ultimately responsible for the bill <e> <s> i ask them seriously to reconsider their position <e> <s> at this time of night i do not want to go through the contributions made by other speakers other than the minister <e> <s> i would argue that in general terms they all supported our position except in the case of the noble lord lord glenarthur who was worried about certain aspects but generally came down in favour of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i have two answers to that <e> <s> the first point is that the cat is out of the bag the government have accepted that it is unsafe all right less safe and would not be covered by an exemption order which would be safe <e>", "<cs> my lords i am very pleased to allow the minister leave of the house in order to answer the questions <e> <s> as i said at the beginning we are asking him only to explain the reasons for the clause and the governments thinking on it <e> <s> i want to know why it was put down and what the clause effects and changes <e> <s> as i listened to him i did not agree when he said that it is only there to clarify and to make evident what might not otherwise be evident <e> <s> it seems to me that it is there to extend certain categories of protection which might not otherwise be there <e> <s> that is why it says protection of sikhs from racial discrimination in connection with wearing of safety helmets <e> <s> it cannot be simply clarification of race relations law because it would not be required <e> <s> anyone who went to law would find <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has misrepresented me <e> <s> but let us give him his case <e> <s> let us suppose that there is no increase in the accident rate but that the insurance company takes a very cautious view and thinks that there might be such an increase <e> <s> they might or might not be right <e> <s> they may be absolutely wrong <e> <s> insurance companies are not always entirely rational but they are cautious and careful people <e> <s> let us suppose therefore that it raises the premiums <e> <s> i am asking a question of law <e> <s> is that lawful or not <e> <s> i am not asking whether it is justified or right <e> <s> i am asking whether they are entitled to do it <e>", "<cs> my lords i am afraid that we do not accept that reply <e> <s> the noble lord says that his noble friend lord campbell has explained the situation <e> <s> he has not <e> <s> he has stated his opinion <e> <s> with great respect that is his opinion <e> <s> i could take a contrary one <e> <s> that is not the issue between us <e> <s> it is this what do the government say <e> <s> that is the issue <e> <s> i may think it is lawful and the noble lord lord campbell may think it is lawful but what do the government say <e> <s> i do not believe the minister has answered some of my other questions <e> <s> i shall not press this amendment to a division <e> <s> however <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lords dogma is unassailable but his logic is not <e>", "<cs> my lords this must be the most modest amendment that has ever been moved even in this series of extraordinarily modest amendments to this most extreme bill <e> <s> it is the last amendment that we move as regards this clause <e> <s> we tried two amendments in committee and we tried another on <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not know how the noble lord can say that <e> <s> whether the case was vexatious or whether it was said to be vexatious or frivolous the fact is that it took three years to obtain the money <e> <s> in other words the money was received three years after the tribunal decided the case in favour of the complainant <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not like it when we say that these are modest amendments <e> <s> we had better say that they are minimal amendments <e> <s> this is a very minimal amendment <e> <s> as the noble lord lord rochester said it deals with industrial training boards <e> <s> it is not asked that the government should put on anybody who is experienced in training for employment but that before making any appointments the minister should consult with organisations which appear to him to be experienced in training for employment <e> <s> so he could implement the amendment and there would still not be anybody who in fact was experienced in training for employment <e>", "<cs> my lords if the noble lord had any facts he might convince us <e> <s> he said that this amendment would frustrate the objectives of the new training boards <e> <s> is he saying that the objectives of the new training boards will be frustrated if they become representative <e> <s> he said that an amendment which says that they ought adequately to represent both sides of industry would frustrate their objectives <e> <s> do their objectives depend on their being unrepresentative <e> <s> they are by their essential nature and must remain unrepresentative institutions and presumably the more unrepresentative they are the better <e> <s> that is what the government say <e> <s> the noble lord says that the eitb he is nothing if not contradictory is representative <e> <s> the only trouble with the eitb is that although it is representative if it had to be representative statutorily it would fall apart through endless division <e> <s> that is what he asks us to believe <e> <s> it is absolute nonsense <e> <s> however he will not listen to us so we shall withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i must apologise for the fact that i am unable to stay until the end of the debate <e> <s> i have told the noble lord lord campbell of that and he has graciously excused me <e> <s> i wish to begin by thanking him for a short and well-directed bill to remedy what he rightly calls an unforeseen and unintended injustice <e> <s> that is precisely what it is <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that reply <e> <s> is it likely that the article will explain how it comes about that this tiny survey which asked only people who were in pre-entry closed shops now tells us that there are million in pre-entry closed shops <e> <s> where does that figure come from <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord aware that according to the press statement that the government have already issued of the people in pre-entry closed shops must be provincial actors since that is the only form of closed shop which operates in that way <e> <s> where are the actors who are in closed shops if they are not in equity <e>", "<cs> my lords is the noble lord correct <e> <s> as i understand it clause b only applies where the employer has reasonable grounds for believing that the individual worker that is the sikh would not object to wearing a helmet <e> <s> therefore the amendment says that if he takes that view he may be justified but he may not <e> <s> whether or not he is justified will turn partly as we have said on health and safety but it will also turn on whether or not the individual worker would have worn a helmet <e> <s> that will come into it <e> <s> this can only apply if there is the compliance of the worker himself <e> <s> therefore we must have a situation where the worker agrees to wear a helmet and where there is a question of health and safety involved <e> <s> what is wrong with that <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for many of the things that he has said about us and for saying that we provided him with a formidable analysis <e> <s> he acknowledged the weight and substance of our arguments <e> <s> he said that he did not take what we said lightly <e> <s> unfortunately he did not take it seriously or heavily enough to agree with us on a single amendment that we put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend is quite right <e> <s> the noble lord could not remember what they had said <e>", "<cs> my lords in this debate we have rightly thanked the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for his expedition in reintroducing this bill <e> <s> i particularly want to thank him because the last time we debated this issue i unfortunately had to leave before hearing the reply of the minister and therefore i have the opportunity as the noble lord lord campbell has this evening of trying to answer the point that was made <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord says that he would <e>", "<cs> my lords if i understood the noble lord he said that that would be the case if the whole period did not exceed days <e> <s> nevertheless for the whole of the period during which the injunction applied the union would not have been able to proceed with the organisation of a strike <e> <s> therefore although it would not have had to conduct another ballot it would not have had days in which to organise a strike <e> <s> it would have had significantly fewer <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble lord not agree that all that has to be shown is a serious case to answer <e> <s> it is not the same as having to prove it <e> <s> it is not a trial merely a serious case to answer <e> <s> many instances could occur and have occurred where if it goes forward to a trial it is a perfectly lawful act <e> <s> that is the point i am making <e>", "<cs> i do not disagree with the minister but i do not see why i am not making a valid point <e> <s> when the minister was last on his feet he said that we did not need the bill and therefore presumably the amendment because there was an alternative open to the union <e> <s> i ask the minister to have the courtesy to say this evening that on reflection he now accepts that that is no kind of argument at all and therefore that there is no argument against the bill or the amendment <e>", "<cs> i fully accept the arguments made <e> <s> it was my intention that it should read weeks <e> <s> in other words it is the larger period rather than the smaller <e> <s> if there is an ambiguity i am perfectly willing to let the noble and learned lord lord brightman dictate the amendment which i shall bring in at report stage <e>", "<cs> i accept everything that has been said except the comments of the minister <e> <s> strangely enough my experience has been that in all our debates on the bill no one has supported the government at any stage in this house <e> <s> the minister has been entirely alone <e>", "<cs> my lords the series of suggestions put before the government for their consideration during the proceedings on this bill proves if it proves nothing else that we are doing our very best to try to accommodate all the legitimate objections which the government might put forward <e> <s> i apologise for not being in the house in time to read the new amendment proposed by the noble lord lord campbell of alloway and to discuss it with him <e> <s> this was due to falling trees on the western region <e>", "<cs> my lords i should point out to the minister that the offer was considerably improved between the time of the first ballot and that of the second ballot <e> <s> it was not the same issue <e>", "<cs> my lords the minister does not appreciate the first thing about union executives <e> <s> the executive says what it thinks the members should do <e> <s> it is not its business to be slavishly in touch <e> <s> the minister does not complain when the unions involved in the ambulance dispute recommend acceptance <e> <s> he does not say that they are out of touch <e> <s> they are only out of touch when they recommend a strike and the members do not want it <e> <s> the executive gives its opinion <e> <s> it is for the members to decide <e> <s> that does not mean that the executive is out of touch <e>", "<cs> my lords i heard what the minister said <e> <s> however in the light of the remarks of the noble lord lord campbell of alloway i must retain the amendment and ask the house to vote on it <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank the noble lord for that answer <e> <s> however how does he square what he has just said with the widespread reports of the secretary of states interview mentioned in my question <e> <s> in <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to ask the noble lord a specific question <e> <s> the government have made two general statements about future legislation in this field to abolish wages councils and to introduce legislation on emergency disputes <e> <s> is the secretary of state now saying that that is not being proceeded with or is the minister today saying that it will be proceeded with <e> <s> which is it <e>", "<cs> my lords in the time available i wish simply to concentrate upon the importance of training for the success of the economy <e> <s> i apologise in advance for the fact that i am unable to stay to the end of this debate due to a long-standing educational engagement in oxford <e>", "<cs> my lords in a slightly more crowded chamber yesterday the minister was likened to professor pangloss because of his determination to ensure that the governments training and education policies go forward <e> <s> he said that he saw them as the best and all for the best in the best of all possible worlds <e> <s> however tonight it seemed to me that he looked more like despondent billy bunter gazing down at a half empty tuck box <e> <s> i must say to him that we regard this matter as not so much a tuck box as a poisoned chalice <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may intervene <e> <s> the noble lord says that i am unhappy <e> <s> i can assure him that if he took the code away and burned it i should be very happy <e>", "<cs> my lords we for our part should like to thank the noble lord lord allen of abbeydale and his committee on three counts first for the fascinating review in the report of opinions on the charter <e> <s> everything from the soaking wet to the positively dehydrated is there <e> <s> it is a very good source for students of attitudes towards the charter <e> <s> secondly and in some ways more importantly we should like to thank them for the very balanced judgment with which they reached their conclusion <e>", "<cs> my lords does the minister not admit that even on the oecd figures since the government have made changes in the way in which they calculate those figures one must add per cent <e> <s> to achieve the proper figure <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble lord agree with this he knows very well that we never said any of those things <e> <s> can he answer the question put to him by my noble friend <e> <s> what is so special about health and safety <e> <s> he does not want regulations on working hours wages or protection of children because they raise costs <e> <s> yet he does not abolish all the legislation on health and safety <e> <s> surely that adds to cost also <e> <s> what is so special about that <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord knows very well what i am saying <e> <s> if the government were consistent in their position they would abolish health and safety legislation <e> <s> if they do not they are inconsistent <e>", "<cs> my lords on behalf of those who supported him i thank the noble lord lord campbell of alloway for taking the lead <e> <s> throughout he has been indefatigable persuasive flexible and reasonable <e> <s> like so many others who have been indefatigable persuasive flexible and reasonable he has met his reward <e>", "<cs> i have one or two questions to ask on this matter <e> <s> the amendment states that regional or area health authorities should <e>", "<cs> my lords will the noble earl comment on a statement in the <e>", "<cs> my lords my noble friend lord wedderburn has taken us through the provisions of this bill and no doubt we shall go back to them again in committee <e> <s> i do not wish to go over any ground that he has covered <e> <s> the minister has adopted a somewhat narrower focus <e> <s> so far as i could see and i was following his speech with the aid of a copy of the speech of the secretary of state in another place he followed the secretary of state quite often word for word except that he took one-third of the time <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is at it again <e> <s> he says that there can be no doubt that it would be highly costly <e> <s> i take it that he will not advance any figures at all <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord referred to my speech but not to my figures <e> <s> is he challenging any of my figures which were designed to show that that improvement had not taken place <e>", "<cs> i am not surprised that the committee has been teased in this way <e> <s> one should begin by looking at what the amendment says in the context of the bill <e> <s> if you are excluded from a job or you cannot get one simply on the ground that you are not a member of a professional association you get compensation <e> <s> that is what the amendment says <e> <s> it is <e>", "<cs> this bundle of amendments is unfortunately a mixed bag <e> <s> we readily accept that many of the amendments which attempt to deal with points which were raised in another place make the clause as it stands more acceptable <e> <s> however other amendments and in particular amendment no <e> <s> make the clause less acceptable <e> <s> as the minister said in the original version at least one might have said that the word spurious was not exhaustively defined <e> <s> now the minister tells us that the definition which is now to be embodied in the bill because the word spurious has been deleted namely <e>", "<cs> i am quite prepared to leave the amendment until later in order to give the noble lord an opportunity to speak to it independently if he would like to do so <e> <s> nevertheless it seems to me that the change that we should like to see in the governments amendment is contained in amendment no <e> <s> and we should deal with the matter now <e>", "<cs> i should perhaps apologise for attempting to help the committee <e> <s> we should have had two separate debates <e> <s> that would have taken longer but would not have enabled us to make the point we wish to make that is that whereas in some respects the amendments being moved are an improvement on the face of the bill other <e>", "<cs> i should prefer not to move it <e>", "<cs> we must rise to say why we find this clause unsatisfactory and unfair <e> <s> we must ask the government to think again about many of the points raised in this debate <e> <s> we tried to get the clause to include professional associations <e> <s> we tried to get it to include protection for the normal activities of trade unionists <e> <s> we tried to obtain minimal rights of representation effective rights of membership and to give some precision to the notion of the spurious offer as it was on the face of the bill <e> <s> the government refused to do any of those things <e>", "<cs> the noble lord lord boyd-carpe titer should understand that the only reason i mentioned those figures was that the government maintain that pre-entry closed shop membership is on the increase <e> <s> the government on their spurious evidence ask us to believe that there are million workers in pre-entry closed shops <e> <s> i agree with the noble lord lord boyd-carpenter that the practice is dying <e>", "<cs> i tried to make it absolutely clear to the committee that we are not opposing the abolition of the pre-entry closed shop <e> <s> we are saying that it should be done in a balanced way <e> <s> we shall not be voting against the clause <e> <s> we are trying to get the government to consider some of our amendments at report stage <e> <s> we are saying that the abolition should be done in a fair and balanced way <e>", "<cs> the noble lord asked a direct question and he is entitled to an answer <e> <s> our amendments to the bill show the position of the labour party and the opposition on the closed shop <e> <s> if he is not certain of that and wants it stated again i refer him to the labour party policy document <e>", "<cs> if i may say <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord says that the potential for damage was there what he means is that it was not actually there <e>", "<cs> if these people come out on strike and they are included in the strike unless they have been balloted in an entirely legal way which is laid down with great precision in the legislation then that act of validation will be unlawful <e> <s> if the union unfortunately gets into its strike force some people <e>", "<cs> i do not wish to keep jumping up like a jack-in-the-box <e> <s> there is so much wrong with the noble lords view <e> <s> the trouble is that he thinks that everyone is called out on strike as though all trade unionists have little pieces of string attached to them the string is pulled but in the absence of the string they do not come <e> <s> therefore if trade unionists have the string around their necks and it is pulled why cannot they be made to sign the ballot before the string is pulled <e> <s> strange as it may seem people come out on strike <e> <s> they are not always called out <e> <s> they may feel themselves involved and have an interest in the matter <e> <s> they may even want to support other people <e> <s> they come out on strike but it may not have been reasonably practicable to give them a paper to put a cross on <e> <s> therefore the ballot is unlawful <e>", "<cs> the noble lord is now saying something quite different from what the government said in another place <e>", "<cs> yes quite different <e> <s> in another place the government said that we could not have this amendment because it would unfairly and unduly widen the area of immunity <e> <s> the noble lord now says that we do not need the amendment because it does not do anything new <e> <s> i suppose we ought to call this the ilo answer <e> <s> we are getting the ilo answer i cant tell you why we are against it we have told somebody secretly privately confidentially <e> <s> we always do it secretly privately and confidentially and you must take it on trust <e> <s> i suppose that that is what we shall get <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may draw his attention to subsection b which makes it clear that the union would be liable in the circumstances to which he referred <e> <s> it states <e>", "<cs> will the noble lord take it from me that there are virtually no rule books which give shop stewards the right to call strikes and commit the union <e> <s> that is why this bill has to say ignore the rule book <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to interrupt again but that is not so <e> <s> it is only the case in respect of lay officials <e> <s> we do not say if we do say it in this series of amendments we are wrong and will correct them and it is not our intention to say that they can write themselves a rule book so that the general secretary the executive and the rest are not responsible <e> <s> we say that this can only be done if it is in the rule book and is being done for lay officials and not for full-time officials <e>", "<cs> the relationship between trade unions and their members is rather complicated <e> <s> we do not have bits of string that we pull <e> <s> the rule book is usually extremely clear <e> <s> only the national executive can authorise industrial action <e> <s> if one authorises industrial action in most circumstances one pays benefit <e> <s> only the national executive is entitled to pay <e>", "<cs> the noble lords replies are a mixture of the general and the obvious the particular and the mistaken <e> <s> he has taken us generally through the bill and told us what the provisions of the bill are <e> <s> i am bound to say to the minister at twenty minutes to eleven that we know what the provisions of the bill are <e>", "<cs> they are only contrary or contradictory if the object of the exercise is to tie down the workers and the union in every conceivable way <e> <s> it may be that if one put them all together and if by some moment of aberration the minister allowed us to have them all the result would be somewhat confusing <e> <s> it may be that there would be a good many of them <e> <s> but we have to keep trying and putting it in this way and that way in the hope that we might make a little pinhead of a hole <e> <s> of course we never do <e>", "<cs> i hope that the minister has finished reciting the contents of the bill <e> <s> even if he does misrepresent my arguments that is at least a per cent <e> <s> improvement in the situation <e> <s> however he misrepresented my arguments in two inconsistent ways <e> <s> he said first that what is proposed is too wide and that it would help the union <e> <s> he also said that it brings us back to fudge and mudge <e> <s> however he then said that it would help neither the union nor its members and that that was what i wanted <e>", "<cs> suppose that the note comes in five months and four days after the event <e> <s> the first thing that the poor old general secretary will ask is how do we know that it was us and not the aeu or the tg <e> <s> unless the government want the union to send out repudiation notices that have nothing to do with it it should be given a few days to ring round and find out who was responsible <e> <s> perhaps nobody was responsible <e> <s> the union should have some time <e> <s> it should not have to respond forthwith or immediately but within two weeks <e>", "<cs> what the union repudiated was a primary action because it made everything else illegal <e> <s> here from out of the blue comes not the man who was involved in the primary action not the man the union wrote to the union keeps his letter on file but a vehicle manufacturer who is a party to a commercial contract <e> <s> the union will not know how many people who are party to commercial contracts were involved in its strike six months ago <e> <s> give the union a fortnight to find out <e>", "<cs> is the noble lord saying that the union should repudiate it whether or not it was involved whether or not it was the aeu that that does not matter and the union should just repudiate immediately <e> <s> why can it not have time to find out whether it was involved <e>", "<cs> we have had this so often in the past <e> <s> in effect the noble lord says to us that he has reason to believe that a judge would say that a fortnight is forthwith <e> <s> he cannot say that <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> the noble lord must have left his brief <e> <s> i cannot believe that his adviser has written that even at ten to midnight <e> <s> are the government really telling us that they are going to abolish the statutory ballot scheme <e> <s> what an argument <e> <s> that is what the minister is threatening <e> <s> he is saying that we should not ask for this or they will take away that <e> <s> i cannot believe that that is a reasonable sensible logical answer <e>", "<cs> it is not as simple as that <e> <s> the minister says when we introduced the scheme we gave you the money because it was voluntary <e> <s> if that had been the governments policy they should have <e>", "<cs> i shall not divide the committee tonight <e> <s> i shall bring this matter back on report <e> <s> i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may <e>", "<cs> i wished to ask the noble lord whether he could think of a right to strike which did not involve setting aside in some way the contractual rights of the employer <e> <s> that is what we are saying <e> <s> if he cannot think of a right to strike which does not involve setting aside the contractual rights of an employer is he not saying if he respects the principles of english logic that there should be no right to strike <e>", "<cs> yes i would like to bob up <e> <s> i shall rephrase the question <e> <s> can the noble lord tell me of another area where on exercising ones legal rights one incurs a legal penalty <e> <s> his right to strike involves a legal penalty <e>", "<cs> we have given notice that we shall oppose this clause but we have explained i agree with what my noble friend lord jenkins said that we do not wish to take our opposition to a division <e> <s> i briefly want to plead with the minister to think again about the central point that we have been making for the greater part of the debate on this clause that is the question of what it means to restrict the unions right to recommend to persuade or and this is what the bill says to call for a strike <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down perhaps i can say that he has introduced a new and interesting concept the premature call <e> <s> though he need not answer now my question is how premature can a premature call be and how late does a premature call have to be before it becomes a late call <e> <s> is a late call as lawful as a premature call <e> <s> if not how late does a late call have to be before it is illegal <e>", "<cs> i wish to be clear about the matter <e> <s> let us suppose that a group of workers stop work and say this is dangerous <e> <s> we shall start work again only when you put a guard up <e> <s> it appears that because people are involved it is industrial action <e> <s> if on the other hand one worker stops work and says i will not start work until you put a guard up is that industrial action <e> <s> is it industrial action if the workers say nothing but look as though they do not wish to start work before the guard is put up <e> <s> what is it that translates the situation <e> <s> is it numbers <e> <s> is it what is said <e> <s> is it intention <e>", "<cs> how does the employer know <e> <s> if the employer went to a tribunal how would the tribunal know <e> <s> the minister is saying that there are two forms of pressure one might be called simple elemental pressure which is lawful and then there is another kind of pressure <e> <s> we are trying to define that which is complex <e> <s> it seems to me that if an individual says that he will not work until a guard is put up because the situation is unsafe that is simple lawful pressure <e> <s> however if he says that he will not work until the guard is put up because it is unsafe and he also says something else let us call it <e>", "<cs> before the minister leaves that point what does he say about that <e> <s> does he say that if the employer requires his workers to work in an unsafe place the workers can stop work and still have the advantage of their contract or do the contracts then come to an end <e>", "<cs> it seems that we now have some agreement on the matter <e> <s> we do not believe that the right to strike is a corporate measure which applies only to workers if they belong to trade unions and can only justifiably be operated through trade union procedures <e> <s> we believe that in certain circumstances there is a right to strike whether or not you are a member of a trade union and even in certain circumstances if that strike is not supported by the trade union <e>", "<cs> surely the noble lord can see the difference between wishing to discourage unofficial action and a situation in which one supports legislation which provides that those who go on strike unofficially have absolutely no rights <e>", "<cs> that is exactly what the bill is doing <e> <s> the minister must have said times tonight that it is for the union to decide whether action is official or unofficial <e> <s> the bill gives trade unions that single choice <e> <s> they have to decide whether action is official or unofficial <e> <s> if they decide that action is unofficial they put their members at the mercy of instant dismissal <e> <s> the minister appears to be saying that the unions should recognise every strike in order to save their members from dismissal <e> <s> is that the policy of the government <e>", "<cs> i am sorry to disappoint the noble baroness <e> <s> we are not talking to amendment no <e> <s> and at this time of night i do not intend to move that amendment <e>", "<cs> i apologise to the noble baroness if changing the groupings at the last minute meant that she thought that we were discussing a different amendment <e> <s> the government grouped amendment no <e> <s> and amendment no <e> <s> <e> <s> we take them to be very different and therefore wanted to take them separately <e>", "<cs> if the minister tells me that we shall come back on report <e> <s> in the meantime i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> before the noble lord sits down he has usefully summarised what the clause will do <e> <s> he has not mentioned any additional liabilities accruing to trade unions <e> <s> therefore surely he will support an <e>", "<cs> it is a novel procedure for the noble lord to interrupt us and give us nothing <e> <s> i suppose that it is the procedure that we have to put up with <e> <s> he has given us nothing <e> <s> he said that he is thinking about it <e> <s> does he accept the mess that the law is in <e> <s> i shall not bore him yet again by reading out what the ilo said although i could <e>", "<cs> there might be nothing more that the minister can say but he knows that those publications are largely useless <e> <s> however given the time of night i beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> we are opposing the question that this clause stand part of the bill though at this time of night we do not intend to press it to division <e>", "<cs> the government say that crotum should not only go on but that it should be expanded <e> <s> i am saying that we should compare what crotum does this under-utilised largely useless rolls-royce service with what happens in regard to unfair dismissals discrimination cases race and sex cases industrial injury and health and safety cases where there is no legal aid whatever in tribunal hearings <e> <s> where there is legal aid it is severely means-tested and even with legal aid which will not give you more than per cent <e> <s> of your costs if you win you have to pay it back <e> <s> if you look at the way the eoc and the race relations commission have complained of constant under-funding we say that it is irresponsible of the government to not only continue with crotum but to suggest that work should be expanded next year <e> <s> if we double the area of responsibility there might be two cases rather than one <e> <s> that is a waste of public money and we cannot support this clause <e>", "<cs> the noble lord has put forward one non-fact he does not know the cost of the report and one pseudo-fact <e> <s> he said that one-third of the inquiries related to possible breaches of union rules <e> <s> if they were investigated by crotum and if in her investigations she found as many irregularities as she found in the investigations last year that would result in one-and-a-half injunctions both of which she would fail to get <e>", "<cs> while i have a great deal of sympathy with the case for genuine conscientious objections i am afraid that i cannot agree that a sufficient case has been made out on the basis of the amendment <e> <s> it is an argument that we should have a conscience clause based upon a text not upon a doctrine or a body of belief <e> <s> the second epistle to the corinthians is the text <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister agree that on his figures if we adjust for changes in the increases or reductions in the claimant count the number of long-term unemployed on previous estimates would rise to over <e> <s> does he further agree that when we take into account the use of restart back to work and et to reclassify the long-term and short-term unemployed the figures must be even greater <e>", "<cs> my lords will the minister accept that the actual answer was <e>", "<cs> my lords i am pleased that the noble lord lord campbell of alloway points out <e>", "<cs> my lords no <e> <s> the noble lord is right <e> <s> i do not believe that the minister was saying that an unqualified assistant could so act <e> <s> it may be that where there is a qualified assistant there will also be a partnership or a limited company <e> <s> therefore the problem arises when a union does not act in that way <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister answers that question will he take on board my related point <e> <s> will he accept an amendment which makes it absolutely clear since it does not appear to be on the face of the bill that if a shop steward or a full-time official of the union attends a meeting and plays a full part but with the object of persuading members not to undertake the unlawful act the union will not be liable because the official will not be regarded as being a member of the meeting <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord is saying that if you are at a meeting that is a fact and you are liable <e> <s> he is completely contradicting what he said two minutes ago that you can be there that it can be a fact you are there but if you support the law and try to get people not to strike you are not a member and not liable <e>", "<cs> my lords i am glad to see that we have managed to get another reason out of the minister <e> <s> he is very fecund as regards the reasons given <e> <s> indeed we never receive the same answer twice but i shall return to that matter later <e> <s> the noble lord lord campbell of alloway said that there is no possible connection and no similarity between the two aspects of the matter <e> <s> of course in a way that is what <e>", "<cs> my lords i take the noble lords point <e> <s> however i shall have to read the report in <e>", "<cs> my lords the point at issue is whether this is in fact a mess <e> <s> i have no doubt that in similar circumstances someone who thought like the noble lord could be sitting underneath the tumbrels in the french revolution saying that as they had all got themselves into that mess they must get themselves out of it <e> <s> our position is that the government have got the trade unions into this mess <e> <s> noble lords opposite may well laugh at that but that is what we have been saying <e>", "<cs> my lords i am extraordinarily pleased <e> <s> we have made a dent <e> <s> far be it from me to disturb the equanimity with which the noble lord has met our point <e> <s> he is quite right three months is perfectly reasonable <e> <s> i wish that he had said that forthwith was unreasonable and that we could have had two weeks <e> <s> however i am prepared to accept what he has said and i shall not move the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i thought that the noble lord said that an invitation was not a call <e> <s> that is not what the <e>", "<cs> my lords before the noble lord sits down perhaps i may say that i do not want to go through all the permutations <e> <s> does he agree that the implication of his comments is that if workers want to take action which is not authorised by the union or which is subsequently not authorised by the union they should throw in their union cards <e> <s> if they do that they will be outside the ambit of the law <e> <s> are we naive to assume that that might be one of the purposes of the clause <e>", "<cs> my lords i ask the minister to think seriously about this amendment <e> <s> it may be his last chance to help us as a minister before he leaves for green fields and pastures new <e> <s> as we shall exchange him as we are told and the second baron from wellington and east anglia is replaced by the second viscount from eton and trinity this may be the last time that he can help us <e>", "<cs> my lords before the minister sits down i put this important point and perhaps he will confirm whether i have it right <e> <s> on monday morning the employer telephones the union and says your members are on unlawful and unofficial strike <e> <s> we want a repudiation <e> <s> on monday evening the union puts the repudiation in the post <e> <s> it cannot send a telegram because we do not have them any more <e> <s> they have been done away with <e> <s> if the union has a fax machine there is no problem <e> <s> otherwise the union puts the repudiation in the post <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord appears determined to leave us with strathclydes fork here <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord has summarised once again the provisions of the clause <e> <s> we know those provisions very well that is what is <e>", "<cs> my lords the noble lord lord renton is right in the sense that the amendment would leave an element of uncertainty <e> <s> however the problem is that the bill as it stands leaves an element of greater uncertainty <e> <s> during committee we said that there is nothing on the face of the bill which can tell a union how it can bring about a lack of responsibility and liability by severing itself from an official <e> <s> there is nothing in the bill which allows that <e> <s> indeed the bill clearly states that one cannot take into account the rules of the union <e> <s> it is no good the noble lord lord renton saying that a court would take into account the union rules because the bill clearly states that one cannot do so <e> <s> perhaps the amendment could be better worded but we are trying to provide a little less uncertainty than now exists in the bill <e>", "<cs> my lords i am not surprised <e> <s> naturally one is disappointed <e> <s> the noble lord is right we have discussed this point extensively <e> <s> however the minister has not made any concessions or listened to the arguments <e> <s> we have adjusted our claim downwards as he said <e> <s> he has never come forward <e> <s> we perhaps should not complain but today he even read the same brief <e> <s> the phrases are exactly the same except where he says and i agree that it is quite different when it is a question of union liability for which there are separate provisions in clause <e> <s> that is quite right <e> <s> when it is a question of union liability everything has to be done <e> <s> everything must be delivered by post <e> <s> it is absolutely tight the union must not be allowed to escape liability <e>", "<cs> my lords thanks and congratulations are in the air and i do not wish to depart from those sentiments <e> <s> i should like to congratulate the minister on three counts <e> <s> first i congratulate him on the gallant way in which he stood alone on the burning deck <e> <s> in previous engagements in this house on industrial relations legislation the government were tempted to change the watch now and again <e> <s> but the noble lord has been there bowling away from the gasometer end all the way through the proceedings on the bill <e> <s> all the government answers have been his own work subject to the flow of paper from time to time <e> <s> i congratulate him on that count <e>", "<cs> my lords if that is the case how does the noble lord explain the fact that the number of strikes has been falling since <e> <s> indeed it has fallen through both labour and conservative governments at more or less the same rate <e> <s> the only escalation which occurred was in when there was no legislation from this government on the statute book <e> <s> ever since that time it has fallen at much the same rate long before any of this legislation was heard of <e>", "<cs> my lords does the noble viscount not agree that the question asks whether the wages councils are operating effectively <e> <s> that is asking the government to say what they think those councils are for <e> <s> can the noble viscount say whether the wage councils are to eliminate low pay <e> <s> if that is the case can he say why more and more british workers fall into a low-pay situation <e> <s> do not the government really want to abolish the wages councils but do not dare to do so because of the social consequences <e>", "<cs> my lords it is a pleasure to begin my speech by congratulating my noble friend lady castle on what i suppose is technically a maiden speech <e> <s> i would have said more about that but it appears that the lady has vanished and therefore it is perhaps better left unsaid until the next time we meet <e>", "<cs> my lords i do not think that the noble lord is right <e> <s> the point i am making and i think he will find that i am correct is that the rpi has increased considerably more than the increase in earnings <e> <s> that is the essential point and so any advance in real earnings over the past decade has now been wiped out <e> <s> i do not believe that the noble lord will challenge the fact that we now have negative real wage growth <e>"]
