["<cs> i wonder whether the noble lord could enlighten some of us who may have flown on such a route as to quite what a cabotage route is <e>", "<cs> also before the noble lord sits down and he has obviously firmly sat down by now although he was asking for an act of faith surely this is an occasion where consultation <e>", "<cs> my lords i beg leave to ask the question which stands in my name on the order paper <e>", "<cs> my lords i thank my noble friend for his most full and clear explanation <e> <s> would he be good enough to state whether he would consider deferring the depositors protection scheme under the banking act until a scheme is worked out that is satisfactory to the building societies <e>", "<cs> my lords will my noble friend also agree that the record of the banking industry is equally good and that only on one occasion since the banking act was passed has a depositor lost money through a bank <e> <s> and this came up in the discussions on the banking bill <e> <s> will he not agree that if the principle should be on a statutory basis for banks it should also be statutory for building societies <e>", "<cs> perhaps i may make positively one of the shortest speeches in your lordships committee in support of this amendment <e> <s> i believe it is of the greatest value <e> <s> i am surprised i have to confess that some noble lords for whom i have the greatest respect should introduce so much emotion to try to counter it <e> <s> i am very saddened by that <e> <s> all i would say is this <e> <s> nobody is particularly worried that in an mot test they have to have workable windscreen wipers workable windscreen washers and rear lights that work <e> <s> all these things they might object to in terms of a restriction on freedom but they accept that they are necessary <e> <s> in fact wearing seat belts would save many more lives than any of these other add-ons to ones motorcar <e> <s> i believe your lordships should look at this very carefully before being swayed by the emotion shown by some of those people who <e>", "<cs> my lords may i first apologise to the house that i may have to leave before the end of this debate and hope that your lordships will not consider this discourteous <e> <s> i am afraid however there is a flight that i must catch tonight and it is the last one <e> <s> i should also like right at the outset to thank and congratulate the noble lord lord wolfenden on introducing this debate and in putting forward his views so clearly and i would also congratulate his committee on preparing such an excellent report on the draft directive which one knows so much better as the vredeling proposal <e>", "<cs> my lords so much has been said already about disclosure that i feel i should start by disclosing an interest that i work for an american bank <e> <s> may i go on to congratulate my noble cousin the earl of airlie on an excellent speech to which i listened with considerable interest <e> <s> but i have to confess that i did not agree entirely with everything that he said <e> <s> i should also like to congratulate the noble viscount lord chandos on an equally fine speech <e> <s> i found that i agreed with him rather more <e> <s> my congratulations go on to include the noble lord lord plowden and his committee on producing such an excellent report with which i totally and wholeheartedly agree <e>", "<cs> my lords i did not understand why the noble lord was talking about lead because i did not think there was any lead in diesel fuel <e>", "<cs> i rise with great trepidation as it is rather late in the day in every sense of the word to raise a new amendment <e>", "<cs> therefore i crave <e>", "<cs> as always i am most grateful <e> <s> therefore i stand corrected in more ways than one <e> <s> if i may just raise this point for consideration which i hope meets the bill i should like to crave your lordships indulgence for a few brief moments <e> <s> i have to declare an interest in that i am the president of the british direct marketing association which covers all forms of direct marketing including direct mail <e> <s> the industry is shortly to launch a scheme the mailing preference scheme which allows members of the public to have their names withdrawn from mailing lists by writing to a central organisation <e> <s> i think that this will be of great benefit to the public <e>", "<cs> i am most grateful to my noble friend for his very full reply <e> <s> i should like to consider the points he has raised and beg leave to withdraw the amendment <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to support the point made by the noble baroness <e> <s> i am connected with the national foster care association and i have been a foster parent <e> <s> i have seen in practice a lot of the problems that come up in multiracial placing <e> <s> training comes out time and time again <e> <s> various situations could have been resolved had the people been trained in advance <e> <s> i am sorry to take up the time of the house on this point but i think it must be evaluated and emphasised <e>", "<cs> my lords i have had a wonderful introduction on this occasion <e> <s> i shall not take the advice which is usually given to people to start off in a very positive way but will start with an apology <e> <s> i apologise for taking the time of the house on this point because it may be hard for noble lords to see the difference in the arguments put forward <e>", "<cs> my lords perhaps i may respond to that point <e> <s> i appreciate that in a long-term foster care/foster parent situation children refer to daddy and mummy <e> <s> i am not saying that it should sound like some bureaucratic title <e> <s> it is more how the foster parent or foster carer is seen from outside <e> <s> i do not think it is a question of a relationship <e>", "<cs> my lords as possibly the only foster parent or carer in this house i should like to say that fostering is extremely difficult <e> <s> i am afraid that i cannot support my noble friend on this amendment <e>", "<cs> when the noble lord lord ennals was saying that it was for the parents to decide i think he meant it with the best possible heart <e> <s> however having had some knowledge of foster children and adoption these children desperately need to know who their parents were down the line <e> <s> i do not see why children born in this way should not have the same right of finding out <e> <s> they need to know and it will cause problems <e> <s> i totally agree with what the noble baroness lady macleod said <e> <s> i can assure the noble lord that when the children come to the point of wanting to know they desperately want to know <e>", "<cs> although the mothers have given birth naturally without knowing the identity of the fathers the children still desperately need to know <e>"]
