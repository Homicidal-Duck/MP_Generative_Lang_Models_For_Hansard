["<cs> my lords may i first thank the noble baroness lady young for the generosity of her remarks at the start and couple with them the remarks of the noble lord lord wallace of coslany and the noble baroness lady robson <e> <s> i think i am privileged to speak for the first time in your lordships house on a bill affecting a service in which i have spent the majority of my working life <e> <s> i worked in the national health service first as a nurse then as a midwife and then as a health visitor and subsequently i have occupied educational roles preparing nurses for their work in the national health service <e> <s> in my present educational role i have felt it very necessary to remain closely in contact with the work of the national health service to the extent that we have created joint appointments between the university of manchester <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to add my congratulations to those already extended to the noble lord lord hunter of newington for initiating a debate that is so relevant to the quality of patient care which i am sure is so near to all our hearts <e> <s> i too have a great professional interest in the debate as a nurse a midwife and a health visitor <e>", "<cs> my lords i rise to thank the noble lord lord trefgarne for placing this order before the house and to support it <e> <s> in doing so i would declare my interests because i am a member of the united kingdom council for nursing health visiting and midwifery chairman of the english national board and also chairman of one of the boards which will be dissolved as the act becomes operative that is the joint board of clinical nursing studies <e> <s> in these capacities i have been party to the discussions on the electoral scheme before the house and i give it my full support <e>", "<cs> my lords i too should like to thank the noble lord lord molloy for the opportunity to consider the future of the national health service <e> <s> i should also like to add my congratulations to the noble lord lord ennals on his maiden speech <e> <s> i had contact with him during the time when he was a minister and i recognised his real commitment to the national health service <e> <s> i am sure your lordships must feel fortunate as regards the experience and wisdom that he brings to this house <e>", "<cs> my lords i wish to thank the noble baroness lady cox for providing an opportunity for your lordships house to discuss this matter of very grave concern to nurses and to all <e>", "<cs> my lords i should like to thank the noble lord lord hunter of newington for giving your lordships house an opportunity to debate the nuffield foundation report on pharmacy and to congratulate the foundation on its initiative and the quality of its report <e> <s> i also welcome the statement put out in the discussion paper on primary health care that the department will give the report serious and positive consideration <e>", "<cs> my lords like the noble lord lord rea i was a co-opted member of the committee and had the privilege of visiting the united states <e> <s> as a consequence i should like to draw attention to and underline some of the aspects of the report which are particularly relevant to my own profession that is nursing <e> <s> as a professor of nursing i must declare an interest in the funding of nursing research education for nursing research and career structure for nursing research <e>", "<cs> my lords in the interests of saving time i shall not repeat some of the points that have already been made about the uncertainty of funding and the models of funding in the higher education system <e> <s> they are very real concerns both of the vice chancellors and of the committee of directors of polytechnics <e> <s> i wish to speak from the viewpoint of my own profession of nursing <e> <s> until recently i held the chair of nursing in the university of manchester so i think i can speak as a practitioner of a comparatively new discipline which is trying to enter the realm of higher education and trying to break through the powerful bastions that exist there <e>", "<cs> my lords would not the minister agree that nurses have a contribution to make to the policy of the national health service which is far broader than their narrower sectional interest <e> <s> indeed they have an intimate acquaintance with the national health service and the needs of patients <e> <s> it is a contribution which is complementary but distinctive from medicine <e> <s> in view of that contribution to policy would the minister agree that there is a lamentable lack of expert opinion on the policy board <e>", "<cs> my lords as one of those who has worked both within the national health service and alongside it since its inception and who shares with the noble baroness lady cox membership and fellowship of the royal college of nursing i do not wish to make partisan points <e>", "<cs> in supporting this amendment i should like to underline and <e>", "<cs> my lords at this time of night i do not wish to prolong the debate by repeating what has already been said so adequately but i wish to support these two amendments <e> <s> i see them as particularly important amendments <e> <s> in particular i should like to underline the reference in subsection a of amendment no <e> <s> a to the need to support the provision of postgraduate vocational and continuing education programmes <e>"]
